          "Text": "Hi everyone, We have been using the Journal plugin for many years, and since upgrading to Moodle 4.5 we have encountered several  issues. We noticed that there are multiple open pull requests on GitHub that contain fixes which have not yet been merged. For now, we plan to apply the relevant patches ourselves in order to keep the module running during this academic year. However, given the current lack of activity and the absence of an official release supporting Moodle 4.5, we are considering discontinuing the use of this module next year unless maintenance resumes. Could you please confirm whether there are any plans to continue maintaining this plugin or if it’s being phased out? It is a shame, because this module has been very valuable and interesting to use in our courses. Thank you for your work so far. Best, susana",

Students can only see their OWN writing and do NOT have access to another students writing unless the students share the writing via some other means. e.g. Physically show them on their screen, or via copy and paste in an email message. You can set up automatic prompts that update at whatever time interval you desire. Each day is okay. Changing the required number of words each day is one of the automatic prompt options. You can also setup and use a, Gloassary of Common Errors (the actual name is optional), that is also accounted for in the auto rating suggested scoring. This makes it possible to enforce proper spelling so that the modern slang of such things as, u, instead of you, can be enforced. The autograding is actually only a suggested rating that the teacher can acept with one click of the mouse, and even if they apply the suggested rating they can always over ride it, and change the rating and feedback.",

The biggest hurdle was to make sure I found the correct entry in the mdl_grade_items table. I then had to go and regrade every journal entry. I also did that in the database as it is quicker. Everything appeared to have been changed and updated correctly. WARNING: I do not recommend that you do this on a production Moodle site, but if you MUST make sure you back up your current data first. As an alternative, I know that at one time I was changing how much an activity was counted for in a final grade book calculation. Sorry to say I do not remember how I got in there to change that. What I do remember is just how much of a pain it was to do that. It probably was along the lines of putting the faulty journal in it's own category and then set how much that category counts towards the total grade.",

If you play with Diary a little more, you will discover that you can have it work just like the journal plugin. Edit all entries > No Edit entry dates > No Enable statistics > No Enable automatic rating > No, but it is optional. Ratings > No ratings, but can be set to any of the five rating types. All the other settings are optional and truthfully, just those first 3 items are the key to making Diary work like Journal. Granted, since you can change the, \"color\" of things, it will look just a little different. 😁 And as you've discovered, it is great for other types of activities .",

          "Text": "It has been over a year since a forum entry with the same subject was started, so it is locked and cannot be commented on. I somehow missed the original question posed by Robin Latham, but in a private message yesterday, I provided her a partial solution, and it was so simple, I am mentioning it here so that others can implement it, too. She asked:  \" Could we get a toggle to be able\nto organize the journal entries by student last name rather than as it\nis now by date of entry only?\" Not a toggle, but a change to alphabetical order...In the lib.php file, look for: function journal_get_users_done($journal, $currentgroup) { It should be around line 702, depending on your version of journal. Just a few lines below that look for: $ sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY j.modified DESC\"; Change it to: $sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY u.lastname ASC, u.firstname ASC\"; This will cause both the users that are done and the users who have no entry, to be listed alphabetically when a teacher goes to the page generated by report.php. I have made a pull request to try and get this change into the Journal code at github. Robin also asked: \"Also, if we could be able to download the entries, that would be nice.\" I do have a solution for this, but it is nowhere nearly as simple, requiring the addition of about 100 lines of code lib.php and nearly that many in report.php. Time permitting, I will try to add it to my github version of Journal, and will post here when it is available. Download entries is actually available in a new plugin I am developing, based on Journal, named, Diary. Over the years, I have seen numerous requests for a Diary plugin, and mine is similar (based off of) Journal with the added capability of giving the user a new blank entry, every time they go to edit on a new calendar day. Still have lots to do, but if anyone wants a look see, let me know via private message, and I will give access. Or you can git a, mostly current version, from the Diary master branch at my github account.",

We need to specially thank AL Rachels ( https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=94615 ) for his contribution in this release as he removed all notices and debugging messages as well as converting the add_to_log() calls to the new events system ( http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2 ) Thanks AL. Please, if you notice any new issue during these first days of testing and deployment comment about it here in the journal forums, on the tracker contrib component or on the github project page ( https://github.com/dmonllao/moodle-mod_journal ). Next step towards the code cleanup would be to write unit and acceptance tests for it so we will detect quickly when we are breaking something during the cleanup.",

          "Text": "I'm trying to find the best way in Moodle I can do the following: For each of the assigned readings (perhaps more than 25 in a semester) ask students to submit a reflective writing assignment. Deadline is something like three hours before my course, and I will use their contributions to prepare mini-lectures. Grading is simple (if they submit something reasonable, they get full credit). I only take marks off if they submit reading summaries (paraphrasing the content of what was read, not personal, not reflective). For the purpose of my mini-lecture preparation, I want to annotate their submissions, e.g., with comments on passages such as one can do in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Adobe Acrobat, etc. I don't want to do this on hard copy in 2015. I'd like to be able to generate a word cloud using the content. I could have up to 40 students in two sections (80 students total) and I don't have a secretary to help me click! Looking at the Journal activity in Moodle, I think it comes up short on the annotation feature (at least based on the documentation I looked at, there seems to only be a form field for instructor feedback and a grade). I'm thinking of going with Assignments (there's bulk download of Word/PDF/etc.) documents although a Word cloud wouldn't be possible (that's not a show stopper). I'd appreciate feedback from the Moodle community regarding this approach. Thanks!",

I would prefer to include those changes only in master (or also 2.8 as it has just been released) but I am not feeling like backporting it to 2.7 and 2.6 as the changes have not been properly tested in real environments, only in testing environments but I would reconsider it if some of you are experiencing important performance issues.

With a journal with more than 150 entries, the function that calculates the number of entries does arround 700 DB queries (4-5 queries per entry)... It costs 180-200 seconds to render the entire page. Now, with that improvements it cost only 40 queries and arround a second to render. We would definetely try the cron improvements in this production site and we will try to report the results. Cheers!",

About three weeks ago I discovered that most versions of Journal (including 2.6) have one small bug in the journal lib.php file if you are using Journal set for Grade > None and with debugging turned on. The bug is a notice that an offset is not set and is caused by checking to see if a grade has been overridden in the gradebook...but no entry is in the gradebook because the Journal is set for no grade. A couple of days ago I came up with a fix that will most likely be in the next version along with a new feature I've come up with that posts a notice that a journal entry needs to be regraded if the student makes changes to an entry that has already been graded. The upshot of it all is that it will not hurt to go ahead and use Journal 2.7.2 with Moodle 2.8. Tonight I will finish pushing that last fix up to my github account and you can get an updated copy with the fixes, if you would like to. HTH , AL",

I really like the Grade Me block for alerts as to what needs to be graded, but it presently does not have a plugin for showing Journal entries that need grading. Last weekend, while laid up with another cold, a truly UNWANTED gift from my students, I managed to cobble together a working plugin that will do what's needed. The modification adds one folder, one file, and modifies one other file of Grade Me. Right now I am waiting on a reply from the Grade Me folks about getting a copy of the plugin to them. If anyone would like to try it out, I can provide a copy of it.  Just be forewarned, I have developed it for Moodle 2.7 versions of the Journal and Grade Me and have not had any time to test on any other versions. I might be able to do so next week, but no guarantees. It does work very nicely on Moodle 2.7, Moodle 2.8 beta, and Moodle 2.8 RC1. AL",

Today I checked, and it was very easy to add just a few lines of code to the lib.php file along with a new entry in the language file that will change the date and time of the timemarked that gets placed next to the grade, to a message saying the entry needs to be regraded, if the student resubmits by clicking on Save changes.

David Monllaó (Lead maintainer) has been pretty good about releasing versions for each Moodle but he only does enough to keep it working and is not adding any new capability. The latest version for Moodle 2.6 works with Moodle 2.7, but if you turn on debugging to developer mode, there are about 30 warnings of various types that will show up depending on what part of journal you are in. Most are related to deprecated methods of getting info and adding log entries. There is one set of two warnings that will show for every student entry when you view all the student entries. Now...the reason I know these details is...I have played with trying to do a little programming in Moodle over the years, and literally just yesterday, had picked the Journal activity as something to play with while on summer break. It is very simple compared to other activities , without too many files to learn about. I am down to just two warnings left to try and figure out. They both show up for the teacher but only one shows up for students. I have fixed the log entries and even added a couple of new ones. If you would like a copy with my modifications, to try out, let me know. The modifications do not change the journal database tables at all. Hopefully, sometime tomorrow, I will have the last two warnings  fixed. I'm going to quit \"playing\" for now. Students \"gifted\" me a cold and it is getting to me, so I'm done for the day. AL",

There is no Journal code in Moodle 2.0, so the Journal tables will be left completely alone by the upgrade. The script should still function. You have reminded me to check that the script works at all under 2.0. I think we'll need to do a different version for that anyway.

While the functionality does indeed exist elsewhere, the \"journal\" as a functional centerpiece of reflective practice, will be sorely missed.... perhaps I should replace all instances of \"online assignment\" with \"journal\" ;=} However, to the functional issue! I am, I guess, surprised that an upgrade from Moodle 1.x to Moodle 2 where the Moodle has courses with journals will run smoothly. I had expected that it would result in making quite a mess of the coursees assignments and gradebook, but assuming that is not the case, it seems to me that it makes sense to ensure that the Moodle 2 setup checks the db to determine if there are journals and then offers the option to convert or cancel, as there are quite a few people who continue to use journals (whether they are romatics like me or just uninformed of the obsolescence) and this could be a worse experience than that of upgrading to 1.9 and discovering that all your gradebooks now resemble badly scrambled eggs while grades are due in 48 hrs...... I guess here again I am trying to look at the situation from the perspective of the gazillion users who are not obsessive about forum postings or implementing the latest stable (there are lots of folks still using Moodle 1.4 because it provides them what they need....) What will Joe User, with a moodle with dozens of existing courses which have contained journals for some years, have to deal with when he decides to go ahead and upgrade to Moodle 2 and then get calls from teachers saying that none of their journals work? If one is going to claim that Moodle is so easy to use that even a \"teacher\" can manage it, then we had better make sure we trap all issues before they create some meltdown for Joe.....",

I don't know the resolution but there have been several forum posts and tracker issues on this - I recall one with images in the Lesson module doing similar. Either do a search in the forums/tracker for draftfile.php or else maybe someone with experience of journal 2 will come along with other suggestions. (I haven't installed it so can't test it out) Did you have the journal in 1.9 and did you follow the correct procedures for upgrading to 2.0?",

Here are some observations: The Journal does allow you to grade work (without any utilities to alter it), though I am not sure if the grades appear in the gradebook or not as I've never bothered grading them! Linguistically I have some \"issues\" with the Online Assignment. The use of the word \"assignment\" instead of \"journal\" - It might not seem like much of a difference, but in some cultures it's huge. Journal is a word that I like because it has connotations (for me at least) of reflective practice, self-observation, and is generally a \"non-threatening\" kind of scenario. Assignment , on the other hand, is laden with connotations of pressure and judgement and, perhaps most disturbingly, someone else assessing the work - which is not at all the approach I try to encourage! Related to the above, when a student has finished their entry, they are required to \" submit \" it - it's a small point, I'll admit, but again, it screams of pressure and handing over responsibility for assessment to someone else. I'm sure there are other points which someone more familiar with the Online Assignment can highlight, but these are the obvious things that have occurred to me as I investigate the issue. Hope this helps a little, Rena",

My students have to complete very short journals (answer 2-5 questions) before every class to aid in their comprehension of read material. As teacher I skim through all of their responses very quickly (5-10 minutes in total for a class of 30 students) to give myself an overall idea of their understanding of key issues. I also typically give a short written response to a handful of randomly selected students, so that each student experience teacher feedback from time to time. This is supposed to be a task of very limited time consumption for both student and teacher. Here the \"everything in one window\" feature of the journals is absolutely essential. As a teacher I want this process to be quick and smooth with no clicking around. In Denmark I don't think many teachers are concerned with grading these kind of assignments. We typically would not do that. But we are concerned with having something as useful, fast and easy like the journal. Frankly, the online assignment doesn't even compete. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed that the journal will be discontinued. I feel that it will seriously hamper the reception given to Moodle in Scandinavian countries.",

Here's what my teachers really love about the journal and don't love about online assignment: 1) The Journal can, but the online assignment cannot, sustain back and forth dialogue once the teacher responds to the first entry. Once a teacher responds to an entry using the online text assignment, that's it, the dialog is over. This is huge. The purpose of a paper and digital journal both is to create new understanding and deepen it. That's not currently possible with the online text assignemnt, so when I read that the online text assignment is (or has?) replaced the journal, all I can think is that in its current iteration, that's not remotely true. Pun not really intended. 2) For a teacher reading student journal entry, the date last edited is right at the top. This is important if completing a journal entry is an actual assignment. 3) The teacher view of journal submissions is \"easier, and clearer on the screen\" than its online assignment counterpart. If the \"fixed\" online text assignment in 2.0 addresses these issues, then the journal can vanish without weeping and gnashing of teeth, but otherwise, it's just not nearly as useful a tool as the journal and the journal will be sorely missed.",

Many teachers at our school use the Journal module in different ways that are not currently replicated in the assignment activity. I understand that it will be in 2.0, but they wanted it now. Plus...we greatly customize our deployment for the K-12 environment and only recently brought the conversions to 1.95. It seems to be working fine. I use it as a tool to track student work on projects and find it very easy to see it all in one place, on one screen. Other teachers use it as a formative assessment tool so they can see the responses of the entire class on 1 screen...which is far easier that the current online assignment tool for this purpose. Although they are both really the same from the students view, from a teachers perspective it is far nicer to see all the students responses on a single page. Hope this helps! Brian",

Nor have I posted before, so have some faith! I've been following the journal issue with much interest because I also wanted to see a single page with \"interlaced\" discussion (ie: alternating prof and student). As it appears now, the best that text-assignment (or any other form of assignment that I have tested) can do is like a list of FAQ's with answers that has been sorted putting all the questions onto one page and all the answers onto another! Even text-assignment with inline option turned on, gives only ONE \"interlacing\" and thereafter its again like the separated FAQ's format. With considerable experimenting and jumping in and out of prof role and a fictitious student role, it looks to me like the prof could do the following without too much extra time: (I'm using version 1.9, and do not know how this view might be different in earlier versions.) The prof upon opening the student's text assignment sees two windows: student and prof. The prof at this point can quickly and easily cut and paste the student's most recent comment into his own window, and then proceed to write his own comments. There isn't any automatic dating, or spacing in this approach, but a double-dash line could quickly be added. This only works as long as you only add text at the bottom of the file. Unless with my lack of experience I'm missing something this would appear to be a fairly simple way of creating a fairly good journal. If the prof does the cut-and-paste for each new addition by the student, then the prof's window becomes a complete, interlaced dialogue. The student also can see both windows, so can look either at his own window with just his own comments, or at the prof's feedback window to see the complete dialogue. I'd be interested in any feedback or improvements on this. -Alan",

At my school I guess around 95% of the use of moodle centers around the journal and the ability to get an overview over all students responses very fast (not for grading purposes, but to see whether they have a decent grasp of the concepts being asked about). This is so important to us that it could well be a dealbreaker for us with regards to upgrading to Moodle 2, which would be a great shame, since I have been looking forward to some of the new and improved features.

My students have to do a journal before every class, where the have to answer a few key questions regarding the text they've read. They don't get grades for this. All I need is to skim through their responses in 5 minutes to see if they have grasped the key concepts and maybe I'll provide super-short feedback to a random handful of them. This is how many teachers at my school uses the journal. As I wrote, it is easily the most used module at my school - probably about 95% of the moodle use at our school.",

As soon as I read the information that the support for the journal module will be discontinued for Moodle 2.0, I looked for alternatives. Have you tried out the database activity module? HERE is a sample reading journal that I uploaded to the Database of Databases. This is a generic weekly reading journal. Adjust it to your needs. Before you change anything in templates, make sure that you have disabled the editor. In my classes I use this journal with separate groups , i.e., one person builds a group and all groups are added to \"individual students\" as grouping . Once you have set up this activity, you can save it as a preset and make it available for all teachers. Whenever they want to have a reading journal, they add the database activity, select group mode with \"individual students\" and select the preset. Each week you will see the entries of your students on one page - no additional clicking needed compared to the assignment module. With kind regards, Hartmut",

It appears according to the tracker (which now seems to be responding again thanks to additional RAM....)  that http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-17725 was not included in the Moodle 2 upgrade scripts,  which means that journal tables are apparently orphaned in some way on upgrade as best as I can determine based on info that persons upgrading to Moodle 2 RCs were successful in upgrading, but had no access to the journal activites. It also appears that there is extensive confusion surrounding the Journal plugin db entry on Moodle.org as it seems to still be in need of a maintainer (IS that going to be you, David, and have you discussed the plugin db entry with Anthony Burrows?) and while there are comments indicating that it won't work with moodle 2.0 on the plugin entry, the posts here are that it does. Additionally,  even if the module works for Moodle 2,  the question is how one migrates from a Moodle 1.x with journals to Moodle 2 with journals.  That is to say,  can one simply NOT convert the journals and then upgrade to Moodle 2, install the module, whereupon the module will work and all the pre-existing journals will function? So while there is one train clearly southbound,  there is another northbound,  and the conductors on both trains have inconsistent statements to make which of course leads to tremendous confusion. It would seem that the FIRST thing to do is tyo update the Journal module entry in the moodle.org db so it is vetted, current and has an active maintainer.  Once that is accomplished I would suggest the second thing to do is to make it clear in forums and moodle docs that there apparently IS a transition path for the journal module, as wel as clarify any issues with respect to the db (especially if one is also changing from MyISam to Innodb) and migration.",

          "Text": "Hi Marc, nice roadmap! I've been looking for a \"journal has died\" in Moodle Docs and in the M&P entry and it seems that they already reflect that from 2.0 onwards it's not in core and should be downloaded via the M&P latest version download. I've just finished a upgrade from a 1.9.8 with journal activities and entries to the latest (2010112400) moodle 2.0. The journal tables and his data remains into the database; after that, I've installed the journal module for 2.0 and the journal activities and entries were restored to the corresponding courses. I'll also try to copy the journal module into the moodle 2.0 mod/ directory before the upgrade execution, but I guess that the behavior will be the same. There is an issue with the gradebook, 2 years ago I attached a patch ( http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-16761 ) for 1.9.x to add compatibility with the gradebook but it has not be applied to core, I'll add an upgrade process to the 2.0 module version to add the existing instances to the gradebook. I'll add a post when all will been done and available through the \"download latest version\" link (probably thiw weekend) If I'm not wrong, the root from the M&P automatic download link .zip it's the journal/ folder itself About the module future, I don't have a pedagogical view (I'm not a teacher) and I can't help on that, should be the community who demands what is prioritary with her votes on tracker, I'm sure that you and other moodle users could be very useful to define that direction",

          "Text": "David, As far zips..... There is an automagical way that the CVS respository creates zips from existing contribs.  Unfortunately,  for some contribs these automagically created zips include /moodle,  which meant that for anyone who did not have a /moodle,  its was pain in the rear. I asked Anthony to talk to HQ folk about changing that behavior but as I recall we were told, \"no.\" Some zips are designed to be placed in a target folder to be exploded  (such as /mod, or /filter.)  You indicated that this is how the current zip is set, and I checked and that is indeed the case. This suggests there is something about how the cvs was set up for DragMath that we didn't understand (maybe the diff between patch and plugin.) This behavior is fine, but it does mean that the user has to place the zip in the correct folder..... To try and address the issues we faced with dragmath,  I created an archive that allowed for it to be placed in the moodle root and unzipped. This meant that no matter the moodle,  all one had to do was place the zip in the moodle root and unzip. Under the current scheme that would require additional steps, and that is really unnecessary as long as the docs make it clear that one is to place the zip in the mod directory (though it may be obvious to us,  newbees often miss that) and unzip. I don't know if you have done this before, but once you edit the db entry for the module, it will become invisible until Anthony OK's the changes, and once you see the editing interface for the db you will see that you can have different links for different versions (that way you can differentiate between versions for various branches of Moodle.) I always created a custom grade for journals in GB; I was not aware of your patch (but note that the url you used include the paren some doesn't bring up http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-16761 )  I really hate to push patches as so many users have difficulty with patches and it can be a pain at upgrade time. But since the devs have clearly indicated that they are not listening .... How many files outside /mod/journal have to be patched for journal to interface with GB, and would it be worth it to create the same kind of archive I describe with respect to dragmath so that unzipping not only adds /mod/journal, but also overwrite any other files necessary? Once upon a time I was called upon to create an interface to query a db400 store with a gui.  SInce historically this was 5250 terminal green screen country, any change in what the users wanted required a rewrite in RPG. In order to empower users I set up a a basic toolkit and variables structore that made it relatively simple for users to manage things themselves. It would be very nice to be able to provide a Moodle interface that provide a constructor to make creation and or modification of activities based on basic templates available; like an openoffice Base integrated with Moodle.  One can only dream",

About M&P, I don't have write access to the journal entry, anyway I only have write access to the journal contrib version (from 2.0 onwards) and the \"download latest version\" link should be refreshed with that contrib version (HEAD), the journal versions lower that 2.0 are moodle core code and I can't change it.

I suggest before you go  back to 1.9 you ask your teachers to try out the online text assignment and see if that will satisfy them. If you stick with Moodle 2.0 they will need some training to understand the new file upload system etc etc. How long did you have 1.9? Or is this a brand new install?",

The journal is really simple to set up and to use and teachers are used to it. Also, the online assignment is listed as an assignment which creates a different mindset in students than a learning diary. It is comparable to the difficulty we have had convincing/forcing teachers to give up the Returnfolder module (a very simple third party file upload tool) and use the Database module instead. The database may represent the same functionality and more, but it is therefore a lot more complex to set up. It was only with the preset option that the database could satisfactorily replace the Returnfolder (although I still have problems creating a preset that works). Rgrds, Paul.",

If it is decided to \"can\" the journal, then a replacement tool will be needed, as well as a conversion app so that previous courses don't have to be re-designed, which would be a huge hassle.

I guess the whole reason I ever implemented Journals after they were phased out was because I had an instructor ask what happened to them, and I saw that it was still available. With a small amount of research, it sounded like they were a little different. But looking at it now, they are not. Here's the difference I would make if I could - make a Journal assignment type that will allow multiple submissions - but instead of allowing the student to overwrite what they've previously entered, they get a new form and the teacher gets a new grade and feedback form.

Having just spend a year incrementally introducing Moodle at a K-12 girls' school, and the previous week doing virtually nothing else besides Moodle training for faculty so that they might work on their classes in Moodle during the summer break, I am pressed to bring up the high value of the Journal Module in its present incarnation to K-12 schools. Being able to respond to all of the Journal entries from a class on one screen is a real benefit the Journal has over the online writing assignment. But even if someone were to come up with a lovely way to add that to the Assignment module, there would still be another significant problem with subsuming the Journal into the Assignment. Nomenclature matters! As a Grade 10 literature teacher who successfully used the Journal all year explained, \"a journal is different from an assignment. It may be a type of assignment, but it is a type that evokes the easy sharing of thoughts, and a certain intimacy rather than the formality of of anything termed straight up \"an assignment.\" This teacher was dejected when I explained that our Moodle Partner host said they might soon be unwilling to address my questions about the Journal's behavior (those backslashes) in that it is no longer supported. She uses the Online Assignment too, but sees the latter as a more formal and specific \"Assignment,\" not a Journal. I can see where \"Lecture Feedback\" certainly has its place and applaud its good designers. However most K-12 schools do not need a to use Moodle to track whether students are in their seats for a lecture. What they do need is for Moodle to stay true to its constructivist roots, something the Journal module does uniquely well. To continue a back and forth discussion between student and teacher on the nature of a child's developing thinking on a school topic is a wonderful thing. Why end this excellent practice? In this week's training sessions, my science teachers focussed particularly on the Journal Module for classes where a student's developing thinking about her indendent research is a great thing. These teachers don't want to carry two dozen paper journals around for reading and response. They do want their students to keep a journal for all the good reasons associated with that practice, and the teachers want to read and respond to those journals digitally.They want to see when the entries were made, they want to get through a group of those responses on one screen, quickly and efficiently. My teachers and I don't want to give students a writing assignment when we mean to encourage them to write in journals. We do give writing assignments, but those assignments are a more formal type of writing, with different expectations and intentions, than those associated with Journal writing. Please, please keep the Journal module and please don't turn it into a attendance taker. If what's needed is a capable programmer to care and tend to the Journal, shouldn't an all points bulletin go out, rather than an axe fall? Thank you for your consideration.",

Obviously it is a shame if no-ones developing the module though. Couldn't it appear as a separate activity module, but pull functions from the assignment?

This would retire the old journal activity, make use of the online assignment activity, give the perception that journal and assignment are different beasts to the users. And the whole lot could be sold to existing users of the old journal that its an upgrade/improvement/honest its not something completely different. There would probably need to be some sort of db migration for us admins to smooth the process along (or I have to migrate 82 journals!) Is this the musings of a made dreamer or a possible way forward? Just as an aside I have a few tutors using the advanced upload assignment as a journal as students can scrawl text and upload files/screen captures etc. They like this as it has the added value of the uploads, which online /inline text doesn't.

Far too tedious!! is there some conversion code (or sql snippets) that we can use to convert journals to assignments on the fly and not have to re-enter the gradebooks? Notice of a Possible Bug with Migrated Journals in Grader Report 1.9: Has anyone else noticed that journal activities show up without marks in gradebook 1.9 ? I mean after migrating to 1.9, i can see the marks in the individual journal activities but they are blank (and not used in aggregate calculations) in the grader report It appears to me that the marks must be stored in two separate and independent places because I can add marks for journals via GRADER REPORT but it does change anything in mod/journal/report.php and vice versa Also, entering new marks via mod/journal/report.php does not appear in GRADER REPORT If this is confirmed, it may mean that the journal activity is currently unusable as a contributor to aggregate marks in moodle 1.9",

It is a library file which contains one function called assignment_type_online_upgrade 3. modify migrate_journals.php in three ways: 3a. add a relative call to config.php at the very top 3b. we need to define $oldversion to be some number less than 2005042900 (this \"fake\" requirement is probably what caused the reported failures of this script reported in tracker and this forum) 3c. add a call to assignment_type_online_upgrade at the very bottom with a value less than 2005042900 4. just to make sure everything gets converted, you could do the following SQL statements directly into your database before and after item 5: 4a. select count(*) from mdl_journal; 4b. select count(*) from mdl_assignment; 4c. select count(*) from mdl_journal_entries; 4d. select count(*) from mdl_assignment_submissions; 5. call migrate_journals.php from your browser 6. check if your journals have converted to assignments voila!

I have discovered this thread regarding this issue, and the ability of online assignments to fill the gap, but my situation has issues which the online assignment, as least as I understand it, doesn't completely solve. I was hoping for the students to be able to regularly (~weekly) write about their experiences and progress in an ongoing manner, to see how this progresses over time. I was planning to look at the journals once every few weeks to provide some feedback. But from what I understand of online assignments, each submission from the student will be a separate entity, therefore not allowing for an ongoing narrative, nor my contributing feedback to groups of entries (I would have to grade each submission separately). This is both impractical for our situation, and lessens the experience for the student. Am I missing a portion of the functionality of the online assignments?

The journal does an excellent job of maintaining an ongoing discussion between student and teacher and, just like a paper journal, makes it easy to follow the development of an idea over time. With the online assignment, there is no option for an ongoing dialog. You are foced to keep recreating a new assignment over and over, and to see development of an idea, you will need to open each assignment individually -- an awkward and unweildly task, by comparison. Currently, as I understand it, it is not possible to include journal grades in the gradebook. In 2.0, the journal wil be absent altogether which, to my mind and the minds of several other teachers at my school, is an unfortunate loss. I do not understand the thinking behind abandoning the journal, which continues to function in a stable fashion. I'm hoping your message will encourage a developer response on the thinkig behind the planned demise of the journal assignment. Lisa",

What do you mean by \"advanced online assignment?\" What I tried to explain, and apologies if I was not clear, is that the online assignment does NOT provide an ongoing discussion beyond two to three exchanges. I contrasted that with the journal, which provides an unlimited exchange between teacher and student. I am also confused by your reference to the forum discussion. The diffference there, which has seemed clear, is that a forum discussion is exactly that -- a forum -- not a private dialogue between teacher and student. The point that has been made by others in this dialogue, several times, is that the online assignment can do everything the journal can, not that other activities might provide lesser experiences than the one the journal currently does. If the online assignment is meant to have unlimited back and forths between student and teacher, as the journal does, that would be great. If the online assignment has been \"broken\" for the last several versions of Moodle and will be fixed in 2.0, that would be helpful to know. If so, the only pertinent question remaining would be--for those of us using both the Journal and the Online assignment, for the different functions they each serve in their current iterations, will it be possible to use both names in 2.0?

You can carry on a threaded conversation with each student from one location in this way. (This was not my discovery, and I'm actually looking for the original post with this idea so I can credit it properly -- if anyone knows where it is, please reply!) One drawback, however: in a \"separate groups\" Forum, you cannot post prompts to which all students can reply. If you post a prompt before entering a group in the Forum (via the dropdown at top left), students can read your prompts but not reply to them. You must enter a group, then post your prompt, then enter the next group, etc., if you want students to reply to your prompts. A workaround for this: post your prompt and ask the students to copy its subject for their reply. Another potential drawback: grades for the Forum are cumulative, and show up in the gradebook as an average grade for the entire Forum rather than individual entries. However, appropriate gradebook weighting of the Forum grade should take care of this. If you name the Forum \"Journal,\" students will get the picture.

          "Text": "I was able to override this by forcing the system and the end-users to be just in GMT-5. The thing is, that's not correct, so other times will be off by an hour. It looks like the reason for this is because the finish time is hard-coded to be the start time plus (number of days x 24 hours) - so the timezone change won't take the extra hour (or conversely, the less hour when the timezones flip the other way) into account. There isn't an easy way around this, and would require a total recode of the Journal function, which I'm not capable of undertaking. However, I was able to build a hack for the code (note that it is not a \"pretty\" hack.) Basically, I grab the \"end time\" of the journal and see if that time is 11:00 PM. If it is, then I add 1 hour to the end time, so Moodle will see the new \"time\" of midnight. Likewise, if the end time is 1:00 AM, it will subtract an hour. I'll post this code change below; we're running Moodle 1.9.x. CAVEAT: I don't know if this will break other journal stuff or not, we'll have to find out. If it does, let me know and I'll look into it. Chris Edit /mod/journal/view.php, look for the code that says: if ($journal->days) { $timefinish = $timestart + (3600 * 24 * $journal->days); (around line 60.) After this code, add the following lines of code: $finish = userdate($timefinish); if (strstr($finish,\"11:00 PM\")) { $timefinish = $timefinish + 3600; } else if (strstr($finish,\"1:00 AM\")) { $timefinish = $timefinish - 3600; }",

I have trainers who need to deliver e-mentoring, to do this means I need each trainee to be able to make private, date/time stamped entries, in to some kind of secure container.  Effectively they would make an entry, save this and in turn the e-mentor would be notified of the change and be able to add their comments. I have achieved this in the past by using groups and setting a forum that uses seperate groups - to be honest I did it so long ago I have forgotten how I acheved it. In an ideal situation each traineed could be set up with a journal that by deisgn is private to them with only the trainer having access. Having an activity that works along these lines would make for easier management. For all I know this may be pie in the sky... Scott",

I recognize that this is counter to the Journal's original intent. However, in this course, some Journal entries are intended to become a portfolio for student reflection, and not intended for feedback or review. I thought about using groups for this, but that doesn't seem like it will work, since I will want at least one instructor for each group. I've tried using override roles, which seems promising. However, I ended up getting stuck where even the Admin user was not able to login to the course--so I had to backup from that. My question is: 1. Can it be done?",

If it's so important that students have a \"truly private\" journal, perhaps it might be a lot easier to simply suggest that they have the journal elsewhere!

It's just an idea - I'm wondering if it's really worth you embarking on what could potentially be an awful lot of work for something that could accomplished through much simpler means!

OR 2) Click \"Reports\" in your \"Administration\" block. Select the date you want to check, click the drop-down arrow by \"All activities\" and select \"Journals,\" click \"Get these logs,\" and any journal entries on that date will be listed.

I suggest that students date each journal entry. When a student wants to add a new entry, he positions his cursor at the end of his last entry, taps the Enter key twice, adds the current date, and begins typing. That way a student's newest entry is always at the bottom of the journal field which makes it possible for me to see that entry while adding my feedback, and the student's journal is in chronological order. Works great for us. For example: 2/23/07 This was my first journal entry. 2/26/07 This is my second journal entry.",

What I liked about the Journal was the way the student could see all their entries on one page when they clicked on the link in the upper left (on my site).  This encouraged them to think of the Journal as a progression of thought and showed how their thinking or reflection was evolving as the course went on. It didn't look like a gradebook but rather was more personal - a journal that they \"owned\" rather than a series of assignments from the teacher. When they click on Assignments then it looks like a gradebook - each assignment is separate and they click multiple times in order to view each entry.  (And journal-like entries are mixed with other writing assigments). One of the harder things is to get student to connect the material earlier in the course to material later in the course and one of the uses of my journal was to get them to keep reflecting on this.  Sure I can ask them to do this using the Assignments, but the just the layout of it makes it more difficult and I don't think they feel the \"ownership\" that a Journal encourages. Bottom line - a series of Assignments is not a Journal - nor is a Blog unless they allow for making the Blog private.  [ Yes a peer-available or public Blog adds another dimension but depending on the course may not be appropriate.  ] Just venting here. Hacking Journal to work in 1.7 is not an option for me.",

I would like to be able to post (in my course) a Journal assignment that allows me to do the following: 1.  Ask students to write regularly in their journal 2.  Allows me to provide feedback on each entry and give an individual grade for each entry I'd like this to be in one 'activity' instead of having to insert a journal or assignment activity in each week of my course.  Why?  Because I'd like to use this the same way that the traditional paper notebook journals are.  You collect them from the students at a regular interval, read them and record a grade in your grade book, and provide some feedback/dialog for the student and then give the notebook back to the student to start the process over again.  Each time you collect the notebook it is easy to look back at previous entires etc. etc. This would be even more powerful as a Moodle activity and it seems that it would be most appropriate in the Journal module or in the Assigment module whichever.",

This concept of all the entries being compiled was the only one lost in the transition to Online Assignment (which otherwise does everything Journal does and better).

I guess what I need to do is create a Journal activity in each week of my course?  But that does not allow students to look back at what they wrote in previous weeks (not easily at least). Thanks for your answer, as I write here I think I'm starting to understand that ALL of the features that I mentioned are not currently available (ongoing journal, grading for each addition) but I'll keep my eyes open for 1.6.  Any new schedule for its release?

If the new Assignment module can or will provide that functionality then that is great, but if not, then I think that the journal module (or its lecture feedback avatar) would be missed. Both the journal and lecture feedback modules are attractive to those with big lectures. I do not that big lectures nor a budget to support them, but when I tried to persuade others to use Moodle it was those with big lectures, that were impressed by the automation that Moodle could, in the journal module, provide (even without the super attendance tracking/automation). So, I think that it would be nice to keep it. I thought that Dr. Kariya converted the lecture feedback module to work with 1.4. I posted it to the Lecture Feedback Module thread .

I ask students to write 2-3 questions on the topic (in class) and I have 60 questions to start discussion with.  Assignment module does not have that flexibility. Neither does any other assignment. Of course, I could use chat, but that is not very convenient in  a sense that I want to see who didn't post questions. In other words, assignment module does not work well when there is a need to process student's writing fast (paste all the questions to wordpad and arrange them so that a class can have a coherent discussion, and you will see what I mean) Also, an ability to see the text without clicking two or three more links is a huge advantage as compared with clicking on student's name, then on another link to see the essay. So, I would keep something similar to journal module for in-class use or make the interface of assignment module more flexible. Rimas",

I'd also like to recomend everyone consider these points of view: When having a desire for a certain feature to be made for moddle we should try to think about something universal that everyone can make use of, correct me if i'm wrong Martin but Moodle is not Burger King where everyone can have it their way or is it ? in that case i'll take 10 combos to go please an example, lets say you have a feedback module then someone wants a feedback module with blue trim, then another person wants a feedback module with red trim and another wants it with gold, it's not being realistic for the Moodle community to taylor such specific request, I try to consider a feature that can be used by everyone not only from a teaching perspective from a human one. I tend not to look at education as merely a tool for information, or so automated that there is no use for a teacher, knowledge by itself is not power, the ability to apply it to the real world is. Simple is always more useful... Perhaps there could be an area (if not already existing) where everyone could place their recommendation for future Moodle tools, then use the forum only for discussing ideas on making use of them. I\"ve notice this on alot of forums, just think it could be more effective in getting to the answers we seek. Often there are 100's of pages we have to sift through in the forums to find a simple solution. My $1.98 cents worth",

The great joy of Moodle (and a key reason why the U of Glasgow has recently adopted it as its centrally supported VLE) is its inherent flexibility, its potential to afford a range of learning opportunitities (such as PDP here) espec. those premised in soc. constructivist learning and support, and its relative ease of use (thereby affording learning enabled not driven by technology).   A further plus for moodle.org is its potential to enable folk in the same institution to communicate!

The other thing that happened is that students received multiple emails notifying them of responses - but when they went to the link, they found the response was empty. Many thanks for your suggestions. John Bourne (version 1.4+)",

Some of teacher A's feedback is already there, because it has already been saved. Teacher B writes his feedback to all entries, without saving periodically. Teacher A continues writing his feedback. Teacher B finally saves the whole page. I think the feedback that teacher A wrote in #3 might be overwritten . Is this possible? The reason I think this might have happened is that when I was teaching a course together with Joyce Smith we noticed that if two teachers are commenting on a student's journal, the latter one 'takes over' the ownership of the feedback, so to speak.",

Perhaps there could be 3 options: \" Public \", \" Teacher and Student \" and \" Private \" (Student only, as a notebook). Currently we have only the \"Teacher and Student\" option. If this was done, when teacher selects \"Private\" Journals, they were not visible for anyone but the student (not even the teacher could see them). Anyway, as I told before, I think that the Weblog option would be the most intersting one to share the knowledge that the students build. Just Type=\"Public\".

I have 180 students in a course.  Three faculty.  Students work in groups and each faculty looks after some of the groups.  Is it possible yet (or is it planned) to be able to view forum entries from students according to the groups they are in.  Today all I could see was a very long list of all students enrolled with balnk entries for most (because they haven't made a journal entry yet).  Is this because of the version I have running today?  I do know there is mighty work going on ,  what I don't know is - is there something I'm doing wrong or is this particular facility not available yet.  It it isn't has anybody any ideas how I can achieve the above?  This is my first course on Moodle.

I initially intended for the students to submit a 500 word (2 pages) summary of each unit.  My questions are: Is 500 words too long for Journal entries and can I edit their entries (similiar to editing a Word document) to provide feedback on their writing skills?

I like having students revise their journals through the week with frequent suggestions from me. Giving developing journals one minute of attention here and there, saves enormous amounts of editing/grading/reading time for the teacher at the conclusion of the process. If you REALLY need an \"in-line\" editing function, you can spend the time to login as the student, and edit the journal in a different font color (using the HTML editor), though the logging can get tedious with big classes. The absolute proper use of a journal is probably to have the student reflect and revise on his own for a period of time. Then the teacher provides feedback. For this functionality, no module is better. But, hey, this software is incredibly flexible, so I don't think it is wrong to re-imagine its use to fit your situation. best, Tom",
