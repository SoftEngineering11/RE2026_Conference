          "Text": "Hello, I am having a problem with the BBB extension in Moodle management. The conference room plug-in is installed and working on the platform I use. However, even when I enable the waiting room option, so that students can only enter when authorized, they still have free access to the platform. As soon as I start a session as an administrator, they enter the room directly, without my mediation. I have already checked all the settings (I enabled students to only have access to the room as participants), but the waiting room still does not work. Would anyone know if this is due to a lack of an important update by the platform administration or if the waiting room option has actually been disabled in the latest version of the system? Has anyone else encountered this same problem? Thanks to everyone for their attention. Best regards, Egon",

We have created a tracker for this issue: https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-85873 and would be great to get some input /insights from others. the issue user experience: As a teacher I have enabled the Guest Access in my BBB activity. I shared the Guest link with my participants so they can easily access the BBB session. Some of my participantes have an account on our LMS, but are not part of the course. BUt are allowed to follow the session. When the participants is logged into Moodle LMS, and use the link. The username is automatically filled in. When they fill in the guesst password they see the notification “required” at Guest Username. Our proposed solution Modify the logicto only mark the username field as 'readonly' and 'disabled' if the user is both logged in AND has access to the course. If the user is logged in but does not have access to the course, the field should remain editable. (Please be-aware of Password managers) what we do now As a temporary workaround we added a Javascript to the addiontal HTML . The script is placed in the tracker.

The newer duration-based method gives percentage credit based on the duration of attendance. The newer method is complicated, because it relies heavily on the data that is available in Zoom and matching up the attendee information with the Moodle user information is not always exact, so manual editing may be needed in varying amounts depending on how the Zoom meetings and the Zoom plugin activities are configured. Here is the grading method help text: Choose the method to use when grading student participation. Upon entry: the student receives full marks (max grade) when they click to join the meeting in Moodle.

Perhaps it will also work for others: I think that the BBB plugin accesses the BBB server when deleting the courses in order to delete the recording there as well. Our old server data is still stored in the Moodle backend (bigbluebuttonbn_server_url), but the server no longer exists. In my opinion, this causes the error message in Moodle and the course can therefore not be deleted. Our solution is as follows: we still have a server URL and the token of an old BBB test instance that is still running. We have entered this URL and token in the backend. Now the courses can also be deleted - even if the recordings do not exist on this test server. At least it works for us. best regards, Anton",

I've converted the timestamp to human-readable date and checked the log of the user with ID 1919, but I've didn't find any useful information related about disappearance of recordings in the log table. There wasn't any log about them. Only that user was gave an another course access to another user at that time.

This can happen for a number of reasons, but most likely is network connectivity issues of the user when the process of fetching recordings from the BBB server takes place. Currently a workaround for retrieving these disappearing recordings exists, which is to run CLI script found in the plugin directory at mod/bigbluebuttonbn/cli/update_dismissed_recordings.php on the Moodle server. It will change the status and process the recordings so that they show up in Moodle again. Hopefully this helps, Shamiso Jaravaza",

You can put the access code in its description. - Use the availability options Moodle offers to limit the access to what you want. Of course if you give the access code in the description, the student can go there any time - and meet others! You have to judge whether that is OK with your audience. Otherwise, there must be ways of rotating the access code, etc.",

Today on a Moodle 4.1 I activated the BBB plug-in, it still uses the server provided by the developer. When I create a BBB activity I can run BBB perfectly - on the same laptop, same browser (Firefox). On this very same laptop a BBB meeting called from Greenlight, a link like server/xxx-xxx-xxx with an access code, I can't open the video nor share the desktop. (see screen-shot) After a delay of about 10-20 seconds it shows an error something with code 1020 and vanishes. Everything identical, the developer BBB as a proper BBB activity runs whereas a BBB meeting called through the Greenlight link works only partly.

Part 1 is fine as when I switch away from test-moodle and instead use test-install with the default secret, I am am able to launch the room just fine. For step two, the URL is fine as I am doing an exact copy/paste from the default (I tried both http and https just in case) When I get to step 3, everything goes off the rails. It seems as if the shared secret does not exist. I am given a shared secret in the setting box, but there seems to be no matching shared secret on the server itself. Running the command 'bbb-conf --secret\" returns the error that bbb-conf does not exist. Following https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html#api-security-model I can neither retrieve nor reset the salt due to bbb-conf being not available. Accessing the server directory shows that neither bigbluebutton.properties file nor the /etc/ directory exist. (I cant remember where I read it, but I also used wget to make sure I am able to connect to the server and that was ok) Any clues as to what I may have done wrong? Why bbb-web.properties file is missing? Where could I find it? Is there any way to recreate it? \n```text\nwget\n```",

Part of my confusion was from trying to run the commands on my web-host and not understanding that the BBB server was on blindside networks and not my own web server. Since I last posted, I tried out various short term trials of hosting companies, including biggerbluebutton and higheredlab and both are able to launch a room totaly fine. And as I said before, running blindside networks 'test' server also works fine. It very much seems as if blindside networks has discontinued their 'free tier' services but never anounced it. Everything I read still seems to indicate that using the defaults for Moodle 4.0 and BBB would still let me conect to the blindside networks free service, but in practice I simply cant conect.",

You can try this: - In Moodle, create a test recording in the same activity where your missing recordings are. - Get recordingID from the recording link and use that recordingID in API mate to get the meetingID, getRecordings will give this info. - Use the meetingID to find recordings using getRecordings. If you can see details about your missing recordings, it's a Moodle plugin problem. If there are no recording details, it's definitely your configured server. Hope this helps!",

And check that your service provider don't have a clause on how may days recordings are kept as per Sergio's advice. Some BBB suppliers delete recordings after x days (should be in your contract). For us, if the client is happy to keep paying for space, we keep recordings or agree with them when/frequency to get rid of old recordings.",

We aren't sure if this is a Moodle question or a BBB one, as we don't know if the students attending a BBB meeting are even shown in the BBB stats. Any insight into this would be amazing! Thanks James",

          "Text": "Hi James, I know my answer is coming a little overdue here, but in case the question is still on the air. As it has been mentioned before, the Plugin captures all the activity that happens in Moodle. Users viewing the room/activity, joining the session, doing click on the recording, etc. Those events are logged as any other plugin in Moodle, which means any plugin or report you already use can give you that information. Now, in regards to what happens in the live session, that is a different history, because that information is recorded by BigBlueButton itself and right now there is no way to pass it back to Moodle. There is a commercial solution out there that gives you a report with the activity in the session. It is called statistics and it is presented to the Teachers and Administrators as a recording format in the same way the Playback format is presented. But again that is only available if the BBB server offers that format. As far as I know, the only ones providing that format right now are the Blindside Networks folks.",

The \"Join session\" button might remain available for teachers / managers / admins - alongside that warning ? I can imagine how e.g. collaborating course teachers might want to discuss this activity with each other again - without students knowing another session has opened. They could even record their meeting and hide it from students, the recording conveniently placed right there in the activity. My two p's. I do believe something needs to be done with that \"Join session\" button - it certainly can't stay there like it is now. I'd be happy to add these thoughts on the tracker, as well, if they are useful. HTH . Regards, Przemek",

All instances of Moodle are version 3.9 and BBB version 2.2. We suddenly received an error when trying to access the classroom link and/or recorded sessions. It stated \"Unable to connect to the BigBlueButton Server .\" I double checked the URL and secret in the plugin settings and they were all correct. A restart of both the moodle and BBB servers allowed us to start a session again, but now it will not load a presentation. It just won't show any slides and gives an error in the BBB logs about failed to upload presentation 404 error. I'm unsure if this is a moodle/BBB plugin error or a BBB server error, but any pointers would be greatly received as I've now spent 6 hours trying to solve and need to get this up and running before lessons resume tomorrow. Many Thanks Greg",

The PHP version is fine - I'm running 7.3.0 with Moodle 3.11.3+ I also have the correct BBB plugin version Also the plugin was working fine before October 1st so I don't think the PHP version can be the problem. Can you think of any reason the Let's Encrypt CA expiration could have an effect. I can reach my BBB server OK from the Moodle container. My PHP instance is in a different container on the same network. I'm using this proxy server: https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy - to manage the moodle installation and other subdomains. From my PHP container: strace -e openat wget -O - https://examplebbserver.com/bigbluebutton/ returns ERROR: The certificate of 'examplebbbserver.com' has expired. Is this relevant at all?

          "Text": "Thanks for your great work! I'm testing your plugin in my Moodle (3.4) and I have a strange behavior/problem. And a couple of questions. First the problem: I create a GoToWebinar Activity with an user with role Teacher or Manager without problem. Then I try to join the webinar with that user. GoToWebinar send an email confirmation as new co-organizer. And I join the webinar without problems. If I  just change to another page or logout of moodle and come back I can still join the webinar and the button [Join Meeting] points right to https://global.gotowebinar.com/eojoin/xxxxxx/xxxxxx But If I try to enter with another user (not the creator of the activity) as Estudent, Teacher or Manager: First time I go to the activity and click on [Join Meeting] I enter the webinar without problem but just as a attendee (no co-organizer or panelist). The [Join Meeting] button links right to https://global.gotowebinar.com/eojoin/xxxxxx/xxxxxx If I change to another moodle page or logout when I come back to the activity with the same user the [Join Meeting] button doesn't redirect to the webinar (gotowebinar) it links to itself . Example if my GoToWebinar activity is: https://mymoodle.com/mod/gotowebinar/view.php?id=27 the [Join Meeting] button url is again https://mymoodle.com/mod/gotowebinar/view.php?id=27 And not the gotowebinar link It's a big problem for stundents that disconnect from the webinar. I have to tell them to use the webinar link of their e-mail and not the moodle activity. And now some of questions: It's nice that the creator of the GoToWebinar activity is the co-organizer. But Is there anyway that if a teacher join a gotowebinar it joins as panelist? The webinar can't start if the organizer itself start it. So If I a teacher or manager create a webinar in moodle (as co-organizer) still needs the main GoToWebinar account to start it. Is there any way to start a GoToWebinar by the coorganizer or presenter? (I think thats a limitation of GoToWebinar not your plugin), And now the last question My Moodle is in Spanish and I can't find in the Moodle Language Packages the strings that appear when clicking a GoToWebinar Activity like: Meeting Tittle, Description, start, end, and the [Join Meeting] button. How can I translate it? Thank you very much for your great and easy to use plugin! I hope my problem can be solved!",

It is not quite the same as it will need to support multiple meetings per activity. The major issue I see now is that the API used by GoToMeeting has changed. When you set up a developer account in https://goto-developer.logmeininc.com and create a new App, you will find that the API Product is listed as: G2M_Development. Previously, it was G2M_Development_ExtendedOAuthv1. With this change, I get the following error when I go to /mod/gotowebinar/configtest.php: When I investigate a little further, I find this in the response body when the plugin makes a  curl request: \"OAuth API v1 has been decommissioned as announced in February 2018, please switch to OAuth API v2 documented here: https://goto-developer.logmeininc.com/oauth-migration-guide . Please reach out to Support ( developer-support@logmein.com ) with questions.\" I think the switch on the GoToMeeting end happened quite recently as this was working a month ago. Creating a dev account at this time used the G2M_Development_ExtendedOAuthv1 API product - which does work. But now the API product expects OAuth API v2 to be used so it looks like the module won't work unless the API calls are updated to match this.",

The upgrade was not successful and the old version number was retained. I could not but try to uninstall the current v2.2 in advance.

          "Text": "When using a \"freestanding\" BigBlueButton (means: via the Greenlight UI) a guest (who does not have an account on the system) can enter a (freely chosen) name before entering the video conference. Same when using BigBlueButton via other systems, e.g. IServ. But when using BBB in Moodle, guests cannot enter their names and it is very annoying having 20…30 anonymous \"guests\" in a video conference. Is it a bug / missing feature in the BBB plugin of Moodle? Or just mis-configuration? How can we fix it? Greetings from Hamburg, Lars R.",

After a while, the recording is visible for just the members of Group A. My question is: where in the database is the link stored between the recording and the group? I simply can not find it anywhere. The problem is that I have recordings that I as a manager can see. Neither students nor teachers in this course can see the recordings. When I set the BBB activity to 'no groups' the recordings are visible for everyone again. What I think that happened is: a recording is made for group A. Then group A has been deleted. The recording is now 'orphane'. I can see it as a manager, but I seem to be the only one that can see them... Any ideas?",

The plugin works fine for the admin who can schedule and start a Webinar and for users who can initiate the connection and participate in the synchronous activity. But I have experienced a serious problem. At the end of the Webinar there is no report in the session link . Of course, I would like to point out that cron works fine and runs the script every 15 minutes (* / 15 ****) \\ mod_zoom \\ task \\ get_meeting_reports Any suggestions on how to fix this? Furthermore , it would be very interesting to be able to automatically link the user's stay in the Webinar (the total minutes) to provide the evaluation in Moodle. Currently, if I set the Zoom activity rating to 100 points with a pass value of 90 points, at the end of the webinar all participants are assigned the value 100 (in the evaluation register) without considering the actual minutes spent in the webinar. In this way it is not possible to differentiate between those who have followed in full, and is entitled to a certificate, and whoever has left the Webinar early, and is not entitled to a certificate. Thanks for the attention.",

          "Text": "Hello Everybody! I've got a problem and looking for suggestion how to resolve it. My history of using BBB+Moodle started in 2016. That time I've installed VM with Moodle 2.6 and VM with BBB 0.81. We used this system successfully till 2018 year, that time we decided to upgrade Moodle to brand new 3.6.1 and BBB to 2.0 beta. I established new VM, got fresh installation for BBB and I copied all recordings from 0.81 to 2.0. Then I switched off old 0.81 BBB and tested communication of Moodle 2.6 with new BBB server 2.0 and everything worked fine. That time we decided to save time and let both Moodle (old one 2.6 and new one 3.6.1) worked with one instance of BBB 2.0. I was going to move my courses alog with recordings of the old Moodle instance 2.6 to the new one 3.6.1 later and I supposed it should be easy for me, but I mistaken... So I adjusted my firewall and two different Moodle web-sites worked on different ports fine. Untill I decided to upgrade BBB to the latest 2.2 release. The reason was Adobe Flash EOL and I wanted new technologies like HTML5 client, using it on mobile phones and all the new features which appeared in BBB since my last upgrade. I did that upgrade the same way as before - just made fresh installation using BBB-conf script and copied all my folders with recordings to the new VM. Then I set up new Internet connection, because BBB required wide broadband channel, and I changed IP, readjust everything, domain name, firewall and so on. Finally I tested it with new Moodle instance - everything worked fine! I was glad till the moment I tested old Moodle instance 2.6 - it was unsuccessful. Of course I changed secret key (aka SALT), but I din't know should I change URL (I left it the same, because I didn't change domain name, only adjusted new IP in DNS records). Summarizing all up-mentioned my question is: \"Does somebody know the way to transfer courses as well as lists of BBB recordings which belong to them from old 2.6 Moodle instance to new 3.6.1\" I've tried it today and it transfered with empty list of recordings, only other kind of standard Moodle plugins and other content... The problem is that old 2.6 Moodle also lost all recording lists... I am in despair! Please suggest any workable way to resurrect my webinars! Thanks in advance!",

When I try to create an BBB resource to any of my Moodle classrooms, I get this error message: error/bigbluebuttonbn/general error unable connect I triple check my BBB Server , changed my secret API and the error still remains. Curiosity: when I do bbb-conf --secret to get the secret, the command also returned a link to Github API-Mate: https://mconf.github.io/api-mate/#server=https://fplvirtual.fpl.edu.br/bigbluebutton/&sharedSecret=0x18DBB234A93511EAA6FED33DFC2CA371 Opening the link, I got some options to test my BBB Server. And every single option worked. Create a videoconference room, join to this room, end the video conference. Everything works fine, except at Moodle. Yesterday, I've updated the BBB plugin and still nothing. Can anyone help me? Thanks!",

Since it is BBB related you may be better off by asking in the bigblubutton-dev google group. But, you are correct. The recording processor is a single thread process and that is exactly what happens when meetings are to big or the server is processing too many. There have been plans over the years of re-implementing the recording processor but stability and features on the core components always trump this initiative. Let's remember though that the single server deployment is not meant to be run at high scale. In that spirit, and if you don't want to write your own recording processor (which is what every single company in BBB ecosystem is doing for scaling their clusters), you could have multiple bigbluebutton servers under Scalelite. You would not gain speed and compute power by spreading meeting, therefore recording processing between servers, but at the same time, you would increase your capacity for live sessions.",

I've installed Moodle 3.9. We have 270 users which login to website at 8 AM. in the 9 courses we have a Bigbluebutton plugin for separate groups and recording enabled. At first it was fine but after 4 months as it has a lot of recordings in it (about 200 in one page), it crashes the server . The only thing that surprises me is that, when I use Bigbluebutton plugin, even when it is only me, (late at night when the students are not participating in the classes) it uses 100% of on of the threads and makes the server really heavy. Ant when I have lots of users, the server crashes completely because of heavy cpu load. as you can see I have a powerful server which can handle thousands of users simultaneously. Why should the plugin drain the cpu so? this is when there is very little site visits. When only me using the bigbluebutton plugin: this is when we have 250 users participating class: should I delete the recordings?",

Once I configured it (which was a very long, confusing process), I can use the activity External Tool and from there create and start Zoom meetings and, when finished, share recordings. It's supposed to be able to sync with the calendar that way students can see when they have Zoom meetings coming up, but I haven't gotten that part to work. I'd be interested in hearing from others who have had success with the Zoom plugin activity and/or the LTI external tool.

I do not know if its related with the fact that we updated the BBB Moodle plugin to the latest version (v2.3.4) a few days ago. @Adam Griffiths said that he solved the problem by re-running the import script. Can anyone please share what is the SSH command that I should use to do that? Or if there is any KB article that explains that? Also anyone has an idea of what the problem is? I run on the BBB server the command bbb-conf –check and it shows no problems. Thanks!",

          "Text": "hello - our fix was down to a problem with our scalelite setup rather than BBB. BBB was correctly publishing the recordings. The import script is specific to scalelite and just copies the completed published recordings from individual BBB servers to the central scalelite server. The script is here if you have scalelite - /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts I've updated our BBBBN plugin to 2.3.4 and moodle to 3.9 today and all is working correctly for us so don't think the plugin is the culprit. Are you using scalelite or is it a single BBB instance? Are any recordings being published? They can start to take days if you stick with webm format and have a lot of sessions on the go. In our busiest period (we had 4 BBB servers and rang between 400-600 users across them with 5-10 meeting, only one webcam showing on each meeting thankfully) I had to change to mp4 (which also made my IOS users happy) to get recordings showing up in anything like a sensible timeframe. Have you used the bbb-record command? Used with --watch it will at least show you the various workers are running - https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/recording.html I also used to fish around the /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/ folder, ls -ltr will show latest recordings at bottom which can help diagnose problems. If you haven't signed up to the BBB google groups I would recommend it. I have fixed most problems with a combination of these moodle forums with the google groups.",

It seems that the update includes changing one of the libraries required by the API for accessing the recordings. Since the API is still running, it has the reference to the old version. On restart, the API starts using the new one. 2. If that doesn't work, what worked for me (I was doing something else) was to run bbb-install.sh again (in the same way I did a few weeks ago) right after performing the apt-get update.

Restarting did not work, so what I did was to run bbb-install.sh again. The thing is that bbb-install.sh comes with a bunch of other checks to verify your configuration files. In your case I would try that first. If that post your question to the bigbluebutton-setup google group. There are hundreds of System administrators there. They may have run into that issue too.

You only need to replace the content in the directory containing bigbluebuttonbn with the code of the version you want to install. What I normally do in those cases is to rename the current directory as .bigbluebuttonbn, so Moodle ignores its content, and then unzip the new version in a new bigbluebuttonbn directory. And simply go to notifications and Moodle will do the rest. Also, don't jump from a super old version to the newest one.

Since the recording is in reality hosted by BBB, that would require a better player able to track the progress and to report back to Moodle. Then and only then, the plugin could be extended for such capability. The only event that can be tracked right now is when the users click on the playback recording link. That generates a Moodle event that could potentially be used as part of a report. No, which report?, that is the part I don't know. How do you normally track activity in other plugins or activities ?

We also have BBB plugin from our moodle server configured to connect to this server for recording.  I have admin access to both the servers. Using BBB from moodle, I conducted an online class for my students, in which I taught using a presentation uploaded to BBB.  This session was recorded. After the session, I am able to view the recording and play it from moodle. But, I am not getting an option to download the video (containing both the presentation and the speaker view) .  If I right-click on the video of myself speaking, the speaker video alone is downloadable, without the presentation. The download feature of the entire session is important, because the video will be auto-removed from the server after two weeks and my students need the recording downloaded by then, for future reference. 1) Is there a proper BBB recording download procedure that can be made available to teachers and students, from moodle (for downloading the entire session)? 2) Is there a way to download this recording using BBB server's web interface? If not, what is a good workaround? 3) Is there a way to get a teacher's conference room created from moodle to be listed as a conference room under the same person's BBB user account?",

I've tried to change the course id in the database (bigbluebuttonbn table) but this video doesn't exist in this table ! I got the meeting id in the URL name (when I read the video - which exists in the moodle platform), but this one seems to be imaginary in the database. Do you know where I could find details of the database schema ? I have only 2 tables with the name \"bigbluebutton\" : bigbluebuttonbn and bigbluebutton_logs. I guess there are more than 2 tables ... Can anyone help me ? To change the course directly in database or to find the management option in the platform ... Thanks in advance !",

There is a separate window for video which we like because in other versions as soon as you turn on the video, presantation becomes small. Also I saw the possibility to upload audio from a computer.

I don't have access to the video you posted, and I am not quite sure I understand your question, but I can tell you this. There is only one official distribution of BigBlueButton, although there are several versions available for production. We (as the developers of BigBlueButton) encourage people to use the latest one. At this time, the latest version is 2.2, and it is what you find in Moodle Cloud , test-install (the server configured by default with the BigBlueButtonBN plugin), and any of our servers (Blindside Networks servers). Now, that being said. If you have your own BBB server, you need to configure the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for using your own server by replacing the configuration that comes by default. And that is unrelated to the version of the plugin, or Moodle. Just to recap, there are thre components here Moodle + BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle + BigBlueButton",

          "Text": "Hi, I just wanted to share a mechanism that I have crudely implemented for authenticating recording links. As we know that BigBlueButton recordings are kind of \"unlisted\" in the fact that once the link is available, anyone can watch it. Hence using Nginx auth_request submodule, I have implemented a mechanism to authenticate the requests with some tweaks in the BBB plugin. Along with BBB server link for API, I have added a new column called BBB recordings link. So I have bbb.xyz.com handling my API requests and rec.xyz.com serving my recordings although they are on the same server (this is not really necessary, and the same bbb.xyz.com itself can be used This mechanism only works if moodle is also hosted on abc.xyz.com and cookie is shared at *.xyz.com that is cookie is available to both xyz and rec subdomains A new file called bbb_auth.php is created to which meetingID and bbb activity id are sent as GET parameters. if the meetingID is a part of BBB activity, a 200 OK is returned else 404 is returned. This bbb_auth.php link is used in the nginx rec.xyz.com auth_request field configuration. So when a logged in user from moodle visits the recording link, the recording link in the backend passes the cookie and requests bbb_auth.php for a reply, ONLY if the reply is 200 OK, the recording link (and all the audio, video and image assets involved) will be served. This allows for an authentication between Moodle and the BigBlueButton server through Nginx with minimal modifications. Please suggest if there are better mechanisms to do with without the cookie sharing constraint.",

When I had a webconference with a student last week, the connection was on and off quite a bit.  We eventually gave up and decided to try again this week.  Does anyone have any ideas what we can do to get a clear stream?

I am asking all this because if this is a issue that may that may affect someone else we can generalize the solution through code that can solve the p[roblem for everybody in the next release.

This is enterely imputable to the BBB plugin v2.2.9 caused by a badly tested snippet taken verbatim from a generic piece of code whithout exhausing al the possible outcomes. Totally my fault. It clashes with any theme or plugin using icons with the root icon-*. It was fixed a while back (end of Feb) but released as part of the last release last week (v2.2.11) with a few other cumulative fixes. You should update ASAP. Versions 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 have been removed. @Chris, we are about to release 2.3 which comes with a big refactoring, I would love to have you on board for giving it a try.",

          "Text": "Hi Rob, Good news.  We have released BigBlueButton 2.2-beta, which is the first version where the HTML5 client comes to the foreground as the main client. We made the announcement here to our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bigbluebutton-dev/34SphncjKEw/KJZsbQbEAQAJ . Here's a quote from our announcement The BigBlueButton HTML5 client runs without plugins. There is no Flash, no Java , and no mobile app needed to run the HTML5 client.  The client takes advantage of the latest capabilities of FireFox and Chrome (the recommended browsers on the desktop) and mobile Safari (for iOS 11+ iPhones and iPads). The HTML5 client uses the browser's support for web real-time communication (webRTC) to send and receive high-quality audio, video, and screen sharing.  You'll find the shared video of higher quality than the Flash client.  We use FreeSWITCH for WebRTC audio and Kurento for WebRTC video/screen sharing. The HTML5 client implements the full capabilities for the presenter upload presentation, pan/zoom, and annotate using whiteboard tools (including multi-user whiteboard). The HTML5 client offers more collaboration capabilities (compared with the Flash client) including built-in shared notes (using EtherPad) and ability to share YouTube video during the session (though the shared YouTube video does not appear yet in the recording). The HTML5 client runs on desktop, laptop, chromebook, and mobile devices.  It implements a responsive interface (written in React) that automatically adapts to the screen size.  This means the *same* code and interface is now running across all these devices.  For mobile devices there is no app to install. The HTML5 client runs with the mobile browser which on iOS is mobile Safari browser and on Android is Chrome.  These browsers support using WebRTC to send/receive audio and video.  The supported operating systems on mobile devices is iOS 11+ for Apple iPhones/iPads and Android 6.0+.  The device must support the h.264 codec (which is supported by iOS and most Android phones). We've been testing earlier builds of the HTML5 client on our test server at https://test.bigbluebutton.org/ . While BigBlueButton anyone can use BigBlueButton as a general web conferencing system, the project focuses on the needs of the instructor and student for online learning. With our announcement, anyone can setup their own BigBlueButton server (with HTML5 client as default) by following the install steps at: http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/html/html5-install.html .

          "Text": "Hi Urpo, Very simple. Room/Activity with recordings, is the normal and regular room we have had since BigBlueButtonBN version 2.0. Meaning an instance that can be used for joining sessions that may be recorded. If they are and have recording linked to them, the recordings are shown at the bottom. Room Activity only, similar to the first one, BUT with no recordings. This instances won;t give the users even the possibility of recording the session. It is normally used for give students an space for collaboration with no need to be worried about space or the content they recorded. If an existen room is changed to this type, the existent recordings will remain in BBB but they won't be shown. Recordings only, Since the inception of BigBlueButtonBN version 2.2, the plugin named RecordingsBN that was used for showing all the recordings in a course, has been phased out. The reason for that is that there was too many duplicated code and it is always more difficult to maintain more than one plugin. Specially when they have similar functionality. So, In order to have an instance for showing all the recordings in one course you select this type. You can also use this type if you want to show only one recording (or a small set of them) by importing recording from another instance in the same course, or even in a different one. I hope this clarifies things. Cheers, JF",

Lets say a teacher wants to have a room with recordings for student collaboration showing a recording from a different course but only want them to have meetings that  should not be recorded. You may argue that students won't have access to start/stop recordngs anyways, but they could if you want to give them moderator capabilites. I know, the convinations are endless, but this is the thing, this plugin has been growing in features and capabilities based on user requests. What does't make much sense to you may be the only way to solve someone else problem. My advice is always to look for the settings that will work for you particular use cases and try to set them up by default, this way your users don't have to be worried for too many combinations. I would say that in your case, if you prefer no to see the checkbox but still want to have all the meetings with the option for being recorded, add this to your config.php $CFG->bigbluebuttonbn['recording_default'] = 1; $CFG->bigbluebuttonbn['recording_editable'] = 0; I hope this helps.

The last can only be accessed by the teacher or administrators when the groups are separated. I don't know in this case why you are seeing only 2 rooms per activity when you should actually see 3 as for what I can see you have 2 groups in that course. Also, it wouldn;t be related but I would recommend you to update to v2.2.4, which is the latest version and it has been particularly updated for Moodle 3.5 Regards, Jesus",

For restricting access to a room to some users (including teachers) you could use groups and to use an special role for those teachers (non-editing teacher may be used, but I would rather create a custom one for that particular use case. Lets call it TA). Then you enroll the TAs into the course/groups you want them to have access, and for the activity you can add them as moderators in the list of participants. The groups should be set up as \"separated\". You may have to play around  with the options until you get the set up you need. Good luck, Jesus Federico",

          "Text": "Hi, I managed to successfully downgrade these two plugins and I would like to share my actions. I did not try it on a live system but on a staging one. Before you begin keep a backup of everything!! You can find the version of a plugin in the version.php file: $plugin->version = 2014070401; My old BBB plugins on Moodle 3.0.9: 1) mod_bigbluebuttonbn version 2015062101 2) mod_recordingsbn version 2014070401 The new BBB plugins that I wanted to use on Moodle 3.0.9: 1) mod_bigbluebuttonbn version 2016051919 2) mod_recordingsbn version 2016051906 Pre-installation steps: a) I have the code in a git repository so if I need to, I can checkout the folders and revert the file changes. b) It is important to keep a back up of the tables that the plugins use. From their \" db/install. xml \" I found three tables: b.1) bigbluebuttonbn and bigbluebuttonbn_log for bigbluebuttonbn b.2) r ecordingsbn for recordingsbn c) I exported the tables one by one: c.1)   my sql dump -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE mdl_bigbluebuttonbn > /tmp/moodlelive_bigbluebuttonbn_table.sql c.2)   mysqldump -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE mdl_bigbluebuttonbn_log > /tmp/moodlelive_bigbluebuttonbnlog_table.sql c.3)   mysqldump -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE mdl_recordingsbn > /tmp/moodlelive_recordingsbn_table.sql Upgrade steps: a) rm -rf mod/bigbluebuttonbn b) rm -rf mod/recordingsbn c) Then, I  'wget' and 'unzip' the zip files from the Moodle plugin directory, in my mod folder. d) From the front-end, I followed the steps and upgraded the plugins. Let's suppose that I am not happy with the new plugins, something does not work and I want to downgrade. At these stage, if I have created new meetings they will be lost, if I apply the following steps so please make sure that you only want to downgrade without migrating any \"new\" data. Downgrade steps: a) rm -rf mod/bigbluebuttonbn b) rm -rf mod/recordingsbn c) git checkout -- mod/bigbluebuttonbn d) git checkout -- mod/recordingsbn At the moment, I  have got the old plugin files that were stored in my GIT repository. e) A table in the database keeps the new versions of the plugins that I installed, I must update these values otherwise Moodle will never use the older plugins versions and I will not be able to downgrade! e.1) ID for mod_bigbluebuttonbn: select * from mdl_config_plugins where plugin = 'mod_bigbluebuttonbn'; e.2) ID for mod_recordingsbn: select * from mdl_config_plugins where plugin = 'mod_recordingsbn'; e.3) update mdl_config_plugins set value = '2015062101' where id = THE_ID_FROM e.1; E.4) update mdl_config_plugins set value = '2014070401' where id = THE_ID_FROM e.2; f) So, up until now we have put in place the older versions in the database and we need to import the backups: f.1) mysql -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE < /tmp/moodlelive_bigbluebuttonbn_table.sql f.2) mysql -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE < /tmp/moodlelive_bigbluebuttonbnlog_table.sql f.3) mysql -u MYUSERNAME -p MYDATABASE < /tmp/moodlelive_recordingsbn_table.sql Refreshing the front-end will prompt you to update the database, click on the button and then check if you can use the plugins - perhaps you will need to update the secret and the URL of BBB server on the appropriate screen. It worked for me without issues, if someone tried something else please share it! Best wishes, AN",

I haven't confirmed it, but I am guessing that some of them will make v2.1.x fail. Anyways, the ideal solution is to migrate the current RecordingsBN instances in your Moodle server by creating a corresponding BigBlueButtonBN one (with the same name) in the same courses/ sections . This is because as you may have noticed, BigBlueButtonBN includes the functionality RecordingsBN used to have. Which is to show in one instance all the recordings that belong to a course. Within the new version you would need to add a BigBlueButtonBN and configure it to act as a resource by selecting the type \"Recordings Only\" when adding it to your course. So the only noticeable difference will be the icon. Right now all the migration has to be done manually, which may be painful if you have a large number of RecordingsBN instances already. Well all this you may have figured out already, so my contribution here is a new version (v1.3.3 or 2016051907) of the RecordingsBN plugin. This version includes an option only available to Administrators for migrating the RecordingsBN instances into BigBlueButtonBN ones. See screen caps attached. Now, if you can please give it a try and give us your feedback so we can proceed to fix whatever you find or to release it right away, that would be very much appreciated.. Thanks, JF",

          "Text": "Hi Nick, I think there is a misconception here on what the capabilities in the previous version were and the ones the current one are. With BigBlueButtonBN 2.1.x the recordings belonging to a Room were also shown to all the uses who have access to the Room. RecordingsBN was used as a view in order to show ALL the recordings in a course. But this use case was not changed at all. With BigBlueButtonBN 2.2, the functionality offered by these two plugins was merged, which means that you can have an instance that has a Room/Activity with no recordings, it can be a Room/Activity showing its own recordings (same as the standard Room in v2.1.x) or a resource with Recordings only (same as an instance of the previous RecordingsBN) The use case you are trying to cover has never been considered, although you were able to hide the recordingsBN instance from students using the Moodle capabilities. Nonetheless, there is a workaround you could try. This would be to create a group per user in that course and enroll them. Students should see only the recordings for the group (or groups) they belong, but Teachers should be able to see all of them. I hope this helps. JF",

We have also been working on an HTML5 client for BigBlueButton.  You can see the latest information here: http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/html/html5-overview.html . You can also try out the latest build of the BigBlueButton HTML5 client on our test server at https://test.bigbluebutton.org/ . We invite you to try it with you iPad (iOS 11+) or Android device and let us know what you think.  Here's the HTML5 client viewing presentation area from the Flash client. We recommend using iOS 11+ as Apple has provided support for WebRTC in iOS 11+. We're working on the first release of the HTML5 client -- try the above and give us your feedback. Regards,...

The first thing I have to tell you is that things can be faster if you provide the right versions when asking for help. In this case, along with the 2.2-beta (which doesn't tell much really) there is a 10 digits number. That is the one we really use to identify issues particularly related to a version. I am assuming you guys had 2017101002 (that may have been the first report). The issue you have now is telling me that you either have 2017101003 or 2017101004. You have two options here: The first is to update to 2017101004 (if you are still in 2017101003), which was released yesterday to the Moodle Plugin Directory. But in this case there is still an edge case lasting. The activities created with 2017101003 are not going to work. You would need to delete them and create them again. If that is important for you, you can take the second option. That is to find the latest code in the github repository (master branch). The version  2017101005 solves that edge case as well. https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/moodle-mod_bigbluebuttonbn This version is likely going to be promoted to RC this week. So if it works for you, you could take the first option and wait to do the next update until the newest version is released there. Please let us know if you run into any other issue after the update.

          "Text": "Hi Sara, Do you mean to save the WebRTC/Flash/ Java permissions so the the browser \"remembers\" the next time the user uses the resource? Well, for these permissions we need to remember that this is a Browser thing and not a BBB one. And as far I can remember they are required only the first time you launch into this site (unless you clean cache and settings) The WebRTC/Flash permissions (meaning webcam and audio) should be remembered (at least Chrome and Firefox do) as long as you always use the same BBB server , meaning you are not behind a load balancer that is giving you access to a different server every time. Java, well I am afraid you need to download (end execute) the extension ever time. In Chrome you can check what permissions you have for the particular site once you are in the session. If you click Manage microphone settings you can see what sites have been allowed to use this resource. Same for the webcam and Flash. Now, for the Flash settings, there is also a section when you can change the default behaviour for flash (which I would not recommend) But again keep in mind that these are settings in the browser so every single user accessing that site has to do that. if you mean the tests of webcam and mic included in BBB, these can also be disabled in BBB by editing the config. xml file. /var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml You have to be the admin of that BBB server and the changes will apply to all the users of that particular server. I personally would not recommend it as you may hit some other issues of people with Hw or OS problems not able to identify. Which means a lot of unnecessary requests to the Technical Support team I hope this helps JF P.S. It is fine to ask anywhere about this kind of questions, but your chances of getting a better and quicker response to questions directly related to BBB are maximised in the BBB mailing list bigbluebutton-setup",

You can reach out with any of the companies listed here: https://bigbluebutton.org/commercial-support/ As you may have figured out by now, BigBlueButton is an open source project for Web conferencing. Same as Moodle is for Content Managment for Education (LMS). The project itself doesn't make any money directly. Instead it is supported by the companies that are part of the ecosystem. Responding to your question, as for any other Open Source project, free doesn't mean free as a free beer, but free as in freedom. There are tons of resources out there that explain the business model for open source projects. You can start taking a look to this one: https://handsontable.com/blog/articles/5-successful-business-models-for-web-based-open-source-projects Regards, JF",

With 4 people (3 students and 1 teacher) it simply gives a message that the session has been disconnected and closes the session for all participants. I typically have groups of 4 people (1 Teacher and 3 students) and have not had a problem until yesterday. However, since yesterday, it is impossible to run session with 4 participants (3 students and 1 teacher). Any suggestions on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated.",

The problems don't usually just happen, so an update was in process or it is on its way. With test-install you either have to be patient and wait or report it to the bigbluebutton mailing list as it may be an issue the developers are not aware of. Cheers, JF",

The plugin let you create Moodle activities that will let you make use of some functionality inside the LMS, BUT, you have to have a BigBlueButton server where to run the meetings. It is true that the plugin comes pre-configured to work with a BigBlueButton server provided for free by Blindside Networks, BUT (again) it is not meant to be for production, only for testing. It is OK if you use the server as much as you need/want. The server works normally fine, but as it is used (for free) by lots of users daily it may be overloaded in times. Also it always runs the latest build with gives users access to all the new features and capabilities, although the downside of that is also that in times there may be hidden bugs not detected in development.

Go to your adobe connect settings in your moodle (normally it is somewhere like here: http://your-moodle.com/admin/settings.php?section=modsettingadobeconnect ) and in \" HTTP Authentication Header \" field, write what you wrote instead of \"AVALUE\" in last step and save it. Edit \" web.xml \" located in \" appserv/web/ \" and enable the \" headerauthenticationfilter \" section, but you need to disable the API \" init-param \" section. And save it. Restart your adobe connect. That's it. Now there is no need to enter username (or email) and password to enter the adobe connect class and the users will be directly entered to class as they click on the button. Regards, Hamed",

I am trying to connect from the configuration menu and get a http 400 error (page not found). Nevertheless I used all the parameters that Adobe support gave me (attached). I tried with port80 and adobe ask me to use port443. On HTTP_AUT_HEADER they told me to stay default.

The terms of use are shown in the chat box when a user joins the session. Just a few things to keep in mind: - it is meant to be a testing server not a production server - it is open, which means anyone can access your sessions at anytime. - it can be used by everybody which means that there may be cases when the maximum capacity is reached - its recordings will last only for 14 days - the administrators could shut it down any time. We don't do that, and we do our best to keep it up and running, but sometimes maintenance interruptions can happen and they not always can be scheduled. This is why we recommend people to have dedicated servers for production. Regards, JF",

You can find multiple references to Ubuntu 16.04 as the only way to get it to work through packaging in the official documentation: http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html -------------------------- We (the core developers) have designed, developed, installed, and tested BigBlueButton 1.1 on Ubuntu: 16.04 64-bit (Xenial Xerus). That’s what we recommend you use. We have not tested BigBlueButton 1.1 on any other version of Ubuntu (or Linux). Why the focus on Ubuntu 16.04? It’s a choice of quality over quantity. Long ago we concluded that its better for the project to have solid, well-tested, well-documented installation for a specific version of Linux that works really, really well than to try and support may OS and have none of them work well. --------------------------",

There are several troubleshooting  tips you may find useful. As this is not a Moodle issue related I would recommend you to go to the bigbluebutton forums and do a search or ask there. There are tons of posts pointing to similar problems and also hundreds of people (either sysadmins or bbb developers) who can respond to these kind of issues faster. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup JF",

It provides instructors with real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, polls, emojis and their screen.  BigBlueButton can also record and playback online sessions for later viewing. The BigBlueButton project is pleased to announce the release of BigBlueButton 1.1. We have been working with the Moodle community for over six years now with the goal of providing remote students a high-quality online learning experience.  This release is a significant step towards that goal. Major new features in BigBlueButton 1.1 include: Breakout Rooms – Instructors can group students into breakout rooms for increased collaboration. Instructors can monitor activity in the breakout rooms and set a time limit for collaboration (see ). Closed Captioning – BigBlueButton enables a stenographer to provide live closed captions in multiple languages during a session. After the session finishes, the captions will appear as subtitles in the recording (see ). Faster Screen Sharing – Screen sharing is faster, works across all browsers (using a Java application that launches outside the browser) and now captures cursors (see ). GreenLight – Administrators can install a new front-end, called GreenLight, that makes it easy for users to quickly create meetings, invite others, and manage recordings on a BigBlueButton server . Using Docker, administrators can install on the BigBlueButton server itself (no need for a separate server). GreenLight is written in Rails 5 and can be easily customized by any rails developer (see source on GitHub ). Ubuntu 16.04 packages – This release installs on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit (the most recent long-term support release from Canonical) and uses `systemd` for new start/stop scripts for individual components. For more information on this release see detailed list of new features and issues fixed in BigBlueButton 1.1 . We recommend anyone running an earlier version of BigBlueButton to setup a new Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server, install this latest version and copy over any previous recordings (see the above install documentation for details). Many learning management systems have integrated BigBlueButton into their products using the BigBlueButton API .  By far, the deepest integration with with Moodle. According to the Moodle stats over 4000 sites have installed the BigBlueButtonBN plugin .  Currently, it's ranked #5 in overall downloads (Look out Academi, we're coming for you . We welcome any feedback on this release.  Like Moodle, BigBlueButton and the BigBlueButtonBN plugin are open source projects. For more information, visit https://bigbluebutton.org/ . Regards,...

Our mantra is we release on quality, not dates.  We also have very high standards for each release, and a development process to ensure quality.  As such, the length of our beta cycle that is usually as long, or if not longer, than the development cycle itself. The result is that the final release tends to be stable and allows us to focus our efforts on the next.  We've had fifteen releases of the product over the past eight years.  Our main use case is thinking about the needs of instructor wanting to teach students effectively. There are some very large deployments of BigBlueButton (and some very large organizations that publicly state they save over $10m USD / year using our product).   For Moodle, the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle is currently ranked #5 in overall downloads and used by 4,500 sites.  We're closing in on the #4 spot. This widespread adoption reenforces our commitment to stability and usability first, features second.  Looking ahead, we will continue to improve BigBlueButton in each release, to deepen the integration with Moodle, and to focus on the needs of the instructor. Thanks for sharing information on our project.  Much appreciated. Warm regards,.. Fred BigBlueButton Product Manager",

          "Text": "Hello Richard, I've posted some documentation on Moodle Docs here . In order to get the activity plug-in to work properly there were some changes I had to make to the configuration files for my Adobe Connect Pro server . The to the config file allowed the activity module to make web service calls and use HTTP header authentication so that the users from Moodle could join the Adobe Connect Pro meetings. I'm pasting some of the notes from the help page to answer your question regarding the settings and what values to use Host - This is the URL where REST calls are sent to and it must bet set to the domain where our ACP server exists. If your ACP server is behind the domain name of myacpserver.com, then this settings would look like myacpserver.com/api/xml. Meeting domain - This value is just the domain name of your ACP server and would be the same as the Host setting above without the /api/xml part. Port - The port your ACP server uses for it's connections. The default port is by no means the recommended port needed for the activity plug-in to work. You may use any value for this so as long as your Adobe Connect Pro server is setup to receive requests from that port. Admin Login - This is the super administrator account user name. This account will be useed to make all the API calls. This account should also have permissions to create users, create meetings and assign permissions to user. If you are not sure which user account that is then you will have to contact your ACP server administrator and consult with them. Admin Password - the password for the super administrator account. Again if you are not sure about this then consult with your ACP server administrator. I would also like to note that I'm currently working on adding a \"Test Connection\" button to the activity global settings page, so that you can test your connection settings to ensure that all the operations the activity module performs does in fact work with the settings that were provided",

However a user on the Adobe Connect server already exists. I can suggest a couple of things. 1. If you could download the new source code for the module. Got to Adobe Connect settings from the 'Manage Activities ' page in the Administration block; and test the connection. The test will run through a number or procedures and report back if there was an error in any of them. 2. Double check if the Moodle user you are logged in as already exists on your Adobe Connect server. If so and the Adobe user is NOT an admin, remove the user on the Adobe Connect server and try it again. 3. Alternatively, you could create a new Moodle user that does not currently exist on the Adobe Connect serber and try to create and join a meeting. One question, are you receiving that message when you click on the 'Join meeting' button?",

In your case you will need to have this option checked. You can get the latest version of the code from here , I've also update the MoodlDocs page with the new information. Regards,",

Still, in my setup (ACP 7.5), this only gets the user to an ACP login screen, where they can enter as a guest or enter with login and password. The description of this module says \"So as long as the user is logged into Moodle they will never have to enter in user credentials to get access to an Adobe Connect meeting\" I am not finding that to be true. In fact, if a meeting is set to private, there is no way to enter unless the user has a login and password created in ACP. Is there still an issue with username set to e-mail address? Or could this be the HTTP_AUTH_HEADER setting? I used the default \"rl-user-id\" setting. I contacted my ACP service representative to ask about this but they referred me back to this forum! This is a great module and I look forward to getting students up and running with this. Thanks!",

If you have your own server you can use header authentication. However, if you are hosted by Adobe the documentation says: \"With a Acrobat Connect Pro hosted account, you cannot use single sign-on or external authentication. You must pass the user’s authentication credentials on the Acrobat Connect Pro hosted account, not the credentials for an external network.\" So, it looks like this module only works partially with an Adobe-hosted ACP account. You can create the meeting and allow your users to log in as guests, but not log them in as users with Adobe-defined roles. Regards",

If you would like to allow users to access the meeting as public users, you can add the activity module and set the Meeting Type setting to \"Public\".

A normal user that exist in the LDAP server can login into moodle then use the Adobe Connect's activity or login into the url server Adobe Connect in a transparent way. Thank's and regards.",

We have installed the module as we are piloting an hosted trial and it appears to connect OK. Moodle users are automatically generated as participants in the connect admin although it doesn't take their passwords which have to be generated by admin manually. Another issue I have noticed is that when creating a meeting in moodle it can take some time to move away from the \"adding a new Adobe Connect\" page - sometimes it is better to clear firefoxes cache and log back in? Also I am finding that although I am assigning a host role when creating the meeting the role always remains presenter when logging in? The only way I can resolve this is to log in to connect pro admin and set it there. Any ideas as to where I might be going wrong? If any other educational users have purchased a server licence could you give me an indication at the kind of costs involved? Kindest Regards Daran",

When the activity module creates a new user account on the Connect Pro server it does not use the same password that the user has in Moodle (and there is no way it to figure out that password), so it creates a random password. The activity module will automatically log in the user into Connect Pro once they click on \"Join Meeting\" button. So the user essentially does not need to know their Connect Pro password. When you are creating a meeting in Moodle how long does it take for you? It sounds like you are creating meeting with the activity module, but you are having users go directly to the meeting URL rather than clicking on the \"Join Meeting\" button. In order for the user to receive the same role, on Connect Pro, that you gave them in Moodle that user must click on the \"Join Meeting\" button. Only after the user has clicked on that button will the user be assigned their role on Connect Pro. This was a design choice so that the API calls were only made when there was a absolute need to do so.",

The module moves meeting recordings, on the Connect Pro server, from the 'Forced Recordings' folder to the 'Shared Content' folder. So you can check to see if there are in fact any meetings by logging in to your Connect Pro server and clicking on 'Content' then 'Shared Content'.

My goal is to fully test with a hosted account and release a new version. Some users have been trying to get the module to work with their hosted accounts. Users with hosted accounts say they can create meetings and assign roles to meetings, however the SSO feature does not work for their hosted accounts. One user pointed to Adobe documentation stating that you cannot externally authenticate users if you are using a hosted account. Your host setting would be \"connectpro000000000.emea.acrobat.com/api/xml\" and your domain setting would just be \"connectpro000000000.emea.acrobat.com\" For your port number, because you on a hosted account I would guess 80 would work. The reason why there is a port number to begin with is for when a dedicated server is running on a different port other than 80. Regarding the HTTP Authentication Header, this setting is needed to ensure the SSO functionality works. However because you are on a hosted account, I do not believe this setting will work for you (as mentioned above ). I have provided more details about this module and settings on the MoodleDocs page here",

Only thing you need to do is sign in to the meeting room again (no SSI option since it is a hosted account.) The issues I was having was creating a host role for someone with admin system permissions in Moodle. The default role appeared to be Presenter. I decided to create a quick video showing how I create Adobe Connect meetings with the Moodle plugin on our hosted Adobe Connect server: http://www.screencast.com/t/YWMxYWY5Z I hope this helps, as the plugin offers real advantages by creating a calendar event for the meeting in the course, creates automatic links to the meeting for easy access by students, and allows you to create and delete Adobe Connect meetings within Moodle, without having to login to the Adobe Connect server. The only thing you will need to do extra as compared to an internally hosted Adobe Connect account, is to sign in once more to Adobe Connect when you enter the meeting you created in Moodle. I really think this plugin will encourage our instructors to host more meetings, as well as easily being able to create meetings for students to host, too.",

I am having the following issues and wonder if anyone else has experienced this: After creating an Adobe Connect meeting in Moodle, whether it is private or not, the meeting does not recognize the creator as the host. If I give myself (the instructor) the role of host, it still does not change to that role once I enter the Adobe Connect meeting room. This is really strange, but even if I change my permission from presenter to host within the Adobe manager interface (logging in directly to Adobe Connect server), my role changes to presenter when I try to login to the meeting through Moodle. I can create a host role for a student account, which seems to works, but when I create one for me, it does not. I am also one of the admins on the Adobe Connect account and am using my credentials to make the connection with Adobe and Moodle. We are using the hosted version of Adobe Connect. The connection tests appear to be working, but not sure if I'm using the correct HTTP header info or not. What really is strange is that my Moodle site keeps making me a presenter in the room, even if after I add the host role in Moodle and also change it to host in the Adobe Connect manager. Any ideas?

Simply put if the user had the \" Allowed to do everything moodle/site:doanything\" capability then they would have been affected by this issue. I would say that if it is not too much trouble to update your plug-in with the latest code, then please do. However, getting Moodlerooms to upload the updated version is troublesome then a simple work around to the issue you are having was to simply create a new role that is similar to the Moodle Adminsitrator role except it does not have the 'Allowed to do everything' capability.

In attachment you'll find the italian translation (it_utf8)for the plugin (the help will come if i'll find time). If you need to do some update to the lang in the future, feel free to contact me again. I added also 2 strings ad the end to translate \"Private\" and \"Public\", but to be used the code in mod_form.php must be changed too as follow: $meetingpublic = array(1 => get_string('Public','adobeconnect'), 0 => get_string('Private','adobeconnect')); Then i defined also the strings for 5 notices that were not translatable, as they were fixed in the code of join.php and view.php (in the translation you'll find the referenced strings in english): obviously the code must be changed too. And finally another suggestion: in the view.php maybe it's better to use (around line 338 and 352) $time = userdate($adobeconnect->starttime); ... $time = userdate($adobeconnect->endtime); so the dates printed on the web page will be automagically set-up according to the user language preferences. Hope this helps. Best regards",

Instructors/Meeting hosts (in Moodle) are not assigned a host role in ACP meetings: - I am able to create a meeting by not assigning a meeting URL - The meeting is created and I am presented with the \"Join Meeting\" and \"Assign Roles\" buttons - When I click \"Join Meeting\" ACP launches and I enter the meeting, but only with \"view\" permissions (participant), not host or presenter roles. - I go back to moodle and click on the \"Assign roles\" and ensure that my user is assigned the \"Host\" role. - try it again, the same thing happens, I can enter the meeting with \"view\" permissions only. - The user I am currently using to login to Moodle and that exists already in ACP is an admin in both systems. I have tried using another user who is only an instructor in both systems and I experience the same issue. - Looking at the ACP API and debug logs alerted me to this: [08-31 11:16:11] web-35 XML API called, action = principal-list, session = breez24ymmzf4zxewnkg9, caller = 9, parameters = &action=principal-list&filter-login= [08-31 11:16:11] web-40 XML API called, action = permissions-update, session = breez24ymmzf4zxewnkg9, caller = , parameters = &principal-id=11334&acl-id=11000&action=permissions-update&permission-id=view (I removed the server ip address in the caller and my user id). The above logs appears when i create a meeting and also appears when I go to the \"assign roles\" button and assign a role to the user. Instead of assigning the host permission it assigns my user a \"view\" permission. Question: does anyone know why I can't get the module to send an API call to assign the proper role? 2. I notices that all meetings I create with the ACP module are created in the \"Shared Meetings\" area in ACP. Why does it create the meetings here instead of the \"meetings\" area of the user who logged in to moodle (who also exists in ACP) and is actually creating them? I am also running Blackboard 9, and the ACP building block. The ACP blackboard building block creates the meetings in the meeting area of the user that logged in to Blackboard (who was created or already existed in ACP). Hope someone can help.

Just to get some information, when you are assigning roles what context level are you assigning them at? Site, course category, course, module, etc. Also, what happens when you change the meeting from public to private and try it again? Can you replicate the permissions issue for a new user (with teacher role) in Moodle? Meaning if you create a new user, assign the user a teacher roles in Moodle then login as that user and create a meeting and attempt to join. In your ACP log that you posted, were there a call to permissions-info? The permissions-info call check to see what role on the ACP server the user currently has. For your second point, the specification to create meetings in the user's meeting folder wasn't part of the requirements Adobe had when we made the module. Is there a reason why meetings should be created in the user's meeting folder as opposed to the shared folder?",

          "Text": "Hi, Thanks for your reply. - I tried two separate accounts, one which was an ACP admin, and one that wasn't. However, I tried that in an earlier version of the module. I'll redo this test by creating a new user as you suggested. - Changing the meeting from private to public and viceversa makes no difference. I always enter the meeting with view permissions. - I have tried assigning roles just about everywhere, site, course and also in the meeting (assign roles). I have tried a combination of them all, some, and also in isolation from all others (i.e. chose the role in site but not the rest, then course and not the rest...etc) - The ACP log doesn't show an API call of \"permission-info\". I looked at the log generated by the Blackboard building block and it does show a \"permission-info\" API call, so not sure why the Moodle module is not doing it. - Meetings in user's areas rather than \"shared meetings\" area. This is incredibly important when working within a service provision model where the user is able to login to ACP directly as well as creating meetings via integration with our LMSs. If a user logged in to ACP, they would not be able to see all their meetings and create reports (for instance - though I know that if students use the \"Join Meeting\" button some sort of report is possible in Moodle, however, as an ACP administrator, I would also like to be able to do reports, and if people do not use a good naming convention when creating meetings, then it becomes a guessing game what meeting was for what course when they all sit in the \"shared meetings\" area) I'll try redoing the test with a new user and post results.

          "Text": "Hi all, I have finalised my testing with a new user, here are my findings: - I created a new user in Moodle (instructor for my course) and not in ACP. The only way I was able to see the option to add a new \"adobe Connect\" activity in the drop down menu was to add site wide instructor permissions to the new user (this is of course not ideal because then I can see all the courses with those permissions). I wonder why this is the case. I provided the new user with Adobe Connect host privileges (everywhere). - Once I was able to see the option to create the activity, I created a new meeting (private, no meeting URL, default everything else). When I created it I pressed the \"save and display\", this brought me to the next screen where it was supposed to show me the details of the meeting, but it didn't. The bottom frame return an http 200 OK response, so I knew it had nothing to do with moodle. I suspected that the user was not created in ACP automatically, and from what I remember reading the user is created when the \"Join\" button is pressed, but I had no button and no meeting info (but the breadcrumbs showed that the meeting was created). when I went in to moodle with my admin user I could see the details of the meeting. In ACP the meeting was also created. - So, I created the new user in ACP. Then I logged back in to moodle and I could then see the meeting details. I clicked the \"Join Meeting\" button and the Adobe Connect window came up with a \"The meeting has bot yet started. You will be able to access the meeting once the host arrives.\" So, clearly I was able to get into meetings using my other user because I am an ACP admin, but it still did not provide host privileges in the meeting itself. And this new user cannot even go into the meeting because there are no host privileges set. - If I go to ACP as an admin, edit the meeting that is in \"Shared Meetings\" and manually add the new user as a host of the meeting (under \"Edit Participants\"), then I can click the \"Join Meeting\" button in Moodle and enter the meeting as a host. So, this basically tells me that the module is not able to modify the participants section of the meeting to add the user as a host. The moodle user in ACP that I am using (for the module settings) is a full administrator of ACP, I even ensured that the user has full rights to the \"Shared Meetings\" area. - Now, I have been told by the Moodle server admins (our instance is hosted externally to our institution) that the\"editingteacher\" and \"teacher\" roles have been renamed in our Moodle instances. Can this affect the way the module works? Is the module expecting certain role names to be able to work properly? Any ideas? Cheers, Petri",

          "Text": "Your setup sounds odd. If your user has permissions to add an activity module in the course then they should see the Adobe Connect activity module in the drop down. A user does not need the Moodle Adobe Connect Host role to add an activity instance. Double check and see if your are overriding any permissions, because what you are describing does not seem like the default behaviour. Look at your site roles. The activity module creates 3 roles. Each role has one capability set to 'Allow' by default. Your Adobe Connect Presenter role should only have the ' mod/adobeconnect:meetingpresenter' set to allow. Your Host role should only have the ' mod/adobeconnect:meetinghost' set to allow ; and your Participant role should only have the ' mod/adobeconnect:meetingparticipant' capability set to allow. Can you remove that test user on your ACP server. Turn on developer debugging on your Moodle site. Login in as that test user and click on the connect meeting activity. Does anything display on your screen? Also when you attempt to join can you check the logs on your ACP server? When you click on the 'join meeting' button and the user has not yet been created on the ACP server, you should see the following API calls in your ACP server log: action => principal-list, filter-login => <username> (this checks to see if the user exists) action => principal-update, first-name => <value>, last-name => <value>, login => <value>, password => <value>, extlogin => <value>, type => 'user', send-email => 'false', has-children => 0, email => <value> (this will create the user if none exists) action => permissions-info, acl-id => <value>, filter-principal-id => <value> (this checks to see if the user has a role in the meeting already) Lastly, can you double and ensure that all of the files in the adobeconnect folder have been updated correctly? To answer your last question, the module (with regard to assigning ACP roles) only uses the capabilities that were created by the module itself. Creating/editing the module settings is governed by the same capability that all activity modules use.",

          "Text": "Hi, Thanks for your response. I was finally able to return to this issue. I checked the roles in Moodle for Adobe Connect. They are set as per your post. I'll leave this as it is. I have set Moodle in debug. to answer your questions: - When I go to the connect meeting activity (i.e. I click on the add new activity - Adobe connect- option) I don't get anything on the screen. - When I \"add\" the meeting I do get the lines: aconnect_user_exists: REQUEST <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>principal-listTESTUSER aconnect_user_exists: RESPONSE <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>Test UserTESTUSERtestuser@unsw.edu.au *NOTE:I assume this is all OK, it is just checking that my user exists. I created the test user in ACP as well and gave it Meeting Host permissions. I want to tackle one issue at a time, so I didn't want to deal with account creation issues, if they exist. After I created the meeting (which I set as private) and attempted to Join the Meeting, I was unable to enter it since it told me that the meeting had not started because the meeting host had not arrived. So, I then clicked the \"Assign Roles\" button. There were no Adobe Connect Host assigned. So, I chose my user ID from the list on the right (after I did a search) and added it as a Host. No errors or issues appeared. I still could not enter the meeting room. So, I went looking for the logs. The \"api/log\" shows something interesting at the time that I \"assigned\" the host role to my account: [09-30 12:33:20] web-34 XML API called, action = common-info, session = null, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &action=common-info [09-30 12:33:20] web-10 XML API called, action = login, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &login=moodle&password=xxxxxxxxxx&action=login [09-30 12:33:20] web-39 XML API called, action = sco-shortcuts, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &action=sco-shortcuts [09-30 12:33:20] web-37 XML API called, action = sco-contents, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &sco-id=11005&action=sco-contents&filter-source-sco-id=43608&sort-name=asc [09-30 12:33:20] web-38 XML API called, action = sco-shortcuts, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &action=sco-shortcuts [09-30 12:33:20] web-34 XML API called, action = sco-contents, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &sco-id=11000&action=sco-contents&filter-source-sco-id=43608&sort-name=asc [09-30 12:33:20] web-10 XML API called, action = sco-contents, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &sco-id=43608&action=sco-contents&sort-name=asc [09-30 12:33:20] web-39 XML API called, action = principal-list, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &action=principal-list&filter-login=TESTUSER [09-30 12:33:20] web-37 XML API called, action = permissions-update, session = breez2chuzdfhmtm2yhwh, caller = 192.160.71.129, parameters = &principal-id=11334&acl-id=11000&action=permissions-update&permission-id=view The last line, if I understand it correctly, is updating the permissions for my user id (which has a principal-id of 11334 in the SQL table) and only assigning a permission of view (which is a participant in ACP). From this I can only think that the module itself is sending the wrong permission-id to the ACP server. Is this correct? Cheers, Petri",

The user is then logged in via web services to the AC server.  That is the reason why your users are still able to join meetings. Though I should note that a user may still be logged into the AC server even after they have left a meeting.  The AC server will automatically log the user out once their session expires.  The exact time it takes for a session to expire is unknown to me however. The user could technically go tot he main AC URL and possibly change their own password, or go to the forget password page and the activity module should still work without any issues. The alternative is to first create users on your AC server and to make sure the user has the same username or email (sepending on whether you have 'Email address login' checked).  The activity module will look for users with the same username or email address and assume that the currently user exists and log them in. Hope this helps",

Just to note that this forum is only for support of the activity module here . I'm not completely clear on your explaination. When you say 'Assign Roles', there are two areas where this can be done. 1. The main course view has an administration block where you can click Assign Roles.  On this page you will see the Adobe Connect roles listed as well as other Moodle roles.  When you assign roles on this page you are assigning roles only in the context of that course . 2. Viewing the Adobe Connect meeting details (by clicking on the activity) there are two buttons 'Join Meeting' and 'Assign Roles'.  On this page when 'Assign Roles' is clicked, you will see an interface that will only list the Adobe Connect roles.  In addition, this area is where you can assign Adobe Connect roles speficically for the context of that activity .  This means you can Assign adobe connect roles to user but they will only have those roles within that activity, but not outside of the activity. Now which area were you referring to when you say \"I can only set roles under 'Assign Roles'\"? Regarding the message \"Resource does not exist\".  Can you double check the 'Test Connection' messages on the settings page and make sure that none of the tests have failed.  Tests that have passed are in green and tests that have failed are in red. If everything has passed turn on DEBUGGING mode for your site.  Try removing that meeting that is giving you the error message and try adding a new meeting and see if any error message appear and if you are able to join the meeting. It may have been the case that an activity module is still showing up in your course when it is in fact partically deleted.  This can sometimes happen when an error occurs in the add/delete process.",

I assume that this is due to the fact that Adobe Connect 7.* wasn't prepending resource links with the protocol, but now it does. After correcting this (it is a couple of lines in views.php and one in join.php), everything works fine. If anyone wants the code, just contact me. Furthermore, in our system the Moodle plugin was publishing under the \"Meeting Recordings\" a list of all resources uploaded in the meeting  (including links to images and PDFs used in the conference, sometimes deleted and duplicate ones), I've made a little change so that it only publishes links to conferences and shows their duration: this way students will only see recordings and will be able to tell which is the real recording of, say, a 50-minute conference, and which is a test recording of 20 seconds.",

Everything looked great- and I busily set about adding a course with an Adobe Connect activity.  After that I tried to see if I added a presenter or host from within Moodle if I could log in to Adobe connect using that same profile from within Moodle.  That did not seem to work. The problems started after I logged out from Moodle and tried to log back in- I soon noticed that I am now unable to log into Moodle.  I tried the 2 admin accounts, and with both- Moodle simply returns me back to the log in home page of Moodle.  It recognizes the user name- but does nothing with the password (does not put up a wrong password error).  I tried several times of having Moodle send a new password via email- which it does.  But the new password will not work either. I've spent hours scouring the forums for answers, tried the passchange.php fix someone posted- but that just returned an error with a blank page.  The only thing that has semi-worked was if I go into MyPHPAdmin tables and I manually copy the encrypted password for the guest id and paste it in as my admin password.  The guest password will not work on it's own, I must next request a new password by email, retrieve it, and enter it on a new log in page within Moodle. Once I do all of that- I can get in as an administrator.  But once I log out- I have to redo the whole process to log back in.  And it does not seem to matter if I change the password while I am logged in or not. The problem only seems to have occured since I installed the Adobe Connect module- so I uninstalled it (deleted the module from within Moodle), and retried logging in after the deletion- but have found the same problems exist with logging in.  Unfortunately, I am not sure if the same problem exists for clients logging in as students at this point.",

I immediately used the Fantastico backup created of Moodle 1.9.9 and restored the 1.9.9 installation of Moodle.  Interesting thing happened: after the restore I was able to log in with my admin user id and password as if everything was reset to normal. BUT upon logging out- and trying to go back and log in (browser window closed, and reopened with prior to that used IE internet options to delete cookies/ history)... When trying to log back in I get the SAME problem again, ie; attempt to log in with known user name and password does not work and just brings me back to log in page without an error message.  Also heard from a frustrated client (with student privileges) that she is not able to log in either.  Another interesting thing that happens is that if I enter a known wrong password- then it returns me to the log in page with a red error message \"Invalid login, please try again\" Oh, and I have checked the moodle database using MySQL in my cpanel  after the restore both before and after the 2 log in attempts I made and it shows all on list as ok.  I do not know if there was a problem with it previous to this or not. Anyone have any idea what is going on here, and why it occured upon or following install of the Adobe Connect Pro module?",

I've looked over all of the code again and if you have \"HTTPS Connection\" set in the module settings, it should be sending all requests and generating all links using HTTPS. I'm not quite sure I understand the issue you run into with the port number.  You mention that the module is passing http://meeting.server:443/ and that you had to go inside the code an alter the URL to https://meeting.server/ .  Are you saying that the problem is the port number? Can you verify, that in the Adobeconnect activity module settings page you have enabled \"HTTPS Connection\". Also, the activity module includes the port number in the URL if the port number is anything but port 80. There isn't any setting on the Adobe server side that I'm aware of that can adjust the URL that is being passed. I you can verify your finding again and if you still have problem, then can you zip up the files you had to change and attach them to the Moodle tracker issue for me to review and see if there was anything that I missed.  Again I don't have an Adobe Connect server over HTTPS that I can test with.  However the change to get this to happen should be a small issue.

And though I usually like to figure things out myself, I'm just not wrapping my head around this one as effectively as usual. Before I begin, I want to verify one thing. The way we have our Adobe Connect system set up is on a server hosted by a 3rd party reseller. From what I've read so far, this isn't going to be an issue, right? The way we set up our sessions is using the option that anyone that has the URL can join. Is this setup going to work with your module? We need to have the time of the session be reflected in the user's time zone. We normally have participants from about 30 countries in each course so this is vital. I'm assuming this is standard but I need to double check. This is the main reason I'd like to use this application rather than just using the *Insert URL* feature. Once we get past these questions, I'm going to need your help filling out the following. When I enter the following, I get a pop-up window which indicates that \"The property 'login' is empty, please input a value and save the settings\". When I click on \"More information about this error\", I am directed to a Moodle docs page which has not been documented yet. http://docs.moodle.org/en/error/adobeconnect/error2 Thanks in advance for your help!

I am not certain if having your Connect server hosted by a 3rd party will be a problem or not.  That all depends on whether the 3rd party host Connect server on their own hardware.  In any case, I would suggest forwarding them to the MoodleDocs page for instructions on how to setup the Connect server to work with the Moodle activity module AdobeConnect Page . 2. If I understand your question correctly that is not a problem.  If a meeting is created using the 'Public' setting, then anyone can access that meeting.  However, please have a look at this page , as it details the different types of meeting you can create. Regarding the settings you need to for the module to work.  That message comes about when you run the test before you have clicked on the 'Save Settings' button.  Can you save the settings first before you run the click on the test settings?  Also the HTTP Authentication Header field should have a value.  Your 3rd party host reseller should be able to tell you what this value is after they have gone through the documentation on in point 1.  Otherwise you can just put in the default setting of my-user-id. Hope this helps. Regards,",

If not, you should be ;) Seriously though - I'll file some Tracker items and generate patches to do it the old way. The commit series is at https://github.com/une/moodle-mod_adobeconnect/compare/master...une_master (that une_master branch shows what we have in production; the master branch tracks the CVS upstream changes). The changes are: We set a new logo based on the Connect logo (no more white rectangle) The meeting URL was never being validated. Connect accepts 60 character meeting URLS. The database field was limited to 10 characters but was never being validated - so would either (a) fail on database entry or (b) fail on the Connect side. The commits here extend the field to 60 characters and apply validation. The format of the URLs is validated. It has to start with a letter [a-zA-Z] and contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens. We do a simple replacement of all bad characters with hyphens and validation fails if first character isn't a letter. The meeting times (start and end) both default to now. This means that validation fails if you don't adjust them. The change sets the end time to 2 hours in the future. The title field on the module form is strangely titled in the default English language pack (it's just 'Adobe Connect'). That's tweaked here to 'Meeting title' to match the other fields that are 'Meeting x' If either your meeting title or (when in Groups mode) the name of your group had non url-friendly characters (like ampersands '&') the meeting name was getting chopped off. That's now fixed by properly encoding the xml entities. I think that's it for now ;) Myles C.",

If all the tests pass, when you click on the activity, click on assign roles and manually assign yourself as an Adobe Connect Host.  After do so, does it allow you to join a meeting? Lastly http://lp.esi911.com/mod/adobeconnect/join.php?id=105&sesskey=uYbHoMbZdz&groupid=0 is the page that does some final authentication and determine whether you are a participant in the meeting or not.  After this is completed this script redirects you o the meeting URL.",

At our institution we use CAS for everything, but are currently trying to configure the HTTP header authentication for Connect. It relies on the use of LDAP accounts (already configured with Connect) and then after a webservice authentication discussion with Connect, Moodle sends the username and a valid token with the user, signing the user into Connect. Without it our users need to enter their password again. It'd be great to know if a CAS plugin could be written. What are you using for SSO?

I've read through the postings here and elsewhere and have been testing the current 1.9 and 2.0 plugins. I've responded to the post above about the meeting url being a mandatory field because that seems to stop the Moodle 2.0 version working - at least with a hosted account. e.g. with 1.9 i can add and access a meeting if I leave the url blank but can't if I tried to use a custom url. with 2.0 I can't leave the url blank and so adding a meeting activity fails. These problems may only occur when trying to use a hosted account rather than self-hosted but there certainly seems to be a difference between the 1.9 and 2.0 modules in that the later seems to make the url field mandatory and therfore doesn't work. My next step is to look at the code to see if I can find where to fix that but does anyone know where to look for that or have a solution to this problem? Thanks Ron",

Before commenting line 161 in Moodle 2 I got a message that the url field couldn't be empty. Does your fix differ from this? My testing was made more difficult because the college firewall/proxy was causing some problems but we've resolved that now and I've since discovered that I was misunderstanding the custom url field and just adding the preferred name e.g. rontestmeeting works fine.

          "Text": "Hi Akinsaya, Well, it doesn't really break it.  Things just work now according to the licensing rules.  So if you didn't have it setup right before it would still work but now it won't. You can license Connect as a 5-user named host setup (or more users). This is in the context of running your own connect server at your site. Previously anyone who was a host in a meeting did not count against the 5-user limit.  This was not enforced by Connect prior to 8.1SP1.  Hosted accounts will eventually have the same enforcement. What that meant was you could have any user in moodle create a room and host it as long as you didn't have more than 5 concurrent rooms running.  Now, someone can create a room but can't host the room until they are placed in the Meeting Hosts group on the connect server.  Until the host arrives the room is not usable by presenters and participants. To your second sentence \"Not sure if this helps, but the plug-in give a user an adobe connect role once they click the 'Join meeting' button.\"  Yes, but even if they are a host in the meeting they will not be able to host the meeting .  They need to be in the \"Meeting Hosts\" group on the connect server which counts towards your license user limit.  An administrator needs to grant access to being a host -- people can't just create a room on their own and use it without being granted host access inside connect. Again, hosted installations of connect don't have this enforcement yet but it is coming. -- Scott",

The rest I Left as default. This enables the Test Connection to work One big point I learned is that the meetings setup in MOodle are under \"Shared Meetings\" IN AdobeConnect.com There you have to setup the host and/or presenter roles otherwise even though you create the meeting in Moodle you will be logged in as a participant. In other words as explained elsewhere in this thread the roles assigned in Moodle do not carry over when you are using adobe hosted service.",

          "Text": "Hi Ata, How to apply a patch depends on how you have your Moodle instance set up. Is it hosted on Windows/Linux? Are you using any version control? Do you have a test environment where you can test applying the patch & make sure it works for you before applying it to your live environment? If not, I HIGHLY recommend you set one up before applying any contributed patches! As Akin mentioned, modifying your code can make future updates difficult. See Davo's comment here (which also includes a link to the docs on applying a patch): http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=164818#p722393 In the meantime, I would suggest that you go to http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-3302 and \"vote\" for the issue (you will need to create an account if you don't already have one). This way hopefully the patch will be reviewed by the maintainer (Akin) and might make it into the next version of the module. If that happens, you will be able to simply download the new version of the module.",

You can then apply these manually. There is also a link to \"view file\" where you can access the new version of a file, but BEWARE as the changes may have been made to a different version of the file, so by copying the whole file, you may write over any other changes that had been made on your original copy. If you're still keen to make manual changes, you could try making the following key changes ( WARNING : not a recommended method - see previous posts) : 1. Make a backup of your current joinrecording.php file and make sure that there is minimal activity on your live site. 2. Add the third line (in green) to line 19 (in my copy) of joinrecording.php: $id          = required_param('id', PARAM_INT); $groupid     = required_param('groupid', PARAM_INT); $recordingid = required_param('recording', PARAM_INT); 3. Make the following change (in green) to line 105/106 (in my copy) of joinrecording.php: redirect($protocol . $CFG->adobeconnect_meethost . $port . $recording [$recordingid] ->url . '?session=' . $adobesession); 4. Upload the new joinrecording.php file to your site using FileZilla and be prepared to restore your backup copy if anything goes wrong! 5. Report back here Jen p.s. I signed up for a free trial of an adobe.com hosted account and tested out the two-line change above. It seemed to work for me: p.p.s. This is the bare minimum required to get the recording URL to work. You will have to make further changes to view.php (as per the github link) if you want recording support for Adobe Connect activities created in 'group mode' (multiple meetings per activity)). p.p.p.s. have you considered downloading a local version of Moodle on your computer as a basic test environment? http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=177330 Careful - it's addictive!",

So, it seems at least for now, I'm going to have to continue our current method.  I'm able to launch/authenticate successfully straight into a Connect session from within Moodle using a hidden field, but the key to that is the student cannot change their Connect password.  In our case, this has not been an issue, since we never send them directly to Connect and, from the student view of things, it's all one big solution and they don't notice they're being redirected. I was just hoping I could do all of the management from within Moodle, but it seems that's still out of our grasp.",

I now have it working so I thought I would share them with you. Note - Port 80 did not work for me because our account requires SSL connection so I changed to port 443 and the error messages stopped. You can tell if SSL is required by looking under the Advanced Features heading on the Adobe Connect Account Summary page for admin accounts. I looked all over for information on how to edit the HTTP Authentication Header but I could not figure out a way to edit the information from a hosted solution account. Our organization does not need single sign-on because our students normally login as guests to any Adobe webinars that we host. That's our pre-Moodle process anyway and I don't see it changing any time soon. Since that's how it is now when we send links to our meetings, I don't see what the big burden is. Now that we have Moodle, the student clicks on the Adobe Connect activity link, clicks on the Join Meeting button and a pop-up window open asking them to login with either username/password or as a guest. I am choosing to use the plugin for the ability to automatically have the activity show up on the calendar as described in Barbara Schroeder's video posted in this thread June 5, 2010 . Otherwise, I would probably follow Brian Rutherford's advice in his post in this thread on June 4, 2010 .

I understand SSO won't work, but I am unclear about what this means... Does this mean users will have to login moodle, then in Adobe (with username and password automatically created in Adobe by Moodle)? Right now, I am able to create a meeting from moodle and it shows in Adobe. When I try to connect to a meeting with a new user, the user is created in Adobe Connect and I get to the Adobe Connect page where a login and password is requested. If I enter the same username and password as in Moodle, Adobe replies that I have entered an incorrect username or password. Is this something that can be fixed or is this something that can't be because I am on a hosted Adobe account? I so much wish it can be fixed!!! Thank you in advance for your suppot! Julien",

Could you please confirm that when you go to \"Site Administration -> Users -> Permissions -> Define roles\" that you can see a role with \"adobeconnecthost\" as a short name? Another way to check if this is the root cause of the issue is to set the permission for the ' mod/adobeconnect:meetinghost ' capability to \"Allow\" for a role such as the manager (either in the system context or in the course context by locally overriding the role), and then try creating an activity when logged in as a user with the manager role in the course.",

          "Text": "Hi Luís, There are two parts to this A. Module installation ( https://github.com/number33/moodle-mod_adobeconnect/blob/MOODLE_20_STABLE/db/install.php ) It sounds like the module did not install correctly. Given where it stopped (after the creation of the adobeconnectpresenter role), it sounds like it failed when it tried to set up which standard Moodle roles can assign which Adobe Connect roles. It expected to find the roles with each of the following shortnames: coursecreator, editingteacher, teacher. It's important to have the the module install correctly so that it can set up the three roles correctly. If you are missing one (or all) of the above roles, you could do one of the following: 1. (Temporarily) create the missing roles (coursecreator, editingteacher, teacher), and then re-install the module. 2. Or apply the following patch which will stop the installation from failing if it can't find the aforementioned roles: https://github.com/jamedmondson/moodle-mod_adobeconnect/commit/997b0b52cc680f93c9e8cb9369cfc3bcc4b90cc5 , and then re-install the module. 3. Or manually set up the roles: Role / shortname / set-up Adobe Connect Host / adobeconnecthost / Set \"mod/adobeconnect:meetinghost\" to \"Allow\" (everything else \"Not Set\") Adobe Connect Presenter / adobeconnectpresenter / Set \"mod/adobeconnect:meetingpresenter\" to \"Allow\" (everything else \"Not Set\") Adobe Connect Participant / adobeconnectparticipant /  Set \"mod/adobeconnect:meetingparticipant\" to \"Allow\" (everything else \"Not Set\") Then you would need to set up some of your core roles to be able to assign the newly created roles (the installer sets it up so that editingteacher, teacher, and manager can assign all three of the new Adobe Connect roles. I would suggest adding manager to that list.) B. Password If you can log into Adobe Connect directly with your supplied username and password, but not via the module, there could be a problem with the username or password not being escaped correctly. To test this theory, you could try temporarily changing the password to something simple (8 characters, with only upper, lower and numeric characters, avoiding letters with accents) and see if that works.",

There is a free version which has many limitations and a paid \"Pro\" (Professional) version that includes added features and the ability to host more people at the same time.

I haven't tested this out myself, but if you wanted to you could prevent that capability in the module context.  As the Moodle code displaying those actions (course_get_cm_edit_actions()) checks to see if the user has the capability in the module context.

I would need to allow editing for the AC module in the module context, but not allow it in the course context. And in the course context, I would need to disallow editing only for the AC activity, leaving all other activities/resources editable. My idea of turning off editing on the course view page is an imperfect solution anyway. The ideal would be to have consistency between what happens when the meeting name is edited within the activity (including the verification of duplicate names on the server), and what happens with a simple edit on the course view.  However it appears that one is handled by the module, and one by Moodle core. Perhaps it would be better to have the Moodle activity name and the AC meeting name be two different entities, rather than having one entity that is stored in two different places, thereby risking ambiguity? Cheers, Dominik.",

The only issue I can see is that when I pull up the AC activity, no matter what start and end date I put in it returns a date from 1969. Beyond that when I click \"See server meeting details\" it links with extra characters that won't allow it to get past a login page. Any assistance will be appreciated.",

Last thursday, i upgraded my AC Server to get it updated to the latest release, because in the following weeks an important update is announced about a chrome compatibility. Following all the instructions, the server was updated successfully, but moodle? Good news, the button \"Test Connection\" told me that all was green, and i thought: \"i can clean up all and i can go  home\", but... After some minutes, my phone rang: \"we cannot enter anymore in our moodle-connect rooms !!!\" PANIC! What happens ? The plugin seems to work, but the join-auto-login does not work. Now the happy ending: after 3days of googling/debugging i've discovered that the upgrade has resetted the web.xml configuration file without changing the file-time (!) and without telling me anything about this overwrite. I put again the web.xml as instructed in the moodle-plugin pages, all the things are now fine again. Hope this can help someone that will do the same upgrade. And BTW, thanks for this plugin!",

Just because I used to use Skype before I retired, I have generally kept a version working and available from my github account. If you go read the comments at https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_skype you will see details on how to get a copy. I am currently using it on Moodle 3.2.1+ with no apparent problems, other than one warning about the Update this Skype button being deprecated. The warning can be safely ignored. The plugin is not a graded activity or anything. It just gives you a way of automatically  listing all users in your Moodle site with a Skype ID entered in their profile. On more than one occasion the maintainer has mentioned releasing a new version soon...but nothing yet for a good while.",

          "Text": "Hi King, There may be a conceptual problem here. RecordingsBN is actually a view for the recordings created by BigBlueButtonBN and not a plugin for creating recordings itself. What you need to do is. 1. Add a BigBlueButtonBN activity/room to your course (which you already did) 2. Make sure the option \"session can be recorded\" is enabled for that activity/room. You'll find that option as an advanced setting by clicking the \"show more\" below \"send notification\". If you didn't change anything to the global configuration, this option comes enabled by default. 3. Save the activity/room, use the link that is shown in your course and join the session. 4. Once you are in BBB, make sure to press the button for recording that shows up in the tool bar. The capture will start at that point. 5. Logout from the session and once you are in Moodle again you may want to press the \"End session\" button. It is not required but it will speed things up for you as the recording is being processed until the session is closed in BBB. If any user remains in the session it is kept open. 6. Wait until the recording is processed, depending of the BBB server, the duration of the session, the resources you used it may normally take something between 6 to 30 minutes. (some times more if you are using test-install. This server is heavily used) 7. After that time, just refresh the page where you activity/room is. The recording should show up there. Now on recordingsBN, well, once the recording is visible in BigBlueButtonBN you should be able to see it in the RecordingsBN list. As I said, the former is the source, the last is just a view. Although, in the Activity/Room you will see only the recordings for that specific instance of BigBlueButtonBN, while in RecordingsBN you will see the recordings for all the activities in that course. I hope this helps. Cheers, JF",

This would explain why you don;t see the join button (if that is what you are asking) Those are settings that you change depending what are you trying to accomplish with that particular activity/room. If you are not familiar with any of them, I would recommend you to create a new room and only use the defaults and only set the required parameters (which is the name). Of course if you changed the settings by default in the global configuration that will make things a little harder to guess.",

It seems that you are trying to install BigBlueButtonBN in a server that had BigBlueButtonBN installed before, but it wasn't correctly uninstalled. My guess is that you may need to manually remove from the database the tables: mod_bigbluebuttonbn mod_bigbluebuttonbn_logs And run the installation again. I really hope this is not a production server. Let us know how you do. Cheers, JF",

          "Text": "Hi, I have been running BBB successfully on my Moodle site for over a year, possibly longer; I have been using http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/ . It has been a terrific plugin, and really helpful for me, and for my students. Last week my server 's hard drive failed, and I had to restore from the recent backup that I fortunately had. Since then, all of my previous recordings have vanished, meaning that the entry for the every one of my previous recordings (about 30 of them) says \"There are no recording for this meeting.\" More than that, new recordings that I (thought) I made are producing the same message. The lecture streams just fine, I have online students who see it just fine in realtime, but the lecture is not being recorded. And yes, I did have the \"Session can be recorded\" checkbox checked (that is my default setting for the BBB plugin). I am also aware that the recordings go away after 14 days; however, unless my memory is failing me, I recall that the link to the recording is still visible in the BBB activity; it produces the \"this recording is not available\" only when that link is clicked. For me now, all of those links are gone. I have been testing it tonight, and no recordings are happening. The only error message I have found is in the Chrome developer's console, which said that the html5 server returned a 404 (not found) error. I see nothing in my server's logfiles (I refer to the server files, not the moodle logfiles, or the BBB/RBN logfiles; I don't know where those logfiles are located.) My version of BBB is 2.1.1 (2016051905), RecordingsBN is 1.3.0 (2016051904), Moodle 3.1.2 (build 20161027). My server is OSX Lion, running (among other things) MySQL v5.6.33 and PHP v5.6.27. It's worth saying, maybe, that the hard drive crash/restore may not be relevant; it may only be co-incidental. Can you suggest an approach I can take to diagnose this issue, and hopefully fix it? While it would be great to get my recordings back (the last 14 days, anyway), more important to me is to be able to make new recordings going forward. Thanks in advance! Cheers, Kevin",

We are looking for an alternative virtual classroom that can support this number of simultaneous users (divided over a dozen concurrent  sessions or more). We have been looking at BBB now and again and recently it has started to include the functionality we need (recording, breakout rooms, etc.), so now I wonder if there are any users of BBB out there who have installations of similar or bigger size, so that I can ask them about the hardware infrastructure we would require to set up a server that is sufficiently powerful for our needs. I also have a number of questions about possible functionality (to which I have not yet been able to find the answers on-line): Can one BBB server serve virtual classrooms to two Moodle sites if they are in the same Moodle server? Does the Moodle integration limit BBB sessions to accept only users authenticated via Moodle, or is it also possible to have people from outside of Moodle access the session (acccess via a link)? Will the number of Breakout rooms be flexible (5 seems to few for our class sizes)? Thanks in advance for any information you can share. Rgrds, Paul.",

Yes, it can serve multiple Moodle sites, servers an even other systems (like Wordpress) with no problem. Each session will have its own meetinID therefore users will join the meetings they have access to. Does the Moodle integration limit BBB sessions to accept only users authenticated via Moodle, or is it also possible to have people from outside of Moodle access the session (acccess via a link)? The Moodle integration only allows access through Moodle activities , and only to authenticated users will be able to join. For allowing access through a shared link you would need to tailor an special link. The plugin does not provide that capability. Will the number of Breakout rooms be flexible (5 seems to few for our class sizes)? The number of 5 rooms is fixed and it was defined that way to simplify the UI JF",

The plugin works as you see. Short answer is no. There are no records of access denied in the current version and as this is a functionality that is seldom used I don't think it will be anytime soon.

I'll start the ball rolling with a few comments of my own: BBB  might not be (just yet) as smooth as Google Hangouts or Skype but it is is open source and integrates nicely with Moodle. We used to use Hangouts but found there are (were) limitations on who could participate and they needed a Google account (as you also need a Skype account for Skype) With BBB, as long as you are in the Moodle course then you don't need to sign up for anything else. On the minus side, for the time being, there is no mobile app for BBB but I have every confidence that there will be soon",

Latest Release Our goal with BigBlueButton is to provide remote students a high-quality online learning experience.  We've been working on it for over seven years and the Moodle integration is (by far) our deepest integration of any LMS. BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, polling, emote icons, and desktop.  Classes can be recorded for later playback for students. The latest release (BigBlueButton 1.0) adds Polling Auto reconnect Improved video dock This release marks our 15th release of BigBlueButton (we called it 1.0 because we are conservative ).  Here's a screen shot showing the default layout. BigBlueButton supports many types of collaboration (one-to-one, small group collaboration, and one-to-many).  Here's a screen shot of a session sharing 15 webcams. For more information on the latest release, see http://bigbluebutton.org/2016/05/17/bigbluebutton-1-0-released/ .  To setup BigBlueButton yourself (it's open source!), see http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/ .  For an overview of using BigBlueButton, see http://bigbluebutton.org/videos/ . Latest release of BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle We've recently released BigBlueButtonBN 2.1.1, the BigBlueButton plugin for Moodle, which has the ability to copy recording links from previous courses.  Here are some screen shots of the integration In addition to offering many options for customization, the BigBlueButtonBN plugin gives teachers and students can access recordings from a BigBlueButton session within Moodle. The BigBlueButtonBN integration for Moodle is available from moodle.org, see https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_bigbluebuttonbn .  According to moodle.org there are  currently 3,869 sites using BigBlueButtonBN. We're very pleased to see this adoption around the world (it's localized into over 25 languages). If you want to quickly try the latest version of BigBlueButton, check out Moodle Cloud which has BigBlueButton built-in (up to 6 users and no recordings).  See: https://moodle.com/2015/07/06/moodle-launches-moodlecloud-free-hosting-for-educators /. As always, we welcome your feedback on BigBlueButton and the BigBlueButtonBN integration for Moodle. Regards,... Fred BigBlueButton Product Manager",

I tried sending a message to the maintainer back in July 2014, but he hasn't logged into Moodle since a month before that. The warnings were simple enough that I was able to fix them myself and have them on github at https://github.com/drachels/moodle_skype_activity if anyone wants to try it out.

BBB provides a rich features set and accounts for multiple use cases.  Integration with Moodle is a trivial affair, requiring only the IP of the separate BBB server and the salt to connect.  The activity modules are available via the moodle plugin site and are regularly maintained. NB. BBB requires that it be installed on a separate server to moodle and it cannot be installed on a shared host due to the processing requirements.  Again, refer to the FAQ for minimum requirements. https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/090InstallationUbuntu",

This is observed even after refreshing the page. Furthermore, I had to turn on UI as html : changed from No (unchecked) to Yes (checked) in order to see these recordings.

And the toolbar seems to be broken since the last update, on Moodle 2.9.5+ (Build: 20160317) works with no problems. As you noticed, the best workaround for now is to use the plain html UI. Although the toolbar should work with plain html, it does for me on Moodle 3.0.3+ (Build: 20160317) . A few questions. 1. What version of the BigBlueButtonBN you have? 2. What BigBlueButton server are you using? test-install? your own? a hosted server? Depending of the BBB server you are using the actions over recordings can take a few seconds to be processed (up to 10), but you should see a spinning wheel while the request is processed. 3. If you clean caches both in Moodle and your browser, do you still see the problem? 4. If you activate the developer console in your browser (Chrome or Firefox F12) do you see any error message coming? 5. Can you confirm out of moodle if the actions on recordings can be performed? Or, what about in BigBlueButtonBN, can you perform actions to the recordings there? JF",

You are saying that: - You have Moodle 3.0, BigBlueButtonBN 2.0.4 and RecordingsBN 1.2.1, right? - You have your own dedicated BigBlueButton server. You tested recordings by creating a meeting outside Moodle and then fetching the recordings also outside of Moodle and you confirmed that the recording is there, right? What did you use, apimate or the demos included as part of BBB? - You have a BigBluebuttonBN activity in one course that is configured to be recorded, you joined the session and pressed the button for recordings, you spent some time there and then left the session. Right? When you go back to the BigBlueButtonBN activity after a few minutes you give for the recording to be processed, does the recording appear at the bottom of that BigBlueButtonBN activity? - If all this works, then you added a RecordingsBN resource to the same course and the recording is not showing up there? Only the message that says that \"there are no recordings to show\", right?",

In fact, to make things simpler try suing the BBB server that comes by default and once you have your Moodle plugins configuration correct switch to your own BBB server. http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/ 8cd8ef52e8e101574e400365b55e11a6 So, lets get back to Moodle/BigBlueButtonBN. I am still not clear on whether BigBlueButtonBN works fine for you or not. So lets go back to point 4. 4) Configuration of these plugins with certain parameters Please forget recordingsBN, only install BigBlueButtonBN for the moment. And don't change any of the configuration parameters that come by default (no yet). 5) Creation of the meeting directly on the BBB We'll skip this step because you are going to use test-install 6) Insert on the Moodle course the learning objects BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN Add a BigBlueButtonBN activity in any of your courses. Again, don't change anything. Use only the parameters by default. It should work fine. Now, 7) Use the activity, join the session, start the recording, spend some seconds or minutes in the session and end it from the Moodle tab by pressing the end session button. Wait for a few minutes (15 minutes if needed) and then go back to the activity. Is there something showing up at the bottom of the page, right after the description of the bigbluebuttonbn activity?",

          "Text": "Hello, moodlers. We have some problem. We have a good working moodle 2.7 on IIS7  with WinServ 2008 R2. We want to integrate some webconference system like BBB or OpenMeetings, but we have some question because both physical servers (web- server IIS with Moodle and BBB) were behind proxy-server with one external static ip. We made rule that look like: Source - Internet interface, Appointment - our external ip, Service - Http, Destination - 192.168.1.3:80 ( local ip that web-server IIS with Moodle). Also on proxy-server we wrote in hosts table: IP-adress - 192.168.1.3:80 and hosts name - our website Moodle domain (2nd level like moodle.learn.com) Also we installed to another computer BBB on linux server (192.168.1.4), that works (i suppose) well, but only in local network What must we do that BBB became available from internet? (If we have one external ip and proxy-server) Likewise we installed OpenMeetings on server with Moodle 2.7 (WinServ 2008 R2), but we have the same problem too (no available from internet). Also I think that we need to configuring IIS for using OM on this domain with port 5088, but we don't know how maybe forwarding requests? I hope we help us, even if it will be any thoughts or principles. P.S. Sorry, if i wrote my message on wrong forum",

[Background Information] I've installed the 2.0.1 BigBlueButton plugin on our Moodle server (Moodle 2.8.0), the BigBlueButton server version is build 264. [Issues] 1. Some of the BigBlueButton plugin configurations are not working: (1). The default setting for \"Session can be recorded\" is not working In our university, we encourage teachers to record their online lectures. I've enabled the \"Recording feature enabled by default\" on the configuration page, as the screenshot shows below. But if I create a new BigBlueButton activity in Moodle, the \"Session can be recorded\" option is default not ticked. What we want is set the \"Session can be recorded\" enabled by default. So that teachers don't have to tick the \"Session can be recorded\" option every time. The Following screenshot shows the default settings for a new created BigBlueButton activity: (2) The default setting for \"wait for Moderator\" is not working I've set the \"Wait for moderator enabled by default\" to \"NO\",  so students can get into the virtual classroom in advance. But I found the configuration is not working.  On the BigBlueButton activity setting page, the \"Wait for moderator\" option is still ticked by default. Following screenshot shows the configuration setting: 2. The present content function is not working On the BigBlueButton activity setting edit page, I've uploaded a PPT file as the presentation content. So this PPT should be displayed in the presentation area inside the virtual class. But when I join the session, it is still the default PDF. Best wishes, Lina",

I also think that the price is one thing, but what about functionnality, user interface? Are tools available in several languages (if needed)?

Modifying the client in such way brings an extra complexity therefore I don't think we are going to see it happening anytime soon. You can see that is part of the roadmap http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/road-map.html#whiteboard but it certainly doesn't have the highest priority in the queue right now. The best place to rise this kind of questions is always in the bigbluebutton forums. For end users in this case. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-users You can also contact any of the companies listed for commercial support http://bigbluebutton.org/commercial-support/ Regards, JF",

It appears that their Adobe rep has suggested they leave this field blank, but the test connection fails and when trying to add it as an activity, the whole site just hangs forever. This is what they sent to me: HTTP Authentication Header - This value can be found in your custom.ini file for your Adobe Connect Pro server . In the custom.ini file look for the line that begins with HTTP_AUTH_HEADER, enter in the value after the equal sign. Example if your custom.ini file has the line HTTP_AUTH_HEADER=rl-user-id, then only use rl-user-id in the module global setting. leave it blank Does anyone out there have any advice? Thanks! Erin",

I've been reading this information about OpenMeetings Installation but I've got some doubts: 1.- My Moodle is installed in a remote server (Linux Machine) so I suppose that the database is listening and allowing TCP/IP connections. 2.- Open Office service must be installed on the remote server too? 3.- Do I have to install ImageMagick, gosthScript, SWFTools on the reomote server too? 4.- After doing all these steps, How could I try Openmeetings on my remote server? 5.- Finally, Do I have to install Moodle plugins by putting the folders into Moodle /mods directory? Thanks a lot for helping me!!. Cheers. Susana. Requirements full-list ) It is recommended to make/use an empty database/scheme Database available ( MySQL , Postgres ,... MSSQL , Oracle ,DB2 see Database MUST listen and allow TCP/IP connections! And the default character-set/scheme must be UTF8! For example a fresh My SQL does not listen on TCP/IP by default and has not utf8 as default-character-set defined. You have to change these settings and restart your database server so that changes take effect (mysql-config is in my.cnf). Postgres for example does also not listen by default on TCP/IP but uses by default UTF8 (since postgres 7 or 8). To change Postgres listening on TCP/IP check postgresql .conf and add your host to the pg_hba.conf. In Postgres you need to create a database using template1 cause template1 create automatically a scheme called public which is needed (and since postgres 8 you can use several schemes inside one database public is the default one Postgres-Docs ). OpenOffice-Service started and listening on port 8100 (see OpenOfficeConverter , this is not necessary for installation but for running later on) Installed ImageMagick (this is not necessary for installation but for running later on), you can get more information on http://www.imagemagick.org regarding installation. The instructions for installation can be found there http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php , however on most linux systems you can get it via your favorite package managers (apt-get it) Installed GhostScript (this is not necessary for installation but for running later on), you can get more information on http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ regarding installation. The instructions for installation can be found there, however on most linux systems you can get it via your favorite package managers (apt-get it).

Just follow the Installation Guide and it will lead you to the login Page. *5.- Finally, Do I have to install Moodle plugins by putting the folders into Moodle /mods directory?* => yes you need to install the Moodle Modules liek any other Moodle Plugin. sebastian",

What we are looking for is something which can be used for both one to one and group web / video conferencing.  We would also require the meeting to be recorded and chat logs kept.   We are currently in the process of moving to Moodle 2.4 so that is the version we would be using this plugin for. I have looked at both and am impressed by BigBlueButtons recording capabilitites but have recently seen OpenMeetings mentioned quite a bit on the Forums so I suppose what I am looking for is a comparasion of the two and some opinions of people who currenty use either plugin.

          "Title": "Ynt: BigBlueButton vs OpenMeetings",
          "Text": "Hi, having used both bigbluebutton (bbb)0.81-beta and open meetings(om) version 2.0 in real time online courses I think I have some experiences on both of them. First of all, afaik, om has plugin only for 2.2 verion of moodle; correct me if I'm wrong. The moodle plugin of om for 2.2 version migth work in moodle 2.4, but I haven't tried it personally. Finally, the followings and comments might contain some invalid information especially due to the versions of the both video conferencing tools and my personal lack of knowledge. So please feel free to correct the areas you see any incorrect information. You can give a trial shot for bbb here and om here . Anyway, here are the areas I'll compare them: 1- Chat module: In bbb chat module is vertically placed on the right by defaults, which give you the opportunity to view nearly all the messages from the participants. In om, however, it is placed horizontally in a rectangular box just beneath the whiteboard in which you can see the very few messages from the participants even if you hide the admin panel Prior to 0.81 version, bbb was showing certain characters of the participants' names (such as Grah.. instead of full name Graham Stone). But in 0.81 beta version this was corrected and full name of the participants can be seen. Again prior to 0.81 version of bbb, you could change the font color of your messages. This was a very good feature especially in discriminating the messages. However, in 0.81 version you have only one color: black. I believe this will be corrected since 0.81 version is still in beta In bbb there is also a private message area in which you can send private messages to the users similar to adobe connect. I say similar because in adobe connect the teacher is informed if a participant sends a private message to the other. In bbb, teacher is not informed if any of the users are privately chatting unless the recipient is the teacher himself. In om, afaik there is not a private chat feature available. 2- Users block: In om, users are given more permissions such as turning on their mic even if you disable them to avoid echo. bbb is more aggressive than om in this aspect: Once the moderator logs in and set turn off all mics, every new comer enters the conference as their mics off. This is a good feature to avoid echo since every user does not use a headset with mic. And in om, if you choose webinar as conference type, the mics can be bulk turned off. But this time, if you want to allow a participant to speak, you have to first click on the user's name then click again to turn on his/her mic, which requires a double click to turn on and double click to turn off. This might cause problems if you have a crowded class. 3- Tools: The tools in om is undoubtedly richer than the ones in bbb; especially the icons and type tool. In bbb 0.81 beta version type tool is added, through which you can type on the whiteboard. However, the typed items cannot be dragged to another place as it can be done in om. In om you have one useful too, which is polls, through which you can create polls (let's say questions) and ask the participants to make their choices when they are ready. At the end of the voting session a pie chart is shown. 4- Uploaded materials: The materials uploaded by the teacher in om remains in teacher's account even if s/he logs out the conference and backs to moodle. In bbb, however, once the teacher logs out and logs in again, s/he has to upload the materials again to use them. In om, you can have more than one whiteboards whereas is in bbb you can use only one whiteboard. 5- Recording: In om, you can record the session with the editing tools. I mean if you draw something on the whiteboard, it is recorded as well. However, in bbb the things that you draw on the whiteboard is not shown in the recording; only the slides and the voice of the teacher. I think this is because of the format of the recording. The slides are saved as .swf files and audio as .vaw. And they are saved separately. Another point to consider is if you have sessions one after another, you should think about the recording process one more time. I mean while the recording of the older session takes place, another live session will tried to be handled by the server : How a powerful server you have, you should think about the server load. In om, you can also define which areas of the screen to record. By this way you can record let's say the video view of the teacher. In bbb, however, only the whiteboard and chat module is recorded. As a solution, you can think about using a screen capture program. Besides commercial ones if you have a Ubuntu machine you should give a try to kazaam , which gives very good quality output with a small file size. 6- Installation: You can install both moodle and om on the same server since om runs on port 5080 while moodle runs on port 80. But personally I do not recommend running the lms and video conferencing tool on the same server, especially for production sites with large amount of participants. But if you have a small number of participants and budget, this can be considered. Although there are some attempts to run bbb on a different port apart from 80, (personally I tried it too) it stopped working after a successful 30 seconds runtime. BBB developer Fred Dixon is very decisive on this matter; bbb requires a dedicated server and has to be run on port 80 (see here ). From a technical aspect, from the outputs of our bbb server, I can say that bbb heavily relies on the processor rather than RAM of the server. You can install bbb on a Ubuntu 10.04 server easily, and you might have problems if you want to install it on a 12.04 Ubuntu server. See here for installation instructions. You can install om on Ubuntu 12.04 and even on Ubuntu 12.10 server. See here for installation instructions 7- Layout: bbb 0.81 beta version is added a new feature through which you can change the layout automatically with one click. The options are video chat, meeting, webinar, lecture assistant and lecture. You can use om more than a web conferencing tool. I mean you can create different sessions, calendar events, user account assignments through the om portal itself. In bbb, you do not have much choice but just using video conferencing features. Conclusion: Since we have been using moodle 2.5 and horizontal chat module is extremely important for us (we are using it in a language course and we frequently ask participants to share their replies/comments with us) we went back to using bbb. One more thing to add is that, personally I think, the speed of these videoconferencing tools mostly depends on the bandwidth of the server and the participants' rather than the architecture on which they are built.

We noticed that the welcome message in the chat was getting lost, so we assigned it the color blue to make it stand out.  To simplify the UI for the chat, we removed the ability for the user to send out messages in different colors (we were almost sure no one would notice that we removed it . > However, the typed items cannot be dragged to another place That's correct.  We'll add the ability to drag around whiteboard items in a future release. > However, in bbb the things that you draw on the whiteboard is not shown in the recording In version 0.81-beta-2 (which is getting close to a final release), BigBlueButton records all activity in the presentation area, webcams, audio, chat, and desktop sharing for playback. You can see an example of the recording capabilities in 0.81 here: http://goo.gl/p8psx You need to use FireFox or Chrome to view the recording as we us only non-patent encumbered codecs for playback (VP8 and Theora). > You can install bbb on a Ubuntu 10.04 server easily, and you might have problems if you want to install it on a 12.04 Ubuntu server. We recommend you install BigBlueButton 0.81 on Ubuntu 10.04.  We'll support Ubuntu 12.04 in a future version. Thanks Mesut for sharing your experiences about BigBlueButton! Regards,..

However this does not happen. BBB-forums state that \"Bigbluebutton JOIN call should be modified in the integrated system which is Moodle, what is called a Custom URL \" Any ideas which file in the moodle module needs to be modified to change the join call from http:// to bigbluebutton:// It seems that all join calls originating as bigbluebutton:// can be handled by the BBB-Android app, however there is no specific documentation statting how this can be customized from within Moodle.

          "Text": "We are pleased to announce the release of BigBlueButton 0.9.0, our twelfth release to date.  BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning with deep integration with Moodle. Our goals of this release were to improve the overall quality of audio, give Teachers more control over the recordings, and increase the likelihood that users enter with a functioning microphone. Features in this release include: improved audio using web real-time communication (WebRTC) support in FireFox and Chrome web browsers, teachers can now choose which segments of their class are recorded using the Start/Stop Record button, and users now test their microphone before joining the audio bridge and can also join in Listen Only mode We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience. This release is a significant step towards that goal. You’ll find detailed information on this release — including detailed overview, installation instructions (Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit), configuration, development instructions, and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) at our new documentation web site http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/ . The BigBlueButton client is localized in over 30 languages.  This localization effort is done entirely by our community. The BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN Moodle plug-ins (maintained by Blindside Networks) has been downloaded over 100k times in the last 12 months. See: https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=2 . For short tutorial videos on using BigBlueButton see http://bigbluebutton.org/videos . We are very proud of this release and wish to thank all the members of the Moodle community who gave us feedback.  We look forward to seeing educational institutions, commercial companies, and the BigBlueButton community at-large build upon this new release to delivery a high-quality on-line learning experience to remote students.

The directory structure does not show up at all (the box just remains completely empty - see screenshot attached). When I click upload , the \"select file\" windows opens, however, after clicking \"start upload\" nothing happens (the window just sits there).

When I create an activity for a BBB recording it records the session as I can see this in the Genericconf logs. However when I have created the BBBrecordings resource and click on it there is no recording, it is completely blank. Yet, when I use the Blindside networks test server I can see the recording correctly. I am helping a client out who is on a budget here in Australia. I am only a novice user of Moodle so any hope or pointers of how to get things behaving would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

If you are running a BBB 0.9, sometimes the users forget to push the recording button (even though the meeting was set to be recorded, the user must push the button to really start recording). Or for any versions, sometimes the recording was not processed for some reason. I would recommend you to do a direct request to the BBB server by using api-mate http://mconf.github.io/api-mate/ (or ask to your system administrator to do so) You can query all the recordings and look for the one you need by title, or if the recordings are too many then you need the internal meeting ID and query for recordings in that specific meetingID. Let us know your findings",

          "Text": "Hi Tina, Not necessarily. And I am afraid you need to have a good understanding of how the recordings are managed in the BBB server. Are you doing the getRecording request for the specific meeting you are looking for? The BigBluebuttonBN plugin will show you only the recordings related to the BigBlueButtonBN activities in the course it is. If there are recordings in the BBB server from other courses you will see them by using the getRecordings command, but they don't necessarily belong to the course where you have the recordingsBN instance. You need to execute the query for the specific meetingID you are looking for. You can see that ID if you launch into a session from your moodle and while you are in you run a getMeetings command using apimate Take that ID and use it to recover the recordings. If after the recording is made you have recordings in the recordings element, so all is good. NExt thing to look at is the connectivity between your Moodle server and the BBB server The response is always an XML file like this <response><returncode>SUCCESS</returncode><recordings/><messageKey>noRecordings</messageKey><message>There are not recordings for the meetings</message></response> If there is success and no recordings. Well there are just no recordings. If there is success and there are recordings, in the element recordings you should see something like this for each recording in that server: \n```text\n<recording>\n   <recordID>26961dd06cd95364e5fc58cdb3e69837609b59ee-1414094627549</recordID>\n   <meetingID>3c9da89e522728730c41bd16c82624d4-2-1</meetingID>\n   <name>BBB Test</name>\n   <published>true</published>\n   <startTime>1414094627000</startTime>\n   <endTime>1414095020000</endTime>\n   <\nmetadata\n>\n      <originservername>192.168.22.147</originservername>\n      <contextactivitydescription>Test</contextactivitydescription>\n      <contextactivity>BBB Test</contextactivity>\n      <origin>Moodle</origin>\n      <recording>true</recording>\n      <\ncontext\n>English 101</context>\n      <originversion>2.7 (Build: 20140512)</originversion>\n      <originservercommonname />\n      <origintag>moodle-mod_bigbluebuttonbn (2014101002)</origintag>\n   </metadata>\n   <playback>\n      <format>\n         <type>presentation</type>\n         <url>http://ANYURL/presentation</url>\n         <length>7</length>\n      </format>\n   </playback>\n</recording>\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n You are looking for the recording for an specific meetingID that belongs to the activity you created in your moodle <meetingID>3c9da89e522728730c41bd16c82624d4-2-1</meetingID>",

Something worth noting: I haven't yet seen a media- server based web conferencing platform that is not paid. Many offer fremium pricing (free for smaller numbers of participants and restricted features/options, e.g. https://www.meetingburner.com/ ) but if you want to use them professionally, you normally have to pay. Case in point, BigBlueButton http://bigbluebutton.org/ software is indeed free and open source so you can download it and install it on your own media server. If you have the expertise and the time to do this and manage it yourself, that's great and you can save yourself some money. However, for most people, this isn't an option so they're looking at a hosting service or commercial support of some kind, i.e. http://bigbluebutton.org/commercial-support/ There's also more options to add to the list: https://moodle.org/plugins/view/mod_openmeetings https://moodle.org/plugins/view/mod_netucate (German) https://moodle.org/plugins/view/mod_videoconsultation https://moodle.org/plugins/view/mod_webinar (Adobe Connect) There may be more, so it's worth checking the Moodle plugins database for webinar service integration modules: https://moodle.org/plugins/index.php I hope this helps!",

For the Plugin to work you need to disable this feature. This works at the moment. According to Adobe they will enforce this in the future: \" Make sure to update such integrations with session identifier after\nlogging in and use secured Web Services APIs so that the integrations\nkeep working after this option is removed in the near future and\nenhanced security is enabled by default.\" So I guess the plugin will have to be updated to be able to use the secured Web Services APIs. Would be nice to have SSO enabled for Hosted solution like they have for the Webinar Plugin. W",

We hold fairly large sessions of 40-60 users which doesn't seem to be supported by the 'free' options. Of the solutions that I investigated, I really preferred Adobe Connect Pro. I found it to be very flexible and intuitive. I seemed to be a good fit for the Moodle philosophy as well. I also found a reseller that does a Moodle-Adobe integration. I can provide their information if people are interested. We are planning to purchase a single license and and do a 'test run' before we fully commit to an operation-wide switch. Adobe is also releasing an updated version of Connect within the week. I sat in on a webinar that showed off some of the new features and I was very impressed. It really is worth a look.",

          "Text": "Hello Jagdeep I am wondering if there is many to many Video/Audio Discussion in Wiz IQ Also you asked what features we would want that Adobe has and WizIq does not If I understand correctly there is 2 way point to point communicationby Cam and perhaps one or two mic's but not many to many video and audio simultanous connections (Please correct me if this is not correct) That is HUGE for my purposes-- I want the natural interaction where they see and hear one another! Also Adobe charges $50 for hosting that offers up to 9 rooms and 100 simultaneous connections (total) at any time, unlimited meetings of unlimited length and as many recordings as we want/ (I understand that most smaller companies may not be able to compete with this price given these terms and bandwidth considerations of allowing this much stuff to be unlimited) This makes a rather big difference in terms of what is offered for our students On a feature level the biggest plus for my purposes is Adobe's break out rooms. Elluminate also has these but is much more expensive. These rooms mean that can have trainings and teach about and demonstrate processes for our students and then have them go do them with one another in groups of 3....just as we would in our live seminars We can watch what is happening in any of the groups. We can send reminders of how much time remains to all the groups For process oriented trainings this is a huge factor. There are a lot of other perks in Adobe but these are things that make the difference for the kind of full group interaction I want to offer Best Renee",

It is now free of charge, but I am not sure if it will remain so for much longer as I cannot imagine such product staying free. The platform has just launched recently, which may explain why it has not gained more popularity. The company is based in Silicon Valley in America, I expect them to gain more popularity soon as Rukuku is so easy to use, and just looks beautiful. I love the name too! I think their web conferencing is amazing, and it is all free, and so is all other functionality. I tried their built-in interactive many-to-many whiteboard (Mediaboard) - it is great for group writing and editing images. They also offer a chat and all teaching materials are organized in a forum called Courseline - separate for each course. I found it convenient because the discussion in the Courseline is structured and focused on particular pieces of content in your course. The company recently announced on their Facebook page that they will offer an iPad application in a few days too. All in all, www.rukuku.com is an amazing (and beautifully designed) alternative to the outdated flash-based Adobe Connect or the clunky WizIQ. It is kind of like a very cool version of Google Hangouts specifically designed for training and education. However, some small functions you would find in Adobe Connect Pro are not there yet, e.g. no raising hands or polls. I could not find screen sharing either. What I loved was their integrated course authoring suite called Composer - it is possible to create courses very quickly, and even sell your courses on the built-in Marketplace. I haven't tried creating a full course yet. There are not so many courses there now, but the number of courses is growing every week. I use rukuku.com for tutoring once a week, and I absolutely love it!",

Even with the setting ticked for \"Students must wait for moderator to join\", the students remaining logged in keeps the webinar going.

Any moderator can kick any viewer out of a session.  To kick a viewer, move your mouse over their name in the Users window.  You'll see a row of icons appear next to their name -- click the 'x' icon to kick them out of the session. Once all users have been kicked out (or have logged out) and there are no more active users, the recording of the session will stop and the BigBlueButton server will process the recording to create the playback. If you are going to record your sessions, you may also wish to put a time limit in the sessions.  Make sure you give yourself lots of extra time to account for students how join early.  For example, if you have a three hours class, you may set the maximum duration for the session to 4 hours (320 minutes). This ensures that even if students linger, once the server hits 320 minutes, it will end the session for you. Regards,... Fred -- BigBlueButton Developer",

          "Text": "By design the session runs until the last user left the meeting. The way a moderator can manage to kick all the users at once is to terminate the meeting manually or automatically. And this must be done by using the third part application, in this case Moodle. Manually: When the BigBlueButtonBN activity has been set for opening the session in the same tab, and after the Moderator/Teacher logs out from BBB the user is sent back to Moodle. The page where the user lands shows a list of the BigBlueButtonBN activities for the course with an End button at the end. If you click that button, an end command will be sent to BBB meaning that the meeting is terminated and all the users kicked out. Automatically: You can also set up a duration for the meeting. This feature was included for 0.8x to prevent recordings to last forever when one or more users (typically students) let the session open. If you decide to use this feature be aware that there is no way to change the duration once the meeting has been created, and if the meeting was created (meaning that some one get into the meeting) before the time it was scheduled, the meeting could end before the session was intended to end. To play safe, give the session about 15 minutes before and 15 after the planned time. If the meeting was supposed to be from 10:00 am to 11:00am, give to the duration 90 minutes. So the teacher can join the session 15 minutes before hand and left a little later if needed. Jesus Federico",

          "Title": "BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta Released",
          "Text": "We (the core developers of BigBlueButton) are pleased to announce the availability of BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta .  Our goals for this release were to give Teachers more control over the recording during the class, to improve the overall quality of audio, and to increase the likelihood that users enter with a functioning microphone. To achieve these goals, we implemented the following major new features: Start/Stop Button for Recording -- Moderators can now mark segments of the class for later playback. Improved Audio -- BigBlueButton now takes advantage of the web real-time communications (WebRTC) framework built into FireFox and Chrome to give users higher quality, lower latency audio. Microphone Check -- BigBlueButton now gives every user a chance to check their microphone before entering the session, ensuring when they enter the session they are ready to participate. Listen Only Mode -- Users without a microphone can join audio in 'Listen Only' mode. In this mode, BigBlueButton displays a speaker icon next to their name letting everyone know they can hear (but not speak). Here are some screen shots of the new Start/Stop button for managing the recording of the session. Here is a screen shot of the new audio chooser. We have three new videos for this release. A video showing how to connect, configure, and test your microphone with BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta. A video showing how to use BigBlueButton as a student. A video showing how to present a lecture with BigBlueButton and moderate others. We wish to thank the following organizations for their contributions towards this release: Blindside Networks -- Core development, documentation, QA, and release management Seneca College -- Client development Mconf -- Listen Only audio iMDT -- Lock Settings SpeakServe -- Client development HostBBB -- Testing We wish to thank the BigBlueButton Committers for this release: Richard Alam - Lead Architect Felipe Cecagno - Client Fred Dixon - Project Manager Tiago Jacobs - red5 Chad Pilkey - Client Gustavo Salazar - Server We also wish to thank the members of the BigBlueButton community that helped localize this version.  At the time of this post, we have over 95% of the language strings localized for Albanian, Armenian, Bulgarian, Estonian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Welsh. We have been developing BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta for almost eleven months.  Our demo server has been running builds of 0.9.0-beta for the past two months.  In addition, our developer community has been using and giving feedback on BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta for over six weeks.  The core of the product is looking solid. We're now working on finishing the localization, documentation, accessibility , and documentation in preparation for the release of 0.9.0 (it will be our twelfth release). If you are an administrator of a Moodle server looking for a synchronous, web-conferencing system designed for on-line learning, we encourage you to try out BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta.  You'll find the new WebRTC-based audio a big improvement.  Technically, it's 48 Khz audio encoded in OPUS transmitted in UDP.  From the user's perspective, it just sounds great. The Moodle plugins for BigBlueButton (BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN) have been actively developed and maintained for over four years now.  They have been tested and updated for use with Moodle 2.7.2 (see BigBlueButton Moodle plugins ).   The plugins come pre-configured with a test-server running BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta so you can try it out right away . In the BigBlueButton project we believe that every student with a web browser should have access to a high quality, on-line learning experience. For more information on this release, see: Detailed Overview - A detailed breakdown of the new major and minor features in BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta Installation Instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit -  Step-by-step instructions to install BigBlueButton 0.9.0-beta on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Warm Regards,...

I have defined url and security key successfully on the plugin. After scheduling a session and want to reach the class, internal server error appears. It seems that this error happens on the moodle side since the url of the page indicating error shows it exists in moodle and ends by \"/mod/bigbluebuttonbn/view.php?id=3702\", for instance. I searched in your previouse suggestion on the same issue and tried blindsidenetwork test server. I got the same error by using http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/ as url and 8cd8ef52e8e101574e400365b55e11a6 as the security key. Before that, I had used bbb version 0.81 successfully on the same both servers with the same configuration. just the moodle was on version 2.7 I wonder if the plugin has compatibility issue with moodle 2.7.2 or anything else. Your guidance is highly appreciated. Thanks,",

Most of the time our server is in use it has between 30-70 concurrent users. We maxed it out at 124 - once. It worked, but I did notice some mildly degraded audio, especially in the recording. Based on monitoring, we believe that was more a function of running into bandwidth limits (on our client side) rather than pushing the server to any sort of limits. We have a fully virtualized infrastructure - for production systems we make sure we slightly under-provision the underlying hardware. Our BBB installation is running with 8 cores (the underlying system is 2.3GH Xeons) and 16GB of RAM. The filesystem is running on a flash-based subsystem.",

You can use the default values and create/use meetings as it is shown in the video included in the plugin page https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_bigbluebuttonbn Just keep in mind that your Moodle server needs to be able to communicate with the bigbluebutton server using CURL. The first call the plugin makes is to validate the BBB version parsing the xml response that you usually get from here http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/api/ Also, as always, the more information you provide (specially versions you are using, settings you have and steps you followed), the easier for anyone to help you out.

By chance, are you missing the protocol in the url? >url setting like this: \" 10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/\" It should be http://10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/ , if that is the url you use to access to your BBB server, which by the way, assuming you have a n standard and complete installation, it should show you the demo page. Also, if you test this URL in your browser http://10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/api/ do you get the same XMl you got from the test-install server? You should. If you don't so your BBB server is broken. And finally, did you replace the salt (AKA shared secret) by default with the one used by your server? The one that comes by default only works for test-install, at least you replace the salt in your BBB server. By the way, the XML response you got in the browser has nothing to do with the response your Moodle server should get. That only means that your client computer can communicate with the BBB server, but doesn't mean the Moodle server can. JF",

The first thing you want to try is of course to make sure that the target BBB server is working fine using the demo page installed by default. When you are trying to make the plugin to work for the very first time, we recommend testing with the configuration by default. If that works you can discard a bunch of things. If these two conditions are fulfilled, then you can proceed with changing the URL and SALT. Now, if after these three steps you still have problems, the first thing I would check is communication between servers. Making a wget call from the Moodle server to the BBB server can give you a good idea about what can be possible wrong. \n```text\nwget -O - \nhttp://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/api\n```",

          "Text": "Is someone (or some organization) inflating the downloads to the web conferencing plugins in the Moodle plugin database to gain a higher ranking? Check out the chart for top 20 downloaded plugins for 2013 ( link ).  Screen shot below. Notice that BigBlueButtonBN checked in at a respectable #13 overall with 52,982 downloads. Nice.  As one of the developers of BigBlueButton, and the co-author of the BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN plugins, it's very satisfying to see our efforts to build an open source web conferencing system benefiting so many in the Moodle community. I've pasted below the chart for top plugin downloads over past 2 months (March 2014 and April 2014). Notice anything odd? The plugins for AMVONET Room, WebEx Meetings, and OpenMeetings -- all web conferencing plugins, and all with impressive download numbers. On the surface, it looks like these three plugins had many thousands of Moodle sites installing them in the last two months. But looking at both charts together, something doesn't look right. Fortunately, moodle.org also tracks the downloads for the past 12 months, which lets us look below the surface to the underlying data and trends for both 2013 and 2014. OpenMeetings Here's a snapshot of the monthly downloads for the past 12 months. Downloads: March 2014: 2,928 April 2014: 16,836 An increase of 575 % AMVONET Again, here are the monthly downloads for the past 12 months. Downloads: March 2014: 142 April 2014: 18,627 An increase of 13,117 % WebEx Source: monthly downloads webex Downloads: March 2014: 124 April 2014: 17,376 An increase of 14,012 %. I'm curious what others think of these numbers? My bet is that someone wanted to inflate the numbers for one of these plugins and, to make the inflated numbers look less obvious, they inflated the numbers of other web conferencing plugins to try and mask the increase. It would be great if someone from MoodleHQ could take a look at the weblogs logs for any unusual download activity. Regards,... Fred -- BigBlueButton Developer",

Normaly I could see in the past arround 2,000 or max. 3,000 downloads of a new om moodle plugin. But in the middle of april the number of downloads increased from one day to another of more than 15,000 per month. At first I looked at the charts of moodle.org like you. Then I thought there could be an article about different web conference systems and how they work with moodle somewhere in the internet. But I could not find any comparison like this. Maybe it was done with a script. I tell you: It was not me . Greetings, Michael",

I tried posting on the plugin page as well sending to the developer himself but no responses. 1. The email that gets sent to participants that I enroll in a webinar (I am the teacher / admin) includes a link to join the webinar. If the person is not already logged into Moodle, once they do login they get this error \"Must specify a course module or a webinar ID\". They then can self-navigate to the course and webinar but the link could be improved. 2. The timing of my webinars is always off by one hour. I 'add session' and set the time but when I save it, the next screen that shows the summary of my sessions is 1 hour early. Both my moodle and AC time zones are set to UTC - 5 (East Coast US - NY). I don't know if the issue is related to daylight savings and if so, how to fix it. Screenshots attached. 3. If I try to edit a session I've already created, under \"Host\" it says \"Select a host \" but there are no names to select. Thus I can't save changes because the Host field is mandatory. Thanks!",

After several years and various solutions we're waiting for BigBlueButton to reach 0.8. I really believe that BigBlueButton is the best cost effective solution. If you have the money and infrastructure for an on-site version of Adobe Connect then I hear the integrations with Moodle are pretty good, but it's not a good solution if you don't have a dedicated installation of Connect under the control of the same group that runs your LMS. BigBlueButton meets almost all of our needs right now, but for us to really commit to it we need recording and playback, which should drop in the next few weeks. At that point we'll re-evaluate moving completely over to an integrated installation of BigBlueButton. Right now we make due with a mix of a few other solutions and upload the recordings after the fact to our instance of Kaltura CE.",

I did not contribute earlier, because our classroom solution is not open-source. After Blackboard acquired Elluminate some years ago, the famous Moodle bridge plugin disappeared from Moodle Docs Plugin directory. The Elluminate trainer community did wait in vain, how Blackboard, (who is vendor of a commercial LMS also) will handle Elluminate´s Moodle connectivity in the future. Here are the good news: Blackboard did continue to integrate the famous Elluminate engine, now named \"Collaborate Web Conferencing\" with many LMS (especially all those supporting the LTI standard). Collaborate´s user interface is improved from Elluminate´s plane cockpit GUI, The Java -based engine is still the same and does include audio-enabled breakout-rooms as usual However, recording and playback of actions happening in several breakout rooms might be difficult to handle, several independant audio streams in parallel. It might be a better idea to define several rooms and let participant change the room for group work. This enables you to record each room independantly. Collaborate has a flatrate-like license model limiting the number of seats, but not number of rooms driven in parallel. The dedicated Collaborate-Moodle Integation is currently certified for Moodle up to 2.5x . I´m driving the Collaborate plugin v3.1 on my Moodle 2.6 - without glitches up to now. Please note, that Collaborate´s Moodle plugin is distributed by vendor only and therefore not listed in the Moodle Docs plugin directory. I currently consider this as a conceptual bug of the Moodle Docs site disallowing any documentation about plugins not being distributed there.",

          "Text": "I have just started looking into web conferencing. I have used elluminate. It's expensive but it works. I am interested in trying out the BigBlueButton . ( http://bigbluebutton.org/ ) It looks like it has most of the functions that I would need. I never really liked the record features of elluminate simply because I never really wanted to watch long meetings again. However, If you invest $299 in Camtasia studio ( http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/ ), you can record meetings and then cut out the fluff later. There are some free alternative desktop recording options, but Camtasia is, by far, the best out there. I actually use Camtasia a lot to create training videos and lectures. It would be nice if a web-conferencing programs also allowed the recording and editing features that you find in Camtasia. I have also used Camtasia to record someone else's elluminate meeting. It was a good thing since they forgot to hit record at first and then later realized their voice wasn't being recorded. As of this reply, BigBlueButton was still working out some kinks on their whiteboard feature. However, a good, free whiteboard application/website is scribblar.com . ( http://www.scribblar.com/ ) It allows you to create multiple rooms and each room allows multiple pages. It even allows file sharing and pdf uploads of 5 pages. I have used scribblar for lecture rooms in moodle as well as tutoring rooms. I love the fact that you just have to put a link to the room in the moodle course for others to access the whiteboard. It also allows you to lock the room so that others cannot change or delete things if you have a lesson set up or something. It doesn't have a record feature, but again you can use Camtasia to record a session and post it to YouTube or something later. So, my recommendation would be to use 3 programs: BigBlueButton - although I have only seen demos at this point (But it does have a moodle module.) Scribblar - Easy, powerful, and free whiteboard Camtasia - $299, but well worth the money. You will thank yourself for buying a copy.",

For the whole community, the ideal way to go is probably to keep a free open source version (based on version 4.5) of a Dimdim module up to date and glitch free. It might also be helpful to change the name to separate it from its Dimdim past. (No pun intended.) I'd suggest that it's important to have the range of features that people want, but keep the possiblility of switching off features that administrators don't want to provide, as some features won't be appropriate for some student groups. If it's good enough, it would eventually get drawn into the mainstream Moodle. CamStudio is also open source and it might be possible to integrate it to add features. Might all be easier said than done, but it looks like webconferencing is here to stay, so why wouldn't you/we? Ross W",

Then they started delaying the open source releases and got into open source crippleware (no recording feature for example in open source). Now, the delay in open source update is simply too much. In fact, DimDim has most likely used the free word of mouth publicity associated with open source product as a stepping stone. Every company has to make money, but if they could be open right from the beginning about their policy, it would have helped. If one was interested in open source only, one would possibly not have wasted time on DimDim. Having said that, DimDim product looks okay to me for basic web conferencing and scores on ease of use. But, the free version gradually is being marginalised and if you use the free version, you notice how much shout is there about upgrade.",

          "Text": "Hi Folks, I'm up-to-date with the discussion about the Remote Learner Adobe Connect plugin for moodle here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=145225 , particularly in regard to the inability to connect to a hosted adobe solution with SSO. I've just noticed on the adobe site another plugin for use with adobe connect and moodle: http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/adobeconnect/feature-details/connect-moodle.html Does anyone have any experience with this mod? http://www.refineddata.com/learning-management/c2m I can't see any reviews for it, or any mentions of it in moodle.org forums. What is of interest is the money-line: Connect-to-Moodle provides a Single Sign On (SSO) environment in which information passes effortlessly in both directions between the two platforms so users cannot tell where Moodle ends and Adobe Connect begins. The SSO associated with the free integrator doesn't work with Adobe Hosted Solutions (majority of Adobe deployments). I wonder how they have achieved this with: \" Connect-to-Moodle is installed as a series of simple drop-in modules, blocks and activities . \", when the discussion on the remote leaner plugin points to adobe being the problem for SSO on hosted solutions? Has anyone had any experience with this mod? Would anyone from Remote Learner like to comment? Cheers, -David",

          "Text": "We (the core developers of BigBlueButton) are pleased announce the availability of BigBlueButton 0.81-beta-2. BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  The goal of the project is to provide remote students a high-quality learning experience. We expect to have a release candidate for 0.81 shortly, followed by a final release.  Most of the work now is on finishing the localization strings. We invite you to try out 0.81-beta-2.  Here's what's new in this release: Simplified Interface – BigBlueButton now has a consolidated Users window for easier session management and a more consistent user interface (including updated skin and icons) to help new users get started quickly. Layout Manager – BigBlueButton now enables users to choose from a number of preset layouts to quickly adapt to different modes of learning. Recording – BigBlueButton now records for playback all during a session (including desktop sharing). Text tool for Whiteboard – Presenters can now annotate their slides with text. New APIs – The BigBlueButton API now includes the ability to dynamically configure each client on a per-user bases, thus enabling developers to configure the skin, layout, modules, etc. for each user. There is also a JavaScript interface to control the client. Accessibility – BigBlueButton now supports screen readers JAWS (version 11+) and NVDA. A list of keyboard shortcuts have been added to make it easier to navigate through the interface using the keyboard. LTI Support – BigBlueButton is IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.0 compliant. This means any LTI consumer can integrate with BigBlueButton without requiring custom plug-ins. Mozilla Persona – The API demos now include examples of how to sign into a BigBlueButton session using Mozilla Persona. Support for LibreOffice 4.0 – BigBlueButton now uses LibreOffice 4.0 for conversion of of MS Office documents ( upload of PDF is still recommend to provide best results). This release has been in development/testing for over thirteen months.  In particular, we've done a lot of work to further simplify the interface. For videos that demonstrate how to use BigBlueButton as a moderator/presenter and as a viewer, see http://www.bigbluebutton.org/videos/ We know that archiving is important to many teachers.  For a sample BigBlueButton recording, click the link below (use FireFox or Chrome to view) http://goo.gl/A0IOXr For integrating BigBlueButton with Moodle, see https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=2 For more information on this release, including instructions on how to install (or upgrade from the previous release), see the release notes https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ReleaseNotes and visit our project web site http://bigbluebutton.org/ We've been working on BigBlueButton now for over four years.  When the final version this release ships, it will mark the eleventh release of the product. Our goal is to provide remote students a high-quality on-line learning experience.  If you are a teacher and want to provide your students with a synchronous learning environment, then we are building BigBlueButton for you.

You can also choose to record these meetings. There is also a BBB Recording module for Moodle which allows publishing of meetings recorded via BBB and they automatically appear in the recording activity. If you arent sure about setting up a BBB server, you may try using a Virtual machine to get started. You may need to configure and open ports to the VM if accessing it from the Internet. Let me know if you need any help with this. Ill try! regards",

We have looked at all kinds of alternatives such as various skype collaboration plugg-ins ( https://extras.skype.com/categories/1/good ) but so far, found many problems with these. Also, they are free one month and then you have to pay the next time you try to use them. I which there was at least an affordable webcast feature that could integrate with Moodle. We are looking at GotoMeeting and gotoWebinar. Webex is a little too pricey for us. Marakesh looked promissing, but since Google bought it, it has died, likely a strategy for google to push its future offering in this area.",

I have some little problems, but i will not say, they are coming from dimdim. Example: I use Microsoft Office 2007. The problem, if i share or create a document, ex. word, when you close a word document at ms office 2007, right up on the x-symbol, it only close the word document window, not the ms word application window. This is not a problem of dimdim, this is one of the new feature of ms office 2007, but suddenly you can not handle all open applications, like browser, dimdim window, ms word application window. you must kill the process over the task manager. this is not a problem if you use firefox , you can restart the session, but not in the internet explorer. My next little problem is the witheboard and the typewriter. If i use this feature, i go inside the wihiteboard with the mouse, it copy from self Text inside, but i have no chance to type anything. But i will and must try it again in the next days! Anyway, this is a fantastic application!!! Bye Andy",

In other word if there are more than two teachers in the course then only one of them can start/stay in the meeting.

          "Text": "Our organization has been looking and looking and tried all kings of stuff. Shareware, freeware, commercial software, open source... I think that what is truly needed for this Open Source Learning Management System is a free and Open Source web conferencing tool that can work on various platforms and with no need to install client side stuff . The companies that develop such tools can use the model of Red Hat, Apache and Moodle, and can do well financially by offering fee for service support, hosting, customization, enhancements and training. This is kind of the model of DimDim. DimDim appears like a very promising application and a lot of people have been kind of holding their breath waiting for a stable version to come. So far, we have seen a lot of delays, and I must say I am getting a little skeptical... after all the hype. Also, the product is kind of disappointing from a cross-platform support point of view, and due to the fact that it seems to crash less on windows platforms and browsers versus open source OS and browsers such as Linux and Mozilla (based on our own test). Unfortunately, and because of the frequent crashed, at this point, we had to decide to remove DimDim from our production servers and to hide the items that would have allowed students to use it for current courses. At this point, there seems to be one application with very little marketing by a lot of features to offer. As I was searching over the last couple of years, I kept running into it and kind of discounted it because of all the noise with other up and coming apps. I think that this community aught to give a more serious look at WebHuddle . Unlike many commercial and proprietary apps, and just like DimDim, WebHuddle does not require installation of client side plug-ins. It supports session recording (both screencast and audiocast). For the audio, I understand that one may have to use it with other VoIP tools ( http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Open+Source+VOIP+Software , Skype, SIPPhone or any other other). Hopefully, some work can be done soon on the audio side. If giants like Google use WebHuddle for Webcast, that says something about the credibility of WebHuddle http://webhuddle.sourceforge.net/demos/32/file_playback.html So my recommendation and support for any tools that integrates and complements Moodle is to look for free OpenSource, multi-platforms web conferencing tools that do not require installation of browser plug ins (this limits a lot the need for support and troubleshooting of students computers). And in the category, I have not seen much that is currently been offered and active besides DimDim (still in Alpha) and WebHuddle (has been in Beta for a while). Once again, while there is a lot of marketing efforts with DimDim (just looks at all the (sometimes redundant) post from the company on this forum), we should not ignore alternatives such as WebHuddle, even if they may be weak in marketing, and possibly (and momentarily) on the audio and for lack of instant integration with Moodle. There are ways to work around these two issues. In regard to Moodle integration, until somebody comes up with an activity plug-in, it is not difficult to just create an HTML link for students and teachers to start a conference. If anybody has feedback on what I just wrote, I would be very glad to hear about it.",

However, I have not experienced any difference in the things of my specific interest like whiteboard at www1.dimdim.com and at www2.dimdim.com as on date. Webhuddle audio is too bad for me (using webhuddle's own hosting) but I am encouraged by looking at the audio quality of the recorded meeting whose URL you have provided. If there is work around for the audio issue then it would be useful. One more issue with webhuddle is its whiteboard. It has to improve my miles. But, application sharing can be a work around for that at the moment. The most promising open source solution I find for virtual classroom is NEW . I find it feature rich. It can suit dedicated server installations and hosted solution does not appear to be available at the moment. Vmukti (formerly called 1videoconference) is also making some inroads. Its test has not worked for me till now so I cannot say too much about it. Vmukti name may sound strange to many here. Mukti means freedom in Hindi & Sanskrit.",

Unfortunately, we found the system very difficult to setup on our dedicated server and way to complicated. The engineering behind the product may be great, but we found the user interface to be quite rough, the setup and user documentation confusing. In the end, after having to hire VoiP/Linux experts, we got it to work, but the end result was iffy. I would love to learn if others have had a different experience with NEW, or if people have found ways to get DimDim to actually work with actual live classrooms. Also, that vmuki product you mentioned looks great, and it would be nice to know from academic institutions that some people have actually had success using it.",

However, at this time I can only install it using a direct connection to the Internet and a dedicated web-facing IP address. I can not install it on a LAN that already has Apache web servers, as BigBlueButton only works reliably with port 80 and the listening port can not be changed (due to the number of servers within the BBB platform). Since Moodle (and many other servers) on my LAN also use port 80 (with Apache), the conflicts are unavoidable unless BigBlueButton is outside the LAN, i.e. on its own Internet IP address, so that it does not have to share port 80. The Moodle plugin (by Dualcode) merely transfers users/privileges information to BigBlueButton and does not help resolve this intrinsic difficulty. BBB is due for the Google Summer of Code this year; hopefully it will emerge as a more flexible platform afterwards, with a few more kinks worked out.",

Also an observation: Users will only be able to automatically access the WebEx meeting if the Trainer/Host is already logged in as the Host. If the Host is not logged in, users will only be directed to the standard WebEX page. Ideally, users should be directed to the WebEx page that shows the login page to click on the Join button once the Host has logged in. This might be something that the WebEx plugin creators should look at.",

They have worked out a complex system of dates for when different levels of enrolment would be available for the next virtual meeting. Think of it like this: Day 1 : User 1,2 & 3 enrol Day 25: User 4 & 5 enrol Day 30 : Users 1, 2 & 3 do their first scheduled meeting over BBB, share files, do video conferences, that stuff. (Not recorded or assessed) Day 45: More users enrol Day 55 : Users 4 & 5 do their first scheduled meeting Day 60 : Users 1, 2 & 3 have their second scheduled meeting, which is recorded and assessed. etc ... We don't know the calendar dates of \"day N\", except by counting them out. Days after enrolment type scheduling is a pain, but that's the job. Our second problem is that BBB seems to have a \"single activity = single meeting\" association. So over time, the course is going to have a stack of use-once-then-discard activities , which is something I'd like to avoid. I'd like to know if there's a way to modify the plugin for moodle (or if there is an existing plugin) that allows multiple schedules for a single activity.",

I presume you mean Ubuntu 10.04 (that's the only version that we test with the packaging of 0.80). Is your Moodle server located on the same network as your BigBlueButton server?  Specifically, can your Moodle server access your BigBlueButton server via HTTP requests. The BigBlueButtonBN plugin must make direct API calls (via HTTP requests) to the BigBlueButton 0.80 server to create rooms, get recordings, etc. For a BigBlueButton server on a local network (behind a firewall), when you access it with your browser (also running on a computer behind the firewall) everything works.  However, if your Moodle server is located outside your network-- outside your firewall -- such as on a shared hosting site the external Moodle server can't reach in through your firewall to access your BigBlueButton server.  The firewall is doing its job. Let us know the networking setup of your BigBlueButton server and Moodle server and we'll dig a bit deeper. Regards,... Fred -- BigBlueButton Developer",

I have tested the BBB server by going to the 192.168.1.11 ip and it comes up with the BBB front page and the demo. All functions work well like this. On a side not, a different situation. I have a static IP assigned to the server, 70.xx.xx.41, I can ping this ip and the serve does respond. I can also do aport scan and it shows all the ports that are open for the BBB. When I go to the ip address directly I get a \"Welcome to nginx!\" message. Is there a setting on the server I am missing since it is not coming up with the BBB page and demo?",

According to this official list of Moodle releases and because this development was made using Moodle 1.9.19 (2007101592.00), this is the serial we should have put. In fact, we had originally 2007101509 until this Monday. We updated the tag due the reports about issues related to bugs in earlier versions of Moodle. The problem is that we have put 2012070600 instead of the one it should be. To certify that this plugins will work for all the 1.9.x versions is matter of time, because we need to test all the functionallity extensively and fix the potential problems we find for each one of them. So far, as we have already done this for 1.9.17, 1.9.18 and 1.9.19, we are setting 2007101591.12 as the minimal required version. This doesn't mean that the plugins will not work on previous releases but only that they have not been extensively tested on them. Regards, Jesus Federico",

For support in Spanish I would suggest you to open an thread in the Spanish forum or send a message to the BigBlueButton mailing list in Spanish https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=es-419&fromgroups#!forum/bigbluebutton-espanol . Getting back to the point. What do you mean with \"RecordingsBN is not installed\"? Did you follow the steps for installing the plugin? What errors do you have? You can follow the instructions shown in this video Even though the functionality is not the same now, the installation procedure is exactly the same. If after creating a meeting with schedule the event is not created in the calendar, you have found a bug on BigBluebuttonBN. If the error can be reproduced please create an issue in the Moodle tracking system. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB/component/12231",

About the misinformation contained in the README file, I already answered your question here https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/bigbluebutton-users/Ez-2DkWyX9E . And by the way, if you check the documentation online you will find that we changed the labels from 2.x to 1.9. see https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=2280 recordingsbn will not generate any table. It uses the info contained in the bigbluebuttonbn_log table. You shouldn't expect any table created. But you must have the two components installed. Unfortunately in 1.9 there is no validation of the dependences. I just installed the modules from the scratch again few minutes ago and I did't have any problem. Both plugins appears in the list. Are you sure you have the recomended  Moodle 1.9 version? (2007101591.12) http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases What version of moodle do you have? It hasn't been tested in all the releases but I can assure you that both plugins work on 2007101591.12 or later. One more thing you can do is to turn the debug messages on and see if you are having any message that can help. If you found a bug, I am the most interested in fixing it, but first we need to reproduce your error. Jesus",

I would thus like to find a web-conference tool allowing answer to this problem.

So, all people from city B, should hear all the presentation in the city A and could ask questions if needed.

This only happens when there is a large number of users enrolled in the course. A new version with the fix is here http://blindsidenetworks.com/downloads/moodle/bigbluebutton_blindsidenetworks_activity_module_2x.zip It will be uploaded into the Moodle database this week after testing a new feature included for the recordingsbn plugin",

Off course if you have a big server and only few users, you could handle the two services in the same box. Just keep in mind that out of the box BigBlueButton has a web server (nginx) configured to listen the port 80 (as any other web server has by default). You can deal with the configuration of moodle on nginx or if you want to install a different webserver like apache, you would need to put either of them to listen to a different por, hence to do extra configuration. We as BigBlueButton developers and commercial providers never do that, not even for development, but yes, we have learn of several deployments of both services in one box. So, the use of two servers is highly recommended but it's not mandatorily required. Regards Jesus Federico",

Im wanna share my problem with you, hoping someone could help me: First of all, I use Moodle 1.9; and I have a BBB server , that is working fine (I can access to BBB Server from my browser, using the different API's...). My BBB Server is 0.71a. So, Ive tried to relate Moodle with BigBlueButton. For this, ive already used three diferent modules: -Module from Dual Code -Module from Blind Side -BigBlueButtonBN What do I need? I need a module that, integrated in my Moodle, allows me to create activities in the different courses I got, with differences between \"teachers\" and \"students\" (different roles). With Dual Code Module, it works fine, but every activity that I create, is \"the same\": no roles, everyone is moderator. So, everyone can change the expositor (everyone could make a presentation!). Thats something I cant allow. With Blind Side module, it doesnt work. When I try to access, i just can see a page with \"Logging in as a moderatori\", like its loading. But nothing happens (its still loading from several hours; I guess if it works, its gonna be different). Ive activated the PHP errors, and on that page (while is \"loading\"), the message I can read is: Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): Entity: line 6: parser error : Opening and ending tag mismatch: hr line 5 and body in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): ^ in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): Entity: line 7: parser error : Opening and ending tag mismatch: body line 3 and html in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): ^ in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): Entity: line 8: parser error : Premature end of data in tag html line 1 in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Warning: SimpleXMLElement::__construct(): ^ in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'String could not be parsed as XML ' in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php:42 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php(42): SimpleXMLElement->__construct('??<...') #1 /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php(277): bbb_wrap_simplexml_load_file('87.106.251.182/...') #2 /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/view.php(102): BigBlueButton::createMeetingArray('this online ses...', 'fb26fe52ed0ae3c...', '', '9ea5119efca11ea...', 'a9a4e04718112af...', '5dbdef9952a1685...', '87.106.251.182/', ' http://87.106.2 ...') #3 {main} thrown in /var/www/moodle/mod/bigbluebutton/bbb_api/bbb_api.php on line 42 And with the third module, BigBlueButtonBN, I made the installation on Moodle 2.0 (because I think its not able to run over 1.9); and, when I try to access to an activity of BBB, it shows me an error message: Exception: String could not be parsed as XML So, as you can see people, I need your help. Is it possible to run Moodle 1.9 + BigBlueButton 0.71a with any module of BBB? What about the mistakes? Does anyone know how I can solve them? (or only one! With one module its enough!) Is it possible to create with a BBB module in Moodle, an activity that students can participate like students? (no moderator role). Thank you very much for your attention. I'll be around here waiting for your answer Thanks again, Ignacio.",

The errors you are receiving suggest the activity module isn't able to parse an XML reply from the BigBlueButton server.  This occurs when you omit the '/bigbluebutton/' from the end of the URL. Can you double-check the URL you gave in the settings panel and let us know the result. > Is it possible to create with a BBB module in Moodle, an activity that students can participate like students?

On the other hand, I am sorry I ran out of ideas, I don't know what else you can do if your Bigbluebutton server is working fine and your moodle server too. Last suggestion I can give you is you should always make sure your integration is working fine with the defaults. After that you can move forward to the next step. Good luck",

This is the 1.0.8-b2 release that has been labeled as version 2012081300 for both components, BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN . The main changes and/or improvements included since the previos release are: 1. The schedule parameters that were originaly activated only for activities in section 1 and higher, are now also available for activities in the section 0. 2. There was a serious security issue on internal calls to index.php, ajax .php and bbb-broker. The access was not validated according to the permissions of the users. This issue was registered as CONTRIB-3840 on the Moodle tracking system. 3. A bug was preventing the normal operation of the module on servers accessing bigbluebutton and external services trhought a proxy server . This bug was registered as CONTRIB-3844 on the Moodle tracking system. These are the issues reported by users during the beta one testing phase. If you find anything that you think is a bug or it can be improved, please don't hesitate in letting us know or directly create an issue on the tracking system for the corresponding project ( BigBlueButtonBN or RecordingsBN )",

You must get the SDK from Elluminate in order to get the web services handler. It's not shipped as a default option with the manager just yet (I don't believe). The SDK documentation describes how to setup a user with permissions on the Elluminate server for web services. This is something that Elluminate can help you with. And, yes, adapter = 'default'. We didn't use a custom modified adapter on the Elluminate server, it's just using the default as it supported every feature we needed to develop this module. I hope that helps.",

I do not know the purpose of using the SDK, but at the time I did the install on our server, the SDK was required for the Moodle-Elluminate integration to work. We are no longer using the ELM (local server version) of Elluminate. 2. The SDK is available from Elluminate when you purchase the ELM (Elluminate Live Manager) for install on your server. 3. No it is not free...you have to pay for licensing Elluminate if you wish to have it on your server (or hosted by Elluminate). They do offer a \"3 for free\" option, but as far as I know, this cannot be integrated directly with Moodle. Check www.elluminate.com . 4. Yes the SDK will be installed on your server along with the ELM. If you use Elluminate's hosted (ASP) option, you do not need the SDK loaded. Mike and Justin can probably provide better answers.

          "Text": "Hi everyone! In coordination with the team at Elluminate Live! we're made a lot of changes to the Elluminate Live! Moodle integration code. In accordance the MoodleDocs page has been updated: http://docs.moodle.org/en/ElluminateLive_module The code has been checked into Contrib CVS and should be appearing up on anonymous access and also via the download server with the same links for the block and module code (both have been updated): http://download.moodle.org/download.php/plugins/blocks/elluminatelive.zip http://download.moodle.org/download.php/plugins/mod/elluminatelive.zip This new code is using a custom Moodle adapter on the Elluminate Live! server and there are supplied instructions in both the module README file and the MoodleDocs page, linked above, to enable this adapter functionality on your server. The following is a list of changes made: Elluminate / Moodle Integration Changes: JNLP files no longer contain junk HTML at the bottom. A custom 'moodle' adapter is to be used as the default value. The recording options for a meeting have been changed to 'None', 'Manual', and 'Automatic' to make more sense. The seats input field for meetings was changed to a text box and added a link which opens a popup window that will check for seat availability by pulling in data directly from the form. Changed the 'Test connection' button in the module configuration page to pull data from directly from the form. Previously you had to submit the form and then go back to the configuration page to perform the connection test. Boundary times are now a module configuration option where an administrator can allow for teachers to choose their own meeting boundary times (available options are the same as the ELM manager 15/30/45/60 minutes). The administrator can force a default boundary time for all meetings as well (not allowing teachers to choose a specific time on their own). Moodle can recognize multiple recordings for a single meeting and recordings can be deleted from within Moodle. Added a link to the Elluminate support URL where you can verify your setup and get technical help along with a 'Join Meeting' link. Included files for implementing the custom Moodle adapter (it is now the default adapter value entered in the module configuration form) in Elluminate Live! server. Using a custom JAR file with a command to check whether the server has seat reservation enabled or not. The form components for seat reservation will not be drawn if this option is not enabled. NOTE: it is enabled by default.",

I note that the Moodle documentation for the Elluminate module refers to the ability to set up a \"private\" meeting but my question is, how do I add participants for that meeting? There appears to be no way in the Moodle module that I can see to do that so currently if I make the meeting private, none of my students can see it. If I say the meeting is NOT private, then everyone can see it. I was hoping there would be a way to add students to an Elluminate meeting and say \"these students but not those students\" can attend this Elluminate session. Is that possible using the Elluminate-Moodle integration module? Also I noted somewhere a reference to being able to keep track of the attendees for each session. I assume the ability to do that is related to the previous question. Finally, is it true that the \"Elluminate Bridge for Moodle\" is a separate product that is only accessible to persons utilizing an SAP version of Elluminate and not those that have an ELM arrangement with Elluminate. I wonder if some of the additional \"features\" that I have heard about (such as those mentioned above) are only the domain of those that have a hosted solution with Elluminate. Cheers, Bill",

I talked to one elluminate expert at elluminate and here is what I know/solved and what I am still working on: Want: 1. How to see grade attendance. currently, I can only click participants (who came), click on my course in their profile, and click activity reports but I have no idea if it is averaged into grade as it never shows there 2. see session attendance 3. be able to delete recording and rename Know 1. don't change format of course to labels - hides elluminate link! 2. must add teachers/students first at assign roles before you can use the feature to edit moderators/students. It stumped me too but works fine. (make sure you have enrolled students to see) 3.don't add elluminate link for your teachers to help them out -it puts YOUR name on elluminate session even when they log into it! (note, as admin, you can make a link and yet when a teacher logs in and adds a link, they will never see you as another moderator to add UNLESS you also assign yourself as a teacher 4. cron must be running or recordings do not show up (they don't email recordings, they show up under elluminate link where it says, join session 5. officially only moodle 1.8 is supported & I have 1.9 but am not going back to check features! Elluminate has only one page on the integration in their knowledge base - I was called today to add my tips above to it. Searches are mostly fruitless for now so we must be in new territory Good luck, hope you and I can find the answers together somehow JT",

There are some things in there that look non-standard and it looks like you've got the Moodle adapter defined as the default in your file which is not what mine has. I'm not sure if the differences are based on you running Elluminate on Windows (I've only ever tested running the server on Linux and Mac OS X). I think that your issue might be related to changes you have made to your configuration that don't have anything to do with Moodle or you didn't follow the setup instructions correctly for installing the custom Moodle adapter. If the problem is with non-Moodle changes, you would have to talk to Elluminate to help sort out the problems. I know the instructions in MoodleDocs for ELM 3.0 and newer still work for the latest release.",

About the configuration file, I made all change required by the documentation on Moodle, but I think the \"different changes\" was caused by Elluminate 9.7 setup. When start the Elluminate Instance Manager, there's a part on setup that ask me if I want to configure an adapter (like Blackboard, CE, etc) and there's an adapter called \"Standard Adapter\". I configure the Elluminate setting up the box on \"Standard Adapter\" (as the Elluminate documentation says if you need to use Elluminate with Moodle), and I think it causes the \"different changes\". I'll try to pass this step without setting up this option, and then, start all change like the moodle documentation says. About the adapter on Moodle, I'm sure that's everything right! I've follow all steps on documentation and I didn't see any error screen. Just that about the Elluminate connection (that I commented on my last post). Then, I think this problem is caused by this 'configuration.xml'. Right now I'm trying to find a solution with Elluminate support and when it finish, I'll be happy to post the result here!

Today I could configure my moodle with elluminate live using the following solution(I expect that explanation can be usefull for everyone that has this same problem). I'll explain the problems and then the solution! - First Problem: on Moodle Documentation: The documentation says that I need to use the files that are on \"elm30\" folder, but... where are these files? Or this folder... ? I've talked about it with an Elluminate support technician, and he called me that I can found them opening the ElluminateLive plugin file that I downloaded here [ http://download.moodle.org/download.php/patches19/elluminate_elm.zip ], on elluminate_elm.zip\\elluminate_elm\\mod\\elluminatelive\\elluminate_addons\\elm30\\ - Second Problem: on Elluminate (9.7) Documentation: This documentation says [on page 59] that if I need to use Moodle with Elluminate, I need to enable the Standard Adapter (or bridge, as you want) on the instance configuration. It isn't true (at least to me)! If I enable this options and follow the Moodle documentation, everything stops to work... ! - The solution: When I've disabled this option (Standard Adapter on Instance Configuration), followed the moodle documentation and used the correct files (please read my last posts. I was using wrong files... ), everything worked fine! Thanks everyone for all your help. And also Elluminate technician support. Note: As a customer of the 2 softwares (Elluminate and Moodle), I suggest that you make clear these parts that talk about files locations and adapters configurations.",

Previously, instructors can create Elluminate sessions and students can join the session with access (as default) to all basic functions (microphone, chat window, whiteboard, etc.). Now instructors can still create Elluminate sessions. However, when students join in the session, they don't have access to any functions. Whiteboard, chat window and microphone became gray area. Instructors can manually give them back the privilege, however, it will be a big trouble when instructors have a large class. As far as I know, nobody changed any settings. Do you know what is wrong and how can I change it back? Thank you so much!",

Everything (after a long support on moodle.org and Elluminate technical support) is working fine . But before to implement it on a production environment I'm testing a disaster and recovery. I'm using Windows 2003 Server Standard R2 SP2 + MS SQL 2005 Express on Elluminate Server. But... when I backup it by the Elluminate Instance Manager and restore by this tool, everything works fine on Elluminate , but on Moodle I can't scheduled any meeting. After the restore, I tried to create a new meeting on moodle, and I didn't receive any error screen. When I click on \" Join Session \" I don't receive any error message too. But there isn't anything loading... When I go to Elluminate Live Server Manager page, I see that creator of those meetings are written like Unknow (as I put on attached file). Is it an issue or a specific problem with me? Can it be an issue with the backup (because I'm using MS SQL with the Elluminate Instance Manager backup)? Note: I've fixed this problem removing the Elluminate adapter from moodle and installing it again. But doing it, I lose all my recorded sessions on Elluminate course. Is there any method to solve it better (without any loss)? Thanks!",

Username and password for the SAS account (provided in your welcome email). Default boundary time, in minutes, before the scheduled start time of a session. To enable teachers to set their own boundary time, select Choose. Specify whether you want web services debugging turned on (default = No). Click Save Changes to save the configuration. Click Test connection to verify you can connect. Note: you may have to adjust the URL to http:// from https://. In answer to your second question, there is no Group option when creating an Elluminate Live! Session.

We did a test upgrade from M1.9.10 to 2.0.2. We have Elluminate Live module installed in our 1.9, and I was aware that the latest version posted here: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=557&filter=1 is for 1.9, but I just thought to give it a try and drop it in the upgraded Moodle 2.0, and indeed was unsuccessful. I then found out on Elluminate's website that they have a bridge package that supports Moodle 2.0 and is available from their download page. So I got the package and was about to install it, but on the new block/ mod confirmation page I noticed that it's called 'elluminate' now, not 'elluminatelive', thus moodle will treat it as a new install instead of an upgrade. I looked at some of the upgrade  and install scripts in the package, and I think all my data in \"mdl_elluminatelive_xxxxxxx\" tables will not be transferred, which means that currently scheduled meetings will no longer be there and links to the recordings won't appear on the block. So is there any solution/ workaround/ hint to tackle this. Is the Elluminate Live Module posted in the plugin download page still being supported/ further developed to some extent? thank you, Dimas",

But as said by Mat, there is this announcement on the Dual Code web site (the one making the Moodle BBB plugin): \"The Moodle plug-in for BBB v0.7 is currently in development.\" Then, let's wait...

Procedure to install the new BBB 0.7 plugin: a) Removed the previous plugin from Moodle: go to \"Modules - Activities - Manage activities\", and click on \"Delete\" for the \"BigBlueButton\" activity. This will only delete the BBB table in the DB. b) After that, go on your Moodle server, and delete the BBB directory: E.g. cd /var/www/moodle/mod rm -Rf bigbluebutton c) Download the new plugin: cd /var/www/moodle/ wget http://www.dualcode.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.zip unzip bigbluebutton.zip Caution: download and unzip the bigbluebutton.zip file in /var/www/moodle (the root of your Moodle installation), not in /var/www/moodle/mod!!! This new zip file includes the mod directory (which should better not be). Probably, that's your problem: because of that, you are still using the old (0.64) plugin. Then go to \"Notifications\" in the Moodle admin interface: you should see the that the new BBB table has been created. Hope it will help. Eric",

          "Text": "Eric, Thanks for your comprehensive list of things to check as it was really helpful. However I have checked all this and it all looks to be OK. I've discovered though that when I set up a new BBB activity, leaving the password field blank, I am asked if I want to join as an Attendee or Moderator. Clicking on Moderator gives the following response. <response> <returncode>FAILED</returncode> <messageKey>invalidPassword</messageKey> − <message> You either did not supply a password or the password supplied is neither the attendee or moderator password for this conference. </message> </response> If I enter a password in the Attendee and Moderator field when I set up a BBB activity then it all works although it doesn't ask for a password when I access the activity. So it appears as thought there are a few issues here: 1. A password is always required when setting up a BBB activity (which may not be what everyone would want if they have to inform their users of it prior to a session - especially for ad-hoc sessions) 2. If a password is required then there is no check on the activity entry form to ensure that a password is entered. 3. There is no prompt for the user joining the activity to enter a password which seems to defeat the reason for having one. regards John",

So I was wondering if anyone knows the history of this situation and if we can find a way to resolve it, else users of both plugins are likely to get very confused about this and potentially break their installations!",

I wrote the moodle activity module for Moodle 1.9 and 2.0 from Blindside Networks.   We wanted to ensure there was a high-quality integration of BigBlueButton with Moodle.  Blindside Networks started the BigBlueButton project in 2007. As a bit of background, we've also written integrations for WordPress and Joomal.  We're also working on an integration of BigBlueButton with Drupal 7.  We've gotten very good over the years at integrating BigBlueButton into other products.  We also host these integrations on our site at Blindside Networks and on GitHub at https://github.com/blindsidenetworks We thought about enhancing the module from Dual Code last year, but their activity module has clear messaging to promote DualCode's hosting of BigBlueButton.  There's nothing wrong with that -- compaines that use open source need to make a living -- but we didn't feel it proper to make any modifications to their messaging. Also, at the time I wrote the Moodle Activity module for 1.9 and 2.0 in January 2011, the DualCode only supported 1.9.  Moodle 2.0 had been out for a few months and folks were asking for support for Moodle 2.0.   So I decided to start from scratch and write an integration for both Moodle 1.9 and 2.0, and, using our experience with integrating BigBlueButton into othe products, make it as good I possible could. By doing this, we also gave the Dual Code folks a bit of competition, and competition is good, but confusion is not. The confusion over the directory structures is my fault.  I used 'bigbluebutton' for the directory name and database name to achieve the name 'bigbluebutton' when installing the activity module. It wasn't my intent to cause confusion or problems for administrators, and I'd be happy to change the structure in the next version of our activity modules so that administrators don't have any potential for conflict.

All is running fine now.  I really like the simplicity of operation.  Next up I'm exploring the API features.  I've already done some modification of the config. xml file (to enable kicking participants).

          "Text": "I am glad to announce you that we have improved and released the most recent version of BigBlueButtonBN Activity Module . This is as part of our efforts to offer this community an always better solution to integrate Moodle and BigBlueButton. In this release we basically added two features. The first one is the support for separate groups and the second one the activity access filter to prevent guests or any configured role to get into BigBlueButton sessions. The separation of groups is based in the basic implementation that Moodle offers. That means that it does not support grouping . The feature was added having in mind that for big classes, teachers could require organize the interaction with students setting up meeting sessions for small groups where an small number of students and moderators would be enrolled. From the BigBlueButtonBN point of view, all the configuration is in the Common module seting box where the selection of [Separate groups] is required. Be aware that only the two first modes has been implemented. The good performance however relays on the group configuration. And there is where the administrator would establish who belongs to which group. In this example a number of different students have been enrolled for the groups 101 and 102, although any of them could be enrolled in more than one at the same time. And the same principle can be applied for teachers, tutors or any other customized role. On the access interface there is only one change. Before joining the meeting when the user belongs to multiple groups, there will be an intermediate page where the group to be accessed need to be selected. Moderators or students having direct access to the meeting would see a menu like this: And students waiting for moderators would see an interface like this. The second feature can be exploid when the administrator wants to give a preview of the courses to guests, not allowing them to access the activities . The configuration is in the roles definition. Just make sure that the role you are configuring doesn't have access to neither Join Meeting nor Moderate Meeting. We hope you enjoy this new features.

The \"SOAP-Only\" user can do exactly what is needed to run the integration but nothing more. This does result in no need for any OpenMeetings Admin-User in the Moodle Module config! So you can better protect your OpenMeetings server from non-authorized access via the SOAP Gateway and no need to share confidential account data.\"SOAP-Only\" users can not login to OpenMeetings administration or manipulate user accounts via SOAP. It is recommended to update to the latest version of OpenMeetings (1.8.3). Moodle Mod 0.9 for Moodle 1.9.x is still compatible with OpenMeetings 1.8.3 and you can also use the new secure user with access level \"SOAP-Only\" with the old Moodle Mod 0.9.

Skype doesn't allow someone to join an existing conference call.  You have to close the current call and then call everyone again. Not easy to mute specific people. Skype group screen sharing is expensive.  Everyone has to be a \"premier member\".  Hence you need Mikogo. Mikogo has been unreliable at times... difficulty connecting. Skype's OSX client has been less than stellar - frequent disconnects. Mikogo has problems when screen sharing with multiple monitors (as of August 2011) Mikogo for OSX will make you lose focus when a student points on your screen during your presentation.  Annoying bug. Teamviewer has a broadcast option that works quite well with a small group of students.  However, you can't easily make someone else a presenter so that everyone can see their screen. Big Blue Button. Problems: Can't control someone elses mouse via screen sharing.  Sometimes I want to help fix a problem or type something but I cant. Voice not as good as Skype's -- slight delay. Screensharing a bit slower than Teamviewer. No breakout rooms like Elluminate has.  That would be nice to take a large group of students and instantly move them into smaller groups where I could move between rooms to give them help. Next version of BBB will have pdf/ppt recording but no screen sharing recording like Elluminate has. When screen sharing, students can't create a pointer to point at something on my screen.  I really liked how Mikogo does this and missed it badly in BBB.  In fact a pointer for each student in a different color appears in Mikogo. Awesome things I've noticed about BBB right off the bat: Voice/Cam/PDF sharing/Screensharing all in one.  Don't need to install a client for Voice, and one for Cam, One for screen sharing, etc. As long as your machine runs Flash, you are in.  I had students in Linux Mint, OSX, Windows, IE , Firefox , Chrome with no problems. Localization works great.  I had a Chinese student that enjoyed this aspect. Interface VERY clean.  I kinda wish there was a settings button at the top for Flash. The PDF doc sharing works EPIC.  Anything can be converted to PDF so that means BBB can work with any document. First time wierdness with BBB Some students didn't understand how to share their screen when made them presenter. Some students didn't know how to maximize the screen sharing. Opening the Flash settings during the screen sharing process can lock up BBB. Flash wouldn't always pick up the correct sound input... Students didn't know how to right click and choose settings to do this. I'm not sure how to whiteboard without uploading a blank PDF file... is there a way? This was our first time using BBB so at the end the students were generally positive about it after they figured out how to share their screen. I'll make more use of the PDF sharing next time.",

          "Text": "Hi Jeremy, I'm one of the BigBlueButton developers and on behalf of the others, thanks for sharing your feedback.  I've responded to your feedback in-line. > 1. Can't control someone elses mouse via screen sharing.  Sometimes I want to help fix a problem or type something but I cant. We've not had a lot of request for adding remote control in screen sharing, but your use case is good.  We've been focused on improving the core capabilities for the moment, such as record and playback. > 2. Voice not as good as Skype's -- slight delay. We have worked on improving the audio in the upcoming BigBlueButton 0.8.  See http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/3c7ce9815a9800c3 . > 3. Screensharing a bit slower than Teamviewer. Screen sharing is one of the weakest part of our product.  We opted to use Java to capture the screen.  On the positive site, our desktop sharing will work on Mac, Unix, or PC clients -- as long as you have Java installed.  Only the presenter (the person sharing their screen) needs Java. On the downside, Teamviewer and others install native code and can thus hook into the underlying OS to optimize the screen sharing. > 4. No breakout rooms like Elluminate has.  That would be nice to take a large group of students and instantly move them into smaller groups where I could move between rooms to give them help. It's a good request, but we have others (such as record and playback) that are taking a higher prirority.  It's on our road map for 1.0.  See http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/RoadMap1dot0 > 5. Next version of BBB will have pdf/ppt recording but no screen sharing recording like Elluminate has. We are getting close to a release of BigBlueButton 0.8 beta which will have recording of slides + audio.  The target use case for BigBlueButton is to share slides (PDF). > 6. When screen sharing, students can't create a pointer to point at something on my screen.  I really liked how Mikogo does this and missed it badly in BBB.  In fact a pointer for each student in a different color appears in Mikogo. Good suggestion ... we are targeting BigBlueButton for on-line classes for 25 users or less.  How would this work if you have twenty students in a session?  Are you sessions primarily smaller groups? Feedback on the first-time wierdness > 1. Some students didn't understand how to share their screen when made them presenter. There's two overview videos we recommend you have all students watch.  It will give them a quick look at the capabilities of the viewer and presenter.  See http://bigbluebutton.org/sites/all/videos/join/index.html . > 2. Some students didn't know how to maximize the screen sharing. We'll look at maximizing a students view of screen sharing for the upcoming BigBlueButton 0.8 release. > 3. Opening the Flash settings during the screen sharing process can lock up BBB. We'll check into this. > 4.  Flash wouldn't always pick up the correct sound input... Students didn't know how to right click and choose settings to do this. We're working on a 'Audio settings' dialog to appear when students first join the audio session.  This dialog will help them verify they have working audio and choose the active microphone. We definitely want to make this process easier for students. > 5. I'm not sure how to whiteboard without uploading a blank PDF file... is there a way? We implemented whiteboard as annotations, so you need a blank slide to annotate. Thanks again Jeremy for your feedback.  Much appreciated. Regards,...

          "Title": "Web Conference with Sychronous video",
          "Text": "Hi to all! It seems that after numerous testing projects I will finally try Moodle for real!!! (extremely small scale but still in a \"production\" environment). The problem is that, apart from asynchronous training, we need to implement some basic web conferencing with (and here is the catch) synchronous video streaming. To illustrate, imagine this scenario: A web conference with 1 instructor and 5 to 10 max participants where the instructor has the ability to present a video (and also pause, rewind etc) which the participants can see in real time over internet (not LAN) in adequate quality and all sides should be able to voice comment on it. Of course, all the web conferencing goodies that, for example, bigbluebutton offers (like whiteboard, raise hands etc.) are more than welcome but not essential. Sharing a Desktop while the video is playing doesn't seem to do the trick since the quality would propably be inadequate. I know I am asking a lot (especially if you consider that it should be a free or low-cost solution at least at the beginning of the project) but I was hoping that someone could suggest a solution or workaround. Thanks in advance, Andreas",

OpenMeetings recently was also updated to Version 1.7 with a number of updates: Multi-Whiteboard, you can add new whiteboard instances, each whiteboard can have the full range of tools and documents inside. Advanced File-Explorer, Drag and Drop Interface for managing files, including possibility to create a document tree with folders. Private and Public Drive in File-Explorer. The File-Explorer has two different views, one is the Private Drive and the other the Public Drive . The Private Drive always contains the same files. Those files are only visible to the user currently loggedin. The Public Drive is bound not to the user, but to the conference room. All users in the conference room have access to the Public Drive. Save whiteboards. You can save each whiteboard instance as a file. The file is located in the File-Explorer and can be drag and drop'ed and organized like any other document, image or folder. New User-Level: SOAP/Web-Service only. For security reasons there is a new user-level. You can now create user-accounts that have only the ability to access via SOAP. In former versions you always need an admin account. MyRooms section. Each user has now by default 2 personal rooms that are always accessible exclusive for that user. There are buttons to enter those rooms from the dashboard VoIP-Integration. Together with our Finish partner and the Open Source Department of Kvarken region we have done a VoIP integration by using an applet for the audio part.

          "Text": "Hello , my name is Sebastian , I am Argentinian and this is my first post . I have installed Moodle and BigBlueButton on different servers ( Windows and Ubuntu) . Both work correctly separately . I installed Moodle modules to connect to BBB , i have tested with Dual Code and the Blindside Networks module and both i found the same problem: the students never have access to the conference if it is configured to have to wait for connecting the moderator . With the Dual Code module is configuration is preset and can not change , so students should always wait for it to connect the moderator . They can never connect, the module does not detect that the moderator already connected . With Blindside Networks module configuration can be changed , so the moderator and students can connect only if the settings indicate that \" students m ust n ot w ait until a moderator joins \". Also, with this module from M oodle I can not see how many students have joined the conference and I can not end the same for all ( if you disconnect the facilitator , students can remain connected ) . So, in summary , with the two modules I have the same problem , the difference is that the module Blindside Networks can be configured to help in exchange for significant loss of functionality. I hope someone can help me please . Thank you very much and sorry for my bad English",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm wondering if anybody else that has EL module integrated in their Moodle site has encountered a similar issue when upgrading to Moodle 2.0. We did a test upgrade from M1.9.10 to 2.0.2. We have Elluminate Live module installed in our 1.9, and I was aware that the latest version posted here: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=557&filter=1 is for 1.9, but I just thought to give it a try and drop it in the upgraded Moodle 2.0, and indeed was unsuccessful. I then found out on Elluminate's website that they have a bridge package that supports Moodle 2.0 and is available from their download page . So I got the package and was about to install it, but on the new block/ mod confirmation page I noticed that it's called 'elluminate' now, not 'elluminatelive', thus moodle will treat it as a new install instead of an upgrade. I looked at some of the upgrade  and install scripts in the package, and I think all my data in \"mdl_elluminatelive_xxxxxxx\" tables will not be transferred, which means that currently scheduled meetings will no longer be there and links to the recordings won't appear on the block. So is there any solution/ workaround/ hint to tackle this. Is the Elluminate Live Module posted in the plugin download page still being supported/ further developed to some extent? thank you, Dimas",

You can't run a virtual machine inside an already virtual environment.  Even if you could, you wouldn't want to: BigBlueButton is a real-time system and, as such, we recommend installing BigBlueButton on a dedicated server. The recommended setup is to not try and run Moodle and BigBlueButton on the same server; rather, run BigBlueButton on a separate (dedicated) server. With regards to CentOS, we used to provide support for it.  But trying to support both CentOS packaging and Ubuntu packaging for BigBlueButton was a lot of effort, too much in fact, and we concluded that we could benefit the community by spending more time on BigBlueButton, so we consolidated the packaging to only support Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit/64-bit. If you can setup a dedicated server, dual or quad-core, 2+ G of memory, with Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit/64-bit, you can setup BigBlueButton in about 15 minutes.  See http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/InstallationUbuntu Regards,...

The default tcp port of BBB has to be changed from tcp/80 to tcp/443 (for example). - Server1: Moodle ==> IP: IP1 (private/static) - Port: tcp/80 (http) - Server2: BBB ==> IP: IP2 (private/static) - Port: tcp/443 (http & rtmp) Router: - Internet side: IP: IP0 (public/dynamic) - NAT table: tcp/80 -> IP1-tcp/80 (Moodle) tcp/443 -> IP2-tcp/443 (BBB: http & tunnelled rtmp) tcp/9123 -> IP2-tcp/9123 (BBB: desktop sharing) Remarks: a) For BBB, you cannot let the server run on tcp/80 (default) and configure the NAT like this: tcp/443 -> IP2-tcp/80. This does not work. b) I have chosen to change the BBB port from tcp/80 to tcp/443. You can chose another port than tcp/443. It is just that tcp/443 is often opened if the firewall or proxy servers, and then BBB can be used from inside an organisation. c) To access the BBB server, you have still to use http, not https! https://IP0:443 (not https://IP0 or https://IP0:443). d) Configuration adaptations to make BBB running on tcp/443 (http) in place of tcp/80 (http). In both cases, the RTMP protocol is tunneled into http. The tcp/1935 native default RTMP port does not need to be opened in the router. 1) bbb-conf --setip bbb.mydomain.com:443 2) Edit /var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config. xml : change all occurence of \"bbb.mydomain.com\" by \"bbb.mydomain.com:443\". 3) bbb-conf --restart DNS: www.mydomain.com = Moodle -- bbb.mydomain.com:443 or www.mydomain.com:443 = BBB",

In addition, many home PC users don't have phone sitting beside their computer; 2) Whiteboard and Recording : they claim DimDim can record courses, but only audio and video are recorded (with very bad quality). Whiteboard and anything else are not recorded. If only record audio and video, why bother use this product? You can simply use YouTube. 3) Moodle-Integration : It does not work! If a Dimdim account is reused by a teacher, there are many scenarios that subsequent meetings fail to start. Bottom Line: Do Not buy this product!",

I repeat - NOTHING HAPPENED - Moodle did not respond in any way. SO, I am assuming that something is broken because the install instructions are flawed, the activity does not work, the activity does not behave as indicated in the instructions and because the activity indicates that Enterprise username and password are required (and there is apparently a non-Enterprise Package) And that means that something needs repairing. So, do I need to remove anything? Fix the database ? Add anything? What is wrong, how do we fix it and what needs to happen so that no other users face this problem?

There is an Elluminate - Moodle Bridge and it will show up in your \"Add an Activity\" pull down menu once it is installed and you just add it like any other activity, you can link it with a grade if you wish and when moderators click the link they will join as a moderator and when students click they will join as a participant and about 30 min after your session ends that same link will be a link to the recording. Way cool!!!! Elluminate hosts our ELIVE so if you host it on your own server I am sure there are some additional set up steps. More info in screen shot below. Everything you need to know is here - including download link: http://www.elluminate.com/products/integration/moodle-cms.jsp One thing I have not gotten to work with it correctly is roles. Sometimes students are guest presenters in my Elive session and so I give them the Instructor role for the Elive session activity I created but they are not available on the moderator list when I edit this activity.

The reason why I'm asking is that we host our own Moodle (1.9) and Elluminate servers. I upgraded Elluminate from 8.5 to 9.0 per their directions, which were for a standalone system. I made no changes at all to the Moodle side. Since the upgrade, there have been reports of strange things when using Elluminate through Moodle. Last week, Elluminate was throwing authentication failures after the application loaded for anyone coming in through Moodle. Today, I have a report that a faculty member received a pink Moodle error box saying \"You must be a moderator to create meetings\" when he/she tried to add another Elluminate meeting to a Moodle course. Since we're in our winter break here, I'm not sure if the integration is 100% broken with nobody using it, or if these are random problems. Anyway, I was wondering if we are the first site to do this upgrade, or if somebody else has Elluminate 9.0 successfully integrated which would indicate that I did something wrong when doing the upgrade.....",
