So I have decided to fork it and create a new redesigned Interactive book module . The idea of improving Book module came from the participants of Moodle Moot DACH 2025. I will submit it to the plugins database later next week after implementing basic test coverage and fixing compatibility with Moodle 4.5. For now the prototype can be installed in Moodle 5.0, it may work in 5.1 too. Anybody interested in trying it out?",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I encountered with the Moodle Book module and see if anyone has suggestions or if this can be improved in future updates. (4.5.5 version) Here’s what happened: I created a new chapter in an existing Book. Moodle automatically assigned subchapters of a different chapter as subchapters of this new chapter. I did not intend for this hierarchical change. I then deleted the new chapter, thinking only the new chapter would be removed. All the subchapters were deleted as well, without any warning or prompt. This is extremely problematic because: The UI does not make the change of the parent-child relationship obvious. Deleting a single chapter can silently remove a lot of content. There is no confirmation dialogue that clearly says “this will also delete subchapters.” Moodle does not have a undo for this and the recycle bin do not cover book chapters at all Recommendations: We should have a warning when deleting chapters, especially if that have subchapters. Chapters should create entries in the recycle bin This bug (or UX issue) feels super annoying and could easily cause loss of content for other instructors as well.",

          "Text": "Hi One of our academics has produced a course using moodle book and he asked for some help to add free text response boxes for his learners to record their thoughts, reflections, etc. We use the following code which outputs two boxes, the first box is where the learner will submit their answer/reflection/thoughts, and when they click 'Submit your answer' it appears in the bottom box.  However, when the text appears in the bottom response box, the formatting disappears and the text runs on. I have two questions. Is this the best way to add a free text response box which retains the responses? If this is the way to do it, how can I retain the formatting in the response box? The code we're using is as follows: <script> function display1() { var post = document.getElementById(\"Box01Input\").value; localStorage.setItem('Box01InputValue', post); } window.addEventListener('load', () => { var savedLearnerData1 = localStorage.getItem('Box01InputValue'); document.getElementById(\"Box01Response\").innerHTML = savedLearnerData1; }); function getName1() { var input = document.getElementById(\"Box01Input\"); if (input.value == '') {} else { var tE = document.getElementById('Box01Response'); tE.innerHTML = input.value; } return false } </script> <textarea name=\"content\" id=\"Box01Input\" style=\"height: 147px; width: 100%;padding: 10px; resize: none\"></textarea> <br> <button onclick=\"display1(); return getName1()\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px ;\">Submit your response</button> <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"height: 147px; width: 100%;padding: 10px;content: \" \";\"=\"\"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign=\"top\"> <p><label id=\"Box01Response\"><em>Your response will appear here.</em></label></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Not only does iContent let students make notes, they can define them to be public or private. It also allows the student to direct questions regarding the presentation, to everyone or just to the tutor/teacher. iContent also allows the use of essay, matching, true/false. and multiple choice questions from the Moodle question bank. The latest v1.0.7.2 version is only available from github at the moment as I have recently took over maintaining the plugin and had to fix thousands of style and bug errors to bring it up to date. I've one major thing left to fix which is shuffling the answer list for the matching question, before I do a release to the Moodle download s pages.",

Ideally, a different activity would have been used from the start, such as Shirleys' H5P suggestion or a lesson with Essay questions. However, you potentially could make it work with plugins: https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_essayautograde https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_embedquestion With these two, you can set up a question in the course question bank for feedback and then using filter questions plugin to get the question onto the book resource. Answers are saved for learners to return to and the Embed Question Progress page that gets attached to modules with embedded questions will even let teachers view their feedback. Im using auto essay here  because it lets learners 'check' the question (against, say, a word count) to 'grade' it, making it work a little better with the Embeded question Progresss, but even a standard essay question should work. Alternatively, if plugins are not an option, try setting up a database activity for learners to record their thoughts and link to it from the appropriate places in the book resource. This is usually what I do.",

But as soon as users navigate to the next page the (TOC) closes and the Course Index opens. It does matter if you use the TOC of the next/previous buttons. Each time you open a new page the Course Index opens (if you hide it earlier) and you have to unhide the TOC. This is a little annoying to guest users. The book's appearance (Chapter formatting) is set to use indented without Custom titles. Plus the site is set to Allow users to hide blocks. It would be nice to just have an option in the book's appearance to have it always displaying. So users could still hide the block drawer, but the TOC would always display.",

However, on our current version Moodle 4.3.6+ (Build: 20240816) I cannot duplicate the quiz navigation block to close by itself. I seem to recall that action was happening on earlier versions. But if a user closes the quiz navigation block, it remains closed until opened. For our K-5 students especially if in primary grades to have the quiz settings for the quiz navigation block to always display and not in relation to the course block. Not sure if this discussion is happening in the best forum topic and would be better in a (UI) forum topic. Thought there was one, but maybe we are too late to the game. So the roadmap and/or tracker probably is the first step. Not sure if I can be useful in either of those processes because I have never posted or voted on a tracker issue. Basically, just use these to track issues and see what is going to happen in the future. Which for me is retirement from K-12 school district in 3 months. But I will help as much as possible.",

The data should be persistent over years (so not tied to a course but to the school itself) and it should be a living document, which everyone on the staff can edit. My dream is, that after a school conference we do not send an email with the protocol around, but rather during/after the conference directly update the respective parts of the living document and everyone interested will get the email with the deltas (which are the 'protocol') automatically. I currently consider to use a set of Books for this tasks (e.g. one that defines internal procedures, one that defines school wide rules). Is this a valid use case for Books?

The amendment Pages are for the \"Past\" group and should be conditionally displayed to that group only. If there are amendments in \"Book\" resources, then in order to achieve maximum clarity for current students, I would recommend that you update the material in the book, but also create a new amendment \"Page\" with the revised information for the \"Past\" group. Each new amendment should be a separate new Page. If a new amendment replaces a previous amendment, use the date condition to hide the old amendment page from students. That way you can track completion of each amendment separate, and avoid resetting any completions. Label your amendment pages wisely, so you can easily understand the tracking data.",

Each chapter in the book is converted to a \"Heading 1\" style in Word, so you can  then go back into the corresponding chapter in the book inside Moodle, and edit it. You would have to repeat this process for each book though. If you have access to Microsoft OneDrive, it has an excellent text search facility, so if you exported all of your books into Word files in a OneDrive folder, you can search for the terms across all books at once. If this is a regular occurrence, a better approach would be enable and configure the Global search facility on the Moodle site, but this requires significant resources. This would allow you search for terms across all content,  whether in books or elsewhere, directly within Moodle.",

Each chapter usually consists of a header, immediately followed by the embedded video, then a litte text showing the length of that video, that's it. Currently there are 'previous' and 'next' buttons on top of and below the video, what doesn't make much sense to me. I want my students to FIRST see the video and then the interaction buttons. That said: to declutter the page I'd like to remove the top navigation buttons . So it shall look like this . Problem is: the CSS code I can use in the inspector to hide ('display: none;') is the same both for the top and the bottom navigation buttons, so when adding that to my custom CSS, both navigations are gone. Question: How can I avoid that the top navigation is rendered? Which PHP file of the plugin code would I have to edit (if necessary?) Thanks for your support in advance! Stefan",

But firstly, I will share here to get your feedback and then submit to Moodle. My intention is to get as much feedback\nas possible to implement these features with a maximum of value to everybody, and we only can do it together. 1. Back to last visited chapter Would be nice if, when a user back to a Book, moodle redirect them back to the last visited chapter, currently, Moodle always redirects to the first chapter. Click here to see a gif of it working. 2. Enhance Activity completion Currently, the completion criteria it's too much limited, the option \"Student must view this activity to complete it\" only check if the user sees the last chapter, for example, if a book has 10 chapters and the user jump directly to the last page, then\nthis book will be marked as complete. The suggestion here is to add an option that the teacher can choose the required reading percentage to mark the book as complete, like the image below. The result, with a user interacting with the book. Click here to see a gif of it working. 3. Reports, reports, and reports With an enhanced user reading tracker (to be possible the item 2) we can now create a lot of reports, for example, the chapters most viewed, user reading progress and so on. I already made some reports as proof of concept. Final words So... that's all. Please, comment on what do you think about these improvements, I already made it all work, but I think community feedback is important to make it better.",

I completely agree with all of your suggestions, as well as the other suggestions that have emerged in this discussion thread. I have a 3 additional suggestions: In book settings, add an option to \"turn off\" the book title and chapter title. For us, it takes up too much space at the top and is too repetitive. In Navigation style, present an option to not show navigation link at the top of the page (i.e. right now the nav link always shows at the top AND the bottom.) This top nav link isn't necessary because the table of contents appears immediately beside it. Having the option to removing the top nav link would also save space at the top of the page. If possible, include the progress tracking boxes beside each subchapter title so that the student can see which subchapters he/she has viewed (this would be great for people who like to read things non-sequentially). What is the status of implementation of the changes (when will we have access to the new version of Moodle Book)? Many thanks, Leslie",

A button to quickly insert those brackets would be very practical. I'm a bit stuck between two worlds now: a Wiki is great because of these links, but is not easy to print. A book is a like the opposite: nice to print, but lacks the linking. Beste regards, Marc",

If text was copied from Word and pasted into a book a long time ago, for example (before the Atto\neditor cleaned up this content automatically), then this could happen. There are a number of steps you can take to get around this. 1. Open each chapter in the Atto text editor and save it again. Atto will clean up the content when it saves it. 2. If that doesn't fix it, export each chapter individually and identify the one causing the problem. Open that chapter in the Atto editor, go to raw HTML view (expand the first icon in the Atto toolbar (a down-arrow), and then click the last icon\nto see the raw HTML (\"</>\")). Copy and paste the HTML text into an online HTML Tidy website like https://htmltidy.net/ . This might do a better job cleaning it up. 3. If neither works, try installing a plugin to export (and import the book to an ePub (cf. https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=56 ). Then export to ePub, which should ensure the output is valid XHTML . Re-import it into a different book, and export that book into Word format.",

I would like to embed some of my ebooks into a Moodle course, however the end result should be like the kindle reader. Right now my ebook is in the pdf format and if I embed it, students can download it. If I use the book activity, students can highlight the text and copy/paste it. If I convert my ebook into 200 images and insert them as a \"book\", students can rightclick and save it to their computers. Just like when I buy an ebook on Kindle which I cannot save / copy / download, I would like to have this ressource embedded in my Moodle course so that students can access it and read it.

It is a plugin that has a bunch of rather cool little games that link into quiz, glossary and Book. Using Book with questions you might be able to hide the book (available, not visible) and use the game where each question covers a section. Then you can prove they at least viewed every page if you have a question on every page...that might be a lot though. Maybe that's just me, when I create books...well, they're BOOKS. Like Gone with the Wind size books (>1000 pages). Gone with the Wind is shorter than some of my books, to be honest. But I agree with @Shirley...require view. I think maybe book can require view of all pages? But that still doesn't indicate they read it. Maybe add a compulsory \"I agree that I read this information in its totality and I will...\" statement they have to accept to get credit for completion. My old employer had an IT Security course for years that did that--there were three policies and they had to agree to follow the policies and acknowledge their responsibilities before they got credit. If they didn't get credit, they could lose their network access and be fired. A couple people tried the \"I don't agree\" option and...well, it didn't go so well for them.",

I can only seem to change the background colour of the book page when it is behind some text, but what I would really like is for the whole of the book pages to be something, so for example the theme is mainly white, if I could get the book page to be sort of off white, a cream colour or for a border to appear or something, anything really just to mark the difference between the book page and the background theme it is sat on.

Create a place where you want the H5P to display, I have been using Books with sub-chapters , you will come back here later. Create your H5P activity in the hidden topic, make sure you enable the \"Display action bar and frame\" Display Option . Save and display the activity, at the bottom of the activity click on the <> Embed and you will get a popup with some html <iframe> code. Copy that code and paste it into your sub-chapter, I use the HTML function of the Atto editor. You get there by clicking on the down-arrow icon at the top left of the Atto function toolbar, this expands the toolbar and you should now see the </> icon, click on that to activate native HTML editing. Paste the \"<iframe>\" code, save and display.",

I would suggest using a Wiki, but having used them myself, I dropped them due to being too much trouble to create and update the links from one page to another. Another couple of possibilities is the iContent and Simple Lesson plugins. They also have something you could call a, \"table of contents,\" but it is at the top and bottom of the displayed content, so they don't matter as much when viewed on small screens. The nice thing about both, is that you wind up with content that can be displayed like you want in a web conference, the content can be used by the student as a self paced lesson, and both let you include questions. iContent, even acts very similar to a slide show presentation and also lets students keep notes and post doubts (questions) to the teacher.",

I recommend using the moodleBookStartup.dotm Word template I created, that has a set of commands and keyboard shortcuts defined to speed up editing (cf. http://www.moodle2word.net/mod/resource/view.php?id=44 ). In this template, <Ctrl>+8 applies the List Bullet style, and <Ctrl>+9 the List Number style. The screenshot below shows the custom Ribbon and the various built-in and custom styles named so that its easier to use. Shortcuts are displayed when you mouse over a style name. You need to install the template in your Word Startup folder (usually something like C:\\Documents and Settings\\ <your_account>\\ Application Data\\Microsoft\\Word\\Startup\\ ) . See http://www.moodle2word.net/mod/page/view.php?id=16 for instructions on how to do this. This template contains VBA macros, and in some cases, Windows 10 may warn that they contain viruses. They don't, but the digital signature is now out-of-date too, so it makes it more awkward to install. I also recommend using a standard Word style template to apply the same formatting to all documents made. The attached Word style template is one that I use. It does not contain any VBA macros, so you shouldn't have any trouble with it. It should be installed somewhere like C:\\Documents and Settings\\ <your_account>\\ Application Data\\Microsoft\\Templates\\ . You can also just assign your own preferred shortcuts, see instructions at How to Assign Keyboard Shortcuts to Styles in Microsoft Word .",

Here are some suggestions on how to speed things up. Rather than going through the document in a linear way and applying the various different formats as you meet them, go through it multiple times, each time applying a different format: first mark up all the headings, then the bullet lists, then numbered lists, tables, etc. Learn all the keyboard shortcuts you can, avoid using the mouse. You can select a whole set of list items and format them in one step. Theoretically, you could try using Search and Replace to find bullet list paragraphs by their default formatting, and replace them with the named style \"List Bullet\", but I found this difficult to achieve. Set Draft view and turn on the Navigation pane, and turn on the Style Area window so that you can see all the paragraph style names as you are applying the formatting (see screenshot below).",

For instance, you could set up a, Questionnaire activity, with a rating scale question for each page of your book. You could also probably use the Feedback activity, with a similar set up. If you add pages to the book, you will have to \"modify\" your questionnaire or feedback activity to include rating for the new page(s). You could also probably use, Hot Question. With it, you can set up an entry for each book page and let students \"Vote\" for the page. You could also just let the students create the initial entry for each book page and then vote. With Hot Question, if you add a new book page, you can dynamically include it into Hot Question. Note: Since you are probably going to want to keep info about each page of the book in order in Hot Question, you can over ride the \"Vote\" order by setting \"Teacher Priority\" to control the order. Questionnaire and Feedback will require more direct work from the teacher to set up than that required by Hot Question. Personally, if you have a place for testing, I would try out all three, then adopt the \"best\" one. Oh, you might be able to do a rating with the Quiz activity, too.",

For instance, in your book on any given page, you could add a link that would go to an activity, such as Hot Question, to rate the page. The link could be set to open in a new window. In the description of the Hot Question, just in case, you could then have a link to take users back to the correct page of the book.

My SCORM contents do not come from a PowerPoint or anything from Microsoft. They have all been built using an IMS / SCORM editing tool called eXeLearning ( http://exelearning.net ). When importing, each \"slide\" or content from SCORM is just perfect as a book chapter. The problem is the index, as it has an order that has nothing to do with the original. As I read somewhere it seems to follow the order in which it was written in the filesystem, but that's not at all the intention. Additionaly index items have no title, so it becomes quite a mess to look for what title needs to go in each book chapter, and also moving each chapter till it corresponds to the original intention. So, what I need to know is if there is any way, script or not, to have a complete import done the right way.",

          "Text": "Hi René, This is easy to do, and without having to modify the book table of contents code, if you can install plugins. The plugin you will need is the Generico filter. It comes with a sampling of included filter presets, one of which is, Font Awesome. Once you have the Generico filter installed, enabled it, set it to work for both Content and Headings, added it's toolbutton to Atto, go to Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Generico then open one of the empty templates, and Autofill template with a Preset > Font Awesome. To actually use it, edit a page in your Book. Since there is no toolbar for a chapter title, you will need to add the Generico Font Awesome template into the Content area first. Just pick a blank line, click the Generico toobutton, type the name of the font awesome icon you want to use into the icon line pop-up. Make changes as needed to the orientation, size and layout entries, then click insert. Generico will generate and add a line of text into the Content. Cut and paste that line of text into the Chapter title in front of your title text, then finish up by clicking, Save changes. Rinse and repeat as needed for other chapters. If you are going to use the same icon multiple times, it might be faster to make a page with all the ones you want so you can just copy and paste the generated line of text wherever you need it, without having to go through the steps of repetitively creating it.",

In the last, much older, version we had, I was able to display images in a chapter of a book so they moved responsively with the screen size by applying an 'image responsive' setting.  It worked really well. Now our content has been transferred to a new and and upgraded design, the images are all displaying in one long column (image 1 column).  I've checked the settings in the 'edit image' and can't see an option to apply 'image responsive' to each image. How can upload images in a Chapter (the same would apply on a page), so they appear as tiles across the screen (image 2 tiles) and move responsively as the screen size changes in this version of Moodle. In the editing window, they appear as tiles but display in one long column whereas in our older version, they displayed as tiles. I've attached the two images to compare. Would I have to create this activity again or is it possible to amend what has been transferred to the new design? I'm hoping there's an answer Many thanks. Laura",

I managed to cobble together some doe to get it to work, so know it is possible, but teachers won't use that. Is it possible I am missing something that makes this feature just work? Not sure if it is a Book tweak or a O365 repository change. If I use the file picker, go to my  O365 repository, pick my file and choose \"create an alias/shortcut to the file\" it seems OK, but if I then go back to the file I see Path /  and Original unknownsource,repository I update and then get back to the file picked page with no accept or OK button so have to close the window. Back on my Chapter page no code has arrived and Save Changes tells me content is required. We have staff who can do this in BOX, but why not O365? Any ideas please?",

Unfortunately, if you click on the bullet list icon in the Word Home ribbon menu, it applies the formatting, but without applying the correct style name. Overall, the plugin is intended to map named paragraph styles in Word into corresponding HTML elements.

As we want our pdf's to be as small as possible so they travel quickly and that we can use the other free tools available. https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf Upload your file.. then download it.. https://www.idrsolutions.com/online-pdf-to-html5-converter/ Upload and convert. Download the zip file. Set up the \"Orphaning Activities in Moodle\" I used this as a guide Once you have this setup and note before you turn it into an Orphaned Activities Set up an activity \"File\" Note, I found that once I turned this Section into an Orphaning Activity, I had to duplicate the first Activity and go in and edit it for other PDF's I wanted to add into this book. Now you need to upload your Zip file you downloaded from the HTML5 converter Unzip it, it will create the directory you need. Delete the zip after as you don't need it.. Now the tricky bit that took me a little to work out.. I am using chrome.. I had trouble with using the directions in post two. The way its working for me was open Chrome and use the developers tools. you need to look for something like this... moodle/pluginfile.php/671/mod_resource/content/6/WS_TDG_38_17_10_16_compressed/index.html So now we are ready to open another page in the book we are making.. Add the page and insert the code as per post two.. but now we are add in our uploaded file directory.. Copy its link and paste it into this HTML code, substituting the red string <center><embed src=\"yourdomain.com/mod/resource/view.php?id=443#toolbar=1&amp;navpanes=1&amp;scrollbar=1\" quality=\"low\"height=\"540\" width=\"720\" /></center> Note the change in driectory we are pointing to via my example.. I have cut the HTTP: off the front so make sure you have yours in your path.. I also changed the \"540\" to \"740\" Now with luck.. you have your book of PDF's working as HTML5 now.. Working for me..",

I am using Chrome and Moodle 3.1 Atto Drop and drag is not working for me it seems to want to open the pdf in another tab and not leave a link there for me, so I have had to do this workaround. Anyways here is my working version, note working in both Book and Single Page. 1: Load a pdf into the site via the files option and or file picker within the \"Link\" option 2: Going the \"Link\" button, head to \"recent files\". you should be able to see the file you just uploaded. Right click and \"copy link address\" (note this is within Chrome), now that you have this link you can copy it into the Editor or another opened editor you may be using for copy-paste functions. ( I use notepad++ as it keeps any coding clean) 3: Add in the code as above <center> <embed width=\"95%\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://YOURSITE CODE /*.pdf\"></center> Save and it should be showing. Note within this code you are seeing it has a reference to the file actually being within a \"mod_book/chapter\", this is because I have run a test within another area of the site to play with this code. So the file I have chosen is still linked back to that module. This still does work with direct links you may generate. You will also notice that once you save the content and go back to edit it, Moodle will have added some extra code onto the end of it to identify this activity for tracking. example, moodle/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/981727052/silica-lung-factsheet.pdf\" internalinstanceid=\"226 \">",

The export to Word facility is really intended as a temporary facility to enable Teachers to do a once-off export of a Moodle Book to Microsoft Word, so that they can edit it in Word. It is not intended for Students to treat it as a complete and true copy of the Book content. For example, images are not exported in a way that is directly visible to them. If a Teacher wants to make a printable version of a Book available, then I recommend that they export the Book to Word, prepare it (format it with appropriate headers and footers, re-instate images, etc.), and finally save the Word document as a PDF file, and upload that as a separate file beside the Book. You get the best PDF file if you use Words' \"Save As\" command, select \"PDF (*.pdf)\" in the \"Save as type:\" field, click the \"Options\" button, and set the options as shown below:",

I presume it is some sort of \"sheet music\" you want to use. One of the easiest ways I can think of, that I KNOW works in a book, is the Generico filter using tabs and tab items. It can also work just about anywhere you have access to an Atto HTML editor window with file upload capability. The enclosed picture shows an example in a Topic label. The enclosed sample looks the same when used in a book or other type of activities . This example is also using another Generico filter to include the user name embedded in the introduction to personalize the text. The name changes to that of whoever is viewing the activity/page. The added advantage of using this method is that it can become a copy and paste template to use on other pages.",

You can then use the style settings in Word to modify the appearance to your preferences quite easily. For example, you can set the Normal paragraph style to be a sans serif font, and all the styles based on this (by default, almost everything except table cells I think) will have the sans serif font applied. It gets a bit complicated with images though. Although the plugin exports them, you need to run a VBA macro in Word to convert them from Base64 into embedded image format, and at present, Windows Defender thinks the macro is malware, so you need to turn it off to be able to run it.",

I believe you would achieve what you are looking for if you use the Book module instead. Take a look at the link below to see a demo of how this would work. You can see you have the navigation down the left hand side and then the left and right pagination to move through each page in the \"book\". http://school.demo.moodle.net/mod/book/view.php?id=261&chapterid=0 Does this look more suitable to you? You also have the option to enable the Navigation block, if you have not already done so. This will allow you to skip through your existing pages without leaving the page to see navigation. If you click 'Blocks editing on' and then 'Add a block' and select 'Navigation' then the following block will appear for you down the right hand side of your page. I hope this helps. Many thanks.",

It is handy when you want to move a book from one Moodle to another where you can't use Your Course > Settings > Import and don't want to go through the hassle of doing a backup and restore for just one Book file. (Would be a good way for exchanging books with other folks, too.) Open the book you want to copy, then click Generate IMS CP , which will create a zip that needs to be saved. In the course where you want the new copy, create a new book . After you have named it and are then ready to put text on the first page, click on Import Chapter . In the Import dialog window, click the down arrow for Type and select, Each folder represents one chapter . Then click the Choose a file button and go select the zip file your saved and upload it. Once it is uploaded, click on the Import button. After importing and linking, you will have your new complete book. The couple of these I have done this way, had the title of each page there twice, so I edited the Book and selected, Custom Titles , which turned one of them off. Now I try to remember to set it that way when I am creating the new, empty book. By the way, this also works to move books from Moodle 1.9 to Moodle 2.3...and most import to me, the pictures come along to the new location, correctly, which I have had fail with other stuff, sometimes.

I checked and the HTML for each page is identical but on my old version, I had bullets and in the new version, the bullets aren't visible, even though the code is there.

It may not have been migrated over properly. You might need Administrator access to fix it. Something similar happened to me. We have installed the Essential theme, and defined some book customisations on the Essential Theme General page (Site administration > Appearance > Themes > Essential > General) in the Custom CSS section at the bottom. These customisations may not have been copied over when you moved from 3.0 to 3.1. Alternatively, new customisations may be breaking your book appearance. If you don't have Administrator access, you can still fix your problem by adding some CSS directly into your book pages, although it is a pain, and I don't recommend it. Something like the following might work (copied from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11737266/what-is-default-list-styling-css ): \n```text\n<style type=\"text/css\">\ndiv.book_content ul { \n\n\n   list-style-type: disc; \n   list-style-position: inside; \n}\ndiv.book_content ol { \n   list-style-type: decimal; \n   list-style-position: inside; \n}\ndiv.book_content ul ul, div.book_content ol ul { \n   list-style-type: circle; \n   list-style-position: inside; \n   margin-left: 15px; \n}\ndiv.book_content ol ol, div.book_content ul ol { \n   list-style-type: lower-latin; \n   list-style-position: inside; \n   margin-left: 15px; \n}\n\n\n</style>\n```",

          "Title": "Early results of analysing use of the Book module at a University",
          "Text": "G'day All, Last week I gave a presentation at the Australian Moodlemoot titled \"How and why do people use the Moodle Book module\" . The presentation shared some early explorations of how the courses, learners and teachers at one Australian University used the Moodle Book from 2012 through 2015. I'm sharing here in case some of the findings might interest others. I'm also interested in hearing from folk at other institutions who have any insights into whether these findings are similar or very different. This blog post gives an overview of some of more interesting findings, including links to interactive graphs of the data. In summary, Only very small percentages of students tend to read every chapter in most books. Courses using the Book module tend to have large enrollments. Surprisingly, until recently they also tended to have fewer online only students than is common at the university. The median number of Book resource per course was 3 and the median number of chapters per Book was 4 (though there were extremes - 80 books, 100 chapters, over 74,000 words). Almost no-one is using the import chapters functionality David.",

So I went back to the Sandbox, tried different settings, logged out as faculty, in as hypothetical students: one student with navigate set to image. This showed up as arrows only, with the last arrow, on the last page, pointing somewhat downward, not horizontally. a different student with navigate set to text. This had words, and arrows. The word on the last page was Exit. Both those options worked, and the blue check showed up for each student. This took time on my part, logging in, logging out, as my self, then as two different hypothetical students. Not to mention the  time it took, in the past, and now with Moodle update to 3.0, to persistently defend the case of why hypothetical students were needed (weeks, to months; not hours or days!).  So that preliminary work made possible the current resolution to the problem.",

          "Text": "Thanks for the write-up, David. I will let Ordbrand know and we will see what can be done. Students have a number of off-line ebook reader tools to choose from, iBook on the iPad or iPhone, FBReader on Android, Lucifox on PCs with Firefox to name a few. EPUB is the standard vendor neutral format chosen by the international publishing organizations for digital publications, see the International Digital Publishing Forum, http://idpf.org/ , and it is supported by a large number of publishers and tool creators. Publishing is often done to a number of formats at once. Dealing with conversion is easier if the document is well structured and according to format specifications, i.e. it helps to be a bit strict, but when used one should strive to make it less obvious. EPUBs reuse existing web standards , adding a navigational spine to the content, which helps machine reading - think text-to-speech of a multimodal text in the correct order, and a packaging method - EPUBs are regular ZIP archive files, just with an extension of .epub rather than .zip. The current Lucimoo export tool allows only a single book to be exported. Another tool by Ordbrand is Luciwik EPUB/OPDS for Mediawiki (the software which runs Wikipedia). Luciwik lets you export a single article or to select several articles for export to EPUB. You can see an example in the left hand menu at http://far.no/index.php?title=Askeladden_og_de_gode_hjelperne . Luciwik also adds an Open Publication Distribution System book catalog to Mediawiki, allowing discovery of new books either from a web page or by adding the book catalogue feed to ebook readers like Lucifox or FBReader. Perhaps it will be possible to include this functionality in Lucimoo later. The Moodle Book module itself needs a bit of love, e.g. you cannot import a book directly by simply selecting an EPUB file as a resource file and have Moodle/Lucimoo import and display it. To make this happen requires changes to the Moodle Book module itself by its developers.",

I would love to be able to export to the epub format for students, but frankly, I find it unusable. I thought I'd outline my major problems in case they can be easily solved. 1. The font in the the exported epub is far too big, so my epub books are monstrously large (hundreds of pages). Changing the default font settings in my browser (for example) has no effect. 2. Every piece of text in a heading style comes up in the epub table of contents. Really, it would be great if we could choose the heading level. I would be happy if only chapters and sub-chapters came up in the table of contents. 3. Internal links within the books come out as absolute URLs. I use a lot of links so students can go to another part of the Moodle Book for material, academic skills reading, etc. We need to either be able to set up links as relative, or have them edited in the process of exporting. Look forward to any advice or thoughts others might have. Phil Griffiths USQ, Toowoomba, Australia",

          "Text": "Hi, Phil! I have a Moodle 3 site myself, and I find the current version of Lucimoo export is buggy, and needs fixing, at least for some book instances. The main focus of Lucimoo has been on Lucimoo import, rather than Lucimoo export. However, it used to work in Moodle 2. Is your site a Moodle 2.x site, and that case, which version of 2? You  can confirm there  is NO font size set by Lucimoo export by referring to https://github.com/HaakonME/moodle-booktool_exportepub/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=font . This leads me to believe your ebook reader lacks suitable substitution fonts or does not read the stylesheet in the book, and some default font with default sizes are used, and these are too big. Please try to read the exported book in different ebook readers to check if you get different results, or set the font type and size in your reader. H1, H2, H3 and H4 level headings are included at the moment. Configurable number of TOC levels is noted as a wish, but I cannot promise anything at the moment. This might be tricky to accomplish, as the point of Lucimoo export is to export standard, vendor neutral and thus interoperable and valid EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 ebooks, not Moodle books. IDPF is the standard body for EPUB ebooks, and there is quite a bit about how to resolve linking, see http://www.idpf.org/epub/linking/cfi/epub-cfi.html . Thank you for high-lighting these issues, and I hope Ordbrand and I will be able to resolve them.",

I'm in the middle of setting up a Moodle Course and am considering methods of interactivity for participants. I've gone down the route of using two Major Components.  Moodle and Google Apps for Education (free to education programmes in some parts of the world). Although I haven't tried it yet I've been researching the different tools available in each component.  Google Docs via shares in Google Drive allows for live /real time collaboration on documents.  The outcome may be similar to using a Wiki (not greatly familiar with that tool).  The Google Apps for Education gives me control over a set number of Google Accounts which I will set up for tutors and participants (with email redirect). Although a little labour intensive at the start I am able to (manually) create a key folder share for each that when participants take over their accounts, they will have access to.  Within that key folder anything that I create they will see.  I can also give read write capability to one or more sub folders.  So for example, key texts that may be updated along the way I allow folk to view but not edit. Users can be grouped and permissions and levels of editing or viewing can be added or removed for groups as well as individuals.  eg a group for tutors, a group for participants, a group for the examining board.  If a folder is made available to a group it becomes visible to those users, otherwise it remains hidden.  Same with documents. I found it all fairly straight forward to set up and think it will make a nice partner with Moodle. I understand there is direct linking capability between the two as well and I plan to have consistency of login for both, for each user.",

Am not sure if it was intentional not to include the theme css in the print file or not. Anyway for an immediate solution, if you use specific font style when declaring book content in text editor it wont be an issue. As this will effectively overwrite any other formating in both places. If you wish, feel free to create a tracker issue, so it can be further looked into and decided if the theme css can/should be included in the print pages. Thanks",

          "Title": "Semi-Automated Powerpoint to Book Import - Free Macro",
          "Text": "I love sharing! I hope this helps someone (else) With a PowerPoint Macro, it is possible to save your slides and import them directly into Moodle Book using Import Chapter. Attached is the Macro Code, and below you can see step by step how to do it.  Note - This works on PowerPoint 2010 and should work for 2007 but not tested. 0. Load PowerPoint and the PPT file you want to Import into Moodle 1. Now, get Macros enabled on your PowerPoint (You need to see the Developer Tab). You might need admin support for this 2. Click on the Macros button, enter any Macro name (macro999), then click edit 3. Delete any code in the Macro already, and paste in the Macro in the attached file.  For safety sake, you should always check any foreign Macro to make sure it isn't doing anything weird - this one doesn't but check it anyway ps - never edit the macro using Word, or it will mess up the quotes.  Use notepad or notepad++ 4. Before you run the macro, make sure you select the Tools tab, and References.  Make sure you have Visual Basic for Applications, Microsoft PowerPoint nn.n Object Library, OLE Automation, and Microsoft Office nn.n Object Library enabled.  ps nn.n = the version number, so on my PowerPoint 2010 it is 14.0   - You only need to do steps 1 & 4 once per computer, but I think you need to do steps 2 & 3 for every presentation 5. Run the Macro - PowerPoint_ExportSlidesForMoodleBookImport 6. Select your pixel width (for example 600 or 700 or 800) 7. After the Macro completes running, there will be a folder in the same directory as the original PPT file, with the same name as the PPT file.  In that folder will be an HTML page and and .PNG image per slide.  If you just want the pictures, you are all set.  The HTML page is really only there because the Chapter Title comes from the PowerPoint slide title and Moodle needs that (saves you typing it in again!) 8. Create a Zip file, and add all the images and html sorted in Name order (that way the chapters all work fine). If you want any of the slides to be subchapters, rename the HTML files and add \"_sub\" to the end of the name. 9. Now go to Moodle, select the Book you want or create a new one, and select \"Import Chapter\", and upload the zip file.  If you get an error message saying there were no chapters to import, then you created the zip file but forgot to put the HTML and Image files into it. 10. You now have your book imported nicely.  You can import more chapters from another powerpoint file at the end if you want. Finally - should this be stored somewhere within Moodle that is more useful? If yes, please say where and I can include some screenshots to help (once a few people have tested this and ironed out any glitches) All the best!",

          "Title": "Color coding the text of a Book's chapters and subchapters - so I can easily tell them apart",
          "Text": "Hi All I've tried to search Moodle.org on how to do this: I want to color code a Book module's TOC in terms of different color and weight. Specifically, different color and/or weight for the Chapter, Sub-Chapter and for the currently visited Chapter/Sub-Chapter. I think I got it, but not all of it is working. Before applying Custom code.  My TOC looks like this: Observe that the black bold text is the part of the Book ( 1.3 How to change your password ) that I have clicked on. Therefore the black text is the currently visited link of the Book. Notice also the scroll-of-death since the Book module does not have a feature to auto-collapse sub-chapter text. I have no idea why this collapse-feature has not been implemented for the Book module. Perhaps there is a already a Tracker. But I digress... ...as you can see the Chapters and sub-chapter text are the exact same color and weight. The only things to differentiate a Chapter from sub-chapter are UPPERCASE/lowercase, indentation and number coding. My point is that in terms of color, they are identical. Based on this post on StackOverflow , I then applied this code to the Custom CSS of my theme (evolve-D): .path-mod-book .block_book_toc ul > li { list-style: outside none none; font-weight: bold; color: #00137F; } .path-mod-book .block_book_toc li li { list-style: outside none none; font-weight: normal; } Here's the result of applying the CSS code: The difference now is that the Chapters are formatted in bold .  This is definitely an effective improvement because, now, I can better distinguish between a Chapter text and a sub-chapter text. Hooray, but I want to do more! I don't suppose anyone knows how to make the color of the Chapter text and the sub-chapter text different? Despite the advance I have made in differentiating Chapter text from sub-chapter text, I am unable to make the sub-chapter text as a different color, for example black, whilst maintaining the Chapter text as blue. Any help or assistance would be appreciated. Regards Frankie Kam, Malaysia",

The structure can be made to be similar to a Book in that each page can be navigable using a table of contents with forward and back buttons. Unlike the Book though, you can have a question (there are various types) on each page (if you wanted a quiz, have a number of pages together). You can also have branching within the activity based on the answers to these question so personalisation of content is possible. While I do have to admit that the lesson is not quite as slick as a book, it is an extremely flexible tool when delivering content as questions can be asked at key points to aid student understanding so it could very well be an option for you.

          "Text": "The Book activity, to me, is a much needed strip down of the Lesson activity. I have a lot of experience with the Lesson activity, and have aired my frustrations multiple times. The fact is, no one on the development side of the coin is interested in pursuing any improvements in the Lesson module, and frankly I don't think they should. It's cluttered and clumsy and filled with oblique settings and behaviors. I wish I didn't have whole courses built out of them. I think a far superior option would be to have someone on the Book development side look into how to allow questions from the Question Bank to be inserted direclty into Books in the same manner that they're inserted into Quiz pages. Imagine that in addition to inserting a chapter or a subchapter, you could add a question page. When you click the \"Add a question\" button, you are given a variant on the \"quiz building\" screen, which would allow you to see the question bank. The page that would appear in the Book's content section would look like a page from a quiz. Maybe you could limit it so that there could only be 3 questions per page, or something, and allow the student to easily skip them should they want to (for reviewing materials later on, for instance). The singular advantage I see to this approach vs. how the Lesson behaves, is that you can easily create sets of questions that are usable for practice right beside sets of questions for assessment, INSIDE the Question Bank. As it is right now, questions inside Lessons are created in different formats, they live only in the Lesson itself, and have different settings compared to questions in Quizzes -- none of the improvements in the question engine from Moodle 2.0 are reflected in the Lesson activity. If I want to use the same type of question twice or change it later, I have to make it twice and change it twice (one in the QB, once in the Lesson). Imagine creating a set of 5 great assessment/quiz questions, and being able to duplicate all 5 and modify the numbers or phrasing. In 10 minutes you've made 5 great practice questions that can be embedded right beside the content that teaches the concept. I have never included Lessons in the Gradebook, and think it's not a feature I personally would ever use, so I don't necessarily see it as being useful in a Book version of the same functionality. For instance, it would seem very easy to implement only one set of what are currently quiz behaviors so that all questions in Books behave like, for instance, \"Interactive with Multiple Tries\" quiz questions, so that they're clearly interactive, multiple try, learning experiences, that the student can CHOOSE to engage with, without fear of point based retribution or risk. They could be skipped or included as part of the \"Print book\" functionality. I don't have the staff or the personal knowledge to implement this type of thing, but if it weren't for the Lesson activity's ability to pose interactive questions to students and the Book's lack of same, I would be using Books all of the time to present content. Thanks for listening to me rant!",

I used WordPress smashingly on the presentation side of things. However, quiz tracking was so impractical as WordPress doesn't have any good gradebook implementation that I've found.

If I'm wrong about that, lemme sum it all up, and repeat myself: \"Lessons are horrible, and I wish I didn't have whole courses built out of them.\" After my post above, I did exchange some messages with the people in charge of the Book module development. I proposed the idea of a separate activity called an Interactive Book that would accomplish essentially what I outlined above. Their response wasn't encouraging, and mentioned that the question of including that type of functionality came up during the Book's development, but was removed in favor of straight content presentation. I don't want to get too pedagogical, but that attitude severely hampers learning by limiting student-to-content interactivity. The Book is clean and easy to use, and presents information very nicely. But presenting information is not teaching . If there was a way to add interactivity, it would be a powerful teaching tool. Again, I don't have the knowledge or the manpower to do this myself. But I figure if I keep being annoying about it, someone somewhere will think it's a good idea. I might write up a design document at some point as a bump. Thanks again...",

          "Text": "Beatriz, Matt, Tim and Brendan At least four people now! I have read the above posts with great interest.  I have a couple of courses I've written in Moodle Book with the idea that students had an online textbook to study and support what we were doing at school.  The flexibility with media types I understood at the time to mean \"interactive\" but then I was new to teaching and learning and now realise that this is just a different mode of delivery of content. So when talking about interactive, we really mean that the student interacts with the knowledge and constructs meaning from it. When I read a text, I realise that I now ask my own questions during this process to make sense of what I am reading.  This is a skill that has taken me many years to develop but is made considerably more efficient by having the author or expert pose the questions as many do in any decent textbook. Formative assessment works well when a student then has immediate feedback on their constructs of meaning.  Moodle does this in various ways.  The book provides content, lessons provide a delivery of content through a web of choices (basic questions) and quizzes give the tutor the chance to elaborate excellent resources and foster a robust remote environment for guided learning. I suppose you could argue that what glues this all together then is the moodle course page itself and the learner can flip in and out of the activities . But wouldn't it be nice to have self assessment questions and reading quizzes embedded in the book activity so that you don't have to leave the book to take a quick test to see how well you're doing? Alternatively, is there not a simple way of bringing all these activities together in a sequential and seamless fashion so that the learner is unaware that they are flipping in and out and from one activity to another? Maybe that would be the solution - a navigation tool that reads a half chapter of the book, takes the user to a reading quiz and (wish list here!) depending on their score or confidence level, go back to another part pf the book or continue to the next book section. Moodle seems to be on the verge of creating a very powerful tool for learning.  All the bits seem to be there already ... they just need to be joined up in a way that the learner is unaware of or responsible for how they are taken between activities and can therefore concentrate on the important bit; learning process itself.",

Brendan posted something else in a separate discussion about using Wordpress and LTI to do something similar, but I'm not sure if he actually pursued that. It would be worth trying if you're interested in splitting your systems, or already have -- something we've done, and something I regret. I was very surprised to come back to this page and see people responding to my original posts. Sometimes I feel like a little yapping dog in the dark, you know? Hahaha...I posted a similar long-winded, \"oh, why doesn't he just stop?\" rant over in the Lessons vs. Quizzes thread ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=207365 ), which just summarizes my feelings that the Question Bank (even without the improvements that are slated for 2.8, I think, or maybe they're in 2.7 -- we're still on 2.6) is a great tool, or more generally the question types plugins. When I move between Questionnaires, Quizzes, and Lessons, it just gets me rankled that I have these questions stored in 3 different formats, and fixing that problem, it seems to me, would be the same as figuring out how to use quiz questions in the Book activity. So I have my pedagogical gripes (see posts above), and I have my \"isn't this just annoying?!\" gripes. But Tim's post still holds true, as far as I know -- there's been no movement on the Tracker issue he mentioned, and I've seen nothing to indicate the (great and wonderful) dev group is doing anything in this arena. What I have seen is discussions about things like Survey 2 that are still on the path of storing unique question types inside the Activity itself, which is just more of the same as far as I'm concerned. But beggars can't be choosers, and if I was serious about it I would get my boss to pay someone to do something about it, or learn PHP and start staying up late. Thanks, everyone!

So, you can consider yourself as a lucky (really lucky) guy if the older module continues working after having performed one downgrade. Please don't do that ever! Correct approach should be to: 1) install/upgrade new version in test server 2) test, test, test 3) if everything is ok, upgrade real (production) server 4) if there are problems, report them in the Tracker. but, never (and I repeat, never! ) try do downgrade to older versions of Moodle plugins !

I think I saw one in the Intro course that there is a benefit to bringing a page in, rather than just linking to a page or website.  In case the link gets broken, or a PRD goes off the internet, etc., etc. It seems standard practice to just link to websites however. I'm wondering if it refers specifically to a PRD that you download from a site, the upload into your Moodle course, so if it ever 'goes away' you still have the resource on your course.

With pdf files just: 1. save as HTML 3.2 [*.htm,*.html] or export/HTML/HTML 3.2 - remember there will be both a .htm file and an images folder created 2. zip the .htm file and images foler and upload to the Moodle course Files 3. unzip 4. now you can import into the Moodle book - after browsing to the course File folder just choose the htm file and click on import Note - if you don't upload both the htm file and the images folder the images will be lost. Hope this solves this part of the problem for you! Cheers, Tony",

After import I see that all ordinary links to chapter1 are relinked to moodle (and look like \"http://localhost/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1&chapterid=1\"  but links which contain ancors are  imported like \"http://localhost/moodle/mod/book/chapter1.html#section1\" and lead into the void (404 error).

If not, are there any workarounds you have used successfully which students can use to test (and check) their knowledge within a Book module? Thanks!",

You'd have to rely on some form of funky work around or making some changes to the Book module code. A look in the Book tools part of the plugins database doesn't reveal anything that might help. Wonder if there are any other workarounds out there in the wilds? I'm in the early stages of thinking about how the content for a Book module might be linked to version control software (e.g. git ). But even then I'd been thinking of the need for the book to be updated to reflect changes in the repository. But you've got me thinking now.",

Basically these are accesskeys, but also some other things. So these modifications have to be done on each update... At theming side it is not possible to have the theme using accesskeys, you have to modify the core. Our layout does only use 2-columns, hiding of blocks is disabled and each course does have the same basic layout. What we have additionally done some months ago was to include some more accessible themes for visually impaired (high contrasts are used; black-white, white-black, blue-yellow; based on accessibility switching theme from Moodle theme section).

Here is a good article: http://www.brightcookie.com/2011/02/book-v-lesson/ I have a quick question for Mary and other Lesson gurus though. Is there any advantages (or disadvantages) in terms of \" accessibility \" between the Book module and Lesson module? Have these two tools been heavily tested against some of the mainstream screen readers such as JAWS? Can we say Book (in general) is more accessible than Lesson module (or are they equally good)? Also is the PDF file generated in Book module considered as \"accessible\" PDF files? Thanks! Wen",

The only way I know to import from a Word HTML file is the text and formatting will come through and then there will be shapes with a little icon in them for the images. These shapes then have to be connected to the image file in Moodle.  The Word html type of document that seems to import most easily in the book is the single file web page.  It doesn't have a separate folder of all the images. If I am not the one who created the document, I also save a regular Word web page doc. This folder with files and folders inside will have an image folder where they images are the same name as they will be on the imported page.  I find the image folder in that folder on my computer.  Then, in the editing window, I right click on the one of the shapes and go to the insert/edit image link (or use the image link on the toolbar).  On the popup, there will be a http address in the first window with the image name at the end of it.  Mine usually seem to be image001.png.  I then click on the icon on the end of that line so I can upload the image from my computer. I find it in the web page/image file, click on it and go through the upload process.  When I save the new address in the image popup window, the image will appear in the editing page of book chapter. It's a little tedious if there are a lot of pictures, but because I have the image names and the image folder to match against, it goes pretty quickly.  I haven't worked with links to out side pictures before, but if the link is there, you probably need to just renew it was well. I hope that helps.",

          "Text": "This is just a really quick note Marcus, only asking about one thing. Who says all scrolling is bad?  If you are reading, then is it a problem to scroll down? The Scroll of Death typically in Moodle is scrolling to find what you want, constantly, often because the position of the navigation and it's structure is not optimal, or the functionality is not being used (like single section layouts) etc. For example, in this page,  we have nice Menus at the top, but generally, to get to ANY admin function, we need to scroll.  Unless you click to close other menus, in which case you then loose that navigation they provide.  This is the scroll of death.  Scroll is OK in other respects Here is a comment from the wonderful people at 'Adapt': Innovations in design Adapt isn't just a fresh take on an e-learning framework, it also offers an innovative approach to design and course navigation and incorporates, what we think, are several exciting developments: Components instead of templates - pages are constructed by combining a wide range of interactive components in any number and mix required. Removing unnecessary navigation - It makes sense to keep all related content together and to only navigate somewhere new when the content demands it, not when the designer has run out of room on the screen. To make this possible we've implemented a scrolling page layout which leverages much of the latest thinking in web design into the world of e-learning. For example, previous 'sacred cows' of web design such as no content 'below the fold' are now being challenged as we now design for a more web-savvy audience. Preferences - Not sold on scrolling page layouts? No problem, more traditional linear layouts are just as easy to implement. https://community.adaptlearning.org/mod/page/view.php?id=20 I'm not actually sure why you say \"I've had to scroll to the bottom of the page . . .\" -Derek",

Make sure this opens in a New Window. You'll then have a link, from the address bar. Use this as the new URL for your video - If you want full screen, you might have to tweak the video-code a bit - You can then delete that resource from your Course Home page The new URL needs to contain 'pluginfile', not 'draftfile', so this one will work: `http://moodle.bournville.ac.uk/pluginfile.php?file` but the version below just tells Moodle to display, or embed the image on the page \n```text\nhttp://moodle.bournville.ac.uk/draftfile.php\n \nfile=/211540/user/draft/992492675/SatNav.jpg\n```\n I think it's because within the Book Resource, the properties of Open Media, or Open Link are restricted, so the student is not tempted to go 'outside-the-book'. Everything that they need, is wrapped inside the book, so to speak Hope this helps Cheers Anne",

If you want moving pictures with (or without) sound, it has to be an mpeg3, or something similar like a .mov file. Perhaps the thing to do, is practice on a little video clip, that you know works fine (I made one of the washing machine that lasted 10 seconds, but it had sound and some movement) And then I played about with different file-types, compression, file-size, etc. Also, the recording device needs to be set up to capture the best quality available Re: Efficiency Common sense would say, don't make a copy just have a link to your private files. But I think it is also about attaching all the required resources to your book, so that it is self-contained. If at a later stage, you decide to copy the whole thing into another course - or perhaps even share it with another tutor, they might not have access to your private files You might want to consider storing very large files in 'the cloud', maybe Dropbox or Google Drive. But sometimes it good to just push at the boundaries of Moodle to see what it can handle... Have fun...",

With our courses, student cohorts get their own instance of a course in each study period, which requires courses to be cloned from study period to study period (works fine, generally). The root cause was that the media that was inaccessible was uploaded to the book as part of course ID 345 (specific ID not important) then at the end of the study period that course was then copied using the moodle web-service to course ID 678 (again the specific ID isn't important). The content of the book was included in the copy/clone, but it was using the previous courses details through the m_files table, the m_context table and into m_course_modules. My understanding of the \"new\" moodle data file system structure and concepts were that new links to this media should be created directly to the content when the activity was cloned, rather than simply copying the old link. Students in course id 678 have no rights to view content added to course 345, so this is why the link is inaccessible at this point to the students. Is this a bug or has something else happened? Happy to raise a tracker issue if this is believed to be a bug.",

Place pictures with text in cells of a table. - Can have alignment problems. Add text caption to the picture using a photo editing program such as GIMP. - Caption becomes part of the picture. My favorite is to use Snagit. It costs money but is pretty cheap. It does have a free trial version so you can try it out to see if it does what you want. It has hot keys to bring it up at any time and lets you capture from the screen and does just about anything you want to, to the resulting picture. You can mark on the picture, add a caption, watermark your picture, make fancy edges and borders, etc. HTH , AL",

A tip when using Jing (or similar) is to place a blank (Word?) page behind the image on your screen, but sticking out under the image.  That gives you a white space to place your caption on, if you don't want the caption on your actual image.

Although, I couldn't find a solution in moodle to do it faster and using just a text editor. So, what I'm doing is using HTML tags. The <figure> allows me to use the <img> tag with the <figcaption> attribute to set up the legend. With this resource, is possible to see the legend bellow of the image (default visualization of captions) just in case your image is aligned alone in the line. If you choose to use text aside the image, your caption will take the same alignment then the text. This is an example of <figure> tag use: <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"> <img src=\"http://omg.sistemaar.com.br/draftfile.php?file=/3625/user/draft/834728035/projeto_grafico.png\" alt=\"Alt de Figura SistemaAR\" height=\"62\" width=\"800\" /> <figcaption>Fig1. - Um Exemplo de Sistemar.</figcaption> </figure>",

At the moment the next/previous arrows are pretty small and not all that obvious. In addition, students often ignore the contents list block on the left as they just assume its the standard navigation block. These problems lead to them not realising that there's more than one page of content, or how to move through the content. Are there any obvious ways of helping the situation? I thought of: - a \"you are on page 1 of 14\" indicator - changing the next/previous icons to larger arrows with \"next/previous\" written on them Any advice or suggestions much appreciated.",

My school wants to have a printable version of the placement tests, the reasons are not important here. I have read the discussions about printing quizzes and I know there exists no straight solution yet. So I thought the book module would be an alternative, the placement tests consist of only 4-5 short fill-in-the-blanks-texts and I could do it. My first idea was that, since the book has a HTML editor, the cloze-text for the cloze-questions (I mean of the kind soc{1:SHORTANSWER:=ial} ) would be transformed by the book into a cloze-text. But this is not the case. I found another rapid and satisfactory way to create blanks, but I am wondering why the HTML-Editor does not \"understand\" the cloze-code but it does understand the embed code of YouTube videos, for instance. I think I will use the book module in the future and would like to know in advance if there are some elements I cannot embed in it. Thanks and regards, Beatriz.",

To get more control of your visual layout you could import images into pages of your book, or abandon that approach and use pdf documents which can be sized and shaped to fit your designs and images will remain where you have placed them. I sometimes export a presentation (ppt/keynote) as a series of images and put them in a lightbox gallery as it gives you the ability to rapidly flick around a presentation. If the presentation is set to be the size you want the images, then the exported images should by default be the size you want on screen.",

I managed to turn the book from my Green ICT course into a printed book \" Green Technology Strategies \". I then realised I could create a Amazon Kindle format ebook as well, reasonably simply. I discovered that this process does very little to the HTML generated by Moodle. It just changes from one verion of HTML to another, adds some XML housekeeping files and zips the whole lot up in a file. The Epub format appears to be simialr to the Kindle format, but using a different version of HTML and XML different houskeeping files.

          "Text": "Hello, everyone! The Swedish developer Ordbrand has helped me take a dream to reality by adding extensions for book catalogue and book distribution using the open and vendor neutral OPDS - Open Publication Distribution System - as well as exporting to the open and vendor neutral EPUB 3 directly from Wikipedia's software Mediawiki. If Moodle adopts EPUB 3 as its book format, you are doing us all a great favour. This is an important issue, as EPUB 3 is set to replace PDF and DAISY to grant universal accessibilty or inclusive reading if you like. EPUB 3 makes it possible to navigate all content, get text-to-speech, zoomable illustrations with SVG , change text contrast on the fly and a lot of other goodies. Ordbrand develops the ebook reader Lucifox add-on for Firefox , Luciwik OPDS and LuciwikEPUB for Mediawiki, Nikolay Pultsin develops FBReader for Android phones and tablets, and LibreOffice has a \"Send to\" Mediawiki function, meaning you can write off-line and upload to your wiki when you are ready. The first warp speed collaborative ebook experience using Ordbrand's extensions is now live at http://far.no/index.php?title=Spesial:Luciwik and details about what you can do is more detailed in my blog at http://friends.gnutelephony.org/display/haakonme/12315 All software mentioned is Free (as in freedom) software under GNU license terms and available at no cost too . With OPDS and EPUB 3 in Moodle, you support open and vendor neutral production, distribution and consumption of books. We can put books in students pockets by hitting \"Save\".",

I then inserted each slide as a page content titling each page as the slide number. Then in \"Content 1\" I put \"Previous\" - jump to previous and \"Content 2\" - jump to next. I'm not sure this is the most efficient way to do this, but it works. I'm using 2.5.1 If you need to change the content of just one slide in PowerPoint, then when you select Save As... you get the option to save the entire presentation or just the one slide.

I did several tests with lower versions of Moodle 2.2 and it was possible to print the book in all of them.",

Use the lesson module instead.  Just keep it simple.  You will not have the print all feature you have in the book. If you have a computer you could set up a local moodle on ( Bitnami .org has a nice little package that's pretty easy to use), you could set up a higher version, build your book and then save it as an IMS file.  It will download a zipped file of the book content which you can drop into the IMS content package . It will open up and can be read. It will have a table of contents on the side and navigation buttons.  It will not print the entire book though.  You will not be able to edit the content in the IMS, you will have to go back to the standalone and edit it there.

My question is if the IMS content package created by exportimscp can be imported to another (IMS-compatible but not Moodle) LMS? Seems to me that if it really generates an IMS package according to the standard is should. I have many very simple books (with embedded Flash files) that need to be created in standard format (my client's requirement) so they are usable (sellable) by other major LMSs.  I can create them nicely in Moodle (and prefer to author there as Moodle will continue to be the main LMS) and would like to avoid additionally regenerating them in an external authoring package.

Doing it this way means I have only one place where I have to make updates if I need to make changes to the book contents. The down side is that students have to enroll in all the different resource classes they happen to use. I have mine set up for self enrollment and the enrollment key is listed in the classroom assignment description. Like you, I sometimes wind up with a book that would have an extremely long TOC. I break it up into separate books. I make one book the TOC for all the separate books and link to them via URL's. It is even possible to have links that go to ANY page in a book because it's URL contains both the book ID and chapter/subchapter ID. Hope this helps, AL",

We have tried: Backing up each book in 1.9 to restore into an existing course (merging) or new course in Moodle 2.2 Exporting the book from 1.9 as an IMS package, but adding it to the Moodle 2.0 course makes it un-editable and we cannot see an option to import into a book (the docs says ‘Import Chapter’ for 2.3, but we don’t see that option) Putting the books into Equella (file repository) to somehow link to them (with no success) This is now an urgent issue.

The following are a few sneak peek illustrations. For book editing purposes it may be convenient to show and edit a few pages at a time.  The pages may be rendered aligned, or indented or in a collapsible treeview As can be seen in the illustrations above nested headings and numbering can be added to format page titles. The headings and numbering are optional per view instance and are generated by the view if enabled. For book browsing/reading, the number of pages per page can be set to 1 and a TOC can be added. The following illustration demonstrates rich content TOC label by adding to each toc label an image of  the page author. There are still some issues to sort out but in the meantime any thoughts, suggestions or requests are welcome.",

I click the update button and it goes back to regular TinyMCE view.  Still fine. I click the \"Save Changes\" button and all of a sudden the first paragraph (<p>Business Administration Core:</p>) has been changed into a link.  Later on in the same page where the words \"Business Administration Core\" appear again (without a link), the words are also changed into a link.

Create a backup file of just the book content from the 1.9 course 2. Put the backup file in a file repository 3. Restore the file into the appropriate 2.3 course, merging the content 4. Move the book resources in the outline if necessary You could create all of the book backup files prior to upgrading the Moodle site if you don't intend to maintain the 1.9 site separately.",

In Moodle 1.9 the option was just under 'Chapter numbering' and icons were sitting at the top of each 'page', but in Moodle 2.1.6 it isn't there? This was a really handy feature and part of the reason we installed the Book module. We will be upgrading soon so that will resolve our issue, but I did a search and it looks like this was a bug that affects 2.0, 2.1 & 2.22... Here is a forum discussion (which is talking about and Moodle 2.2.4): http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=208252 but if you go to the Moodle Tracker link: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-33262 and read the comments, Helen Foster advises \"... unfortunately Moodle 2.1.6 is supported for security fixes only.

This is how I fixed it: Open the file mod/book/lib.php and edit lines 261 and 264. The modified lines should be: $action = new action_link($url1, get_string('printbook', 'book'); $action = new action_link($url2, get_string('printchapter', 'book') ); In this way, the text whole book or the chapter that the user has selected will be opened in the same browser window, keeping all the menu options.

You can do so in the following way: \n```text\n \n\n\n\n// Original path\n\n\n\nmod/book/tool/print/pix/book.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// Path in theme\n\n\n\ntheme/mytheme/pix_plugins/booktool/print/book.png\n```\n When looking for an overriding image the following path is used. 1. theme (static) 2. themename => mytheme 3. area => pix_plugins for plugin images, pix_core for core images, pix for theme images. 4. plugin type => booktool 5. plugin name => print 6. file name => book It then searches for the image with the following extensions gif, png, jpg, jpeg in that order. Hope this helps. Its not always the easiest thing to work out, I myself had to look at code to remind myself how it all worked. As such I've updated http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Themes_2.0_How_to_use_images_within_your_theme#Overriding_plugin_images with this information as well. Cheers Sam",

Lesson module is not really maintained, some features are not working as expected (ppt import) and connection to questions are not implemented (this was an old plan when quiz questions were seperated from quiz module). Lets try to discuss the requirements and to initiate new development and funding for such a project. Ralf",

Lesson activity is very frustrating to use, in my opinion, but I like the ability to stop and ask questions and deliver feedback, which seems to be something not available in Books. Am now embarking on a reading-fest on the forums and elsewhere to find out if anyone has anything to say on the matter. Did you get anywhere on this? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Our institution is using, AFAIK , Moodle 2.1. I need to import a mini-website into Moodle as a Book. The 'site' is actually an old WebCT Learning Module, consisting of a bunch of HTML docs, images and a common CSS file, all in one directory. I might be missing something obvious, but I can't find out how to import this. There's a UCL guide on importing (PDF) but that must be for an older Moodle version as it refers to an import option when you click the red cross to add a new chapter which isn't there. There's Creating a Book on Moodle Docs which refers to an Import link which doesn't exist. There's zip on the Book Module page on Moodle Docs. The Procedure for setting up a Book pdf is a pretty good guide to creating chapters from scratch but doesn't mention import. I can see no import options in any of the Book dialogues. According to a review of the Book Module \"Book has also the ability to mass import content\" but it doesn't say how this is achieved. On a title scan of this forum I can't see anything about importing, and searching for \"import into book\" doesn't produce anything useful, at least on first scan. I'm getting rather lost in docs. Could some kind soul please point me towards relevant docs, and/or explain how sites can be imported? I really, really do not want to be cutting and pasting HTML code as I'd have to rebuild links to images, docs and stylesheets. Mercy buckets Cheers Fred",

          "Text": "Hello, I am not a web designer, by far, so maybe what I am going to ask may sound silly for some of you, but you could spare me from a lot of time looking into W3School CSS tutorials, trying to find out what is failing. I have customised the Book module so that it can print an introductory text for our programme plus the log of our University, as it is displayed in the screenshot I attach. In order to do, in th file print.php, I have added the following the text, for the headers of book and chapter: <div id=\"logo\"> <h1> <span id=\"css\">University of Dundee </span> </h1> <h2>Master in Diabetes Care and Education</h2> </div> and logo image is added in the print.css file as: body { background-image:url('./images/logo_white.gif'); background-repeat:no-repeat; background-position:right top; position: relative; margin-right:200px ; It is working (I don't know if this is the smartest way of doing it, but it was the easiest way for me to learn how to do it). However, as you can see the log is not aligned with the text. As you can see, the logo is too close to the top margin of the page, and the right marging. I can move it closer to the centre of the page changing   margin-right, but I don't know how to move the logo down, as margin-top: 20x only moves the text. Should I add the logo as image , like: div.img { ; } in printer.css and then adding in printer.php: <div class=\"img\"> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"index.htm\"><img src=\"/images/logo_white\" alt=\"logo\" width=\"110\" height=\"90\" /> What are the right attributes to align the logo (on right corner, top) with the text 'University of Dundee Master in Diabetes Care and Education' Thank you very much for your advice.",

Sadly I did not see this post that Petr was updating the book module until after the fact. Also, I am not a php programmer nor a true moodle developer... That being said, I have created a new version of the book mod that should work for now, until the official version is created. The code is in shape enough to test out, but I'm not sure you should go live with it. I've attached it here. You should untar the file in the mod directory. If you have your book database files pulled over with your moodle 2.0, it should just work.... (i think).... I'd appreciate any comments or feedback. (For example I haven't tested it for permissions for all variety of teachers/students/aids/etc, nor have I got the nav bar completely set up). ... but, if you want to see your books somewhat working on moodle 2.0, this may do it. good luck to everyone, and if it helps you let me know. cheers jim PS.

This requires an option to disable TOC in module as column to avoid two columns. TOC as part of navigation block. This makes the most sense for me.

Are you using Moodle 2? Is it now possible without giving students acces to other things? I've said before that Book seems to me so much more user-friendly and intuitive for students to use to create collaborative projects than Wikis or Databases. Have you managed to allow collaborative editing? Or is it just each student his own Book? Cheers, Glenys",

For example a teacher can override a specific book to be edited by specific students. The same teacher could also allow all books on a course to be edited by students. It's really handy. It allows students to be come creators of activities not just consumers. The only problem at the moment seems to be that resources cannot carry a grade. This makes sense as it's activities which are normally graded in Moodle. The book module does act more like an activitity than a resource though. I've heard rumours that book will be absorbed into Moodle core at some point. If that happens it would be great to see a grading option. I'm also looking at an export option within the book module which would allow exporting books as .epub files so books can be read offline on kindles, ipads and similar devices. Mike",

Description:  When using the Moodle HTML editor and viewing the \"finished\" chapters and book within Moodle, the formatting looks quite fine (e.g., font types, font colors, background font color).  However, when going to \"Print this chapter\" or \"Print book\", there is extra \"white space\" (such as a full line break) as well as some of the coloring seems to \"bleed over\" into other paragraphs. Checking the HTML code within a web browser ( IE and Firefox ) which was drafted using LibreOffice and even exporting into PDF format, things look fine and correct. Examples can be produce via screen shots upon request.  Thoughts and comments are welcomed.  Thanks in advance.",

All were in the same course by coincidence and contained some large video files (>64MB). On the server , delete the offending books from that course in the moodledata folder, go back to the notifications page, click the refresh button, then the upgrade button, moodle then upgraded the book module successfully. I'm not sure that this is a standard approach but it seems to have worked ok this time & apart from the large quicktime files we are at a loss as to why there was a problem. Any ideas?

However, any resource or activity you create in a course has a web url.  So you can do what you want to do - cross link to an assignment or forum. 1. Create an assignment or forum in the standard manner. 2. Right-click on the link to the assignment or forum and copy the link location.  This usually works - if not, open the assignment or forum and copy the resulting link that appears in your browser address bar. 3. Go to the Book you are creating.  Add text, such as \"Upload your assignment here.\"  Select the text and click on the editor link icon (chain link).  Paste the copied url in the link box.

Using Groups does not solve the problem either because both groups still see the same exam.  The only thing Groups will do for a quiz activity is allow the teacher to view the group results separately. The real (but complicated) solution to this is to use Groupings of Groups.  Then you create two different quiz activities (each with a different time limit), but each grouping will see only one quiz - the quiz for their grouping.  You still have the problem of the book link to the quiz.  To make this really work, you would then have to create two books, one for each grouping, with a link to the appropriate quiz activity. Groupings of Groups is very powerful, but can get a little messy.  I've used it for a music course that had Men's Chorus, Women's Chorus and Mixed Choir.  We were able to tailor what each student could see in the course by creating various Groupings of the three groups. It will be interesting to see if anyone else has a suggestion. Floyd",

User saves, all is well. If the user wants to re-edit the page and subsequently re-edit the code, the HTML source box appears, but nothing else- the user cannot see the code, nor can code be entered. The user can no longer access the code to the page in the book. The user can move, maximize and close the box using the header bar on the box, so the box is not frozen. We have replicated this on different Moodle installs, and it appears only to happen within the Book module - the HTML source box is acting appropriately on other pages, activities , etc.",

If you run into errors, use your PHPMyAdmin (or an SQL manager) to delete the 2 book tables. Also, go into your Logs Display table and delete any references to the book module (normally the last things that will appear) Now, rerun the admin. Everything should work fine. Dave",

Theses references were the only one referenced in the errors 1062, duplicate entry which stop the success of the book module install. I have tried this process repeatedly and carefully but the table keeps getting recreated and then the same errors come up rather than it recognising that it is a fresh request. My question is, Is there any other configuration I should be aware of to change considering that the wrong version of the book module was a higher version meant for 2.+ rather than 1.9+, and has it left some unwanted residues somewhere??

I once caught myself working/making changes in the wrong database on a server that had five different Moodle installations on it. I kept wondering why my changes were not making any difference till I realized what I was doing. Another possibility - I had a similar problem once. I fixed it by changing the version number in the module I wanted to install so that its version was one digit higher than the one I wanted to replace. Moodle then would perform the \"upgrade\" to the \"new\" version. Just had to remember and redo it it when I updated versions of Moodle later until I did a new from scracth install.

Where the Book module finally sends its main content out to be rendered (and I don't know exactly where that is) the code could be modified to first pass that material through function glossary_filter($courseid, $text) located in mod/glossary/filter.php. This will insert the necessary HTML code for Glossaries that are available on the highest (site-wide) level, as well as for Glossaries that are specific for a specified Course. Such a Glossary could be created for a dummy Course, and the corresponding $courseid could then be supplied as an argument for the function. This might be a satisfactory solution for many purposes. Can anyone on this forum give a more exact suggestion about where in the Book module code to make such a change?",

Unfortunately the file size is too great to upload to this forum but if anyone is interested please email me at frances.hill@oldham.gov.uk and I'll send you a copy. We are currently using 1.8.2 (yes, we need to upgrade!) but hopefully the procedures will still be valid for later versions.",

I've also found that in the past, we would have a requirement, and then select a \"tool\" or \"Module\" that is as close a fit as possible to our requirement, just to find out months down the line that maybe it was the wrong choice. I'm not sure what exactly you want to use the book module for, but maybe it would be worthwile to look at some other modules that may be a better fit for your particlular requirement, especially now that you have had difficulties with the book, that should have highlighted a few additional requirements that you may not have been aware of untill they became an issue. (like ease of adding swf for instance) I would not go as far as to say Moodle is primitive, there are some terrible products out there, I'm thinking of one specific money pit that nearly crippled us, DNN. Supposedly one of the best CMS's out there, yeah right!?!? that dinosaur cost ous thousands of dollars in wasted time. Moodle is thus far the most stable CMS that I have worked on. To date I have only ever had one error message, and that was a 404 which was entirely my fault.",

Here's how: Code for embedding a swf file into a Moodle page. Load the swf file to the course using the File option in the Admin block. Once it has loaded, right click on the swf file and select ‘Copy Shortcut’. Turn on editing and go to the Topic or section you want to display the swf file and click on the ‘Edit Summary’ icon. In edit mode, switch to HTML view and paste in the following code: <embed src= “ Paste the copied shortcut to swf file here” width=\"550\" height=\"400\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /> </embed><//embed> The width and height can be adjusted particularly if students don’t have any added blocks in their view.

I'm looking for a way to create about 20 books each for about 50 courses which will all differ in content. I've had a look at mdl_book an can see the content is just html which introduces the idea of injecting books straight into the moodle database . I'm wondering if its possible to write queries to edit mdl_book and just inject all my books into moodle? As other tables might need editing too for the books to work, can anyone list the tables that i need to look at? thanks alot really appreciate any help.",

I have tried a variety of themes and I am using Moodle 1.9.7 (Build: 20091126) .  I can see that many moodlers do not offer the print option in book but I think that is because they don't want students to be able to print the document, not because they haven't been able to get it to work. Do you get the 'print complete book' option to work consistently? Cindy Weber",

You will be able to see the source code, I bet you will notice way too much code, <!--if --> with a bunch of other code. Do you get the 'print complete book' option to work consistently? -- Yes, running Moodle 1.9.10. Run this test: 1.  Create a new book 2.  Create new content just plain old text (No copying from Word) 3.  Create several chapters 4.  Add some graphics Then attempt a print test, if it works then the issue is absolutely your content. My money is still on the hidden code that got carried over from MS Word. Kevin",

I see there is a Moodle plugin out there that allows you to search books, but I like that the Global Search allows you to search everything else.  I just want to combine those.  Any suggestions??",

This file format, when\nopened in a web-browser is a lot more accurate [loss of formatting and\nelement placement occurs in converting into .htm format unless things are\n'corralled' in a table] and images are clearer]. In addition, you can\nconvert .doc, .xls, .ppt, .pub file formats in Microsoft Office - both\n97-2003 [well at least 2003] and 2007 versions.\n\n\nProblem is Moodle does not seem to recognise .mht file format - on\nuploading into course files folder the file icon has ? and it will not\n import into a Moodle Book resource.\n\nWould be nice if we could import .htm files into \nMoodle books\n as:\n* it simplifies process - don't have to zip if uploading just one\nconverted file\n* reduces the number of files in the Moodle course files - not a major issue.\n```\n Does anyone know how to overcome this obstacle?

Firstly, I receive course content from academics in .doc format, which I then convert to .htm in MS Word. I save these files as 'p1-Heading of chapter' (where the p1 is the page of the book; p1, p2, p3...etc) and sub-chapters get saved like this 'p1-sub1-heading of sub-chapter' (where sub1 is the sub-chapter of the parent chapter; sub1, sub2, sub3....etc). I save these into a folder, which then get's zipped and uploaded to Moodle's file system. They then get unzipped and imported into a book. My problem is, once unzipped and imported, then name of the chapter/sub-chapter is the location and file-name of the particular file on Moodle's file system. All the chapters look great, until I have to edit them to change the name to something more appropriate (removing the file location etc..). This cause the HTML content to do some strange things, and changes the formatting, fonts, etc. The content only contains basical text, with minimal formatting (text colour, paragraphs, font decoration, etc). I guess I have a few questions:",

          "Text": "We experienced something similar. The HTML editor in Moodle allows the use of <font> tags, but there is a stylesheet applied to the book that overrides all <font> declarations. If you have access to your Moodle code, have a look at /mod/book/book_print. css I reproduce the relevant section here: /* just some hack - ignore user defined <font> */ font { color: #000000; background-color: #EEEEEE; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; This is obviously frustrating for users who do want to specify styles in the HTML editor. Essentially, the HTML editor ceases to be WYSIWYG , because your changes are overridden by the stylesheet. If you're confident with CSS, you can remove sections (or just comment them out using /* to mark the beginning of the block you want ignored, and */ to mark its end). Alternatively, you can rename book_print.css and create a new, empty file named book_print.css. I haven't tried this, so it might make more of a pig's breakfast of the layout, but at least your styling choices will not be ignored.",

          "Text": "Help! I have been using a simple javascript to control the size of a popup window that links from a book chapter: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> function openpopup(popurl){ var winpops=window.open(popurl,\"\",\"width=176,height=116\") } </script> <a href=\"javascript:openpopup('http://ourcourses.ntschools.net/file.php/129/onsunday/Hitting_popup.html')\" class=\"style1\">How do you think this sound is made?</a> It acts as a kind of one off quiz question/answer that looks neat and wraps around the answer text, and works really well, as long as you don't re-open the editor after it is saved, as it annoyingly gets cleaned: lots of painstaking work if you want more than one question. Can anyone tell me how I might also control where the popup window appears in the main window of a chapter? In other html instances \"left=400,top=400\" alongside toolbars, location etc determine characteristics of windows, but I can only seem to get book chapters to respond to height and width instructions. I'd also like to be able to open a picture file in the same way (without setting up an html doc), much as you can link to a file as a resource. This just seems to shrink the picture when I try it in a chapter. Any ideas?",

I am using books (and find them great), however - I have just found out that when I embed a Voki into the HTML of a chapter, when I next click to edit the chapter the only contents/code left is the Voki code. Initially, when first saved, the whole lot displays and functions fine, but it is the first 'edit' that causes the problem. Then, if you click save, you lose all your code, and all you can see in your chapter is the Voki. Anyone else having the same issues? Any suggestions about how to solve the problem, please?

There is no easy way to import PDF into a Moodle Book. You can try a PDF to HTML conversion tool (such as the one provided by Adobe ). But the results are usually disappointing. Most documents created with PDF do not have the needed formatting information in them to create a good web page. Even where there is formatting, it is very poor and does not suit online viewing of the document. The good news is that it is very easy to convert from a Moodle Book to PDF and to other formats such as ebooks. I spend a lot of time copying the text from PDF documents into web pages for my Green Technology Strategies course. But then I was able to produce a Moodle Book and from that publish a printed book and ebook. My hope is that ebook formats with better formatting will one day replace PDF.",

I guess the key is whether anyone knows how an older version of the book behaves in 1.9.7. And where do we find the version of the book that we are running on our install?",

I am really confused as when we loaded the Book module on our local install we didn't have to do anything, apart from enabling groupings for the site, to see it appear for the Book. Surely if the core code didn't support groupings for the book then we would have had to do something more than just follow the install instructions.",

So I first upgraded to the latest book module, which solved the editor display problem, but the display of book-content was very different than before. My old book version had its own css for theming, the latest book is missing that css. After copying all css-values into my own theme, book works as fine as before. On another Moodle it was sufficient to upgrade to the latest book version because the theme was related with Custom Corners, which is (I think) related to Standard theme. So all required theming information is already placed in these related themes. Regards, Daniel",

They look great and print well. Problem is... when I copy the other docs over, the formatting goes awry!! Big Time! I sure could use an easier way to get all these docs into the book! 2. Printing... when choosing to print the entire book (or even chapter only) the pages come out AWFUL! Hardly any format at all... lines and blocks everywhere, and data all crunched together. Totally unreadable! What's the best way to print and have it look good too! Thank you! Kathi",

I am also capturing the results from running the SQL and converting them into HTML and copying that HTML into the book chapter.  Again it display wonderfully but prints in plain black and I loose the alternating color for each row.

I return to the chapter to edit it, open the editor in code view (<>) now the HTML has been stripped of the <head> section so my <style> element is there but can not be used by the HTML so I lose all formatting.

Make it a simple title with limited html.) You can import a folder and it will automatically bring in all html files in that folder.  Therefore you can upload all your html files into one folder and easily import them to your book, maintaining all the style sheet links. I always choose to import my folder as subchapters which makes it easy to delete all pages at once if I want to re-import.  If you are creating a new book every month you might not need to do this. You're right, once you edit a page in moodle it strips off all the headers and so removes the css links.  I try to never edit the files directly in the moodle editor.  Myself, I reimport the entire book if I change one page so my .css stays active.  I always upload the corrected html file to the folder for import.  OR you could import just the one changed page, and then use the arrows to position it after deleting the old page.

I had created those files using SoftChalk ( www.softchalk.com ), which is like a word processor for Web page creation.

If I remember correctly, the mthml format is the single file web-page format and I found it doesn't work! You need to save in htm/html format where you obtain a html file and a folder that contains images of the page. Both need to be uploaded to the Moodle course files - easiest way is to put both into a folder, zip it into a single file, upload the zip file to the Moodle course files, unzip it. Then when you import into your 'Book' you just choose the htm file you uploaded. Hope this makes sense and works - cheers, Tony",

I really appreciate hearing back from someone.  I am new to Moodle and as such am new to this website and its forums.  It was my first time creating a book and I became frustrated since I couldn't figure out why the summary wasn't revealed when you open the book.  I thought I wasn't doing something right and I couldn't find an answer in the discussions, sooooo I jumped in and gave asking a question a try Voila! I probably won't be able to assist anyone as of yet, but I'll remember what it felt like to get a response and if I can help someone I certainly will try. Thank you again!!!!",

I thought hiding the pages in the TOC would do the trick, but now nobody but the admin can access those pages. That's quite dumb behaviour in my opinion, in the sence that it is overkill. If the page is not displayed in the TOC how would anyone that is not an admin be able to access it anyway? I would have loved to be able to display a few top level pages in the TOC and have links to the hidden pages in the actual text of my book. Is there a way that I can edit some file to achieve this? and if so where would a good place be to start looking? TIA",

The Book module is NOT in the Activities pull-down menu , but rather in the Resources menu. Is this okay? As I'm creating a short book with only 3 chapters for testing, I noticed an \"Add Information\" and \"Edit Information\" button. When I click on the \" Add Information \" button, a small window pops up and tells me I need to \"select some text in this page and then press this button\".  So I go back and highlight a few words from the text and then click the \"Add Information\" button and then it lets me pick a theme color (I can't figure out why since the color doesn't show up anywhere!) and type what I want to and then click the \"add\" button. Where does my feedback go? When I click on the \" Edit Information \" button, a screen pops up with 3 buttons, \" Infomation ,\" \" Feedback ,\" and \" Delete .\"  Nice screen, but there's not any instructions as to what I'm supposed to do.  I might be able to figure it out if the buttons worked, but they don't click! Is there something I need to do to make these buttons work? Thanks. When I went back to the course page and logged in as a student, I still saw the \"Edit Information\" and \"Add Information\" buttons. I read in the moodle docs that only teachers could create and edit books. Why do these buttons still appear when I change my role to a student?  Is this right? Thanks for your help; I'm a little confused.  I'm going to try and reupload everything again. Bye now, Ms. Letha",

I can copy and paste the code into the chapter editor, but that will not have the appropriate links to graphics etc. I can delete all the chapters in the book one at a time (slow process) and then reimport the directory, but this Is in efficient and time consuming.

          "Text": "Nora, There are two ways to upload your sound files. You can create them in something like audacity and save them as mp3 files and then go to the files link in your administration block and create a folder called audio_files or something like that and then upload the files there. The other option is to start a book chapter and then highlight a word and click on the link button and then browse. From here you can create folders and upload files to the same area as before. Once you have the files uploaded you have two options: 1) create a link to the audio file that you want and then when the student clicks on the word the default player for that audio type will load and the student can listen to the file. The other way is to turn on the media filter in the modules->filters->manage filters area of your site. This will add an embedded player that students can just click on. See the attached graphic. It may not be exactly what you are looking for but it works great. If you have questions please ask away.",

I've never used the book module since most of my class activities have to be tracked/locked down, so I guess my question would be \"Is there a downside or potential issue with using the book module to create a technical support resource like I've described?\" I've never really seen it used this way before so maybe I'm missing something.

I have a two issues that I would like to solve as we might be doing something wrong: When we upload an html page with graphics (we zip the directory with all the graphics and html pages and unzip it in Moodle) and then use the \"import\" option in the book, it looses all the src links to the grahics. it looks like the relative link for example \"screenshots/image.jpg\" needs to be replaced by \" http://www.tl21.org/hobartcollege/file.php/3/Instructions/ Screenshots/image.jpg\" (The html file resides in the directory \"Instructions\") I don't mind changing all the src statements when importing html files with embedded graphics, but most of the teachers are not really familiar with html coding. Do I have a corrupted copy of the book block or is this normal? If the latter it would be nice if the needed absolute src link can be inserted automatically, (my php coding is not good enough to attempt such a change!) Finally, is there a way to have the book open in a new window so the student can have both the book and the course window open.",

I have uploaded a complete web site structure with graphics and all. When I use the import function in the book the links to the graphics are kept as a relative src link (the html source statement in my case is Screenshots/image.jpg). Instructions in the book manual state that all links will converted to absolute src statements. Somehow that is not happening during the import with text and graphics). However, if I go into edit mode of that particular page that should have a graphic and alter the src statement to a absolute link (in my case http://www.tl21.org/hobartcollege/file.php/3/Instructions/ Screenshots/image.jpg) By the way the text html file resides in the directory Instructions so when hence the relative src link statement to Screenshots/image.jpg But the book import functions does not seem to convert those src statements for graphics to the absolute path needed for the book. Is it a bug or I am doing something wrong?",

That makes the front page a course from which you can import certain things to other courses. - Go to the admin-panel of your destination course - select \"import\" from the admin panel - you´ll be lead to a mask, where you can choose from which course you want to import something - select your backuped front page course - on the next step you gotta de-select everything except the book which you want to transfer. - continue the following steps which are self-explanatory. - there you are.",

I am an American working in a school for disabled children in China and, on an almost daily basis, find myself getting frustrated over the lack of opportunities for disabled people/children to learn. When I started reading your site I got very excited because I think this software has something to offer all of the students I work with. In trying to understand the details of this software, however, I find that I am getting a bit lost in all the detail. I submit a plea for your help to get me over this hump. My present students are all students with cerebral palsy, which, simply put, means they have trouble controlling their body. I am trying to find software that will let me give tests, present lessons and even will allow me to create a kind of ebook, with m/c quizzes at the end of each chapter - preferably with links so that if students don't know a word they can click on the link and find the definition. I am sorry for posting such a mundane question but I need some help seeing the big picture before I can understand and appreciate the trees better. If moodle will do this it would be helpful if someone could send me a url to a site that has an example of this kind of use. Thanks in advance! If you want to see my incredibly cute students you can go to www.hischopsticks.org",

          "Text": "Hi Tom, I don't think the limitation for what you want to do in Moodle for your students is within Moodle itself. Moodle is a browser based web application so you would need to scout out some of the technologies developed over the past 25 years for computer assistance. In 1984 I produced a training video for the University of Virgina on a retinal scan camera device that was fairly non-intrusive, which allowed someone with CP to easily move a cursor around the screen by simply looking at what they wanted to do and blinking for click. I'm sure this technology has evolved considerably but I've not kept up with it. I have seen special trackballs and a few other gizmo's. Try Googling computer devices for accessibility etc. Your students at www.hischopsticks.org look like some of my wifes students.... the faces of angels! I've often wondered what the response would be to introducing this student population to virtual environments like SecondLife, where they could experience a sense of greater mobility while learning. Would they find this interesting?",

The book module changed the links correct. We had one problem related to the Indesign export to HTML. Indesign exported the pics in preview quality and not with high resolution. But that is a Indesign problem. It works great in 1.8. Today I tested the import of a Word Document. I opened the Word Document Office created automatically multipages in HTML, zipped them, uploaded and unzipped them, imported in book module and the pages were uploaded correct, but the href-links to the pics were not converted in 1.9. Is this a bug? I'll add it to the bugtracker also. Ralf",

I'd love it if some of our Book experts could look at this and point me in a direction. Ok - in our 1.8 installation of moodle, we've added the book module. In the \"0\" block in a course, if I edit a label and inside the label want to add an image - I click on the image button in the WYSIWYG editor. A list of the folders in my course appears and I choose the \"images\" folder I created. NO PROBLEM! IF however, I add a book to a block in the same course, and then inside one of the chapters in the book I want to add an image - this is what happens: I click on the image button in the WYSIWYG editor. Instead of a list of the folders appearing that are in my current course, I get the default Moodle site folder. My \"course\" folder isn't there, meaning my images folder isn't there. AGH! What's happening? Is this a problem in the css file in the book module? Is this a bigger problem?",

Secondly, if there is any work happening on the book module can suggest a small enhancement? Could there be better css tagging put in place please? For example, it would be nice to be able to pin down the contents table with css to may be set it with a nice contrasting style. At the moment this is not possible (or I haven't found a solution yet!). I guess that it should really be re-written to use divs rather than tables, but that's may be a job for another day!

To check this I just loaded book.php manually in adminlang, and there it is \"error cant find c:\\...../lang/en_utf8/book.php\". So this has nothing to do with the wonderful Book mod.

          "Text": "In this forum, there have been several posts reporting successful installation of the book module in various releases of Moodle (1.7, 1.8, etc.). Where did you get your book module? Did you download it from the modules and plugins database , or did you get it from CVS ? The CVS module is version 20070406. The module you get by clicking the \"Download latest version\" link in the modules and plugins database is version 20060312. The two versions are different . Do you know if the differences are important to you? Have you thoroughly tested your installation? The above questions are really not specific to the book module, but since there is no \"third party modules and plugins\" forum, I had to raise it somewhere. Moodle 1.7 has broken a lot of third-party modules, and users obviously need a more reliable way to determine compatibility of modules with Moodle releases than we currently get from the rather static view that we get from the modules and plugins database. In this discussion , Tim Hunt proposes adding a voting mechanism to the Modules and Plugins database that would turn the database into a tool for collaboration. Voting is a way of capturing the results of testing by a large user community. If you are looking for the answer to the question 'Does this third-party module work with 1.8?' it is much easier to look at a vote count than search the forums (the votes could carry short comments, so as not to detract from the forums). What do you think?",

          "Text": "The answer depends on what version of Moodle you're using. In 1.6, login as administrator, go to the front page of your site. In the Administration block, click Admin -> Configuration -> Language. You will see 3 links, including \"Edit strings\". Clicking \"Edit strings\" will show you the complete list of language files. In this case, the string is in the \" book .php\" file, so you have to click on that to get the list of strings for that file. Scrolling down you'll see \"Table of Contents\" on the left, and to the right you should be able to type whatever you want to change it to. Hit the save button at the bottom of the page. In later versions of Moodle, the menus have changed, so it may be a little different. Look for it -- you'll find it.",

If there is a way to do this, it is going to be in the way that the PDF is created/encrypted/passworded. You can create PDF's that are protected so that the text and image can't be extracted (i.e. cut and pasted) but its fairly easy to beat those limitations. But again the PDF format is designed to allow the document to be freely shared while providing a consistent appearance (fonts, page layout) and some degree of protection against alteration of the document. It's almost impossible to insure that anything available on the internet can't be captured and sent on to others. If I am interpreting your request correctly you want to have some form of DRM on the text files. You may want to research some forms of Document DRM or MicroSoft iDRM. In terms of MOODLE you are asking it serve in manner completely contrary to it's design. The social constructionist philosophy says share everything and see what happens, it's usually good. MOODLE does have the ability to restrict files to selected groups of users (think classes and/or groups) so you can post a file that only some users can access, but has no ability to determine what they do with the file once they have it.",

          "Text": "John, Assume that you are using moodle in english and therefore will assume the language file to be en. The same reasoning would apply to other languages as well. Instances where you see things like modulename are indicative of language file problem. It means generally that it is not UTF8 compliant. The way to address that in most cases is to copy the language file in the block or module you are installing into your language file en_utf8 directory. Some modules have an en_utf in which case copying the lang directory in the module you are installing to the lang directory in moodle will take care of things. But there are modules where developers have not adhered to this rule yet and have only en directory in the language file. In that case, you have to copy manually from en directory in the module to en_utf8. The proviso is that the developers have made the module UTF compliant even if they don't have an en_utf directory in the plugin. I have not installed the book module. It could well be that what I am saying here doesn't work for this module. Juvenal.",

          "Text": "Hi John, As I got the same error after installing the Book module, I tried the first answer to your question (putting the language file in the lang/en_utf8 folder) - did not do the trick. Then I thought: hey, what if I rename the language file to book_16 (same as module folder). And hey presto - the module now shows up with its name instead of with modulename . So I thought all my problems were over and decided to create a new book. And then I get \"this module type does not exist\". To be boldly honest: although I absolutely love Moodle, I think installing add-ons (especially without lacking documentation) is a right royal pain. (Had problems with other add-ons before.) So I'm lost again. If you find out anything, please share it with me (and probably other confused users). I would love to start using the Book module (as sort of a WebQuest look-alike). As an aside: I use Joomla for the front-end of my website, and installation of add-ons (even third-party ones) is simply a breeze... So I guess it can be done. Regards, Frank",

Is anyone using the book module with any form of activity locking? (Score Lock, AL for 1.6, etc.) If not, how could I make sure users accesses all the material in a book module? Would enbeding links to other activities work? (i.e. hot pototoes quizzes) If they are embeded within the book module, do they still show up as choices in the activity locking or do these activities have to be a seperate resource? Just curious and wanted to know how others were handling this, if at all. Thanks ahead of time for your valuable input. Sincerely, Todd Thornton",

It downloads to your computer as a zip file with name book_16.zip you upload this to your server into the moodle/mod directory. you unzip it there you change the name on the unzipped folder to book you go to the admin section of your site it should go through a quick \"updating book module\" process. you click on modules in your admin section and check firstly if it is there - if it is make sure the \"eye\" is open. If not, then I'm not sure what you have done! If you have used the module before and there is left over in your database , you will have to clear that out. Can't go searching for you now, but the method to do this is outlined in another thread. Hope you get there. I like the book module! Thanks to those who created it!",

I have uploaded the Book_16 directory into the /mod directory and renamed the directory to \"book.\" However, the \"book\" module is not listed in the Admin subsections anywhere (under the Modules sections subsections Activities , Blocks , Filters). Now this may have to do with the fact that I'm using the Moodle 1.7 version and somethng is amiss. Moodle didn't go through any dances to update and install the modification. Does anything need to run on the server side? Does anyone have a clue on what I may have missed in the steps ? -------------------- Update ---------------------- I've been running phpBB for many years and I'm used to having the steps listed in the download file explaining what is to be done to install the module / update. I've just found out (by digging into old mail here) that I have to run ...moodle/admin to install. I will try that now. P.S. Should install instructions be in the mods? _____________________________________ Thanks again, James",

Is this a bug?  Do you want me to submit it to the bug tracker? The reason why we would like all teachers to see hidden resources is so we can divulge information to tutors on the same site as that for students. Regards, Stuart Anderson",

No problem for that, but on the user´s side, students will have to browse within the repository-book using the chapter-schema. No problem again, but  we´d like to give them a chance to search whithin the whole book using tags or keywords: levels (1st level exercises ...), objetives (reading exercises...), certain items related searching (exercises for \"irregular verbs\" or ...). I´ve found this thread ( http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8799 ) and gone to CVS looking for the \"search \"AddOn\" I read about, but it seems to be not for a production server ... and... well, I don´t know what to do.

The content itself is not so long, only three pages in MS Word but it contains multiple tables. There are also some images, but I assume they don't count, since they exist in the file only as links. Moodle seems to leave out the end of the file. A table brakes in the middle of a row. Also the arrows below the chapter leading to previous and following chapters are inside the \"chapter box\" (a thin grey line around the chapter, the appearance may depend on style) where as in shorter chapters the arrows are outside the box. A picture of this is at http://www.hurri.org/diipadaapa/moodle_book.jpg I tried to simply copy and paste the rest of the text and tables to the end of the chapter in Moodle editing view but the end of it is always cut off when saving the changes.",

          "Text": "Petr, a nice start. This is really interesting. A while back , I was thinking about ways to create portfolios (books?) containing student work. If these books could 1) be generated by students as well as faculty, and 2) if your page (/moodle/mod/book/edit.php?id=X&pagenum=X) that creates the entry could offer a kind of \"paste from\" menu of all the various writing a student has done in a course (maybe a drop down list of all written activity), this module would go a long way towards fulfilling such a goal. Of course, I'm sure groups would like to build books, too. ... Like all good ideas, this could get complex. But I like the simple premise. Keeping the structure similar to the lesson module would probably be beneficial. best, Tom",

Considering the portfolio suggestion, IMHO it is better to do small specialised modules rather than all-mighty ones. The main problem with portfolio IMHO would be the present structure of Moodle 1.3 modules - logic and presentation are mixed together, you can not easily display data from another module or interact with it . Maybe in version 2.x or later the aggregation of modules will be possible, well it is the right time to speak about it just now . skodak",

When I create a subpage from a main page, the two are not linked in the sense that if I move the main page it moves the subpage as well? This probably by design, but might not be very intuitive I like your idea of creating a format that can be filled by students. Great for portfolio's. Maybe this module could use some fancy CSS so that it can look like a real book (by users/teachers choice, like scrapbook that Ger has showed us a couple of times.

Would be nice to have it in some other modules too! Can you start the count of the chapters with (an invisble) zero, So I can insert an introduction before chapter one? How can I - as teacher - switch editing view off? With the print option that prints the whole book we have a great and simple tool to create manuals for each section: only the page breaks for letter or A4 are missing.. How should a teacher handle that? If Martin or one of the others would: create a harvest button in the admin menu that collects all the books of a course that list opens in an overview window the teacher can checkmark the files that go in the final coursemanual that will be printed for the student (or the other teacher..) Really, really nice, and so easy: (Art show it to Mary, no no... Mary show it to Art )",

Am I doing something wrong?  Even when I look at the source of the page before it loses the CSS features, I don't see where it is pulling the styles from.  But they are there.  When I make the changes, and the CSS disappears, I don't see anything different with the code to make that change. If it makes a difference, I am using a FF browser. The original html that I am importing comes from a file that was originally uploaded in the Moodle Files area.  So, I can just easily edit the file offline, reload it into Moodle, and then re-import it into the Book.  But that is a lot of unnecessary steps if you are just fixing a typo. But, even so, I still like this Book function a lot.  Great job.",

So the pupils can open the book (which opens at a certain chapter), perhaps even in a new window, and can work on another task at the same time. As this is the same situation in real life; you have the book next to your exercise and can learn AND complete your task at the same time ! Is there any implementation for the tool I am looking for?

You also have a \"book\" folder inside the \"book\" folder, I presume. Move the contents of the inner \"book\" folder to the upper \"book\" folder, so you would have for example a path like /moodle/mod/book/README.txt.",

Also, I made the mistake of unzipping Book.zip on my computer then using Adobe Golive to FTP it to my site.  When I ran it through Golive, Golive  changed the links in Book and resulted in the 404 error I mentioned earlier.  I deleted the whole thing and reinstalled it using AceFTP and it worked fine.  I have the Book Module working now.

One of the most important questions that arose from this meeting was; how can a moodle user annotate or make notes within the online materials. One alternative that has sprung to mind is the use of the Book module. The screen could be split into two parts, with the original material on the left, and the personal notes regarding that particular material on the right. Would this be a possiblity within the Book module? Is something like this already in the pipeline? If not, would it be possible to work together on such a projekt?",

As for private:  are you saying that if you don't care what students put into their own private comments (\"takes too long to check what students store inside their moodle\") that private comments would work? FYI , I just took a quick look at an ilias demo.  Their \"courses\" are similar to Petr's Book module.  At the top of each page there is a Notes link and an \"add a note\" icon.  The Notes link takes you to the Notes Index where you can search, print, etc. your notes.  The icon opens up a text editor where you can add a note and mark it.

Another old suggestion: d3e, used in the famouse JIME magazine, coded in php as a collab annotation tool. (It comes in two flavours D3E that needs file-preparation and the simpler Ubiquituos.. something for Mike?) Also old collab annotation example: http://y-notes.sourceforge.net/ (But rejected in the forums, because it was not well coded? I do not remember exactly) A newer version of this idea? http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projects/annotate.html Having now the great block of shared files and shared weblinks, I took the old bookmarks from William, removed the file attachment option (so, not doubling the shared files block) and offer it now to the users as a flat sticky notes system: On every Moodle page the students sees this finger with the ribbon in the navigation bar and can attach a note. Under his personal profile (in participants) the user has access to his privat note taking mechanism (with self choosen categories) The notes are visible in all his courses and the student can jump to the page from a link in the note. (I still hope that William's Bookmarks become part of the core Moodle, because you must do a lot o hand-coding) Limitation: it only works on screens with a navigationbar.. (But it must be possible to put the button also in the header of a resource-page?)",

Like W Page, I can foresee us attempting this project (e.g Split Screen - half Online Material (like BOOK), half Annotation) during 2005 with the help of our students and collaboration with yourselves A global function: This would be the ideal solution of course. The ideas put forward by Ger are great and exactly what we need. We'd love to help but are unsure how to go about incorporating such a solution within moodle as a whole.

Ideally, notes would show to the student who put in the note either inline, or as a pop-up, but not show to other students (presumably the teacher could view it by logging as the student, but really there should be not much need for the teacher to see the notes if they are only for the student. It seems to me the biggest programming challenge would be to keep the notes lined up with the text, eg. if the teacher modifies the text, a student's notes for paragraph 3 would stick with para 3, even if it becomes the 5th paragraph after a teacher modifies the text. Wiki's already do this, so perhaps that could serve as a basis for a note taking module? To me, the idea is to mimic what a student can do by printing a document out and annotating it. Ger's example from the law site was interesting, but with all notes shared the document quickly becomes unreadable, and of course you have the issue of inaapropriate notes.",

I envisioned using a Flash frame that could call up a given HTML page. Above the \"source\" layer, invisible layers could be added which would bear the page annotations. You could call up a \"student\" layer, a \"collaborative\" layer, or a \"teacher's\" layer and perhaps even view them \"stacked\". The layer would be saved at the end of a session to be called up later in association with a given page. I have no programming knowledge beyond html and so I have no idea how a thing like this could be accomplished. Until yesterday I did not know IF it could be accomplished. But then I came across the following page. http://www.sidenote.net/mainsite/ (look at the SideNote application under the \"solutions\" tab) Check it out. It is very much what I envisioned (except for the dependance on the company's server ) and seems to be what is being discussed here as well. I don't know that this get us any closer to making it happen in moodle, but somebody has accomplished it elsewhere. Best wishes, Matt",

If an instructor posts a wiki with a summary, and posts the text in the summary, then with wiki set to user, each student can add their comments at the bottom, viewable only by themselves. But ideally, students should be able to add comments inline. This would require the teacher being able to add pages to a user type wiki, pages that students could then annotate themselves (perhaps with a different default font color?). It should also have 'export document as html' and/or 'print document' functions. Anyway, seems like to me that wiki would be the best platform to build this functionality off of since it already has the ability to store user and/or group text individually.",

To do this, change this code (you should be able to just copy and paste the code here) in the view.php file (it is about line 156 and comes before the // prepare print icons section): } else { $chnavigation .= '<a title=\"'.get_string('exit', 'book').'\" href=\"/course/view.php?id='.$course->id.'\"><img src=\"pix/nav_next_dis.gif\" height=22 width=49 border=0></img>'; } And be sure to change the height and width to match your own gif. Then add this line to the lang file: $string['exit'] = 'Exit Book'; or whatever you would like the mouseover to say--it could be Return to Course instead of Exit Book. Chardelle",

I followed all install steps and added the appropriate tables (according to the mysql . sql file in the /db/ folder) in my database manually but moodle still does not seem to recognize the module. What other connections need to be made? I didn't want to divert attention from this discussion to an installation problem. If there's a way to get around the issue as per my first post, I'm happy to do that and pursue the long term solution in a more appropriate forum. So if you want to talk exclusively about the book module, disregard what follows. Having said that, if any one here would like to take a crack at the admin/index.php problem I'd be much obliged. Here's the data I've compiled so far: The installation initially tripped between posting the front page settings and creating the admin id. Checking normal server logs indicated a 500 514 error just previous to the failure. I simply signed on as a new user and then added myself as an administrator in the database. The site seems to work fine save for a consistent failure of admin/index.php to load. My service provider is globat.com. They have some limitations in terms of what they allow us to configure though I'm not familiar with all of the settings or their significance. I have seen another globat user posting this same issue so I imagine there may be something server side that is creating the problem. The installation is in a subdirectory and so the admin folder is not on the root level. I've also run phpnuke on the root and the admin folder there never gave me trouble. This makes me think that the issue is not the name of the admin folder. (I've renamed it and adjusted the config file to make sure). More from my last discussion on this topic can be found here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16400 Again, I've added this here simply in case you think you might be able to help with the root problem. If not, happy problem solving elsewhere! PS - Chardelle, I dig your flash book layout. Very cool.",

I'm assuming that it's not difficult to add graphics to a page. Such as jpg or png. But what about an animated gif? Or embed a Flash movie into a page? Thanks",

This was working beautifully before.  I don't know what caused it to set the path that way.  It doesn't want to include the \"data\" part of the path. Any insite would be great as I am to showcase this site on Sunday.  I need to have it functioning.  Thanks.",

Following some test result where I encountered an issue, (hope to be able to correctly explain it) and a \"wish feature\" for the module: Import of nested folder: I tried to import a course structured in this way: /courseFolder (contains only index.html) / css (contains style sheets for all the course pages) /imagescom (contains all the shared course images) /swf       (contains all the swf files of the course) /script    (contains javascript code for all the course) I have zipped the \"courseFolder\", then uploaded into Moodle and expanded. I used the Import feature on the \" courseFolder/unit1 \" html pages. HTML pages are correctly imported and TOC created, but links to files whose path begins with \"../\" (such as \"../images/myimage.gif\", \"../css/styl.css\" and linked javascript) result broken. While files correctly relinked (source as \"images/myimage1.gif\") appears as: http://myserver.com/ moodle/file.php/12/courseFolder /unit1/images/myimage1.gif files with \"../\" path suffix (source as \"../imagescom/myimage2.gif\" becomes: http://myserver.com/ moodle/mod /imagescom/myimage2.gif Let me know if you think you may need more details.

I really like the ability to select a folder to add all the file inside the folder, something the other CMS has never offered and only recently allowed adding of multiple files. One request I do have right now is the ability to import a set of files without having to first create a \"junk\" page in the book. As soon as a book is created, I would like to see the Import link. From my working in other CMSs, common practice is to create all the files locally using Dreamweaver, Frontpage, Word, etc and then upload all the files using WinZip or WebDAV and connecting the files to the module (book). Another feature on the long-term wish list is support for the IMS Content Packaging Specification which is supported in Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft Powerpoint, WebCT CE 4.1/Vista 3.0 and Blackboard 6.0. IMS Content package import could gain support for Moodle from many textbook publishers of \"e-packs\" and similar \"e-content\" that are currently available to WebCT and Blackboard users.

These consisted of sometimes multi-paged texts with associated images. I wanted to break things up into multiple pages because sometimes loading all the text and images on one page took a long time and required a lot of scrolling. I also like the book module, but I have a concern with the concept of a \"book\" within the current Moodle structure. In a typical classroom course, a student is often supposed to read certain chapters or pages of a larger book as a course progresses. As is, Moodle is set up so that from within a specific topic or week, you can insert an entire activity.  If a whole book is a single activity, how could one associate just a certain chapter of that book with a particular topic or week easily without having to resort to some sort of workaround?",

For us, the other teachers and professors, there is Moodle: to help us to bring more (topic-oriented) structure in our courses. Book is also a great starters-help for putting content easy in place inside that structure... (with the danger of ending up with good old \"turning pages\", but that is an other story....) If teachers see the sections as the topic-chapters of their course (as Martin proposes?) and call these books in these sections also chapters, then for a beginner a button to harvest these chapters in one print-out-view (and exclude some books by hand) would be a great help/relief. All the other experts just cut and past the single books into Word and do in Word their prepress by hand: these guys and dolls like computers and the rythm of clicking their mouse, do not automate for them these activities , they will hate you for that, but do it for us, the simple course creatures/creators.)

If you want to convert rich text HTML (graphics, tables, etc.) to PDF, you need to: download HTML page, render HTML to PostScript, generate PDF by GhostScript, update page numbers in TOC. There are some solutions, but they are not pure PHP (because they use GhostScript and other programs) - IMO no hosting company would allow such thing on their server . It is much, much easier to install PDFcreator on teachers's computer. The page breaks do work (at least in my IE and Firefox ) - try File/Print Preview. If you have Firefox, check the appearance of links too answer to previous post: it is necessary to install only on teachers computers, students do not need it, there is a new option for disabling of printing icons and also titles, uploading of files - all tutors should already know how to do it, inserting of links - all tutors already know how to do it.",

Moodle -> Book WebCT Campus Edition -> Content Module WebCT Vista -> Learning Module Blackboard 6 -> Learning Unit All four have the same feature of  linking page togethers with \"Previous|Next\" navigation buttons and a Table of Contents built dynamcially when pages are added, removed or shuffled around. The prime difference between a Moodle Book right now and the other CMS \"things\" is the ability to add other components as pages such as quizzes, assignments and discussion topics. Personally, I like the \"book\" name. When I train faculty in using WebCT, I often give an analogy to think of a content module/learning module like a \"three ring binder\" where we can insert, remove, shuffle pages along with other resources like \"pocket pages\" to hold pencils, calculators, sticky notes, paper clips, etc. (WebCT content/learning modules have an additional \"Action menubar\" where we can include other things like quizzes, URL links, etc to support the content but not in be the content sequence.) Maybe instead of \"book\" consider \"notebook\" or \"binder\"? Cheers, Bob",

The Action Menubar has been around since the beginningof WebCT. A Moodle Resource Toolbar (WebCT Action Menubar) is a way to provide resources that support the content but are not required to be in the linear sequence of reading the content. For example, I might have some content that includes some URLs of additional information on another web site. In the content, there might even be a \"see the links in the resource toolbar for further information\". A few common component in the past has been self-tests, glossaries and student notes. Quizzes are another component that can be placed either in sequence of the module or on the toolbar of a page. If the quiz is optional so the student can improve learning, then it goes on the toolbar of the page. But if I want the student to take the quiz after reading the content, then it goes on the \"next page\" after the content so there is a better chance of not missing it. Resource toolbar is a good way to provide extras while keeping the student on a particular page. Cheers, Bob",

Ok, so I was going along the lines like Bob mentioned about Web-you-know-who's Action menubar.  In my example, I have added the links to the actual book page--just above my book background.  I was thinking of being able to add a link to a resource or activity and have it be placed on the page (not in the html editor box WP, so it wouldn't mess with the background)--in other words imagine the discussion and journal links I added in my picture moved up out of the \"book page\" and placed next to where your print links are now skodak. The other circle in the picture was really a fantasy of having the \"add an activity\" drop down menu on the book page in order to say, add a discussion link to the page.  So say, either above or below the \"book page\" you could have a little menu bar with links to files, activities, resources, etc. (But for now, anyone can add their own \"menubar\" by adding the links via html to the \"book page\" like I did in my example.  It's a little hard to see in the picture, but I just inserted a table w/a blue border above my book background and added a link to my forum icon and the topic forum, and a link to my journal icon and the journal for this particular topic.)

In other words, if you are able to add activities inside a book, then you are starting to create something that offers all the capabilities of Moodle, but has a different structure. I think this runs the risk of mixing navigation structures within a single course inconsistently and confusing students. However, I think the idea is an excellent one, but it is starting to me to sound more suitable to a new course format-a book format. Rather than divide the course up into weeks or topics, students are expected to follow a narrational sequence, the book is the central part of the course, and from within that narrational sequence they gain access to other related activities. You might allow multiple books as well in a single course. Such a format would probably be very useful to literature teachers for example. What do you guys think?",

          "Text": "Now that there is a stable release of the book module,  I just installed it on my Moodle. In doing so, I have come up with a satisfactory (but not perfect) answer to the question that I posted at the beginning of this thread, and I wanted to share it with others who might be interested in doing something similar. Here's what I would do. I'll be working in topics format, with each topic corresponding to a chapter in an offline textbook that the students will be using in my course. I am creating a set of my own notes (my book)  to accompany this textbook, with a chapter in my book corresponding to each chapter in the offline book. I will put the book itself into the topic outline. If  people click on it there, they will be taken to an introductory chapter that explains the purpose of the book. Then in each of the topics, I will create a resource. I will make its type \"web link,\" and link to the page for the relevant chapter in the book. Why is this solution not perfect? Two reasons come to mind: The fact that the icons used for book and resource differ may confuse people (although in my Moodle this won't be an issue because I am using the same hieroglyphic icon for both activities). If someone clicks on the resources link in the activities block, they will see all of the individual chapters listed. If they click on the books link they will see the whole book. A work around for this would be to hide the activities block altogether. In some cases, this might be OK because there would be no need to see all the activities grouped in that manner, but it would depend on the individual needs of the course. I want to give my thanks to Petr for this great module. I especially like the printing function of it. I am sure I will be using this module A LOT in my courses.",

E.g. I have my topics in a flash movie in a book format, and I also offer a printable version of the file (a pdf file).  Would it be possible for the print link to bring up the pdf file? Also, the Lesson module has the ability to take the user back to where they left off -- would that be possible for your module? I think a lot of people would like this type of module--as of now many use the lesson module for this type of functionality--and many do not only because the lesson module is a little intimidating.",

Since \"Book\" will not be in v1.4 many of us who like this mod can take a deep breath and ponder about some of the things we would like to see in this simply wonderful module by Petr . He really should get a lot of Kudos about this mod because of its intuitive nature, applicability and interesting interface. The main problem is, as with all dreams and desires in Moodle , coding is necessary. Many of use have no coding experience or limited coding experience. Maybe we can do a collaboative thing with Petr at the helm, if he is willing, on developing a Book \" Format \" [possibly laid out similar to the \"Social\" format] as well as the . Book \" AddOn \" module. What do other folks think about this? What kind of layout would you want to see in a potential \"Book\" format? Let's put some layout images out there.",

It is more consistent with course editing, these two buttons actually set the same variable in user session (if you are editing main course page and click on book, the editing is turned on, otherwise it is initially off). The bullets: It seemed to me best this way, if you want to change the style, go to moodle/mod/book/toc.php and edit line 41. Better way would be to define them in themes, but I did not want to modify any files from standard Moodle installation - so I inlined the styles to toc.php I prefer searching directly in printer friendly view or using that new search add-on for course wide searching (in contrib/search - not finished yet). Well, if people keep requesting it, I may add it. But as I said before it is not my priority now Anyway, thanks for all your comments!!! skodak PS: I did forget the PDF.

This would be the main content, plus a very few elements, like logo, category and link information. There are php-scripts out there to produce such print version. What has to be done to work this way, is to \"mark\" those text / content portions with some special TAGS like <START PRINT>..Your Content here .<STOP PRINT> Then, such a simplified page could be converted to PDF with a special Print-PDF-version. There are some \"Print-This\" scripts on Hotscripts ( http://www.hotscripts.com/ ) or as pluggins to phpCMS ( http://www.phpcms.de/ ) the latter can eventually be modified to work with Moodle. Hotscripts on \"Print This\" Hope this comment is of some use. Best regards from Costa Rica. Roland By the way ... this editing tools (HTMLarea?) seems to have problems with insertion of links ...",
