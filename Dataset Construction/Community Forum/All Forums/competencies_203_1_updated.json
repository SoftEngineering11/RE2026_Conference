          "Text": "Hi everyone! I'm supporting a school that already uses CBL in their transition to Moodle from fully offline. Besides academic competencies, students are expected to self-evaluate and then work on a couple of soft skills per semester, in alignment with the school's graduate profile. I have enabled the capabilities competency:planviewowndraft and competency:planmanageowndraft for the authenticated user role, which worked fine. However, it quickly became overwhelming since students could see all the academic frameworks. I would like to find a way to restrict students from adding academic competencies to their individual plan. I have tried the following: Setting the soft skills framework to a category and creating a new role, at the category level, with the above capabilities. This didn't work (I suspect because learning plans exist at the user level) Doing the opposite, with the academic frameworks in a category, and setting competency:competencyview to prevent. The list looks clean but students are not allowed to view their rating, proficiency, etc. If there is no other option, I'll use tours to guide them, but I'd really appreciate any ideas you might have! Thank you, Inês",

I have a LMS 101 course, that all of my students take where I explain navigation to the Monitoring of learning plans - Student Profile page. Using the Filter plugin might resolve this, but I haven't been able to figure that out yet. The Student's view has the full learning plan, each competency has additional detailed information.

But my 2025 software development budget is otherwise assigned this year. Still, I've had potential clients interested in CBE, and maybe I can get them to pay for some custom development? Once a learning plan has been completed--do you use one of the certificate generation programs or another system to notify the student (and others) of completion status?

I tell you my configuration. 1) Do a backup of competiencies and delete all plans and competencies. 2) Import your framework or 3) Create your framework competencies. In scale, you must choose in default \"competent\" (or another positive scale), and in profiency, choose all possible values that the compency can get. For example, if you use the next scale: \"not competent, in process, competent\", you choose \"competent\" for default option (it means the value for activities that competencies are automatically completed when criterias are done) and you choose all options for profiency (it means values for activities that competiencies are manually completed). 4) Create a learning plan, add the competencies, add cohort. 5) In course, add competencies (the same of the learning plan). 6) Edit activities or quizzes and in competencies, add them and mark the option \"Completed the competency\". Now, if you want to check it, make this activity or quizz like a student. If the califcation is positive, the competency should be marked like \"competent\". You can view it in competencies tab. I think that the module can improve. I think competencies should be added in each question of the Q'bank. A quizz has a lot of questions and each question could work different competency. Now, I will investigate how competencies are completed when the competency has several activities. Regards. IMG",

This way (I presumed) the default proficiency from the scale would be grabbed on course completion (Achieved)  and then reviewing the evidence, we could apply a 'higher' proficiency upon review. And it's working in some places and not others. For example, I currently have several competencies on a learning plan that are configured. Two examples below: 18740: Quiz (Attach Evidence), Assignment (Attach Evidence), Assignment (Attach Evidence). Course Completion (Complete the competency) 29778: Assignment (Attach Evidence), Assignment (Attach Evidence), Quiz (Attach Evidence). Course Completion (Complete the competency) 18740 is working perfectly, 29778 is the one that is breaking. Both are supplying evidence as expected, but 29778 is not completing on course completion. In the interim, Ive been checking the Scale set at the framework. I've made sure no compentency or its parent taxonomies are using a different scale.

          "Text": "Hello everyone I try to understand how competencies and learning plans work in Moodle. After creating competencies frameworks, learning plans, and adding competencies both the course and plans, I have tried how it works. I have made 2 Quizz, and their configurations, I have add 1 competency, the same for both quizzis. Summarizing, those are my test: 1 Framework  -> 1 competency -> 1 learning plan -> 1 cohort -> 1 student -> 1 course -> 2 cuestionaries -> 1 competency each one. I suppose that the competency is completed if the 2 cuestionaries are passed but: I have made one of them like a student, with satisfactory qualification and, in this moment, the competency for the student is completed. I have made the other cuestionary, with a fail qualification, and the competency shows as completed too. Then, my conclusion is: The value of the competency is not the means of tasks. It is not important the number of activities that a competency has associated because if one completes it, the result of the others does not modified its status. I think this makes no sense because I can't use competencies in automatic mode and all competencies must be manually revised. Is this how works the competency module? I want to design a course with 9 topics, and each topic contribute a little to the same competency. When the course finishes, I want to view how evolved competencies for each student in such a way that if the most of the activities are passed, the competency is considered passed. Any ideas? Thanks you \n```text\n\n```",

In a scale 0 to 10 points where 0 is the worst and 10 is the excelence, my scale is: Insuficiente =  0-4 points (it is not competent) Suficiente = 5 points (slightly competent) Bien = 6 points (competency is good) Notable = 7-8 points (competency is remarkable) Sobresaliente = 9-10 points (competency is excellent) I have marked \"bien\" in default and all except insuficiente in profiency I have seen your recommendations about competency's rules. Although it can work, I would have to design as many sub-competencies as questionnaries and tasks I have, giving a large of framework of competencies. I am physics and chemistry's teacher and my competencies are given by law, and they are a bit wide. For example, one says: the student must identify, understand and explain physiochemical phenomens using physical theories and laws. I have created several sub-competencies based in Bloom's taxonomy, but I don't create subcompetencies for each phenomenon of study, and this makes a large of framework. I think the solution is complicated. Regards \n```text\n\n```",

          "Text": "Hello Esther, The competencies and learning plans in Moodle are very in-flexible and have not received an update in a very long time. If your use case does not require competencies, I would not start the practice. The Moodle concept is for an educational based system. The student has a learning plan for a Chemical Engineer needs these competencies to earn an Engineering degree. The student completes the course, earns the competency and they move on to the next course (competency. My use case is in the workplace setting, where my students have to annually requalify to specific competencies. Moodle's competencies and learning plans were not designed for my use case. The general concept is that each student should have a learning plan with the competencies they need to acquire for a specific skill/task/educational requirement. In your use case you have many students so setting up learning plans would be a major administrative task. Learning plans are used to provide the students with a \"list\" of what they need to achieve or to provide learning goals. Learning plans can also be used to display to auditors, or regulators. I use the plugin- Monitoring of Learning Plans for the excellent visual display. https://moodle.org/plugins/report_lpmonitointring Without learning plans this plugin cannot be used. In my use case, I created learning paths for groups of students based on the job position. Forklift Drivers must have competencies, A-Z and AA-BB. All students that are forklift drivers have the same learning plan - and then I can compare if all Forklift Drivers are competent and have obtained and retained the desired skill sets. For me the basic functionality needs a development refresh. 1. the UI for creating Competency Frameworks and Learning plan templates is very manual and prone to human error. Hundreds of clicks to setup a small learning plan with competencies and add students to learning plans. 2. No automation, no Moodle core delivered reporting. 3. The objects Competencies and Learning plans have no End Date field and therefore the administrative hoops I jump through to refresh the learning plans is an on-going challenge. 4. End Dates is Moodle do not have the same functionality as other LMS systems. End Date should in a relational database end the relationship between the objects. The objects Competency to Learning plan or student to learning plan in the current state \"live on forever\". These are some of the Moodle Trackers - please vote for items that would help your use case. MDL-69237 Link a competency to multiple learning plan templates MDL-62551 - Add a leading checkbox in every competency line in the add competency to course/learning plan template pages MDL-57749 - Allow moving a competency framework to a different category or site MDL-69063 - Turn off Request Review feature for competencies. MDL-59865 - Learning Plan Expiry MDL-66976 Competency tracker Kind Regards",

It would be great as well to have some kind of notification for a student that the deadline is approaching (as for now I did not find a settings about learning plans notification. There are notifications about courses, activities , etc. but the student can miss/not enroll to the course at all). Unfortunately for me, one of the available plugins which is very popular and recommended ( Monitoring of Learning Plans - report_lpmonitoring ) is not supported in Moodle 4.0 (I tried to install it and I had some issues, similarly to other persons on higher Moodle versions than 3.8 or so. I don't feel comfortable with mentioned solutions like removing some of the tables in the database and reconfiguring some moodle/competencies settings again as I wouldn't like to loose some already collected data as probably some data disappear after removal). It looks that I must base on the official features (or any other plugins, but I'm not aware about them). May I count on any hints from more experienced users?",

Going back to the thread: I would love to use the Monitoring of LP plugin, but as I mentioned there are some issues during the installation phase and after looking for any solution I found out that one solution is to manually removing some mySQL tables and recreating them again (somehow ;) ). Sadly it is not my level of tech expertise. When it comes to due dates / deadlines - it looks that it will not solve my case, similarly as your case (I need to define a relative time for gaining all needed competencies, something like \"three months from ascribing of LP\", or \"in 12 weeks\" or so).",

          "Text": "Hi, I have a parent competency that is not updating as complete within a course, even though the children competencies are marked \"Competent\". Here's what I have done: I created a Competency Framework based on Bloom's Taxonomy. The parent competency is called \"Bloom's Taxonomy Completion\" and the children competencies are named after the six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. I created a Competency rule that says the Parent Competency is complete when all the children competencies are complete. I then added all 7 competencies to a test course (1 parent and 6 children) I then created 6 activities and aligned one of each of the 6 children competencies to one of each activity.  (Remember competency to Remember activity, Understand competency to understand activity, etc.) I enrolled a student account (myself) into the course. I entered the course and completed all 6 activities.  (NOTE:  I did this AFTER all the competencies were added to the course and AFTER all the activities were linked to the 6 children competencies) After completing all 6 activities, I went to the Competencies section of the course. (Still in the role of a student).  There, I could see that the course was telling me that I was competent in all 6 children competencies, but I still lacked the parent competency (Bloom's Taxonomy Completion) and was therefore only proficient in 6 out of 7 competencies within the course. I logged out as a student and logged back in as an administrator. Going to the course, I went to Reports and Competency Breakdown.  There, I could see that the student (aka myself) had been rated \"Competent\" in all 6 children competencies, but had not yet been rated in the Parent Competency. Looking at the Competency Breakdown in more detail, each of the children competencies had \"Proficient\" and the related activity listed as Evidence for its \"Competent\" rating.  However, the Parent Competency had \"No\" for its proficiency and NO EVIDENCE to support it. My question is, \"Why did the Parent Competency within the course not automatically display as 'Competent' and 'Proficient' when the 6 sub-competencies (children) successfully marked themselves 'Competent' after the linked activities were completed?\" You should also know that I have reviewed these previous forum posts and believe that none of them answer my question: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=420205 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392208#p1581515 (The children ratings in my case were not retroactive.) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=381913#p1540201 (I believe I created the Competency Rule correctly - see previous image) Thanks in advance.

          "Text": "Dear Moodle community, I am quite new to Moodle, so I hope you can help me clarify a few thing. To give you an idea, what I am working on: We are trying to build an online learning tool for handball referees. Our idea is to have separate learning plans (LP)  for different leagues: referee - elite level referee - adults referee - juniors On the next level, we plan to have competencies (C) for different aspects of being a referee: understanding of handball - elite level leadership - elite level organisation and rules - elite level understanding of handball - adults leadership - adults organisation and rules - adults ... and so on ... And on the bottom level, we would like to have multiple courses, e.g. - understanding of handball - elite level group tactics - elite level offense - elite level defense - elite level ... and so on ... Our idea is that after completing the 3 courses (group tactics, offense, defense), the referee is awarded the competency of \"understanding handball - elite level\". And after gaining all the elite level competencies, the elite level learning plan is fulfilled and the referee can lead games on that level. However, we don't manage to get it work like this. As soon as one course is completed, the competency is awarded. I found these two forum threads: 1) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392070 2) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365575 Here, it sounds like this is not possible (\"each lesson may have 15-20 competencies\"). On the other hand, the Moodle FAQ says \"Can a competency be added to more than one course or activity? Definitely - and your organisation might well need to do this, if certain competencies need to be met in a series of courses or several activities within one course. \" This sounds like what we imagined. Now the question is: Is this possible? If so, which settings do we have to set to accomplish this? Or do we need to add (child) competencies for each course and parent competencies for our planned competencies (understanding of handball, leadership, etc.)? Many thanks for your help already in advance. I hope I have explained everything in sufficient detail that you can imagine what we are trying to do.",

          "Text": "Hi, I have a problem with understanding the proficiency/competent scale in competency frameworks. May I kindly ask you for some assist here? I read already the documentation ( https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Competency_frameworks ) and FAQ about it; I found here couple of threads about the same topic as well (e.g. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=355311 which looks the nearest to my case). In each case the answers are linked to proper setup of the competency scale (Default and Proficient values). But I'm missing something and to be honest I don't know what. Maybe I provide some background and my example: I set my newly created competency framework and I decided to use default competency scale (and I set both Default and Proficient values to Competent); competencies on \"level 2\" are needed to be closed to get \"Level 1\" competencies. Each competency is linked to the activity with \"upon activity completion: complete the competency\". Moreover the course is set so that \"Upon course completion: complete the competency\" (the course is based on self-learning activities and self-studying resources; I would like to minimize the need of teacher assistance and give the possibility that students go through the whole course and close it with the success even when they forget to mark one of the checkbox next to the activity). To simplify that and make it an example out of my case, let's assume that I added only one resource to the course: an URL (with an activity completion via manual marking; and it is linked with a competency). It can be marked by a student as done or (alternatively) he/she can simply press \"complete the course\" in the \"Self completion\" block. In both cases the student completed the course and he/she will be seen as \"Competent\" one in the Learning Plan. But he/she is still not Proficient, the teacher needs to rate it (and can be requested to do a review). Is it possible to skip this manual step of a teacher? I have another case in my mind: if a teacher needs to close manually the course for the student as some kind of the 2nd gate (e.g. the course has two conditions for the course completion: the student needs to work on activities/resources and mark it \"done\" and in \"manual completion by others\" the teacher is marked as a mandatory) it is rather duplicate action to rate the competency rated with the course, or I'm wrong? I know that the teacher and Learning Plan supervisor aren't always the same person, but in case of yes, how to simplify the process? I think that I can't be the first one with such question, right? Maybe I can't use a standard competency scale, or some types of activities/resources? Would someone be so kind to help me out? Thanks!",

I'm not sure why it wasn't working previously, as I had my competency scale like on the picture below : Maybe it was linked with my approach that I created one of the Learning Plan, I ascribed it to a student, and later I started the changes in the scale; maybe the LP or scale wasn't changed simultaneously everywhere, or such updates were disabled by purpose. No idea, but what is the most important is that I have the problem solved. Btw . my original understanding was that it will be possible to set the course in that way, that all competencies will be set as \"gained\" after completing of the whole course without marking of each one of activities/resources as done (no matter if by self or automatic marking). In my opinion it would be great to get the competencies with the \"self completion\" block as well (without additional activity for the teacher/supervisor). I know how to set the course to be closed by both options (Course conditional completion in which I can set \"any of conditions are met\"; one condition can be \"activity completion\" and other \"manual self completion\" (or \"manual ... by others\"), but it is not working with the competencies. Or am I missing again some points in the settings? Your comments will be well appreciated cheers!",

          "Text": "Hi all, On behalf of an institution (using Moodle 3.10.6) who are reviewing and testing various site-wide notifications and permissions, I am currently attempting to understand and provide an answer to them on what the 'Comment on a user competency' ( moodle/competency:usercompetencycomment) role capability permission actually relates to within the user interface. When editing a role's permissions, it is grouped under the \"User\" context .  According to this resource it is defaulted to only be enabled for the Manager role archetype. I would presume then that whatever this \"comment\" function is, it would be accessible at a system or category level. When setting up the competency framework, adding the competencies to said framework, editing either, applying a specific competency to a course etc. I cannot find anywhere that gives you the option to comment on it. If you attach the competency to a learning plan and apply that plan to a user, you can comment on the plan when viewing a user's profile. This seems to be the only place I have seen (beyond rating an activity for competency) that you can comment on anything related to a competency: This doesn't seem like the function that competency comment permission relates to. This comment function within the user profile  has its own role capability permission Comment on a learning plan moodle/competency:plancomment. I would normally be viewing in the Boost theme but switched to Classic just to ensure nothing funky was going on visibility wise (spurred on by the issues viewing admin options to add Comptencies/Learning Plans at a category level mentioned in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-64795 ). Just thought i'd mention that. Not sure if it is a lack of clarity around the description of this permission or just user error/oversight/inexperience (take your pick) but any help with this would be amazing! Thanks in advance.",

Is it OK to use the competency framework without using a learning plan? For example, I can add competencies to a course. Then link those competencies in a quiz, or graded assignment, is this a common approach? From student's perspective, when they go to the \"Competencies\" section, then they should see what competencies they are proficient in. I have not fully tested this out, but it seems to be possible. 2. Or should I be creating individual learning plans for each student to be graded for each competency I understand we can use cohort sync to assign learning plans for the entire cohort. However, it seems that that grading has to be requested from the student. Is there a way that teachers can review the competency at a certain time and manually input the grading scale for the students without getting students to request? 3. Is it possible to manually grade students for competencies? Understand that a better way is to use assignments or activities to track completion status. However, we are just starting to use Moodle, so many of our assignments, quizzes etc are not in the moodle system yet (could be paper form, or in other electronic form), so it will take some time to import all assignments into Moodle. Before we get to the state where everything is handled in moodle, is there a way to manually and easily assign the competency grade to the students? Thanks, David",

          "Text": "Hello David, 1. Competencies must have a relationship to a student's Learning Plan in order to display the student's competencies. The object being viewed is the Student's Learning Plan. 2. Normally, you create a Learning Plan Template and then add in all of the competencies for that learning plan. Each student may have a unique learning plan template or you could create learning plan templates that are common goals that all students in that area of study must achieve. 2a. Cohort Sync to learning plans will automatically link student's that are members of a cohort to a specific learning plan. Cohorts are mainly used to automate course enrollments. 2b. When a competency is related to a course activity the administrator can choose to either automatically award the competency to the student or have the activity manually rated by a teacher. The student will not be awarded the competency until the teacher rates it. I would only recommend manual rating for Essay or complex assignments. 3. Competencies are not grades. Competencies are an alternate method of tracking achievement. Please note the core Moodle structure does not have standard reports on Learning plans and student competencies. The UI for working with competencies and learning plans frameworks are very unforgiving. There are many past post in the forum that you could poke around and look at to provide you with a sense of the challenges if you decide to use competencies and learning plans.",

For some institutions, this is all that what they currently need and may not yet be focused on or desirous of implementing the Learning Plans: they are focused on the course design phase. Also, I have seen a definite benefit in cases where an organization may not have experience with competency based learning models: they can use the frameworks to understand how those work. It is very valuable as the first step if you are not used to working in a competency based model. You can always progress later to add Learning Plans: but if you don't have the right set up for your frameworks to start with, and sufficiently well designed courses that align to the standards, it will probably be a less effective (and more confusing) if you rush into it.",

          "Text": "As far as my understanding goes: At the moment you can use competencies in Moodle as a teacher by doing a lot by hand. But I would like most of this work to be automated. So here is what I am looking for. According to local requirements, we have to rate competencies at four levels - which is not a problem to set up. However, in our courses we use a lot of automatically graded activities (or even assignments). But at the moment I don't see any way how I can automatically assign a student a high level of competency who has done very well in one of these activities, and a low level of competency to a student who has done less well. Doing that by hand is not only tedious (you don't see the points of an assignment or quiz in the competency overview, but also prone to error. And I don't really see the point of copying/replicating digitally available information by hand within the same system. The second problem I have: Some acitivities (rich in pedagogical content) are linked to several competencies, but as far as I see I can't award one of several competencies automatically whereas another one is just used as reverance. All these problems are in stark contrast to the fine grained possibilities when restricting activities depending on prior achievements Moodle already provides. That's why I want to ask whether there ary any plans to make the whole compentency framework more flexible? That would certainly save teachers a lot of time and frustration with teadious paper work. In case my conception of the possibilities and limitations of competencies are wrong, I'm more than happy to stand corrected.",

So far, all the workarounds I have found assume a fairly traditional approach to course design and learning, ironically. For example, they suggest hiding an activity until the other activities have been completed. The course I am designing will be self-paced, self-study. As a result, I cannot assume or impose a sequence for completing activities, nor hide any until others are completed. There is usually no hierarchy between the activities relating to a competency. What I would like to do is have a person marked as competent when all activities where that competency has been allocated have been completed. At the moment, I am thinking that the only way is for it to be done manually, but that seems strange for what must be a pretty common situation. Am I missing something?

I suspect you might get more informed information from a new post, but I had a look at this on my site. First of all, you need to have allocated all the competencies you want to use to the course. This means, as far as I can see, expanding all the sub-competencies, highlighting them all and then adding them to the course. I used a book activity, went to edit settings and then down the bottom to competencies. There I was able to click on the little down arrow and then allowed me to select any competency or sub-competency. It didn't have a competency setting at the chapter level though. I was able to do the same with a quiz as well. Hopefully that was what you were asking. I found this page very useful: https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Competencies",

I think I will have to supply a list in some form of what activities contribute to what competencies. I hate doing these things manually due to the effort and possibility of error if things change. Then at least it is the student who has the work to manually check what still needs doing.

          "Text": "Brigitte, So, two things: 1) competencies are not a trigger, but they depend on a trigger, activity completion: so you use the activity that triggers the competency to trigger further content using access restrictions; and 2) competencies can only apply to a whole quiz not to questions. A Competency is awarded based on some activity completion or not. So, you can't award it based on sets of questions in a quiz, you would have to use a separate quiz for each competency to award it or not. Currently in Moodle you can't link a competency directly to a particular question or set of questions, only to any activity as a whole (Cf. this discussion https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=402469 ). Maybe one day we will have that, but meanwhile you need to align to a whole quiz. That being so, you need multiple quizzes if you want to award multiple competencies. You then use the grades from those quizzes with Access restrictions for further grant access to specific review content. Access restrictions can be set for a grade range. (cf. https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Restrict_access_settings ). For example, if the person got 90% or a passing grade on a quiz, then award then competency; if they got 75-90, open a review section further down the course; if they got below 75, open a section with note saying sorry and a link to take the refresher course instead ;) Btw , are you affiliated with NOLS? I did the NOLS Wilderness Medicine course about five years ago. I think I need a refresher ;)",

          "Text": "Brigette, The good news is access restrictions in Moodle are pretty powerful, especially with the various plugins that are available to extend it ( https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:availability ). You can build some complex structures and content paths with them. Unfortunately, Competencies has been mostly relegated to \"oh, we have that too\" feature list and has been really lacking in feature development. Sometimes the best way to get something done is just abandon formal competencies and go with activity completions and badges and/or certificates instead. Even in those cases, though, there can be value for at least aligning all your activities to competencies. You can use Tags for Questions, if your main interest is in analysis and reporting. I've been in two projects to do this: basically, you tag your questions with tags that duplicate your competency structures, which allows you to see what is going on at least. That can improve your course design and assessments. It won't it help you or students at all in awarding competencies directly though. I love the eastern Sierra. I'm from Oregon but am currently in southern Rockies - I live right on the CDT Hope to get back out there soon for sure.",

Still trying to understand if this is possible in Moodle, basically, in my head i'd create a Learning Plan for each Job Role, then many different courses that grant Competencies. My question would be, once i have the users enrolled to the courses that they need to complete, (this should be done by Learning plans, correct?), how do i view their progress towards completion of either the learning plan or the competency framework? Is there a bird's eye view of all the competencies by that user, that HR can go and see? And inversely, is there a bird's eye view of all the users that have succeeded in that Learning Plan? Bonus points for seeing all users that have that learning plan associated, but something missing to complete it Sorry if these questions are basic, i feel lost in the documentation and moodle isn't helping - i've reinstalled several times for problems due to competencies. (Mostly, can't remove them even though they aren't linked to anything anymore) Thanks in advance for any input",

An\nindividual competency in a framework can have a different scale to the\nframework.\"  In the framework Scale is set to \"Completed Task\" (screenshot), with default as incomplete and proficient as complete (screenshot). Perhaps setting the scale differently will generate different results, but how to know?  Where is the doc that helps me to make these decisions.  For example, I could set scale to \"Default competence scale\" using the values not yet competent and competent--but how does setting the default and proficient make a difference--what is the impact of these settings?  Or I can set the scale to the one that is used for grading the assignment (please retake, pass).  But, the key seems to be in how default and proficiency are set and I have no guidance in how to set these.  For example, I see that in my custom scale (retake, pass) I can set pass as both the default and proficient?  What does that mean? Yes, in the activity competency setting upon activity completion = Complete the competency (screen shot). Any guidance that can be offered here will be GREATLY appreaciated.",

This could be very useful to create groups and further activities for students based on the individual needs found out by a competency assessment?

I have set up the competency framework, i have added the competencies, i have linked these competencies to my course and to specific activities (quiz - must pass to get the competency), i have created the learning plan for the student. The issue is that the student has completed the activitiy but their learning plan and the competency in the course have not updated to state this. I then went and tried it on me (admin) and created my own learning plan etc, did the exam and it works perfectly. My main question is, the new competencies and learning plans were created AFTER the student sat the quiz, would this be why the learning plan and competencies wont update? As when i sat the exam etc it was after the competencies had been implemented into the system. Sorry i hope this makes sense. I ran my CRON so that the system refreshed itself to see if that works but it hasnt made a different to the student and it just states the student is not competent yet admin is competent. Any help would be most appreciated as not sure why it works with me but not my current students (which is why i thought that because the competencies were set up after the student sat the exam could be the issue). Sorry hope this all makes sense, any help would be most appreciated. Kindest Regards Hannah Symonds",

More info if needed: Basically, my company is developing many short courses that can be combined into different learning plans. The same course could appear in multiple plans; for example, \"Crisis Management\" will appear in both Supervisor and Hospital Environment learning plans. My plan is to use very simple, course-specific Competencies, i.e. a Competency literally called \"Complete Crisis Management Course.\" That way, students will receive an easy-to-read learning plan reading \"Complete X Course, Complete Y Course, Complete Z Course.\" While I like the Learning Plan feature, the student-facing interface is too complex for this simple a system. I'm looking for ways to remove the Request Review feature.",

When we get a new employee, I want to assign them something like a learning plan so they are batch enrolled in all the courses in the learning plan. First of all, is this how learning plans work? Creating learning plans requires creating competencies first, but I not sure how to organize the competencies. Here is the idea, tell me how I should configure this in Moodle. I really appreciate your help! For example, I have dinner chefs and bakers. Both jobs require Food Safety training. Only Chefs need Chicken Training. Only bakers need Frosting Training.  Chefs require Basic Oven training. Bakers require Advanced Oven training. Competency Framework: Oven Competencies: Basic Oven, Advanced Oven Competency Framework: Food Safety Competencies: Clean surfaces, Safe Temperature Competency Framework: Chicken Competencies: Deboning, Marinating Competency Framework: Frosting Competencies: Mixing, Spreading Learning Plan: Chef Competencies: all in frameworks Food Safety, Chicken, Advanced Oven Chef is assigned the Chef Learning plan, which enrolls her in all courses marked with the competencies Food Safety, Chicken, and Basic Oven. Learning Plan: Baker Competencies: all in frameworks Food Safety, Frosting, Advanced Oven Baker is assigned the Baker learning plan, which enrolls her in all courses marked with competencies Food Safety, Frosting, and Advanced Oven.

Competency :-Basic Oven is insufficient as it would not allow the proper assessment. A simple approach can be to divide the task into three i.e. the pre activities , the activity and the post activity. What are the skills required for the task that relates  to the oven? Identify these in order. An oven is useful for baking or broiling:- Possible Pre-task:- Appropriate preparation of the oven:- 1. check the oven shelves (this determines quality) 2. presetting of the temperature gauge. 3. appropriate setting of the temperature gauge. (The difference between 2 and 3 is that it can be set but it was too high or too low.) Task:- 4. Proper placing of the chicken in the oven (for proper circulation of heat) 5. Sufficient baking time 6. Checking of product during baking. Post task:- 7 Turning oven off 8. Placing product in an appropriate place Check online, help can be found there. \"Type competencies training  for bakers\". I hope that you would be able to set up your plan. Best of luck Jemima",

You could have one large framework or hundreds. Note: once you setup a framework you cannot move the competency to another framework. Consider how your administrators will use these objects before you setup your framework(s). If you have one large framework, you can relocate a competency within the single framework. IMHO - I would create Food Safety as the top, Parent. I would create under Food, Chicken, Frosting, Chef, Baker. Under Chicken - deboning, Marinating. Before you can build your competencies frameworks, you have to consider scales. Scales cannot be changes once a student (employee) has been awarded the competency. We are using the Monitoring of Learning Plans plugin, which is more visual than the core design. Consider how you will use the competencies and learning plans. For Food Safety each employee will probably have to requalify annually or bi-annually. The competency objects have no end date, they never expire. Learning plans assigned to employees have no end-dates, they never expire. Deleting them removes the training history that you will need to retain for FDA. Kind Regards",

I adapted one Competency Framework from the Repository -the CFER provided by Mary Cooch- for the purpose. The scale values were: \"Not yet competent\" and \"competent\" . The scale configuration was: [{\"scaleid\":\"7\"},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":1},{\"id\":3,\"scaledefault\":0,\"proficient\":1}] I left them like that, having not much of a clue. I then added the framework to my site, and added three skills to a course. From then I created a quiz, gave it a passing grade, and attached a competency. I made a dummy user do the quiz, and when I look at the competencies, I get this: Why is the user not \"proficient\", if he successfully passed the quiz? Shouldn't the value be \"competent\", anyway, as the scale values were entered, rather than \"proficient\"?",

Unless you selected to the Upon Activity completion = Complete the competency. The Rating has to be manually completed by an Instructor or Administrator. If you did not choose a manual option for Activity completion, you should check your cron job, Site Admin>Scheduled Tasks>Complete learning plans which are due. It is also very important that all of the setup at the course + competencies are created before the student completes the activity that awards the competencies. There is no cron job to \"back flush\" and award competencies to activities in the past. Lastly, I use the excellent plug-in, Monitoring of learning plans - https://moodle.org/plugins/report_lpmonitoring This plug-in provides an easier, graphical view of a student's learning plan. This tool made me realize that creating scale values with Complete/Not yet complete are unnecessary. When a student does not achieve that competency they will have a Not Rated status. The only way a student can have a Not yet complete status is if an instructor or administrator manually selects that rating value. This is a lot of manual work using core Moodle Learning plans.",

Yet they seemed to be configured quite differently: 1-English F10 Not yet competent,Competent [{\"scaleid\":\"2\"},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":1}] competency,competency,competency,competency,competency 2-Mexico Aun no competente,Competente [{\"scaleid\":\"2\"},{\"id\":1,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":0},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":0,\"proficient\":1}] competency,competency,competency,competency 3-CCSS-ELA Not yet competent,Competent [{\"scaleid\":\"2\"},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":1}] competency 4-CFER Not yet competent,Competent [{\"scaleid\":\"7\"},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":1},{\"id\":3,\"scaledefault\":0,\"proficient\":1}] competency,competency,competency,competency,competency,competency 5-ISTE Not yet competent,Competent [{\"scaleid\":\"2\"},{\"id\":1,\"scaledefault\":1,\"proficient\":0},{\"id\":2,\"scaledefault\":0,\"proficient\":1}] domain ,indicator,competency,competency I guess the \"scaleid\" is just a name, but afterwards there appears to be different syntax. I don't know if there is a standard way to write the rule, but if so I'd like to know. Also, I don't understand the configuration of the Taxonomy field. Once again, many thanks for your help.",

          "Text": "Ignacio, Here is an explanation of the format for the scale imports in some detail. Here is the sample I'll explain. [{\"\"scaleid\"\":\"\"2\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":1,\"\"scaledefault\"\":0,\"\"proficient\"\":1},{\"\"id\"\":2,\"\"scaledefault\"\":1,\"\"proficient\"\":1}] [ ] brackets surround the whole thing and each part is defined by curly braces {} separated by a comma. The first part, the scaleid, defines the scale to be used. The following part, with id:#, define the configuration settings for the default and proficient settings for each item in the scale you are using. This example has two items in its scale since there is an id : 1 and an id : 2 The Scale ID {\"\"scaleid\"\":\"\"2\"\"} The scale id number here is the id number of the item in the database in the table mdl_scale. The two predefined ones that come with Moodle when installed are: 1 = Separate and Connected ways of knowing 2 = Default competence scale These are found and managed in Site admin > Grades > Scales. If you add a new one here, it will get id 3, unless you have already created one or more, in which case, it will get the next highest number. If you want to import a framework that uses that scale you added, then you would set the id to its number. So: {\"\"scaleid\"\":\"\"3\"\"}. Don't import a framework with a scale number that you have not already defined in your site. How to determine a Scale id? Now, Moodle does not show the id number in the interface anywhere in Site admin > Grades > Scales, unfortunately. To find a scale id, you can check in the database or you can also find it at the end of the URL parameters in the address bar when you are editing a scale. So: https://yoursite.com/moodle/grade/edit/scale/edit.php?courseid=0&id=3 indicates I am editing scale with id 3. That's its scale id. (Warning: Do not depend on the order of the scales in Site admin > Grades > Scales to determine the id number! If you delete a scale, it is deleted from the system, so you will have less items in the your list than the id numbers. Use the URL or database directly to get the ID number of a scale.) The Default and Proficiency configuration {\"\"id\"\":1,\"\"scaledefault\"\":0,\"\"proficient\"\":1},{\"\"id\"\":2,\"\"scaledefault\"\":1,\"\"proficient\"\":1} There will normally* be one each of these for the number of items in the scale. In this case the scale has two items, which we happen to know are \"Not yet competent\" and \"Competent\". Each has a setting for whether it is the default action on completing a competency and whether or not it is on the list of scale items that can be manually awarded. \"scaledefault\" sets the first one, and \"proficient\" sets the second one. 0 means off and 1 means on. - For the first item in the scale, \"Not yet competent\" the settings for it are: scaledefault:0 which means it is not the default and the Proficiency is 1 or On, which means it can be manually awarded. - For the second item in the scale, \"Competent\" the settings for it are: scaledefault: 1 which means it IS the default and is on On, and the Proficiency is 1 or On, which means it can be manually awarded. How these settings looks in the interface in Moodle is shown in my screenshot attachment below. This is what I would call a normal or common way of doing this scale: automatic completion means being marked competent, and if manual set, the marker can choose either value to award. More than Two Items in a Scale If a scale has three items, then there will be three items here for the configuation; four, four and so forth. For example, if you created a scale with three values in it like this: Not yet competent, Competent with supervision,Competent indepedently, and set the second one to be default and include all of them in the manual awarding proficiency, then the data structure in the import/export for that will be this: {\"\"id\"\":1,\"\"scaledefault\"\":0,\"\"proficient\"\":1},{\"\"id\"\":2,\"\"scaledefault\"\":1,\"\"proficient\"\":1},{\"\"id\"\":3,\"\"scaledefault\"\":0,\"\"proficient\"\":1} Recall the there can only be one item that is the scaledefault no matter how many items are in the scale. Only one will be set to 1. Any proficiency can be a 0 or 1, Off or On. *Normally: however Moodle exports themselves sometimes actually cheat on this and only indicate items with non-0 settings. This is the case in example 3-CCSS-ELA you put up. I have this same file and it exports the same thing. However, this is SLOPPY practice. Do not follow this example if you are making your own import files. It is good practice to explicitly indicate all the values for each of the scale items, like the example I started with above. Hope this is helpful. Randy",

Sorry. 1. Scale values? Is there a format to follow? My settings needed should be straightforward. I get points from 0 to 10 (or 0 to 100), below 5 fails, 5 or above passes. 2. Scale configuration Where can I find the explanation? 3. Cross referenced competency id numbers. What are they? 4. Rule outcome and rule config? Seems useful, but I don know the format. 5. Taxonomy?

In lots of industries  we can see a discussion about agile corporate mindsets and structures.  The is has massive consequences for L&D.  Typical L&D programs will run decentral and lots will be adhoc training offers and self organized trainings. The general expection for an employee is that s/he start activities and organizes learning  acitivities by self. If an employeee is interested in personal growth, getting new skills and competencies s/he should be able to identify  a learning plan and to enrole. I expect that we will have much less open central programs, much more decentral initiatives that are started  just a few weeks after identifying the need, working out loud circles und individuals that start their own journey.

          "Title": "Thinking out loud:  A competency based Moodle site",
          "Text": "As a long time Moodler I started a few weeks ago thinking about use cases for competencies and learning plans in corporate or adult training program scenarios.  I would like to share and discuss my findings and ideas. Can we set up a Moodle site that is fully /mainly based on competency based learning/courses and how would it look like.? I'm not completely happy with my results, but it will be possible that I've overseen some options. But lets start at the beginning. We can create site wide or category related competency frameworks. A competency framework bundles several competencies and brings them into a hierachical order. Competency rules allows to defines rules that a user gets a top level competency if one or many other comptencies are met. Acitivity or course completion can be connected with one or many competencies. Its possible to connect the same competence in different courses. A participant can be enrolled into a learning plan. The user sees the learning plans and progress in the dashboard . When a learning plan is created  competencies are connected to the learning plan. Participants are enrolled to the learning plan via cohorts. Is it also possible for single learners? Its possible to define different levels of competencies. I.e. basic, standard, expert. How can we use it in a typical learning environment? For each learning topic and class level a competency framework is cretaed. They are connected to typical learning plans. At school it could be Class 8 English as a second language competency framework. Each teacher has an own classroom for each class in the term. He creates learning activties and connects them with competencies. Each students is connected with a learning plan (i.e. ESL class 8) The student can see the progress in dashboard. This model will work. But there are several issues I'm not happy with.: There are competencies that are not related to one topic only. (i.e. Presentation competency is an issue in German schools in class 8/9 in most topics for this class level). If each teacher adds activities for this competency students have to do  the same/similar very often and teacher don't see the progress/successs from other topics. As long as we have class and topic related courses teachers are isolated and everyone creates individual ressources, avctivities and didactical concepts. Cooperation and collaboration of teachers at schools are not part of their mindest (mostly here in Germany). So ist a lot of effort to create courses. This stops teacher to use a LMS intensive. Let me try to discuss an alternative model. Competency frameworks and learning plans are edited on site/category level. Courses are created for competencies not for classes. Instead of typical class and topic courses we create competency related courses. Its possible that for each competency several courses are available and the students enrolls themself. There are furthermore class/topic related courses. But the intention is different than typical. They are used for communication, some collaborative activities and final exam preparation. The student sees an overview about progress in the dashboard. This model tries  to push teachers to work collaborative and to use didactical scenarios from other teachers teaching the same topic. In some cases this could be  a little bit to radical/revolutionary. If this is your reality you can use the competency based courses as template and import them  into class related courses. I didn't check whether course related competency connections are included in backups.) What is missing? What I could not realize.... How can a teacher see the individual progress for a student? How can a teacher grade, comment the students activities? How can we limit the teachers access to his own students in the competency based courses? How can we implement didactical scenarios that needs group work? I also tried to understand how we can use taxonomies. After discussion with Mary we came to the result taxonomies are only descriptions. They are not related to any function.  Is this correct? Who can see the taxonomies? What do you think?

Cannot move structures - Learning plans, competency frameworks, learning plan templates. Cannot link parent competency to a learning plan, and have all children related to the learning plan. Cannot Search the learning plan templates The current UI does not include  the functionality for students that require annual retraining to \"retain\" their current competency level or to improve on their current competency level. Functionality to set a competency framework, learning plan template or learning plan to \"inactive\" to retain the history of the objects and relationships. Deleting removes the history.

Students in the corporate world complete training outside of the LMS - and administrators often are provided evidence long after the course was completed. The taxonomies should be been at a system configuration level vs. the individual competency framework. These are just the thoughts off the top of my head.",

The corporate learning world goes through business changes that obsolete, rename and reorganize data structures frequently. Selecting all of the children in the tree view quickly, is not an issue. Sequencing them by the ID vs. manually moving them one-by-one, like the course category would be the desired functionality. Setting framework to not visible (hide), did not remove the learning plan from the student's view during my initial testing. Maybe there is a cron job that needs to run, or run more often? Or the functionality does work as expected. I am not concerned an admin picking the wrong competencies, I am concerned with the students' view of their learning plan(s). The migrate frameworks is not that intuitive to use. I have looked at it several times, but moving course competencies from the old framework to a new course is not really the functionality I was looking for. I need to reorganize an existing structure, because my business reorganized a department. I need to move a framework to a new category.",

We use Moodle 3.4 and I am currently investigating if competencies will help with yearly compliance modules. I've set up the competency framework but when going into the course administration menu I don't have a competency option. I have created a secondary account and enrolled that account as a teacher. We are currently using the Adaptable theme. I've also followed along with the \"Revolutionize Education with Moodle Individualized Learning Plans\" Youtube video, www.eclass4learning.com steps and Moodle documentation. Any idea on where I am going wrong? Thanks!",

The next thing you will discover is how challenging it is to use competencies if you have a large course/competency structures, annual competency requirements, or large student (employee) populations. The use case for learning plans and competencies requires reports (views): By Learning plan template - display all related competencies (the current view for more than 3 competencies in a learning plan template is difficult to read - cannot reorder the competency by ID) By Learning plan to display all related students (currently cannot export all students with a learning plan) By competencies to display all students with a proficient value of Yes and the date/time stamp (who is competent to drive a forklift) By competencies to display all students with a proficient value of No (who cannot drive a forklift) Also, once a competency is awarded, it can only be deleted - If the wrong rating is applied the administrator cannot change the rating. Competencies cannot be end-date - so they cannot be reused for annual training requirements. Kind Regards, Shirley",

I do not have a large cohort nor do we have requirements as such.

One issue with competencies is that course teachers don't get the full view -for example if others rate competencies elsewhere, they won't show up as complete in the course. (See Competencies FAQ Are you using learning plans? In your second video, are the competencies in just the one course? The one that shows up as met - is that in just one course?

The department would want to have a quick view of what courses are meeting what competencies and which students are not. The instructor would want to see which students are meeting each competency within their course. Students would want to see if they have met the competency. There are so many steps.

Then from the Users tab, click the link 'Assign user roles to cohort'. From the top dropdown, choose your teacher. etc... That's where I was stucked for a while... Instead, it should be described as everywhere else in Moodle, and would be much better. Site administration / Users / Accounts / Cohorts, create a cohort with the relevant students in it.

But as yet I have not be able to find out how to produce one. There is a plug-in that will get you close. And the best I have been able to do is use an Chrome extension that will produce a PDF of the individual students compencies a trainer has marked as completed. These are also tied back to learning plans. Not with standing that there is commercial type reports that could be produced from only two companies at this stage. But both of these are subscribtion based and are upwards of $US 500 per month for the type of reports we need. One of them has indicated that they are going to be working within the Moodle cloud instances, thus if you are using Moodle org as a hosted instance then you will benifit from this. But if you are a smaller school or institution our only hope is that there is a ad-hoc type report that can be done up. Keep me posted on how you go as I am interested to see how you end up and there might even be a chance to pool resources to get a reporting plugin made up that benifits the community. As this directly relates to moving forward with building on what we have developed already by using Moodle. I would be willing to set up a GoFundMe me type page. And or put it out to tender on Guru.com so that someone with more database reporting skills could pull out the info we need and have it turn up as a PDF. On that note: i have researched a few database reporting tools that look promising that are open source and in theory could build a report we are looking for. If anyone else has a solution..please share..",

I did this in 3.1, I suspect it will work as is later versions, but I don't have the data to test at the moment on a 3.4 site. This is a basic report which shows the user, the course, the competency earned, its id, its framework name, the proficiency level, and date earned. Those are the basics. (Sorry, for the proficiency all that is easy to get from the database is the number because the scales are unfortunately not properly stored as a tables but as messy strings This will work in the Configurable Reports or the Ad-hoc database queries plugins. If you change the \"prefix_\" placeholder to your real prefix for table names, it should also work in external reporting tools such as Reportico, etc. \n```text\nSELECT u.username,\n\n\nu.firstname,\n\n\nu.lastname,\n\n\nc.shortname AS 'Course', \n\n\ncmp.shortname AS 'Competency',\n\n\ncmp.idnumber AS 'Comp_id',\n\n\ncmpf.shortname AS 'Framework',\n\n\ncmpu.proficiency AS 'Proficiency',\n\n\nDATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(cmpu.timemodified), '%Y-%m-%d') AS 'EarnedOn'\n\n\nFROM prefix_competency_usercompcourse cmpu \n\n\nJOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = cmpu.userid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course c ON c.id = cmpu.courseid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_competency cmp ON cmp.id = cmpu.competencyid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_competency_framework cmpf ON cmpf.id = cmp.competencyframeworkid\n\n\nWHERE cmpu.proficiency IS NOT NULL\n\n\nORDER by u.username, c.shortname, cmp.shortname\n```\n Please let me know if this works okay, and if so, I will add it to the Ad-hoc reports page.

So have allocated say 18 competencies to a learning plan and have been using the Learning plan as a base to mark Rating -Competent Proficient - Yes This is via..       Users/Student/Learning plans ******** So If I mark this Status as Complete, in theory, it should write to the database and pull up in this report.. (but is not) but if I go to (Course)/ Reports/ Competency breakdown Pull up the client, I find that all of the learning plan competencies are not rated.. I am not sure if this is a bug in the Moodle\\Competency arrangement and or there is supposed to be some sort of linking I am doing. we know that this competency set is linked to the course as I can see the list within the \"course reports\" but under testing, I marked from here..\"Competency breakdown\" and we know it shows in your reporting.. so job well done.. I may have to look at marking from within here, As we can see.. \n```text\nCompetency ratings in this course are updated immediately in learning plans.\n```\n So..under testing, I marked from here..\"Competency breakdown\" and we know it shows in your reporting.. so this might have to be where we mark from. As to report writing in PHP, out of my league at this stage, would have to be another learning curve. but I have progressed along the path of MySQL WorkBench and have been playing with AWS-Quicksight. Quicksight is looking like it has potential. It is still early days and I am learning as I am doing. And not sure just how much scope I can get out of it as yet. so its just going to time spent on creating a report from the Tables and fields that pertains to what I am trying to achive. but your Code has given me more of an idea of where to look, so a big thanks..",

When I manually rate someone at the bottom of the scale, like Not competent, they get a 0. This is not always properly reflected in the interface, so a Proficiency of No may mean a \"not set\" or it may mean \"Rated not proficient\" (depending on the scale), so you must consult the rating to figure out which is really which. A not set rating seems to show up as \"-\" in the interface. So the database does it one way and the interface another :/. If you want, you can simply take out the WHERE ... IS NOT NULL clause to see everything not rated yet, which will be a huge report and hit the 5000 row limit in no time probably. I skipped over the Learning Plans in the query. It is looking at the competencies in the competency_usercompcourse table, which is basically the user level tracking per competency assigned to them. So, what you say about marking a Learning plan status as Complete for a user in Users > user name > Learning plans is the completion of the plan status not of a particular competency and I don't include that. It could be included with some more joins though using the competency_usercompplan table as the basis.",

In this case, I put user info first, then Course, etc. If you are happen to want to come to Montana to Mountain Moot this July, I will be teaching a class on beginning SQL and custom queries I put the Learning Plan column after Course, thus: \n```text\nSELECT u.username,\nu.firstname,\nu.lastname,\nc.shortname AS 'Course', \n(SELECT plan.name \n    FROM prefix_competency_plan plan\n    WHERE plan.userid = u.id AND plan.templateid = cmp.competencyframeworkid\n) AS 'LearningPlan',\ncmp.shortname AS 'Competency',\ncmp.idnumber AS 'Comp_id',\ncmpf.shortname AS 'Framework',\ncmpu.proficiency AS 'Proficiency',\nDATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(cmpu.timemodified), '%Y-%m-%d') AS 'EarnedOn'\nFROM prefix_competency_usercompcourse cmpu \nJOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = cmpu.userid\nJOIN prefix_course c ON c.id = cmpu.courseid\nJOIN prefix_competency cmp ON cmp.id = cmpu.competencyid\nJOIN prefix_competency_framework cmpf ON cmpf.id = cmp.competencyframeworkid\nWHERE cmpu.proficiency IS NOT NULL\nORDER by u.username, c.shortname, cmp.shortname\n```\n I hope this works and did not add any typos to it as I cobbled it together ;)",

Warning next paragraphs might be out of the scope of the original OP 's thread scope and I am thinking should be taken into a new discussion. On the learning plans, I am actually marking each competency within the learning plan as \"competent\". So far for compliance reporting,  this is all we have had to do after a student has completed thier training via assessments and 'time spent on self paced learning, plus a range of other evidence that is submitted. As a whole, I haven't been going in and changing the learning plan to \"completed\" (read only status). I just did that on a few yesterday to see if they would show up with in the report. (As the report was showing only legacy students from last year that I  started running competency based activities on). Thus, this is where I noticed that. Going to.. (A) Student...learning plan(s).. Clicking in each plan brings up competencies. Mark as competent (via clicking on competency). Then using the \"learning reports\" plugin it will show as a list that are showing as \"yes\"... (I have then been able to use a chrome based plugin that will give me a pretty good printable report that can be downloaded as a PDF and signed off on.) While this has worked, by querying the database (as we have now done). I found that these individual competencies completed status is not being reflected across the system. (Which we can see via these 30+ students not showing up in the report we just produced). But.. (B) Going back into a course. Down to competency.. Report.. Pull a student up. Mark the competencies. (Which are then auto updated in the learning plans).. We can now see these come up in Both the database queries and learning plan reports. So, my deduction from this is.. Seems that it's a one way street.. as in this procedure (B) is linked to learning plans.. but learning plans marked via procedure (A)  are not linked backwards in the database..but are in fact producing standalone data. (This is shown via the ability to produce a learning plan report that shows competencies completed) I am not sure if that makes sense, but happy to discuss in another thread. Would love to see how intelliboard plugin handles this but don't have access to that higher level reporting. Would love to run the tests to see what it produces and compare.",

The importer shouldn't really create a new scale if one can be found using\nthe configuration column from the database. The scale configuration as far as I\ncan tell is a JSON string and could be easily used to check to see if the Id\nalready exists and then use that as part of the configuration for the new\nframework. We may have gotten around this issue by push/pulling information from the Moodle\ndatabase.

The initial logic with those two features is that by connecting them with courses you can define which course will help a particular employee build up his competency level or in general develop a competency level. And that is ok. But the thing I want to do with this is that based on the employee's competencies (organization skills, communications skills, IT knowledge...) he can see or be assigned to a particular course. So if the guy is an IT specialist when he signs into our Moodle page, he'll automatically see only courses that correspond with his roles and competencies, and of course, he can then choose if he wants to roll in. I assume this is Role connected, so can somebody suggest how to best approach this? Thank you in advance.",

I have now set competencies in place across a range of courses and its mandatory for us to be able to produce a report that has to printed to the students file to cover off on the how we deemed they where competent via the range of self paced learning modules and assessments given.. But as yet there doesn't seem to be a ready available report that can print out. Noting of curse that you can right click and print the browser type report. Following on from this thread.. Competency Breakdown Overall Report Mary has done a good job to steer us to this setup Learning plan viewer but this is still not a printable report of a group of students and or one student unless you use the above web print. (I haven't been able to get any of my clients profiles to look like this as yet..) -- Edits -- after looking through the intelliboard demo site, I realise that ours setup is looking like the link below, but as we have more information in there, its a tad different.. https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Competency_breakdown_report I am using this one at the moment and still playing with the setup but once again there is not the ability to just hit a print button.. Monitoring of learning plans So with that in mind, have a nice early morning meeting my time here in Australia with the lovely team from IntelliBoard to see how their plugin might be of help here..

There is a some positive news for the Moodle-hosting users coming.. I will leave that to the Moodle team and the company involved to announce. Where does this leave us small self hosted users of Competency based and learning plan training.. Unless your willing to pay $US5,000-$10,000 per year... Basically out in the dark.. the following is taken off the Orange School Demo site.. So we know we have a great set of reporting tools housed within Moodle site.. And we know this Data is being captured. If there are other's that would like to team up and explore ways to achieve a plugin that would allow export or a pdf report of these. I would be willing to discuss possibilities of how we can make this happen. My idea at this stage is sub-contract out the programming of a plugin that would allow this to happen. I think via a PM would be a good idea, as I cant be the only one that would be looking for this solution. I am not looking for all the bells and whistles that  the commercial reporting plugins offer.. Even if it was just like how we can export the Moodle users logs in to a excel format would be fantastic. I have looked in to the Moodle Configurable Reports - but there are a few things against this. . Plugin is not supported at this stage on higher Moodle versions (But seems it might be coming) And at this stage I don't know if there the right code available to produce a report like this?

Using BIRT To Report On Bugzilla in MySQL BIRT Report Designer I just came across this via some reading and it seems to be that it could be used to setup a report that can be moulded  to the different calls we would have to make.. As to the OP 's request. I haven't come across a way as yet that can pull up Multiple students\\Clients and mark them Competent in groupings. Also I am a little worried about getting in to deep with using Moodle Competencies and not being about to pull out these reports. From a compliance point of view, its imperative that we have access to full reporting (printed or electronic copies) of each subject module and its set of mapped competencies. So with taking this a bit further one Module might have 18 Competencies against it. Map this across 16 modules gives us 280+ Competencies. While in theory it would be nice to say that Moodle Competencies based learning is not going to add to the work load of the Trainer\\assessor. At the moment comparing it against a excel spreadsheet\\Word Template document and and having the ability to \"Power Mark\"  and have comments for reasonable adjustment and supporting evidence is a more labour saving exercise then the setup of how Competencies in Moodle are at the moment. My New years wish... The ability to preview a students\\clients logs.. then come back in to the Competencies and Bulk accredit these. Add comments.. and then be able to print a report with the whole lot out.. all with in a 5-10 minute sitting..",

This prevents the competency from being deleted from the framework, as the database suggests there are still links between it and users in a course. The competency breakdown report for the course/users in this table doesn't show anything, but the link still remains. How to solve this?",

These features can be put together to require someone to annually re-achieve a competency (which is a actually a new competency for every year). Expiring a competency after a time period or on a certain day has been mentioned but I don't think anyone has created a tracker issue for it (it seems like a good idea).",

We need to have a self-sustaining workflow for a professional development environment. So, how can I set up my system so that a student can review learning plan templates and select/instantiate/enroll in a pre-designed learning plan on their own?

Milestones As the ACGME began to move toward continuous accreditation, specialty groups developed outcomes-based milestones as a framework for determining resident and fellow performance within the six ACGME Core Competencies. What are Milestones? Simply defined, a milestone is a significant point in development. For accreditation purposes, the Milestones are competency-based developmental outcomes (e.g., knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance) that can be demonstrated progressively by residents and fellows from the beginning of their education through graduation to the unsupervised practice of their specialties. Who developed the Milestones ? Each specialty’s Milestone Working Group was co-convened by the ACGME and relevant American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) specialty board(s), and was composed of ABMS specialty board representatives, program director association members, specialty college members, ACGME Review Committee members, residents, fellows, and others.",

I then add the framework to a course, and link an assignment to one of the competencies. I then go into Learning Plans through Site Administration and can create a learning plan. When I get to the next step, choosing a competency to include in the learning plan I get the error below. If I go back to the list of learning plans and click on the plan I get the same error. This works fine if I create a learning plan for a specific student but not when I am trying to create a system wide one. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! Nikki",

If you mean rating competencies in the same way a teacher would do for a student, but more in a peer assessment kind of way, you could try one of the custom roles for this. A huge note of caution though: in peer assessment it's most useful to have at least 3 assessments per user, to have a nicely balanced score/rating. With the current set up of reviewing and rating competencies, this can not be done: 1 rating per competency. This probably has to do with the nature of CBL/CBE and the preferred 'competent/not yet competent' scale for this. In such a black-and-white situation, there is no place for multiple assessments/ratings for any given competency: you're either competent or you're not.",

I have also noticed for ALL of the courses that the people assigned as teachers (or higher) do not have \"Competencies to Review\" showing up in the Learning Plans.  (screenshot from Moodle docs below).  Their Learning Plan windows look the same as the students. I found something in MoodleDocs about a capability \"moodle/competency:usercompetencyreview\" but could not find that in the list of permissions in my courses.  I'm not sure if that's relevant? In essence for two of the courses the only way we can tell how far through the competencies our students are is to login as the student and look through the competencies, note them down if they have requested a review then log out, login as ourself and manually rate each competency by going through the lists. I saw something about a Learning Plan Viewer Plug In.  Is that a feasible fix for any of the above? Any assistance is greatly appreciated, I have put so many hours into building these course that the thought of having to rebuild them is somewhat alarming.",

If they answer all (4) questions correctly, then the maximum they will be able to reach is the second level of the scale (out of 6). What have I done? In the lesson, the grade is set to 'scale' (with maximum grade of 6) Grade to pass = 2.0 One competency was assigned to 'course competencies' Each correct answer yields 0.5 points of the grade What happens? When the learner answers all 4 questions correctly, he reaches the maximum of the scale (6), not the second (2). Can someone help me achieve the objective that I had set? Thanks !!",

It makes no sense to have teachers/instructional designers rebuild competency frameworks in csv so they can be imported to Moodle only to conclude that the imported frameworks can't be moved to a more appropriate position (category or course level). A further wish would be to add the following on category level: When managing a category, the user clicks Competency frameworks Selects Add competency framework Gets the option to duplicate or use a System level competency framework (select from list) Gets the option to create a new one altogether Also, learning plans created at a lower level than System, should be able to access System competency frameworks without having to duplicate the framework to the category. In a regular LMS setting, like a school, I imagine it would be really confusing to have all the teachers come up with their own frameworks, but they should be able to build their own learning plans from the competencies in the 'System competency frameworks' library.",

In other words, import a csv file to System competency Frameworks, then, pop over to phpMyAdmin, find the corresponding entry for that comp and change the context id to match the category I actually want it to sit under.

          "Text": "Greetings all, I am not sure where I should post this, so starting here, let me know if it should be elsewhere. MOODLE v3.2 - Competence Frameworks, I am creating a framework at site level (we have no defined standard internationally or nationally).  I have my 5 top level competencies, and I am breaking them down into smaller chunks against which activities will be judged. What I want to know, is at what level I should be defining, or breaking down the competencies into performance criteria at the framework level  and where I I stop and then have the remainder defined within a course.   This is hard to explain. For example, if I have a top level competence, say COMMUNICATE then that is one of the top level competence elements in the framework.   Then say I am testing communication in terms of written and oral.  So I have two subcompetencies COMMUNICATE - written and COMMUNICATE- oral.  Then the written communication requires that the people use the correct systems or technology, use appropriate language, and, say, cover the right material.  Should those three sub-sub-competencies be in the framework, or in the course? Is there any kind of standard that anyone knows of? Many thanks for any thoughts, or any advice on where else this kind of topic is discussed, I know it isn't really to do with moodle, moodle is just the tool, but I figured someone here might have hit this problem before me! Cheers Michelle",

          "Text": "Hi Michelle, This is more a CBE (Competency Based Education) question than a tool one, but I'll see if I can help you (as the topic has my particular interest). The key is to be as concrete as possible when elaborating the competencies in your framework, limiting each competency to one specific behaviour/skill/situation. For your example, this could mean: Communicate Oral Informal I can have a phone conversation I can ask questions about something personally relevant, such as directions to the nearest bus stop etc... Formal Written Informal I can write a post card from my vacation address I can IM with a friend I can write a status update for my social media Formal I can write a formal letter to apply for a job I can write a resumé to accompany my job application I can write an email to a potential employer to apply for a job And so on... one good source for this elaborate breakdown of competencies/skills/can-do statements is the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, aka CEFR. If this is not a foreign language thing you're after, you might want to look into descriptors for soft skills, that are bound to be out there.",

          "Text": "Hi Joost! Thanks for the reply,  I have done more research and thought and discussed this at work.  I am going to add one thing.  Thanks for your post, that helped to get me started! Basically I have decided to split the framework elements Vs course measurables using elements that are non-perishable (and hence in framework which stands the test of time) Vs perishable (measurable in course that might change in the future). i.e.  Oral - informal and Oral - Formal would be part of the framework, we can assume that these will be required forever (non-perishable).  However, the medium used for oral communication (phone/video.) is perishable, the phone may cease to exist, video may become hologram (?!) .  I'd argue that the ability to ask questions is non-perishable, where as using a particular system (phone/twitter/facebook etc) are perishable.  So I'd be putting the system based performance criterion in the course, and the non-perishable in the framework. Does this sound sensible to others? Joost, should I be adding this to CBE discussion? Not sure where that is.... Thanks! Michelle",

You're right in saying that communication skills don't necessarily depend on the tool used: even when humans used drums or smoke signals, they still needed to master the skill of asking questions, answering them and exchanging information in an efficient way. Same goes for computer skills: tool-related stuff can be managed in in-course tasks (being able to store a document made with MS Office Word on a laptop by using the short key Ctrl-S), whereas the skill 'I can create, edit and save a text document' would be handled in a competency framework.",

On reviewing the Learning Plan via the Learning plan templates for that user, it is marked as complete (see attached 1). However, when going into the course and viewing the Competency breakdown report, the competency is marked as not complete for that same user (see attached 2).

I will try to elaborate on this to reach my goal This takes place in a very formal situation, related to the educational structure in Belgium. If someone is interested, I can give more explanations about this and how I try to use the competency framework to follow the formal guidelines we're given... As a starter, I join an \"Educational file\" which is the base for an \"MS Excel\" course. The main points are \"Learning outcomes (capacités terminales)\", which must all be met for the student to succeed. Each one of those are quite general/vague (encode and treat data, present results in a graphical form,...) and has to be broken down into several criteria, more precises. This is arbitrary, the teacher can follow his pedagogical methods, the official program defined for the course, etc. to create his criteria. Basically some moodle activities would be related to some criteria, and once all or a defined part of them are met, then the \"parent outcome\" would then be marked as completed. When all the outcomes are met, then the student succeed for the course. The point is, those criteria cannot be evaluated on a single activity, and multiple activities should be involved in one of them (this was the original meaning of my question). So both your suggestions are helpful, Mary's one for the last part, and Joost's one for the structure of the course itself. I will try to implement both and see how it works",

Then when this fourth activity is complete, the competency can be met. Because in order for the fourth activity to be visible the other three activities must already have been completed.",

In order to be able to post an issue in the Tracker, you have to vote for a number of related issues, so you can prove you're a human being. This prevents the Tracker from being spammed by bots and other things. As for the competency ID numbering, I normally work with a spreadsheet program, set the framework ID to 1000 for instance, the main categories within the framework to 1001, 1002, 1003, etc, and then use the spreadsheet to auto +1 the value for every competency in there. Automating this in the interface may seem like a useful feature, but working with a framework of over 100 competencies, it's a bit of a task keeping track of all the layers and subcompetencies. You have to keep track of the parent competencies and their ID numbers in order to be able to correctly relate them. I found working with a spreadsheet > CSV a lot faster than the interface.",

Since the rating chart only records rated competencies, in this case it displays the status of the 2 rated ones (2 out of 2). In situation 2, you only rated 1 of 2 competencies. The rating chart only displays the breakdown of rated competencies (the other one does not have a status 'rated' or a rating associated with it), so it will only show the 1 color. The hint is in the mention of total number of ratings being 1/2. You would expect a chart showing something like 50% grey and 50% color of the rating, if it would display all competencies rated/unrated and then broken down, but I suspect this is not how this chart works.",

          "Text": "Hi Rob, Elsewhere in this forum, there was a discussion following the same basic question: can I use the competency rating in a similar way to the activity grading (and completion settings)? At this point, I would say the competencies approach can not be compared to the grading approach. With what Moodle presently provides for competencies, they're best used in an all-or-nothing way: you're either competent or you're not. Having said this, it might make sense to break the relevant competency (or competencies) down into more useful bits, adding multiple levels of competency to the test (a basic behavior, an average behavior, an above average behavior and an expert behavior). These ratings should not be in the same competency, but should be treated as separate ones. Then, breaking down the test into smaller units with a corresponding level of difficulty, will enable you to award 1 competency per test/quiz: basic test ==> basic competency average test ==> average competency above average test ==> above average competency expert test ==> expert competency As for the other issue of how to handle the not-rated-yet competencies: I think the recommendation would be to find a clearer way to have them displayed. In the regular studyplans overview window for a student, it displays a progress bar that will fill according to the number of competencies rated in the plan. Unrated competencies are and should be left out. Competencies rated as not competent, do show up in the list, but not in the progress bar. Condition to fill the bar is: competency is rated as competent. There is a lot of room for clarification and improvement in the way all this is displayed and how CBE is approached using Moodle, as you can see and read here... Hopefully this helps you in figuring out how to implement it all.",

As row 1 contains all the headers, row 2 contains everything regarding the framework. - rows 3 and further should contain the actual structure of the framework (built according to the taxonomy you chose). These rows should NOT contain Scale Values, as these are defined at framework level. Nor should they contain Scale configuration (same applies as before). Rebuilding the file should work as following: in row 2, add general framework name, info and configuration (isframework = 1) in row 3 and 4 add SIL0K and SII0S, remove Scale Value and Scale config If you take the CEFR example from Moodle.net , you can follow that structure to build what you aim to achieve. // Edit 1 Which Competency Framework Importer do you use in Moodle 3.1?

          "Text": "Hello there, I have two issues with competencies that I hope have a workaround. #issue 1: Automated competency using competency rule can only move from 'not completed' to completed' and not backwards. I have a competency framework with a competency rule that e.g. 100 points need to be collected for completion of the competency. However, I decided I needed to change the points (e.g. happens when new comptencies are added), so the new total for completion is e.g. 120 points. However, I already received a \"completed\" status in my learning plan for achieving 100 points. The status does not automatically move back to 'not completed' because I now need 20 extra points. #issue 2: Manual set competency overrides automatic competency. No way to remove/reset manually set competency. I have set my competency to \"completed\" manually but now wish to undo that so that it will again look into my competency rules in the competency framework and automatically award competency when I fulfill the requirements. This appears to be impossible however, as it is not possible to change manual rating to \"no rating\" and manual rating appears to override automatic rating. Hope you can help me with this? If these two features indeed do not exist yet in Moodle, can i request them somewhere? Note: I am using Moodle 3.1. Thanks!",

Unlike the badge awarding system in Moodle (where you can modify criteria based on which the system will award badges or retract them), the competencies don't allow for this. There's no going back on being competent. I guess the same goes for the second question: once a student receives a competency rating, the only way to delete or undo it, is to remove the competency (framework) altogether. As for the requesting of features, this can be done in the Tracker . Make an account, find the Competencies bit under the Moodle project, rate or follow at least 4 tracker issues to prove you're a human being and you can request these features to be added. This is however subject to peer review and comments from the Moodle (dev) community, so there's no garantee the features will be added. IMHO , I doubt these features you described have any added value, but that's only my take on the subject.",

With my test student, if she gets a grade that is not a passing grade, she is marked with a red Cross here And the competency is NOT met: When she tries again and gets a passing grade the tick changes to green and the competency is  then automatically met On the other hand, even though it works as it should , I agree that having a \"Require passing grade\" option for an assignment like a quiz is a good idea.

On completion of the training they can print out a certificate for their records and for evidence when loading onto a competency database .\n\nHow can i make the course so they can access again and reattempt the training as if they had never completed before with a new certificate with the correct date? I hope that makes sense?? I have it set at the moment so they must spend 40 minutes on the activity before a certificate will be issued (video is 41 minutes long) The training will be conducted by a lot of people (Potentially 100,000+) so this process needs to be completely automated, also they may access it at any time over the training year.\n\nThanks in advance for any help/guidance you may have",

Points give you the possibility to add some more or less weight to child competencies on completing the parent one (Some maybe more important competencies ). In your example, giving equal points to all child competencies and say they are all required would do the same thing as choosing the option \"when all children are completed\". Like I said in a previous post ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=336350 ), \"Cross-referencing competencies do nothing more than showing competencies\nrelated to one another. I think the purpose is to make it easier for\nstudents who would build their own plan to find competencies to add\". There is not other logic or mechanism here. Regards, Jean-Philippe",

For instance, a competency in Minnesota 4th grade Science is \" 4.2.3.2.3, Demonstrate how an electric current can produce a magnetic force. For example: Construct an electromagnet to pick up paperclips.\" That competency (Minnesota calls it a benchmark) is one competency in the group of standards, named, 'Energy can be transformed within a system or transferred to other systems or the environment.' The group that that standard is in is called \"Energy\" which is a group in the larger group, Physical Science, which is in the larger group Mn 4th Grade Science Standards. I would like to use an off line submission of an Assignment activity that includes a rubric to determine whether or not the student(s) have achieved mastery of that competency. I would likely have a comprehension quiz and another simple assignment on which students would need to earn a certain grade and complete before they attempted the Construct an electromagnet project. As the Director of Elementary Science (theoretically) for a school district that includes 45 elementary schools that each have on average 3 classes of 4th graders, I want to run a report on that competency by class, by building and for the whole district. I would also like to be able to drill down and view the artifact submitted by each student, and the completed rubric with teacher comments, in fulfillment of this competency. There are twenty other 'benchmarks' in 4th Grade Science with hierarchical groupings at each of the above levels. I will also like to run reports on aggregations of those 'scores' by all of the above. How do I set-up reports like that?

Lets say I have 5 main competencies with sub competencies Competency 1 subcomp 1 subcomp 2 etc. Competency 2 Competency 3 Competency 4 Competency 5 Some platform-wide manager can grade sub competencies (preferably maybe define some of the description grades like \"You can easily communicate in english in writing and talking\" or \"Your talking is a little poor and writing is good\" so he can easily use it to grade every user in the same way - and every description would have its own points, in percents lets say), and then from the sub competencies overall grade for competency is calculated (normal arithmetic average would be ok). I know I can open the grade book, add new category \"Competency 1\" and insert inside that category sub competencies, then grade it and I can have my grade for the competency from them. But is this platform wide or only  inside the course? Is it a proper way to use it, or maybe better would be outcomes or competencies? How to proper configure scales, if they are needed? And in the farer perspective - how to merge it with course completion or grade depending on the quiz result? I know moodle would grant me the best possible solution, but as always - way to achieve it is painful So I hope you can share yours experience! Thanks",

Competencies in Moodle 3.1 are a very powerful tool and we need changing a bit our teaching habits but : - Competency Frameword supports hierarchy between skills - Different Scales may be associated to different Competencies - Learning plans may be associated to individual users or to cohort - Competencies are platform wide and, better, category wide - Competencies may be evaluated through activities By the way you may transform your Outcomes list and scales to a competency framework.

As it is stated in MoodleDocs for Outcomes : Outcomes are specific descriptions of what a student has demonstrated and understood at the completion of an activity or course. Each outcome is rated by some sort of scale. Other terms for outcomes are Competencies and Goals.",

In Moodle, there is a site administration setting called 'Enable outcomes' and in 3.1, the description of this setting has been changed to 'If enabled, grade items may be graded using one or more scales tied to outcome statements.' Thus, outcomes in Moodle are to do with grading only. There is also a site administration setting in 3.1 called 'Enable competencies', the description of which is 'Competencies allow users to be assessed according to learning plans.' The documentation Competencies provides a fuller explanation, mentioning competency frameworks too. Thus, competencies in Moodle 3.1 are a lot more complex than outcomes!",

Our ministry looks very closely at the \"outcomes of our competencies\" and we need a method in the course to assess how many students achieved the competency and report that in our Ministry reports. We are now very integrated to the Moodle gradebook and in my opinion in the short time I spent in working through the competency framework - I would love to be able to attach it to the graded item and to evaluate the results through the gradebook. I know there is a work around but I would like to encourage the developers to add them to the gradebook for adding it to a graded item and the category. Thank you again, Nancy K.",

You can get it anyway from github at https://github.com/damyon/moodle-tool_lpimportcsv It needs to be installed in yourmoodle/admin/tool and once installation is completed, you will have an Import and Export link added under Competencies. Works nicely and will let you match your csv file columns to the one used by Moodle CBE frameworks, if they are not the same already.",
