I tried with both editors (ATTO and TinyMCE) and using the same image which which correctly append (#) at the end of each same file to distinguish images with same names. So you screenshot is exactly what should happen for the wiki to use the correct image. John is correct that this has happened in the past and is hard to replicate in the wiki. So I wonder if there has been some security updates added to your college moodle site by admin that is limiting certain files to be uploaded into a wiki? Because when I manually delete the files the and clear the cache the images disappear. Plus if a user could upload an image it's available to veiw for them if they do not clear their cache however the image will not be available to other users.",

The group mode in Wikis often requires teachers to enroll themselves into groups to view individual student contributions within those groups. This setting is meant to simulate the group environment from the teacher's perspective but can indeed lead to misunderstandings. You might want to check the settings under Group Settings in the course admin panel. There may be an option to view all groups at once without needing to join them. If not, perhaps enabling \"Separate groups\" and granting teacher permissions for group-wide visibility could be a workaround. Hope this helps! Let me know if you find a different solution! BR 🤔",

          "Text": "Hi everyone! We are using the wiki activity extensively in our site due to its collaboration and version history features. However, the page editing experience is a pain for many of our users, especially ones who are experienced with HTML and would like to add more advanced styling to their pages. We have noticed that wiki pages in HTML format don't accept various HTML elements added using the editor (from HTML/code view button). For example, we would like to use the HTML tags <details> and <summary> to embed collapsible blocks of long text or pictures (\"accordion\")  that can be easily shown/hidden in order not to impair the page appearance. See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp These tags work perfectly in standard moodle pages and other activities. They are also displayed properly in the HTML editor when editing the wiki page. However, as soon as the wiki page is saved, the tags are completely stripped. Plain text and simple tags like <p> and <div> remain. It looks like the wiki doesn't recognize the tags at all, or there is a list of allowed elements where they are not included. The same behavior can be reproduced with Atto, TinyMCE and Plain text area editors. All our wikis use HTML format. Can anyone please advise how I can enable the use of these tags, or at least hint at what functionality may be responsible for stripping them from wiki pages? We use Moodle version 3.10.1+ (Build: 20210226) with the default Boost theme.",

Often, when there has been no update in the last few days (for example over a long weekend) the page will be empty and say: \"There are no updated pages\". Perhaps this view displays only pages marked as \"recently updated\", and a page remains \"recently updated\" for a very short time... Do you think these are settings we can control?

Event monitoring sends a separate email every time it is saved — but if I set the threshold higher, someone who makes a single post without revising at all would not hit the threshold. It should provide a way to consolidate multiple edits to the same page by the same user, to eliminate multiple non-significant reports. The report doesn't give the title of the page being edited, only a link. I don't see any way to have all participants notified of changes to wiki.",

Unfortunately, someone deleted a lot of files from the Wiki file list, so that those pictures did not display any more.

To make matters worse, deleting files from a Wiki is not included in the Moodle logs, so it's not even possible to know who deleted the files. There is also no permission tied to the ability for deleting files that I could take away from the student role, without taking away their ability to add files as well (mod/wiki:managefiles).

We have a situation where Class 1 of 16 students, are grouped into groups of 4. eg Group A are asked to research and present task A. They in turn will update the wiki page allocated to them 'Group A' in this case. Can this smaller group be allocated a sub group, for example class 1 students are enrolled as a group 'class 1' can they be allocated a sub group eg Class1 Group A for this activity? My other question is when Class 2 take this lesson can the wiki be set up so they can see the opening page with the links to the respective task pages but not be able to view any of Class 1's work Due to foot fall we are running this lesson about once a month to different classes. We are utilising the group function already when they are enrolled to distinguish each class when they run through the course. This assist us with scores, grading etc etc. Any words of wisdom would and will be much appreciated. In anticipation SAM",

Some time ago, just after decision to go w nWiki for M2 was made, I asked Ludo question about how to develop and roll out multipage student wiki. The process to do that in erfurtwiki was easy enough but fraught with formatting issues. He showed me a template utility (on the drwiki site) that would make such an exercise technically trivial and there was a post in the forum at the time I thinking explaining it (in auto shop at prsent so difficult to search.)\n\nWhen nWiki was released,however, this utility did not seem to be included. I posted questions about it but never saw an answer. As I was concerned about continuity issues, I did not convert my wikis to nWiki (which appears to have been a good decision....) and as a result never followed up.\n\nI would try to connect with Ludo on this .....\n\nGood luck",

          "Text": "OK,  Ulrike,  back to the nitty gritty - lol.... erfurtwiki is what the default wiki in Moodle is based on through Moodle 1.9.x. nWiki is the basis for the wiki in Moodle 2+ The process you describe  \"should\" work, and the fact that you produced a bit of a page suggests that the content of your page caused a problem.  The process is a bit tricky because of the play between wiki markup format and html format,  and the wiki moves back and forth because the activity provides an html editor..... If you want,  please feel free to upload your text file and we can look at it.  It will help a bit for you to become familiar with wiki markup, because that is going to probably be the format least likely to get chewed up in importation. I think the wiki still explains some of the markup if you click on the right little yellow help circle. You don't need to save it as a .txt file,  you just need to save the file as an ascii text file.  Text editing on a MS WIndows machine can be confusing because you may not get a pure ascii text file,  which causes all kinds of grief.  WIndows uses the txt extension for \"text\" files,  but offers a number of different flavors that can be used with that extension. At some point I documented some tools and techniques one can use to manage such things.  Have you looked in docs.moodle.org for additional info on wiki formatting? AHhh,  I see a number of the links are broken etc. I did find this discussion: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8501",

It seems to work well enough if you were using the build-in wiki from 1.9 with its four simple tables, but fails badly if you had already inserted nwiki as a contrib module into 1.9, and then later upgraded to 2.0 (or 2.0.1 even). Seeing several irate posts about it I tried deciphering the upgrade path in function xmldb_wiki_upgrade() and if my limited understanding happens to be correct, the process of taking nwiki -> nwiki2 amounts to impersonating the old wiki, and then upgrading that to nwiki2. This doesn't seem to be very successful (and to me it seems a bizarre notion), but is it not possible that the upgrade could detect the nwiki structure already in the database , and upgrade that? Perhaps this would avoid the mess with wtype and subwiki fields missing! I feel that a tracker item on this with a 'critical' tag is appropriate. Some unwary admin may find it very difficult to backtrack from an unhealthy upgrade!

          "Text": "Hi Séverin, There is a way to work around the lack of templates being built in to the wiki if you have the Sharing Cart installed. Make sure the settings for Sharing Cart at Site Administration > Plugins > Blocks > Sharing Cart, has a check mark by Wiki so that you can include user data. Create a sample wiki fixed up with whatever you want included in it for  your \"template.\" Copy it into the Sharing Cart and Select Yes when it asks, 'Do you want to include user data in a copy of this activity?' Now, anytime you want to start a wiki that includes your \"template\" just click the Copy to Course button for your wiki in the Sharing Cart block and drop it into the topic section of your choice. Everything and all the pages you put into the original \"template\" version will be in the new wiki. I've tested both collaborative and individual wiki's and they both worked. Works easiest if you are NOT using groups. For individual wiki's, if you want the first page to already be formatted then you WILL have to make the first page for EACH student, before you add it to the Sharing Cart. Note: If you modify the original \"template\" and then replace the one in the Sharing Cart, you may have to clear the cache first or your changes might not show up. I learned it was easiest to force the data to be updated by using a version number in the wiki activity name. HTH , AL",

We are still using Google Docs for that piece (a workaround) but if we could have templated, individual student wikis with pre-designed pages and some prompts there - that would absolutely fit the bill (i.e. a multi page wiki pre-designed by us, set on individual, where student put in their reflections and add docs in the spaces provided) As we often have hundreds of students in ONE course making the first page for EACH student is simply not sustainable. It would be ideal to have a wiki object that one would design and \"save as template\" and then insert it into a course for students to amend /contribute to individually. Are we dreaming?",

Facilitators want to be able to put up cases for discussion in PowerPoint format.  Students will need to be able to discuss these cases as well as being able to upload their own cases. It would be good if all materials and discussions related to a particular case were kept together. So far I have tried the following: set up a discussion but the discussion activity doesn't allow uploads of PowerPoint or PDF files set up a wiki for each case. I'm concerned about the number of wikis that would need to be created. Students can upload files and start a new discussion but these are all related to that particular case. Tried to have a multiple page wiki but it didn't allow files to be attached to a particular page/case. Any suiggestions??",

          "Text": "Hi All, Reading through this thread, this appears to be a pretty vexed issue that has not yet gone away! It certainly appears to be the case that in Moodle 2.0(.1) YouTube videos are handled differently inside a wiki to the way they are handled in a course topic or similar general location. In a course topic the whole object/embed content (or even the iframe) copied from youtube's embed panel can be pasted into the html editor, saved and displayed as a video. This object takes its size and settings from the copied code, and so even 3D glasses options will work INSIDE moodle without the need to link out. Of course, you cannot paste such content in at all if object/embed code is specifically outlawed in... Admin -> Security -> Site Policies    'Allow EMBED and OBJECT tags' = No unless also in the same site policies 'Enable trusted content' = Yes, AND the user's role settings say their content will be trusted! More strictly, you can paste it in, but you find it remove or deactivated. But aside from these permissions issues, this embedding method of getting youtube content into a topic works a treat! In the wiki, however, we do not seem to be playing by the same rules! This may well be forced onto the situation by the notion of the wiki being a collaborative activity (generally speaking), so if you can't 'trust' the content from one user, how can you trust the content from another! If this is the view taken, which seems likely, then object/embed & iframe entries pose a security risk (or at least the risk of unacceptable content), and these get removed even if you are a trusted being! So what about using other possible routes? Yes, you can enable the Multimedia plugin filter for youtube videos and that works consistantly inside and outside a wiki. As we know, this means that if you enter some text, highlight it, click the hyperlink button, and then paste in the url of the video. Such as:  youtube.com/watch?v=0GcLW0g_c1s. Note however, that this url needs to be take from youtube's ' share ' panel, not the 'embed panel' because they are quite different. The 'share' version works with the filter, whereas the embed version youtube.com/embed/0GcLW0g_c1s does not! This is simply because the filter is looking for ?v= in the url, and in the latter version it isn't gong to find it! [note I've had to cut the http etc to stop this link linking!!!] So for moodle to behave consistantly we need to be consistant too. And there is obviously room for confusion here. There is also a method involving the use of a [youtube] tag each side of the url, as explained here: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Multimedia_plugins#YouTube_Link_Filter but I'm still not clear as to how that is different from simply using the media filter described above. However, the multimedia filter may solve one problem, but it creates another. Elsewhere it has been explained that you can change the size of the display in some types of media by trailing it with d=400x300 (or similar), but the youtube instance of the filter strips these out . in fact it strips out all the content after the ? except the v=#### video reference. This means that using the multimedia filter to give youtube content results in a loss of control of the size of the video in the wiki, and leaves out all the options (such as the colour of your 3D glasses)! So we appear to have away to go on this as yet. Regards, John",

          "Text": "Having thought about this a bit more, I think Franco's solution above may work but will have unintended consequences (such as switching off filtering you want left on). So I have set about finding a fix for the underlying problems. Firstly, not being able to supply dimensions to the youtube filter the way you can to Quicktime or Flash video. This only really requires a few changes to the file /filter/mediaplugin/filter.php We find the line if (!empty($CFG->filter_mediaplugin_enable_youtube)) { and make changes as highlighted (copy and paste, but only in a proper HTML editor, eg Smultron, Fraise, Ultraedit) if (!empty($CFG->filter_mediaplugin_enable_youtube)) { //see MDL-23903 for description of recent changes to this regex //$search = '/<a.*?href=\"([^<]*)youtube.com\\/watch\\?v=([^\"]*)\"[^>]*>(.*?)<\\/a>/is'; $search = '/<a[^>]*href=\"([^<]*?)youtube.com\\/watch\\?v=([^&\"]*)(&amp;d=([\\d]{1,3}%?)x([\\d]{1,3}%?))?\"[^>]*>(.*?)<\\/a>/is'; $newtext = preg_replace_callback($search, 'filter_mediaplugin_youtube_callback', $newtext); $search = '/<a[^>]*href=\"([^<]*)youtube.com\\/v\\/([^\"\\?]*)(\\?d=([\\d]{1,3}%?)x([\\d]{1,3}%?))?\"[^>]*>(.*?)<\\/a>/is'; $newtext = preg_replace_callback($search, 'filter_mediaplugin_youtube_callback', $newtext); } Then we find the callback function filter_mediaplugin_youtube_callback and make these changes... function filter_mediaplugin_youtube_callback($link, $autostart=false) { $site = addslashes_js($link[1]); $url = addslashes_js($link[2]); $info = addslashes_js(strip_tags($link[3]));//strip out html tags as they won't work in the title attribute if (empty($link[4]) or empty($link[5])) { $size = 'width=\"425\" height=\"344\"'; } else { $size = 'width=\"'.$link[4].'\" height=\"'.$link[5].'\"'; } return '<object title=\"'.$info.'\" class=\"mediaplugin mediaplugin_youtube\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"'.$site.'youtube.com/v/'.$url.'&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" '.$size.' >'. '<param name=\"movie\" value=\"'.$site.'youtube.com/v/'.$url.'&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" />'. '<param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"playerMode=embedded\" />'. '<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" />'. '<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />'. '</object>'; } This should allow dimensions to but put in either in the form http:// www .youtube.com/watch?v=6RFuRY7azgA &d=450x300 or http:// www .youtube.com/v/6RFuRY7azgA ?d=450x300 Note thank this depends entirely on the url you get from 'share' in youtube! Finally we can also get Moodle to do the work on putting in an iframe that users are generally blocked from (along with object and embed). My reasoning here is that it must be safe for moodle to do in the say way as it embeds to object safely for you! Here we add an extra trap in the filtering process inside the same braces as before (top of this post) $search = '/<a[^>]*href=\"([^<]*)youtube.com\\/embed\\/([^\"\\?]*)(\\?d=([\\d]{1,3}%?)x([\\d]{1,3}%?))?\"[^>]*>(.*?)<\\/a>/is'; $newtext = preg_replace_callback($search, 'filter_mediaplugin_youtube_embed_callback', $newtext); Note this adds a NEW function call so them we add a new callback function (below the current youtube one) /** * Change links to embedding Youtube content into iframe Youtube videos */ function filter_mediaplugin_youtube_embed_callback($link, $autostart=false) { $site = addslashes_js($link[1]); $url = addslashes_js($link[2]); $info = addslashes_js(strip_tags($link[3]));//strip out html tags as they won't work in the title attribute if (empty($link[4]) or empty($link[5])) { $size = 'width=\"640\" height=\"390\"'; } else { $size = 'width=\"'.$link[4].'\" height=\"'.$link[5].'\"'; } return '<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" '. 'src=\"'.$site.'youtube.com/embed/'.$url.'\" '. 'frameborder=\"0\" '.$size.'>'. '</iframe>'; } And THIS allows you to use the youtube embed content, BUT WITHOUT THE IFRAME STUFF ARROUND IT. Like so: http:// www .youtube.com/embed/6RFuRY7azgA And add dimensions, like so: http:// www .youtube.com/embed/6RFuRY7azgA?d=640x390 I've tested this moderately well though only on Firefox . Thats all for now. John [note: I have inserted a couple of spaces in urls to stop them linking! - there must be a better way?]",

I have set an assessment task for my students in a Moodle 2.0 wiki and we have the bizzarre problem that images uploaded and inserted into posts are dissappearing after several hours. When a user uploads an image and/or video to the wiki moodle server said image is assigned a location on the server (eg. http://moodle.uni/draftfile.php/8707/user/ draft /705008760/activboard300_20090625112013.jpg) such that the image can be displayed in the users post. After an undefined period of time that asset is no longer linkable and will no longer display in the post. If you put in the address for the asset directly you will get a page with \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found\" (e.g. The link above). When you look at a wiki post where this has happened there will be no images in the post and/or a broken image icon (depends on how the browser handles it), but going into edit clearly shows the img tags and references to the missing image. Please note that a 10min test is unlikely to make this issue apparent as there appears to be some undefined period of time, or unknown trigger before the uploaded assets become dead. Create a wiki post with some uploaded images and leave a day and the issue may become apparent, or maybe there is a trigger such that the more images others upload the quicker your assets are dropped from the server. I can only speculate, but hopefully someone expert in the moodle wiki can resolve. Please advise ASAP. Best wishes, Matt Bower",

That said, I do know a bit about the file API, and draft file URLs should not be used except while you are editing content (such as a wiki page). Once the content has been saved, the version of the image that displays to users when not editing should have 'pluginfile.php' not 'draftfile.php'. So if, when you use the html editor to add an image to a wiki page, after you save the page, the image on the resulting page still has the URL 'draftfile.php', then imo this is almost certainly a bug in the wiki which (after making sure it still occures in the latest release version, 2.0.2 or whatever) you should report in Moodle Tracker . I believe the draft file areas, which are (when it's working) used only temporarily while editing, are deleted periodically in cron, which is probably what's causing your problem. --sam",

I didn't do the install, my IT team did.  They don't speak much English.  I don't speak much Chinese.  We've had this problem for a couple of months.  We're using:  $release  = '2.1.1+ (Build: 20110803)'; What can we do to fix this?",

I noticed that it has \"draftfile.php\" when I edit and also that the image disappears right when I go in to edit.  The image is stored in the legacy course files repository for this course due to the conversion but I can't insert it back into the topic easily. Does this mean that a converted 1.9 course cannot be edited without having this kind of issue?",

Front page is a special case because nobody is in student role by default there but you said students can't edit your course wiki... Editing roles is not at all necessary unless if you have a very good reason to change default settings. Or are you trying to allow GUESTS to edit wiki??? (override global settings in some course)",

The students were able to use class time to add content which we witnessed them doing (this was 5 days ago).  The teacher then went back to see the progress and the information that the students had added was not present.  I experienced the same symptoms when I went into the wikis ( nor was any history present other than the initial setup history that we had done) .  I checked the logs in 'wiki administration' and students had added content.  I can even view that content (as well as history) when I select the provided link in the 'Event name' column within the logs. What can I do to display those wikis normally for the teacher?",

Below is some general information on my Moodle: I'm running Moodle 2.8.7+ (compiled 2 days ago). All modules and functionality in Moodle is correct (I can add, delete, use, etc everything). The exception is using anything related to the Wiki module. As soon as I create a Wiki, it gives me the \" Invalid course module ID\" error. If I create another module (for example, a book) this works flawlessly. However it refuses to run the Wiki module I created. Things I've already tried: I've got the same Moodle running on my MAMP installation and I was able to create a Wiki there. Oddly enough! I've made a backup of the working Wiki on my MAMP and tried to restore to me server . No luck. I've checked the MySQL database and all entries are correctly made into mdl_wiki. Both the MAMP and the production site have identical entries into mdl_wiki, so I do not understand the issue. I am, quite frankly, completely stuck on how to solve this. The problem also existed on Moodle 2.8.7, hence the upgrade to 2.8.7+, which didn't fix the situation. Thanks everyone for reading this post and any help would be greatly appreciated, since I'm eager to begin building some Wiki's!",

Identity Management Principles 1.1.2. Authentication Techniques 1.1.3. Authorization and Access Control To me, that looks as though those are level 3 headings (which I'd thought would be \"Heading (small)\". Sure enough, editing the raw HTML shows that \"Heading (large)\" is actually <h3>, not <h1>, and editing it to correct the levels in the raw HTML gives me much bigger headings, with \"[Edit]\" buttons to the right, and a much more useful table of contents at the top: Table of contents 1. Identity Management Principles [edit] 2. Authentication Techniques [edit] 3. Authorization and Access Control [edit] 3.1. Mandatory Access Control 3.2.

It doesn't put in \"[edit]\" links against the <h3> - <h5> headings in the ToC or the wiki page, but that's something I can live without. This gets the Atto editor working \"correctly\" with the wiki; TinyMCE users just have to remember that a Level 3 heading is the top level in a wiki page (a convention I'd adopted previously anyway - <h1> and <h2> are used in the main course page.

I will maybe better suggest using the forum for this.  Each student is creating a  reply to your first message asking them to put a picture of their achievement If you really want to use the wiki  I would suggest that all the students are sharing the same wiki,  and then they are building the page altogether showing each other their result with the help of picture By the way, to answer your question, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to add more than one picture  in your winki Could you be more specific about the procedure are you following? dajan",

You're maybe wondering what the point is of an 'Authenticated user on frontpage' role? In general with roles and permissions, for maximum peace of mind, you should only allow capabilities for things you want users to be able to do. Most sites don't have front-page activities for logged in users to participate in (activities are are only in courses, where users have the role of student or teacher), thus the 'Authenticated user on frontpage' role is sufficient. I can't imagine you having any problems with the front page role set to student if you check carefully what you want users to be able to do or not do. For example, if you have a standard forum on the front page, do you want everyone to be able to start discussions there or post replies?",

We would loved to use Moodle Wiki as our content management system, but we miss an \"approval\" function. For example we have three authors, an editor and a manager. Authors work on wiki and each one's adds are tracked in the history. Then we need a button/function to say that wiki is ready for the editor's review. Then the editor reviews, makes the changes  needed and he wants to mark the wiki as \"More author adds are needed\". Authors come in again, update content and mark the pages as \"ready for editor's review\" again. Editor reviews and verifies that \"content is ready for manager's review\". Manager gets in, review and finds the stuff perfect so marks the pages as \"Approved\". Does anyone else has thought about this? The same \"approve function\" could be also usefull in class projects and academic research projects. If there any developer that could add some inputs in this idea? Is it something feasible or seems like a 'mission impossible'?",

They show up fine at first. Student saves the page and all seems fine. However, when they return a day or so later to their page, their picture is no longer there. Students are blaming each other for deleting their pictures. Using a Wiki has been a complete disaster as the reason for using a wiki is to foster collaboration. Instead, I have several angry students and parents. After viewing the Wiki forum it seems this is an issue that is affecting more than just me. Has there been any resolution to this issue? I really want to continue using Wikis, but if there is no resolution, my principal wants them to be removed from the class. I have looked at two or three Moodle trackers, but they all seem to get closed since the issue cannot be reproduced. I'm not sure if I should open up a new one or not. Fingers crossed someone out there can let me know what I can do to resolve this. Thanks!!",

We're running 2.6.2 and we've had this problem for over a year: the reports last fall that cmoore added were us, too. It's difficult to reproduce because it happens when there is a class all working in a wiki at the same time, but not when only one or two people are editing a wiki. This means it _looks_ fine when one or two staff test it out, but when students are getting close to deadlines they have their image links break and freak out and come banging on our doors. We're considering testing out OU Wiki as an alternative but we would far rather use the regular wiki if this bug can be chased down. Here's a roundup of the relevant links for the infamous draftfile.php bug . https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=170655 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=185839 And this Moodle Tracker issue: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-26782 ...on which you'll see us reporting the problem last fall around this time. We don't think it was ever fixed in 2.4. We're certainly still having it. John, please do open up a new tracker issue, I'll both add to it and encourage others who have had the problem to speak up. It's a leading source of frustration about our install right now, and we have faculty with a long history of wiki projects under our previous CMS and we need to find them a solution that behaves at deadline time.

Students can view the wikis of all other students in the course. \" which is what I would like to do. I tried this second method, creating it as an individual wiki with a group mode of Visible Groups, However, the student is able to create content once on his first page, and then has no more ability to edit his wiki.  The edit tab isn't there at the top.  He sees a drop-down menu for the other students' wikis, and can see them, but he has no edit ability on his own wiki.  The teacher can edit all wikis. Any advice or insight one can provide would be most appreciated. Thanks Joe Amatrucola Moodle 2.6.1+ (Build: 20140131)",

Would anyone be able to give a few clear steps on creating a TOC?  I know I can do this manaually using html and hyperlinking to various pages, but if these pages change, I'd rather not be going back to the TOC to manually update the them.  I'm pretty sure I'm not alone with this one Any advice would be very much appreciated, Thank you Andrew",

I thought I would try backing up and restoring the wiki to a new course.  All went well until restore when I got the error below. All suggestions welcomed!

There is also the idea that data requires its own structure, it demands it essentially. What are you presenting? Static knowledge, googleable content? Informative opinion? Dynamic information? Peer interaction? Wiki or Book, what about forum? Your response also needs to take heed of what you are trying to accomplish in the course - not just the learning outcomes, but the processes involved along the way. That should determine what tools you use. I am currently developing alternate responses to these questions and finding a set of solutions, not just one size fits all. Essentially, Moodle does one job, another tool does another job that Moodle is not designed to do. Seems to be working so far... but we shall see. So let your information and your processes define how you respond to each circumstance.",

Essentialy an SMS, it also has a small LMS module that is more or less a credible wiki and not a lot else. I am not sure that they will be selling internationally yet but I imagine it won't be long. I am developing a solution that meets our local laws regarding storage of data, as well as promoting positive learning outcomes. It also uses MS-Sharepoint which we are turning into a local repository - so not a lot is going to be stored externally. Moodle is, hopefully, going to be used for resources and online testing, If they can get Mahara up in that environment, then that will be for eportfolio and social networking with other common open source tools for more specific purposes - Wordpress for one. All locally stored and we can develop them to suit our need. One snag, Sharepoint 2013 is not being co-operative right now so the whole strategy could be brought undone by it.

I've done extensive searching in the forums here and in the Moodle issue tracker, but haven't been able to find anyone else describing the same problem (my apologies if I overlooked something). We are currently running Moodle 2.2.4 and the Wiki is set up to use Separate Groups. What are we are finding is that comments are not always posted in chronological order. It seems to be triggered by editing a comment, though this does not immediately re-order the comments. The edited comment is generally date-stamped correctly with the updated date and time, and is placed at the bottom of the comments. However, subsequent new comments are often inserted somewhere in the middle of the comment thread. To date, in testing, we have not been able to determine a pattern for the misplacements. All new and edited comments appear to be correctly date-stamped. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Thanks, Trevar",

You can backup your entire doner course (or selected parts of it) and restore it into a recipient course without having to overwrite all the recipient's existing content. Now this needs care, and I wouldn't attempt any such thing without first making a full backup of the recipient ! What is more I would do the whole job TWICE, creating a new almost identical copy of the recipient (with only the short and long names changed a bit) and this course hidden from students. We'll call this our dummy recipient. Then go back into your donor course and back it up, or at least those parts you want to transfer. Now download the backup file and go into dummy recipient and upload the file into its backup files area. Now restore this file from within the course and select \"Merge the backup course into this course\" and when offered \"Keep current roles and assignments\". Now check everything , but especially User enrolments in the course, your wiki content, and any other content that ought to still remain, e.g. Forum posts etc. Only if you are completely happy with the result should you then try this on the recipient course, and even then, not without knowing where you put that original backup file.

It doesn't upgrade OK however, when using a 1.9 backup zip and restoring the zip to 2.1. The user content isn't imported. Looking at the moodle. xml file in the backup zip, it appears that the content is there, but the 2.1 import process doesn't import it. So, during the site upgrade from 1.9 to 2.1, one of our wikis had the user content at the end of the process and all others didn't. The only obvious diference between them (looking at their settings) is that the one that worked is a 'group' wiki and the ones that lost their content were 'teacher' wikis. But the 'type' setting doesn't appear to matter, as a backup zip of the group wiki doesn't restore to 2.1 anyway. It's looking like a copy and paste of pages may be the quickest way forward",

Would an individual wiki work well for a individual portfolio, where an each assignment gets an individual wiki page? Could I use a group wiki for the entire class where they each post there assignment under the corresponding assignment title?  What I am thinking is that this group wiki would have several main pages, such as Applicant Cover Letter, Obituary Assignment, Internal Memo etc... Then each student would get an individual subpage.  So then there would be say 25 sub pages for each main page.  I want to organize the student work in a way that I can access easily in the future. Any advice would be much appreciated.",

Then I can start grading/evaluating. The comment tab was available to me in 1.9. As for moodle 2.2.x, I still have access to the Comment tab.

You could just try UNTICKING the 'force format' box and see if things return to normal, HOWEVER, I wouldn't alter ANY settings on ANY module that already contained student work without first using Backup in the Course Administration and backing-up everthing - especially WITH all the User data settings ticked (on some sites this requires an administrator!). I offer this caution because on some modules changing settings may reset the activity data. So this is either good practice or total paranoia! Regards, John",

          "Text": "Hi Ted, Does this mean that all your links in all blocks turn back to grey text after you have visited them? If that were the case your theming could be better! I'm not a Wiki expect but it sounds to me as if the css theme settings for links aren't doing you any favours. If the colour (color) setting for a:visited is the same as your ordinary text then they will certainly turn to plain text after the page is defined. If you are using Chrome browser then you can right-click (or CTRL-click) one such link and choose Inspect element to see what the settings are. You should also be able to change the colour temporarily here to see what effect that has. Similar things are available in in Firefox if you have Firebug installed as an add-on. To make permanent changes you need to edit the css. But if you do that in the theme's style.css you may affect all links. You can also work with the wiki's style.css in /mod/wiki/style.css. You should not open this file in a word processer such as Word, but in a text editor or a special css editor (a text editor will do fine). Start by saving a spare copy of this file (in case of disasters). Find the entry that begins: a.wiki_newentry and replace it with: .text_to_html a:link { color:purple !important; } a.wiki_newentry:link { color:deeppink !important; font-style: italic; } a.wiki_newentry:visited { color:turquoise !important; } Save the file and refresh the page. Do you get strange colours now? This should allow you to narrow down what you want. But note, you may also have to go into the Admin settings -->Theme settings and switch on Designer mode, otherwise you may not see the changes. This is one of many good reasons for not doing this on a live site, it will slow the site down. Hope this helps a bit. --John",

          "Title": "Simultaneous editing occurs in wiki with overwriting of data as result",
          "Text": "Hi all, We have discovered that the edit protection in the wiki of Moodle 2 is not watertight. Normally, if a (student) user tries to edit a (collaborative) wiki page that is being edited by another user, they would see an error message: \" Someone is editing this page right now. Try to edit it in a few minutes. \" However, experience has shown that nonetheless it is sometime possible for users to edit a wiki page simultaneously with as a result that the data of the user who saves first is overwritten by the one who saves last. Our tests have so far identified three possible scenarios: An interruption in the Internet connection. If a user, for instance using an unstable wireless connection, suffers a short interruption in his connection, another user can open the editing mode of the same page, provided they click at the right moment. A mix up with open browser windows or tabs If a user leaves the wiki in editing mode in one browser tab then opens another with which he/she also surfs to the wiki and then gets the view mode, another user can open editing mode for the same page even though the first user still has it open. Using the back button If a user edits and saves a wiki page, the pages becomes editable by another user, but the first user can use the back button of his/her browser to reurn to editing mode without encountering the error message. We wonder if anyone else has noticed these and other cases where the edit protection fails? And also if anyone has suggestions for improvements, apart from instructions to students for proper use of the tool. We use Moodle 2.3.2+ Rgrds, Paul.",

          "Title": "OU Wiki to replace current wiki module?",
          "Text": "Well, the wiki module is listed as possibly being replaced by OU Wiki at some point in the future in the Roadmap . The question I would ask here is why was this not done in the transition from v1.9 to v2.0? I know I am being unfair, the amount of excellent work done by a lot of people, (none by me), should not be so casually dismissed, but as a fan of wikis, I am actually appalled that the Moodle wiki is so.. so... dowdy.  It was poor in v1.9, and did not fare any better in v 2.0. I understand there was a substantial debate around a new wiki for v2 but really, the end result is disappointing. I know the perception has always been that MoodleWikis should be course specific, but I would ask why? This may have been desireable a few years ago, but is it still so? For me, Moodle wikis can work at two levels, one is site wide, much the same as Forums and Docs do here, (but with a single login). The other is at a course level. Most educational institutions, and businesses for that matter, could well use a tool with that kind of flexibility. Wikis can be specific, and general, and as a place for all sorts of information. We are now well used to using Wikipedia as a source, but what if a school, for example, had the opportunity to develop a school wide Moodlewiki? What if a class of students had the ability to develop a single wiki for an ancient History class, and their teacher could use that as a fully annotated and referenced demonstration of student learning. Better still, could the teacher then not allow continued development of that wiki at a site level?  Over time, it could become an incredibly valuable resource for a school. Is this not what wikis should be? Rather than OU Wiki, why not use MediaWiki as Moodle Docs does? Why not fully integrate MediaWiki as a part of Moodle. Any comments or suggestions are most welcome.",

The idea of Moodle is flexibility, and there is, of course, strong argument that Wikis should relate to courses, as activities , but the broader picture is overlooked in that context . Flexibility should not always mean just within Moodle. The other important thing too is that there needs to be a single login policy. That does not happen in Moodle.org, and I do not understand why? It is likely if there is a embedding of mediaWiki into Moodle that the login process will be taken care of. Currently, in our circumstance, our students log into their computers/network, then to the internet, then to Moodle, then to a wiki (if we had one). Now, to me that is just putting barriers in place. (I know that there is a couple of programs that will change this, like iChain, but that assumes all network techs have a high skill set and that is not always the case.)",

Usually this sort of thing is a hangover of a third party pluging that has not been properly cleaned out from the previous version. you may also need to go to the database via phpMyAdmin and look in the database for any table that relates to that mod and delete that as well.

Then, I click on that page to create it and I add some content, etc. and save changes. I go back to the main Wiki page and the page is not created! It's still in red. When I click on it, it shows me the content I had in there. I save every time, and every time it refuses to actually create the page. Any other page that does not contain images in its name functions just fine. I'm not sure if I'm missing something . . . Is this a known bug? If not, please let me know so that I can report it or maybe you will be more capable of reporting it then me . Thank you!",

I have recommended to them to use the URL address of a picture they find instead of the Download - Upload method. I am not sure why but some projects (Separate groups) are successfully displaying pictures, some projects not at all, and curiously some are sometimes showing a picture in one page but not on another. I will still insist that they use the URL instead of dowloading the picture, and then uploading it to the server . I have a feeling the wiki is not displaying it for me, when each student can see theirs.  I suspect the path to the file is not referenced correctly if one is not the owner of the project they are reading.",

All the other OU Wiki functionality seems to be working OK; just saving changes produces this error (major bummer). Changes are not saved. Please see attached screenshot for the debugging stack trace information for errors thrown by OU Wiki for Moodle 2 version 2012030700. This error appears to have started after I successfully performed a weekly upgrade to Moodle 2.2.2+ (Build: 20120329) from the previous week's 2.2.2+ build. (I've been running Moodle 2.2.2+ on a VPS with Linux CentOS and MySQL .) I had OU Wiki for Moodle 2 version 2011112900 installed at the time (which had been functioning without any problems previously), so I uninstalled that older version (after backing up and then deleting the few OU Wiki instances I had already created). (During the uninstalling process, I did notice that simply clicking the Delete button from the Manage Activities page did remove OU Wiki from the list of installed modules. However, when I manually inspected my database, I found the 8 mod_ouwiki tables still in the database. The tables were empty but had not been dropped from the database. I manually dropped the empty mdl_ouwiki tables from the database. I also manually deleted the mod/ouwiki directory. Seemed like a clean uninstall at that point.) Then I uploaded and installed the latest version 2012030700 found at https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-mod_ouwiki . Installation was successful and I could create a new OU Wiki instance in a test course without problem. However, when I attempt to create a new Start Page by saving a bit of simple text content, I get exactly the same database write error with version 2012030700 as I did with the older version 2011112900. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? I will also post a bug report at https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-mod_ouwiki as the README doc directs.",

To stop others having to go through what I did (making three large wikis that all had to be rebuilt from scratch), here is an instant guide which should help... Thanks to Mary the Moodle Fairy. Simple Instructions for Understanding Wikis in Moodle 2.0+ The 'spirit' of a wiki is to allow anyone to contribute to it. However wikis can be made which are editable only by an individual (e.g. teacher) but viewable by all . The key is that one has to use a collaborative wiki to do this. Being able to do this negates the Moodle 'book' module from what I can see. Read on... In Moodle 1.9, settings for Wikis were different. There used to be three wiki types: Teacher or Trainer Groups Student (Individual student or trainee). Things changed from Moodle 2.0 which offers only two types of wiki: Individual Collaborative. Confusion can arise from the help box in Moodle 2.0+, which pops up when the user asks for information about the difference between an individual and a collaborative wiki viz : The culprit is the statement in relation to the individual wiki: 'everyone has their own wiki which only they can edit'. What the box does not tell you (which in my view it should), is that INDIVIDUAL WIKIS CAN ONLY BE VIEWED BY THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE TEACHER ALONE. If the teacher makes an individual wiki, students will not be able to see it . The words 'individual' and 'collaborative' refer to who can view the wiki, not who can edit it! So: if you want to make a wiki which is viewable by all, but editable only by an individual (i.e. the teacher), you need to make a COLLABORATIVE wiki ...then edit the permissions section for that collaborative wiki as described in the summary table below. Student only, to see and contribute to wiki individually Teacher only to contribute to wiki, but viewable by students as well. Teacher and students to be able to see and contribute to wiki When you first set your wiki up, make it an Individual wiki. Set groups as required. Set up a Collaborative wiki (otherwise students won't be able to see it), but then remove student permission to edit after you have set up the wiki . Do this by clicking on the wiki and then going to: Settings>Wiki administration>Permissions and removing the 'Student' role from 'Create new wiki pages' row. Set up a Collaborative wiki with groups as required. Summary Collaborative wikis don't have to be collaborative, and you might want this. Don't use an individual wiki unless you want to be the only person who can see it. It would be great in the future if it was possible to change an individual wiki into a collaborative one (and vice versa ) after the wiki had been made. One thing that still confuses me i s that in Settings>Wiki administration>Permissions , 'Create new wiki pages' exists, but not 'Edit wiki page'. I hope I've got all this right. - Open to comments.",

We had the same problem and after days figuring out what's going wrong, we found it out: The filenames where reserved names, e.g. activities .png or viewgroup.png. Both files where 100KB each and one could see them in moddata of the course and in moodledata. Finally we suggested to change the names, e.g. to activities-2.png and viewgroup-2.png, and upload the newly named file. Suprisingly the files showed up! Now our problems is, deleting the old files. We deleted them in moddata but the links still show up in the attachment-page even though the files aren't in the Moodle-system anymore. I have two questions: 1. Where do I get a list of reserved names/words in Moodle? 2. How do I get rid of the filenames in the attachment-page? I quess these links are somewahre in the database .

Notice how the html content in the HTML editor looks the way it is suppose to: Now save the wiki and display the content again. Notice how the content doesn't look the same anymore: Now if you edit the wiki page, the html editor is also messed up: What is happening?",

          "Title": "Standard version 2 Wiki doesn't seem to understand groups and groupings",
          "Text": "Hello, Is anyone else having problems with groups and the standard Wiki module in Moodle version 2? I'd like to be able to set up a wiki on a version 2 moodle system in which, \"there is one wiki per group, students can change the wiki of their own group only, and they can view the wikis for all groups.\" When using moodle 1.9 and the standard issue Wiki I often set up a wiki so that small groups of students could collaboratively edit their own group wiki, and view the wikis of other groups (see the yellow cell in the table below). This does not seem to be possible in version 2. Either students are able to edit both their own group's and other groups' wikis, OR they can only edit their own group's wiki and not even see other groups' wikis. The settings for a 1.9 wiki to make this group collaboration possible were (also see yellow cell in the table below): Type: groups Group mode: visible Grouping : Grouping-A (this setting not necessary, but useful in courses with lots of groups) The Wiki settings in version 2 are different. These settings; Wiki mode: Collaborative Group mode: Visible groups Grouping: Grouping-A result in a wiki in which students can edit their own group's wiki AND those of other groups. I was hoping that these settings would emulate the 1.9 version described above (and in the yellow cell below). These settings: Wiki mode: Individual Group mode: Visible groups Grouping: Grouping-A Available for group members only: checked result in a wiki in which students cannot edit a group wiki (to be expected) but can edit their own wiki. They can also see the wikis of other students. The strange thing about these settings is that even with the \"Available for group members only\" checked, students can see a menu of all students and groups in the course, not just the groups in the relevant grouping. I have tried other combinations of settings, but none get the result I want and used to be able to get in 1.9. i.e. \"one wiki per group. Students can change the wiki of their own group only. They can view the wikis for all groups\". This is a bug, surely? For your reference, here are the Wiki types available in 1.9, copied from the help files of a 1.9 system: Wiki types (in 1.9) There are three wiki types: Teacher, Groups, Student. In addition, like any activity, the wiki has the Moodle group modes: \"No Groups\" \"Separate Groups\" and \"Visible Groups\". This leads to the following matrix of nine possibilities: No Groups Separate Groups Visible Groups Teacher There is only one wiki which only the teacher can edit. Students can view the contents. There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wiki of their group only. There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis for all groups. Groups There is only one wiki. The teacher and all students can view and edit this wiki. There is one wiki per group. Students can view and edit the wiki of their own group only. There is one wiki per group. Students can change the wiki of their own group only. They can view the wikis for all groups. Student Every student has their own wiki which only they and their teacher can view and edit. Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of other students in their group. Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of all other students in the course. Unless the group mode has been forced by the course settings, it can be set with the groups icons on the course home page after the wiki has been created. So how can this group wiki feature be emulated in version 2? _______________________ Environment: Moodle 2.0.2+ (Build: 20110413) php 5.3.3 MySQL 5.5.9",

We use version 2.0.5 and appear to be experiencing some strange things going on in the wiki with groups.  After reading some of the posts here I can't find an exact replica of the problems we're experiencing but there's certainly some similarities although some date back to last year now. I have a tutor using the wiki with separate groups.  After thinking we'd lost content we noted that the tutor has to add himself to a group which then enables him to view each student groups wiki.  The alternative was for the tutor to create a new page which then enabled him to view each groups wiki contributions. We got through this... As students are now getting familiar with the wiki and developing they have requested to view each others groups in the wiki.  Of course the wiki settings were changed to visible and then the tutor is unable to view any wiki content again even though he is allocated to a group!  So we change the setting back to separate groups but I am trying to clarify if this is how the wiki should work and whether if a student contributed to their group wiki whilst the setting was visible and then the setting was changed back to separate would that content still exist. I am still carrying some testing but would apprecaite any feedback! Thanks Kate",

          "Text": "This just happened to me and I think it's pretty significant.  It's quite common to customize groupings for individual projects within a course and to want to preserve work done by these ad hoc groups at least until the end of the course.  We use groups a lot to separate sections of students, so the teacher can have a single Moodle class for Algebra I, for example, and still keep the period 1 and period 2 students separate.  Within these class groups, it would be convenient to be able to have groups within groups, as well, so that you could dynamically group students within a class.  So I would propose two features, groups within groups (allowing students to be in multiple groups, with the activity respecting these groupings), and work not being lost when the groupings change. I think the ideal would be to allow students to be separated into groups and then choosing the groups that will be used for that activity.  That way, you could have different groupings of students and then the activity for which you created the custom groupings would respect only the groups that were assigned to it.",

As a teacher, I do this every week or before I make significant changes. Then I can always restore the backup either on my local computer or on a copy on the online server . (I'm also a course creator in my category so I can do this.) As for groups, I learnt the hard way not to delete them too. Now, I put the students in Groups Red, Yellow, Blue and Green for Task One, and East, West, North, South for Task Two, and so on. If there's another way of avoiding the problem, I'd like to know too. \"Groups within Groups\" exist - you have to get your Admin to turn \"Groupings\" on and explore what it says in the Docs. Cheers, Glenys",

          "Text": "Yes, you can go into you Moodle database and remove wiki pages manually, but you will also want to remove the content and links. It can get very messy if you are not careful. I would recommend just removing all content from a page you want to get rid of except a Do Not Use warning, and then wait until they give us a delete page button or tab. If you must though, the page will be in the mdl_wiki_pages table and the content will be in the mdl_wiki_versions table. The versions table will have an entry for each version of the page listed on the History tab. The mdl_wiki_links table will also have an entry for every link that will take you to the page you are wanting to delete. You will need to make sure the entry for the page is the one you really want to delete because if you are like me, I have a lot of wiki's and many have pages with the same name. To help make sure you delete the right contents, you can write yourself a message on that wiki page, then look for it in mdl_wiki_versions. When you find it, make note of the pageid because you will need to look through the whole mdl_wiki_version table and delete ALL the entries that have the same pageid. If you look at the History for the page you will know how many you should find. Once you have those taken care of you then need to go look at the mdl_wiki_links table. Refresh your browser then look for any topageid that now has a zero entry. The frompageid entry should correspond to the one that had a link to the page you are deleting. Look through the whole table because if you linked to the deleted page from more than one page, there will be others to find and delete. The two times I have wanted to do this, I made a sample wiki to play around with first so I would not risk messing up a wiki I was actually using. Hope this helps.",

We have just done a trial upgrade of our 3.5 million record Moodle installation (with an entire copy of the database and half a terabyte of files), and it all went swimmingly well with just a couple of correctable errors (like missing files) until it got to the Wiki! Even then the process ran smoothly up until 'Migrating old pages to new pages' and 'Migrating old history to new history' , both of which were full of errors namely exceptions thrown with very little information given! Error writing to database * line 162 of /mod/wiki/db/upgrade.php: call to debugging() * line 526 of /lib/upgradelib.php: call to xmldb_wiki_upgrade() ... Error writing to database * line 326 of /mod/wiki/db/upgradelib.php: call to debugging() * line 175 of /mod/wiki/db/upgrade.php: call to wiki_upgrade_migrate_versions() ... I have some clues to offer, I think that the test to avoid duplicate entries in /mod/wiki/db/upgrade.php at line 157 doesn't do what it is meant to... try { if (!$DB->record_exists('wiki_pages', array('subwikiid'=>$record->id, 'userid'=>$record->userid, 'title'=>$record->pagename))) { $DB->insert_record('wiki_pages', $page); } } catch (dml_exception $e) { // catch possible insert exception debugging($e->getMessage()); continue; } and so the upgrade attempts to insert a record where it should not! It is notable that both lots of errors are thrown from the same place in the code, which is pretty surprising to me at least, since they are generated from quite different functions. I feel that things might have gone a little more easily if the Wiki team had chosen to rename mdl_wiki to mdl_wiki_old and run the upgrade by migrating this across to a new mdl_wiki table. It seems that its all a bit like trying to eat three Shreaded Wheat - but that one may not translate well! Possibly, we may next try to explore getting rather fuller debug info! Regards, John",

          "Text": "When I first started using Moodle years ago the forums were very helpful to me. Now that I consider myself somewhat skilled in some of the aspects of this powerful teaching tool, I like to share my knowledge whenever I can. If anyone is struggling (like I did) on how to create a wiki with groups, I hope this step by step tutorial helps. Create a Wiki with Groups (Subject: American War Battles) Create Groups 1. On the course page select “Groups” under “Administration”. 2. On the groups page click the “Create group” button. 3. Fill in the following info for this group: · Group name: civil · Group description: Civil War Group Project · Enrollment key: civil · Click the “Save changes” button. 4. On the group page, make sure the civil group is selected and click the “Add/remove users” button. 5. Add users to the civil group (move them from the right box to the left box by clicking the “Add” button). When finished, click the “Back to groups” button. 6. Repeat steps 2-5 to create three additional groups (vietnam, world1, world2). Make sure to make the appropriate changes to Group description, and Enrollment key. Note: Enrollment key is optional. 7. Return to course page. Create the Wiki Turn editing on. Click the drop-down menu for “Add an Activity”. Select “Wiki”. On the “Add a Wiki” page fill in the following: Name: American War Battles Summary: American War Battles Group Project Type: Groups Print Wiki name on every page: Yes (optional) HTML mode: HTML only Allow Binary Files: Yes Disable CamelCase linking: Yes Group Mode: Visible Groups Visible: Show Grade Category: Uncategorized Click the “Save and return to course” button. On the course page click on the Wiki link. This is where you need to stop for a moment and get yourself oriented. Most likely you are on the “Groups wiki for civil” page in the “American War Battles Wiki (since this was the first group you created). If so, you are ready to begin created your Civil War page Wiki. If you would prefer to start with another war, simply click the drop-down on the top-right of the page labeled “Other Wikis:” and choose the wiki group you want to start with. On the lower portion of the page you should see a bold header: Edit this page ‘American War Battles’. ( I chose to start with the civil group so I will begin editing for the Civil War). Type the following: [The Battle of Shiloh] [The Battle of Gettysburg] [The Battle of New Orleans] Click the “Save” button On the top-right of the page choose the world1 group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from World War I. On the top-right of the page choose the world2 group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from World War II. On the top-right of the page choose the vietnam group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from the Vietnam War. Now the Wiki is ready for students to work in! Student Access to Wiki Go to course page. Click on the “American War Battles” Wiki. Select your group from the top-right drop-down menu. Click the ? to the right of the battle you want to begin working on. Get to work! Note: Students will only be able to edit within their group. Because the Group Mode was set to “Visible Groups” by the teacher, students will be able to view every groups work but will only be able to edit their own.",

But to her surprise *POOF* - once the groups were changed the content was gone Obviously it looks like the links were lost when the groups were removed and this makes sense ... to me because I can understand the technical aspects.  But to a teacher I can see how this can be frustrating and a major bug in their eyes.  Unfortunately, not even recreating the group structure will suffice because the actual ID's in the database won't link up. 1. I wonder if this is bug worthy in terms of at least putting some controls on removing/changing groups that are linked to current content? 2. I am trying to reconstruct the wiki history by taking it right out of the database.  I'm not even sure if this is possible without code. I was able to generate a report of all the content revisions with names and dates but it seems too difficult to determine easily what has changed within each revision.  I wonder if anyone has tried this and if so is willing to share their expertise?  I am pretty well versed when it comes to the database but not with php coding",

(i.e. can not support attachments).  It also does not seem to include the one feature that I know our users (students and faculty) really want - the ability to subscribe to a page - which dfwiki had.  Where can I go to read up on differences between wiki2 and ou wiki?  And is there a current roadmap for enhancements of wiki2?  I am still a bit confused about where Moodle is heading with regards to wikis (which I think are fundamental tools if you are trying to teach in a social constructive environment.) Many of our faculty go to external appliations (like pbworks) for their wikis now - we would prefer if they kept their learning activities inside our LMS as much as possible so our users have a more consistent experience.",

          "Text": "I'm a new user of Moodle, and started straight with Moodle 2.0 (well, the newest version, I guess that's rather 2.x, to be fair :P). At the moment, I'm trying to make a wiki, using the NWiki format. I like the fact that when one or more sections are made, a table of contents show up automatically. However, the links to the different sections (they link towards anchors of the form #toc-1, #toc-2 etc.) do not work. When looking at the source code of a wiki page, I see no corresponding anchors at the actual headings. A related problem is that I cannot make anchors manually. I would like to make simple footnotes: I put a link somewhere in the text, which should lead the reader to the bottom of the page, where a corresponding footnote is situated. The link points toward the anchor #blah, and the footnote is situated inside a HTML li tag with id=\"blah\". However, when I click the link in the text, nothing happens, although the anchor is appended to the URL seen in my browser (this happens both in Firefox , IE and Opera). Have anyone else got code that has working anchors? Or can you see what I do wrong just from what I've described? If you need more information about my Moodle installation, the wiki page, or my code - please ask",

My question: Does it only not work on the demopage or in general?\nIf it doesn´t work, how can I create a link which looks like this: \"New Page\"? If I copy the URL , it looks quite shitty. I know that this question must look a little bit stupid to a lot of u guys, but I am a complete IT-Newb.\n\nI have one more question:\n\nIf I try to download the log in excel, the info that appears in the demoversion is not very informative. Is that a bug or intended?\n\nThanks a lot for the Help!\n\nDaniel",

And it is true that creating and editing information in a wiki is much easier than doing it on a set of linked webpages (and using the 1.9 fab html editor ;) ). The problem here is about reusing the wiki. They are not able to import it and they are not able to backup/restore because they do not have permission to create new user records. Did anyone experience the same problem? Do you have any solution, workarounds...? Thank you in advance. Cheers, susana",

A. yes, but only with a valid excuse. 3)Q. Do parents and legal guardians retain their educational rights if the 18-year-old student still lives in their house? Who ultimately makes the final decisons? A. No, Even though the student may still live with the parents or legal guardians and is claimed as a dependent, parents or legal guardians only have access to records, but can no longer make any decisons for the students. 4)Q. If an 18-year-old student needs to be transported to the hospital for further medical treatment and is denying treatment, can that student make the final determination or should his/her parent be contacted?

          "Text": "المديرية :عمان الخامسة    تقديم : وضاح جليل الحدادين هناء أحمد سمحة اشراف : رنده عمايره جرش هي مدينة أردنية ، وعاصمة محافظة جرش وأكبر مدنها. يقطنها قرابة 41,500 نسمة من اصل 153 ألف نسمة يقطنون المحافظة. [ 1] تبعد عن العاصمة عمّان حوالي 48 كم إلى الشمال. تقع جرش في الجزء الشمالي من المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية . وترتفع عن سطح البحر قرابة 600 م. يمكن الوصول لها من عمّان عبر المدخل الجنوبي أو الشرقي، ومن عجلون من الغرب، ومن اربد من الشمال، ومن سوف من الشمال الغربي. وتقع جرش في واد أخضر تجري فيه المياه. وكانت آثارها وما تزال محجة الزائرين ومحط أنظار الرحالين والسياح والعلماء وطلاب المعرفة من جميع أنحاء العالم. مرت على المدينة عصور عديدة، منذ عصر اليونان فالرومان ثم عصر الفتوحات الإسلامية ومن ثم دخلت دفتر النسيان إلى ان تم اعادة اكتشافها في القرن التاسع عشر، حيث بدأت افواج الشركس باستيطانها ثم العرب وغيرهم من القوميات كالأرمن . تدل جرش على وجود حياة بشرية في تلك المنطقة الأثرية تعود إلى أكثر من 6500 سنة. يعود تاريخ تأسيس المدينة إلى عهد الاسكندر الأكبر في القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد أو ما يعرف بالعصر اليوناني وكانت تسمى آنذاك (جراسا) في تحريف لاسمها السامي أو الكنعاني (جرشو) ومعناه \" مكان كثيف الاشجار\". ولقد عاشت المدينة عصرها الذهبي تحت الحكم الروماني لها، ويعتبر الموقع في يومنا هذا عموما واحدا من أفضل المدن الرومانية المحافظ عليها في العالم. ولقد بقيت المدينة مطمورة في التراب لقرون عديدة قبل أن يتم التنقيب عليها وإعادة إحيائها منذ سبعين سنة خلت، وتكشف جرش عن مثال رائع للتطور المدني عند الرومان في الشرق الأوسط، وهي تتألف من شوارع معبدة ومعمدة، ومعابد عالية على رؤوس التلال ومسارح أنيقة وميادين وقصور، وحمامات، ونوافير وأسوار تفضي إلى أبراج وبوابات. وبالإضافة إلى طابعها الخارجي اليوناني - الروماني ، فإن جرش أيضا تحافظ على مزيج من الطابع الشرقي والغربي في آن. إن هندستها المعمارية وديانتها ولغتها تعكس العملية التي تم فيها اندماج وتعايش ثقافتين قويتين وهما العالم الروماني-اليوناني في منطقة حوض المتوسط والتقاليد القديمة للشرق العربي العهد الروماني خضعت (جراسا) لحكم الروم الذين احتلوا بلاد الشام طيلة 400 سنة وأسسوا اتحاد المدن العشر المعروف باسم مدن الديكابوليس وهو اتحاد اقتصادي وثقافي فيدرالي ضم عشر مدن رومانية اقامها القائد (بومبي) عام 63 قبل الميلاد في شمال الأردن وفلسطين وجنوب سوريا لمواجهة قوة دولة ( الأنباط ) العرب في الجنوب. وبسبب موقعها على ملتقى طرق القوافل تحولت المدينة إلى مركز تجاري وثقافي مزدهر لتصبح أهم مدن الاتحاد حتى أن الامبراطور ( هادريان ) قد زارها بنفسه عام 130 ميلادي أثناء مسيره إلى احتلال ( تدمر ). وقد نمت ثروة (جرش) وازدهرت تجارتها وتوسعت علاقاتها مع الانباط إلا أن خراب ( تدمر ) في الشمال على يد الروم واضطراب الامن وتوسع الامبراطورية الفارسية التي اجتاحت بلاد الشام وتحول طرق التجارة اصابت ازدهار المدينة وتقدمها في مقتل وادخلتها أسوأ مراحل تاريخها. خريطة جرش القديمة عاشت مدينة جرش عصرها الذهبي تحت حكم الروم الذين ادخلوا إليها الديانة المسيحية بحلول عام 350 ميلادي لتنتعش فيها لاحقا حركة تشييد الكنائس والاديرة التي دمر معظمها على يد الجيوش الفارسية الغازية. وفى عام 635 ميلادي وصلت جيوش الفتح الإسلامي إلى جرش بقيادة شرحبيل بن حسنة في عهد الخليفة الثاني ليعود الامن والاستقرار إلى المنطقة كلها ولستعيد المدينة ازدهارها في العصر الأموي. ودمر زلزال عنيف اجزاء كبيرة من هذه المدينة سنة 747 ميلادية كما ادت الزلازل المتلاحقة ومعها الحروب والفتن التي ضربت المنطقة لاحقا إلى دمار اضافي اسهم في خرابها وبقيت انقاضها مطمورة في التراب مئات السنين إلى ان اكتشفها سائح ألماني سنة 1806 ليبدأ التنقيب عنها واعادة الحياة إليها لتنهض (جرش) الحالية على يد جالية من المسلمين الشراكسة الذين هاجروا إلى الأردن من بلاد القفقاس عام 1878 للميلاد اثر الحرب العثمانية الروسية. الشركس استقر معظمهم في عمان منذ عام 1878 م وفيها بنوا أولى البيوت الطينية في المنطقة وأنشؤوا الأحياء الشركسية التي لا تزال حتى الآن ونزلوا قرب خرائب جرش القديمة حيث أعادوا استصلاحها وإعمارها وسكنوها بعد أن كانت خرائب مهجورة، وتوزع الباقون على مدن أخرى كالزرقاء ووادي السير وناعور والرصيفة وصويلح والسخنة والأزرق الجنوبي حيث يوجد الماء، في هجرات شركسية بأوقات مختلفة منذعام 1878 وحتى عام 1910م . ويشار بالذكر إلى انه يوجد للشركس جمعيات تعنى بشؤونهم في جرش وباقي المدن التي يتواجدون بها في الأردن. التاريخ المعاصر وفي القرن العشرين، وتحديدا فترة الخمسينات نمت جرش سكانيا وعمرانيا بمعدلات فاقت مثيلاتها في الفترات السابقة بسبب استقرار بعض اللاجئين الفلسطينيين فيها واستمر توافد سكان المناطق المجاورة إليها وتزايد الأهمية السياحية لها بسبب وجود بعض الاثار الرومانية الهامة ولوقوعها على أهم شرايين المواصلات في الأردن المتمثل بطريق عمّان ـ اربد . وفي هذه الفترة توسع الزحف العمراني في كافة اتجاهات المدينة باستثناء الغرب لوجود المنطقة الأثرية التي يحظر البناء فيها. وازداد التطور العمراني والنمو السكاني لمدينة جرش في فترة الستينيات والسبعينيات مما ساعد على زيادة أهمية المدينة وتعدد الوظائف والخدمات فيها وبالتالي زيادة عدد السكان وانتشار العمران الذي شكل عددا كبيرا من الاحياء المترامية الاطراف في الشرق والشمال والجنوب. التسمية كان العرب الساميون القدماء قد أطلقو عليها اسم (جراشا) أو (جرشو) ومعناه \" مكان كثيف الاشجار\". أما الإغريق فقد أسموها (جراسا) وكان ذلك في الفترة الهلنستية ، وكذلك كانت عند الرومان ، حيث كانت إحدى أهم مدن الديكابولس (المدن العشرة) التي أسسها بومبي 63 قبل الميلاد في شمال الأردن لمواجهة قوة الأنباط في الجنوب. واطلق عليها اسم (بومبي الشرق)، نسبة له. [5] كما ذكرت جراسا في بعض النقوش النبطية . وفي عهد السلوقيين كان يطلق عليها اسم (أنطاكيا الواقعة على نهر الذهب)، كما ازدهرت المدينة في العصر الأموي ، إلا أن العرب أعادوا تسميتها بـ(جرش) في نهاية القرن التاسع عشر. [6] كتب عنها ياقوت الحموي في كتابه معجم البلدان قائلاً: \"جرش، هذا اسم مدينةٍ عظيمةٍ كانت، وهي الآن خرابًا. حَدّثَني مَن شاهدها، وذكر لي أنّها خرابة وبها آبار عاديّة تدلّ على عظمةٍ. فقال: \"في وسطها نهرٌ جارٍ يدير عدّة رُحى عامرةً إلى هذه الغاية. وهي في شرقي جبل السّواد من أرض البلقاء وحوران ، ومن عمل دمشق وهي في جبلٍ يشتمل على ضياع وقُرى. ويُقال للجميع جبل جرش، اسم رجلٍ، وهو \"جرش بن عبد الله\". ويُخالط هذا الجبل جبل عوف. وإليه يُنسب حمى جرش، وهو من فتوح شرحبيل بن حسنة ، في أيّام عمر بن الخطاب \". شهرتها السياحية التيترابيلون الجنوبي تقع جرش ثانية في قائمة أفضل الأماكن المحببة للزيارة في الأردن بعد البتراء ، وتتألف جرش من شوارع معبدة ومعمدة، ومعابد عالية على رؤوس التلال ومسارح أنيقة وميادين وقصور، وحمامات، ونوافير وأسوار تفضي إلى أبراج وبوابات. وبالإضافة إلى طابعها الخارجي اليوناني-الروماني، فإن جرش أيضا تحافظ على مزيج من الطابع الشرقي والغربي في آن واحد. إن هندستها المعمارية وديانتها ولغتها تعكس العملية التي تم فيها اندماج وتعايش ثقافتين قويتين وهما العالم الروماني - اليوناني في منطقة حوض المتوسط والتقاليد القديمة للشرق العربي . وفي أيامنا هذه يستطيع الزائر أن يتجول بين هياكل المدينة ومسارحها وحماماتها وشوارعها المبلطة ذات الأعمدة الشامخة والتي تحيط بها كلها أسوار واسعة النطاق. وقد عثر علماء الآثار في داخل هذه الأسوار على بقايا مستوطنات تعود للعصر البرونزي ، و العصر الحديدي ، ولعهود الإغريق و الرومان و البيزنطيين و الأمويين و العباسيين ، مما يشير إلى إقامة الإنسان فيها منذ أكثر من 2500 سنة. [9] يشار إلى انه تم البحث في إدراج المدينة الأثرية بجرش في لائحة مواقع التراث العالمي في الأردن أبرز معالمها المدرج الروماني الجنوبي في المدينة شارع الأعمدة بالمدينة البوابة الجنوبية (قوس هادريان ) سبيل الحوريات (Nymphaeum) في أيامنا هذه يستطيع الزائر أن يتجول بين هياكل المدينة ومسارحها وساحاتها وحماماتها وشوارعها المبلطة ذات الأعمدة الشامخة والتي تحيط بها كلها أسوار واسعة النطاق. وقد عثر علماء الآثار في داخل هذه الأسوار على بقايا مستوطنات تعود للعصر البرونزي ، و العصر الحديدي ، ولعهود اليونان و الرومان و البيزنطيين و الأمويين و العباسيين ، مما يشير إلى إقامة الإنسان فيها منذ2500 سنة. ولكثرة الاعمدة التي تزين مختلف معالمها تسمى جرش أيضا (مدينة الألف عمود) ومعظمها تلك التي تحف بشارع الاعمدة المبلط من الجانبين وهو الشارع الرئيسي في المدينة الرومانية وطوله نحو كيلومتر ولا يزال 71 من أصل 520 عمودا رخاميا هناك منتصبة في مواقعها محتفظة بقواعدها وتيجانها المزخرفة ببراعة لافتة. المسرح الجنوبي: بني في أواخر القرن الأول الميلادي ويؤم السياح والزوار المسرح الجنوبي وهو مدرج روماني تقليدي بني أواخر القرن الأول الميلادي ويستوعب 5000 متفرج إضافة إلى المسرح الشمالي الذي يسع 1200 مشاهد وكان مخصصا للمبارزات ومصارعة الحيوانات المفترسة. ويستغل المدرجان حاليا لعرض الفعاليات الفنية والثقافية من مسرحيات وحفلات غنائية وامسيات شعرية يتضمنها (مهرجان جرش للثقافة والفنون) السنوي الذي انطلق لأول مرة عام 1981 بمبادرة من الملكة نور الحسين. سبيل الحوريات (Nymphaeum): وهو بناء يضم نوافير للمياة أقيم لحوريات الماء في أواخر القرن الثاني الميلادي. حيث لايزال السبيل المعروف باسم (نمفيوم) الذي شيد عام 191 للميلاد يثير خيالات الزائر والسائح وهو حوض رخامي فخم من طابقين ويضم نوافير للمياه أقيم لحوريات الماء ويزين الرخام الجزء السفلي من واجهاته البديعة بينما تزين أعلاها زخارف هندسية رائعة التكوين. البوابة الجنوبية (قوس هادريان ): بنيت في القرن الثاني الميلادي ودمرت سنة 268م فترة الحروب. شارع الأعمدة: وهو الشارع الرئيسي في مدينة جرش الرومانية وطولة 800م. المدرج الشمالي: من أهم مباني الجزء الشمالي من المدينة وقد إنتهى البناء فية سنة 164 _165. معبد أرتميس: يعتبر معبد الالهة الحارسة للمدينة الذي اقيم في القرن الثاني للميلاد من أفخر معالم جرش التاريخية التي تضم أيضا معابد زيوس وزفس وقاعة البرلمان والمقبرة وحلبة سباق الخيل واقنية الري والحمامات الفاخرة. الهيبودورم (Hippodrome): يسمى أيضا ملعب الخيل أو السيرك، يقع إلى اليسار من قوس هادريان ثم يمتد نحو الشمال، وهو على شكل حرف (U)، ومدرجات من ثلاث جهات مرفوعة على أقبية، وهي تستعمل لسباق الخيل والعربات ذات الحصانين أو الأربعة وأخذت عن اليونان. ويتكون من جدارين. ساحة الندوة (Fourm): ساحة مفتوحة في وسط المدينة، شكلها بيضاوي محاطة بأعمدة يونانية. الكاتدرائية ذات البوابة الحجرية الضخمة الغنية بصور منحوتة تخلب الالباب وهي أجمل البنايات الدينية في (جرش) وكانت في الأصل معبد (ديونيسوس) الرومي الذي اقيم في القرن الميلادي الثاني وقد اعيد بناؤه ككنيسة بيزنطية في القرن الرابع. بركتا جرش: مقر احتفالات الرومان بقدوم الربيع واحد المصادر الرئيسية لتزويد مدينة جرش بالمياه والذي يعرف الآن باسم «عين القيروان» تتدفق مياهه داخل اسوار المدينة الأثرية، وبنى الرومان البركتين لنقل المياه إلى قلب المدينة بنظام يشتمل على أنابيب فخارية وقنوات حجرية ويحيط بالبركتين مدرج من الحجر وكان الرومان يستخدمون البركتين مقرا للاحتفالات بقدوم الربيع. المسجد الحميدي: يعتبر المسجد الحميدي من أشهر المساجد الموجودة في مدينة جرش واخذ هذه التسمية نسبة إلى السلطان عبد الحميد الثاني الذي بناه في عهده 1879م وهو محاط بالاثار الرومانية في جهته الشمالية والغربية ويشرف على المدرج الروماني وشارع الاعمدة وكانت تمر بالقرب من المسجد قناة رومانية تم تحويلها لكي لا تؤثر على أساسات المسجد وتمت توسعتة عام 1984م وله مئذنة دائرية حجرية بارتفاع 15 مترا ويتسع لحوالي 1500 مصل. مسجد سوف العمري: تم بناؤه سنة 85 هـ وتم اكتشافة علم 1979م تبلغ مساحتة(96) مترا مربعا اضيف له جناح امامي وطابق ثان بمساحة 306 مترا مربعا ودار للقرآن الكريم وله مئذنة حجرية دائرية بارتفاع 35 مترا. مقام النبي هود: يقع المقام على قمة جبل مرتفع شرق مدينة جرش الأثرية وفي قرية النبي هود والمعروفة بهذا الاسم نسبة إلى سيدنا هود علية السلام والطريق اليه ضيق ومتعرج ذو ارتفاع حاد. يتكون البناء من غرفة مساحتها 16 مترا مربعا يعلوها قبة وارضيتها مفروشة بالسجاد والحصر ومساحة قطعة الأرض الكلية 160 مترا مربعا تحيط به مقبرة وفي الجهه الشرقية منه كهف قديم مظلم. وسميت بعض المدارس في المنطقة باسم النبي هود كمدرسة النبي هود الأساسية المختلطة.

One thing that i can see is that the correct start page has the linkending \"page=%20%20ISD-Wiki\" (\"page=++ISD-Wiki\" also works) and the incorrectly linked to page has the linkending \"page=ISD-Wiki\". Under orphaned pages the incorrectly linked to page is listed, but when i delete it, it just reappears. The page is described as empty and there is also an error saying the page type is neither BIN nor TEXT... Can somebody give me hints with this, what could be the cause of this problem what could i do to try to fix it? Thank you, Robin",

I am rather new to Moodle, and was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction. 1) Basically, I teach English literature, and I was hoping to set up a wiki in which I could save 4-5 different passages of text from a novel, in order that 4-5 groups within the class could work on each text seperately, annotate their text, save for future reference, and present to the class. At present, all I seem able to do is copy and paste a passage into the editing box on the front page of the wiki. I really want links to other pages with these passages saved in them, so that students can navigate their way around these passages and read the comments left by the other groups within the class. 2) Also, is it possible that students annotate around the text, rather than simply modify the text itself. I was hoping they could insert comments, like in Microsoft word, so the passage itself remains unchanged but the comments around it build up and up. At present, all I seem able to do is change the text in the editing box itself, rather than insert comments. 3) Is it also possible that other students can see these comments, and see who has written them? These wikis seem really great in terms of collaborative learning, but I really need some help understanding the tool. Thoroughly apprciate any help, because I have no idea! Many thanks.",

Worth downloading and a read through. To get to your points: a) you need to make new pages. When you are editing a wiki you need to put new pages/page titles into square brackets. So [page 2] will save and, when viewed again, take the reader to page two where it can be edited. b) AFAIK you can't so a MS Word thing in a Wiki. However, you do get a page history to show what has changed. This can be even more useful in learning terms because you can see how people have responded to what (and you can ask them why!). c) Yes - they see and can edit everything you do. It might be worth making a copy of your basic wiki before you make it live - some students seem to delight in removing page links etc. Hope this helps.

I do not know which of these was the primary offender, and I do not remember a specific \"wiki auto-linking\" option when I originally made my changes. When I originally made this change, I did so because I could not selectively override the inclusion of the auto-links. For example, I might have had a non-visible wiki page that I called \"test\", and every time the word \"test\" showed up on any other page it created a link to this page. The feature saved me little time over manually creating the links, and too often sent students on the way to irrelevant pages. Once I disabled auto-linking, it was like I had a new server. My server had performed well under very heavy simultaneous user loads before for exams and file downloading, and it was always a mystery to me why it totally buckled with this wiki-based course.",

In my case, the server that could set up 60 simultaneous exams in a minute was taking 1.5 minutes to load a simple html page (2 paragraphs, no images, maybe a link or two). As nearly as I can recall, we ran into severe problems when we had around 400 pages spread over 20 wikis and 12 groups . Once I shut down the auto-linking, the same simple html page loaded in a fraction of a second, and the number of wiki pages had no impact on any aspect of site performance. At the end of the term the course had close to 6000 wiki pages with no performance degradation. Was it the algorithm for the auto-link searches that quit working well with so many pages, or a clash between auto-linking and groups, or...? I have no idea. I'm happy you don't have to deactivate a capability that may be one of your Moodle favorites, but I'm sorry I could not be more help. Cheers, Eric",

Similar to seeing all their blogs at once, it would be great if that were available for wiki work. Third, the plans you have are great---very helpful. We have a Wiki Wednesday project where students can add research to several ongoing wiki projects.

But this would mean to just encourage the addition of new lines, and sometimes critical reading and careful modification of others lines can be a just as valuable contribution. Any ideas (or examples) of how to deal with it ? Thanks ! L.",

In the first instance I would welcome a summary. Time logged in. Views (How many and average count between edits) / New pages / Page edits (self vs peers). Views: 23 - 8 hrs 23 mins. New pages created: 3 Page Edits: 6, Peer edits 4 Finally how to address the quality. This I am afraid is the educators duty but I would like to be able to grade on the two key contributions of self / peer edits. For two years 2004-6 we ran a 16-19year full time sports course through a wiki. Students readily made updates and keep their own individual pages. We also had wiki gardeners who casual made improvements to layout / spelling and some prolific authors. Once involved the students took a lot of pride in their wiki. We also had a few students who learnt alot from just reading and 'listening' to the heartbeat of the wiki. Time spent logged in is therefore, IMHO , important. I hope this helps.",

If we can assume all the students will wok on a javascript enabled browser (so, no accessibility problems) we could track the time logged in. And even in that case it would mean nothing. since most browsers use tabs (I often use the clickweel for click when browsing wikis, so all pages I visited are on one tab or other... then I have to clean the mess). Resuming : tracking time logged in on a web based wiki involves to many sources of noise that... better not to keep it. We can trace the number of views and edits and use timeframes to have more accurate averages. You introduce an interesting issue wich is the need to grade more than one aspect of the wiki activity. This has to be enabled somehow. Anyway the main idea is: Things happen in the wiki: stuends edit, view, restore pages, tag, comment and even rate pages in peer review... Then the teacher needs accurate reports to grade each competence and work done. Please keep the comments coming, its being really inetersting and useful. L.",

I seem to have a hard time getting teachers to even try out moodle. Well, a lot of them seem to be more familiar w/the wikis. So, my idea has been to open a wiki- and add teachers as students so they can add resources and maybe THEN I can 'graduate' them to the main wiki- or have them do their own. Another thing I've noticed, is that a lot of them are so apprehensive about starting their own. Is there some way to make the wiki to adding resources on the MoodleCourse page easier? I don't work for a school- everything I do is to teach me and others'- and I'm trying to 'help' get their feet wet. I guess the bottom line is that I know that these 'students' are more comfy w/wiki & how/what can I/we do to have them work together and 'graduate' to the wiki. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that has this type of problem. It's hard to 'spark' when some are so intimidated by the word 'moodle'. I've told one of my fave PLN's members that moodle is so easy- and mine's not pretty, but for what I want- it's functional & I know I have a lot more to do, but I know if I could just get'em past that 'word', some of them would take off and ......

          "Text": "At our school our  Moodle is called My Subjects. We've had it going since late 2004. Now most subjects use it to deliver their course material at least. Some subjects eg Drama use a Forum activity as part of their asessment. A good idea is to find others (in your school or environment) who want to try things and start with them. One of our librarians makes research pathways, and together the librarians have experimented with book quizzes. Our Year 6 teachers use the database to gather information for a Mathematics assignment, and another to allow students to present themselves as a fictional historical character. Also we are using the Datbase to get in assignments that we want other students to comment on, eg their games made in Flash, or PowerPoints on Body Sytems that can be used by other students for revision. Slowly slowly we are getting people to be more adventurous. We tried using a Wiki as a Reflective Journal/ diary but setting it up as student/No groups so that only they and the teachers could see it made it hard to view the wikis by class group. So we went back to using the text assignment rather that the plain Journal because the assignment module allows you to e-nag them if it isn't done. And strangely I often use the forum where I might have thought of using a wiki. But would being able to have a course in wiki format mean that the students could appear to have their own 'web pages' inside our My Subjects? That would be useful!! Is there some doco?

You need to have some technical knowledge to download and set up a copy of Moodle in your workplace.

In the case of using [internal://image.png] for linking image in Wiki the IIS server sends the reply to browser's image request with status 302 in the header. Since there is no Locaton field in the header IE doesn't display the image as it wants to redirect. Other browsers apparently ignore the status 302 since there is no Location field and the image (which they actually expect from the server) is in the body of the reply. In the same scenario Apache sends the reply with status 200. The setting to change, in order to get things working is enable cgi.nph and set it to 1: from php.ini ; if cgi.nph is enabled it will force cgi to always sent Status: 200 with ; every request. cgi.nph = 1 Additional information: nph stands for non parsing headers. In our particular situation it would allow CGI to print Status: 200 header, which is normally skipped as it is not needed in most situations. Source link. With cgi.nph = 0, no status header is output unless you invoke header(), and then only if your status code isn't 200. With cgi.nph = 1, a status header is always output, defaulting to 200 if header() is not invoked. Source link. Should I create a bug report for this or there is nothing to change in Moodle code?",

OK, New wiki is in. Now there's a lot of work to do. Due to quality and process matters, the new wiki comes in with significant parts disabled or pending to be completed. So now comes the real challenge. We have a new wiki we can improve and maintain, so we can make it a great learning tool. So, the current todolist: - NWiki migration. New wiki does not migrate from nwiki at this moment. I'm commited to make this migration happen before summer. My best option is to publish a pre-update migration script that will convert NWiki tables into old wiki tables, so the standard New Wiki can migrate it without changing its code.",

          "Text": "Hi Alister I think the problem may be that you hid the original wiki. Instead of doing that move it to an unseen (not a hidden) topic. To do this, say your course normally has 12 topics and the OUWiki and the Resource Link you created are all in Topic 12. In the course settings change the number of topics to 13. Move your OU wiki to Topic 13, but don't hide it nor Topic 13. (Leave the resource link in Topic 12) Now go back to course settings and change the number of topics back to 12. Topic 13 still exists and is still available (not hidden), as are all the items it holds - including the OUWiki. But you can access them only if you know the link to those resources. With most resources you can just use its link but OUWiki doesn't give an option to open in a new page, so this is why you need the resource link you created (and left in Topic 12) which does have the option to open in a new page. Make sure the resource link is defined to open in a new page. Clicking on the resource link in Topic 12 will open the OUWiki (contained in the unseen Topic 13) in a new window. You can use this trick with any resource, allowing you more freedom to layout the format of your Moodle pages to look more like a normal web page (rather than one line per resource). You can also link across to other courses (if the users are also enrolled in them, or if those courses have guest access) and also to resources held in the front page course which is public. This is very useful. What I haven't been able to figure out is how to bring up a wiki (or any resource) without the Moodle header so it can be made to sit in an iframe in another Moodle resource such as a web page or label. This would allow you to embed the wiki beside a video, for example, or beside a quiz. Regards, Mike Smith, Brisbane, Australia",

          "Text": "Hi Alister, It's an interesting idea. You could create you wiki course that has guest access or you could simply enroll everyone into the student role, or other roles depending on whether you want them to have edit/delete/add privileges. If you want the course to be available but not be visible in the Courses Area that seems to be a bit trickier. Other moodlers may have better ideas, but I can only suggest that you set the site-wide property \"courses visible in hidden categories\" and then make a hidden category for all your resource-only courses. However this may upset other things in your moodle, for example other teachers relying on this property to hide their courses. You also need administrator privileges to do this. A better solution might be to let anyone see the course and enter it, but use the same trick to put everything inside into unseen (not hidden) topics. That way you can put an explanatory introduction into topic zero and direct people back to where they should go. Another possibility is instead of allowing guest access to the wiki, play with the authenticated user role and over-ride permissions. Guest access allows anyone even without an account, whilst authenticated user limits access to people having accounts on your system (i.e. your students). To make use of this, you give guest access to the course (but put the wiki into an unseen topic). Then in the wiki settings go to Override Permissions and set the View Wiki property to Prevent for the Guest roles, and then for the Authenticated User role set the properties as you wish (e.g. view but not edit, or comment only etc). Override Permissions are an incredibly powerful way to fine-tune what people can and cannot do, as you will see. However it can quickly get complicated as it all works in a heirarchy in moodle. You need to carefully test with dummy accounts in those roles to see if it all works as you intend. Also, I often forget what overrides have been set for resources so I advise you to be careful and document what you do so you can remember it months later. By the way, do you actually want people to edit your wiki and be able to add pages, or just add their comments? Just adding comments is probably best unless you're using the wiki as a collaborative learning tool - a learning project in itself. Finally, if you're doing an English grammar wiki then a giant in the field is Ruth Vilmi. See her blog here: http://www.writeit.fi/ruth/writeit-resources-grammar/ Regards, Mike",

ANother concern is that if versions are released that just plain don't work that really doesn't bode well for making it a core element to a course, and when coupled with a highly problematic and unreliable history and multiple previous problems it's a bit of a killer. So given decision time is upon us next week it appears that for this programme - a PhD in Technology Enhanced Learning and e-Research it's the final nail in the moodle wiki coffin for us Is it *really* going to go into moodle 2.0 when it's like this?",

In Moodle 2.0 nwiki is being completelly refactorized.

Even though I personally prefer FF I see that it is not a good idea to force anyone into using a certain browser for using a basic feature. It seems that the current version of NWIki is NWiki2.0_Moodle1.9_rev2009012201.zip but I was unable to find a list of changes. So my question goes: What are the changes in between the two versions, and - is the IE/FF Issue resolved? How can I upgrade from the older version to the new one, is there any risk of losing data? I might have overlooked some information or should have RTFM, so any pointer to detailed information would be very much appreciated. kind regards Robert",

About the students problem, In this case, they are editing wiki pages and they can't save because the button do not respond. So, you check the wiki permissions on the course. You check as \"Inherit\" or \"allow\"?. I've done the same action with the last release and I can edit as student, logged with user and password. To give some clues, could you put your moodle on debug mode \"developer\"? In this case, you try to edit as student and give me the message with these error. Because, we can see this behaviour.

But I have found that on the web you need both browsers if you want to take advantage of all the features found in the variety of available pages. On Windows: IE and Firefox, on OSX: Safari and Firefox. We tell our students and faculty to try to use their favorite browser first, and it it does not work, try the alternative. We install both browsers on all our campus-owned computers. Unfortunately we are not yet at the stage where every web page can be correctly parsed by every modern browser, hopefully someday we will be. How is Firefox any more \"non-standard\" than IE? And what if Moodle is generating w3c non-standard files? The problem is if within a web-based program like Moodle some features work ONLY in one browser, and some ONLY in the other.

As I clearly see that there is no html editor using safari this is not optimal but OK. To me, not being able to save a nWiki page on any browser but FF3 is another story. Especially as there is no hint that saving does not work. Just a save-button that does nothing. A basic feature like saving should work across all browsers. I think if I tell my students that certain basic features work on FF3 only this will have an impact on the credibility of moodle.

Now don't get me wrong, I think trying to make software as open as possible is WONDERFUL.... but am I going to abandon MathML (a W3C standard) simply because IE and Safari can't do it? Unlikely..... If the Enterprise has decided to it imprison its participants technologically, that is the Enterprise's choice, and it is as simple to add an alternative browser to an image as it is to roll the image out in the first place.

I'm not trying to get my students to replicate Wikipedia, usually just to collaborate on creating a single web page. I'm an English teacher, and most of my students are not very computer literate, so we need something simple. Ou wiki does what it says it will do with no glitches. Moreover, students can add online images by simple drag and drop - in Firefox. I haven't needed to call on him for ages, but the developer, Sam Marshal, responds quickly and efficiently if necessary. I regret I didn't vote for Ou wiki being included in Moodle 2 when I had the opportunity - I was new to Moodle then and felt too shy and ignorant. I think a lot of some decisions here get taken by computer savvy people who're not in touch with what non techie teachers want and can handle. Cheers, Glenys",

There are php scripts and now a python library for use at command line, but they are not for newbies and would have to be tweaked hard to work with erfurtwiki in moodle. There are ways to play with httrack or wget, but getting such to work inside moodle could be painful. It might be easy enough to write a script to run the wikis tree inside moodle, saving the pages as HTML in a target directory (there are quite a few site rippers around). For moodle it would have to handle moodle file access but that should not be a major obstacle. So.... double ck modules db and if there is nothing there ck to see if this will be a feature of nwiki (if not suggest it-though I think export to odt makes most sense). In the interim you can a) print to PDF pg by pg , b) copy and paste from htmlarea pg by pg, c) dump XML and try to make sense of it or you can install moodle on your workstation and backup and restore wiki to new moodle in new course",

          "Text": "My reasoning was that other modules also need this mode of operation - \"separate students\". Since 1.9 we have the groupings that were designed to extend the uses of groups and allow exactly this. It is still marked as experimental, but groupings will be enabled in all 2.0 (only groupmemebrsonly will be kept experimental). The workflow would be pretty simple, first go to group admin UI and let Moodle create new grouping with one group for each user in the course. Then create a new wiki and set the grouping there. Everybody will have his/her own wiki. This should be fairly easy for upgrades too. If we decide to implement separate student wikis the problems are: * a lot more access control + more complex db structure * we need new UI for user selection so that teachers may actually access the user wikis * we need to handle cases where users are enrolled/unenrolled in the middle of the course * we can not change the mode of wiki from user to group * other modules need to do the same in order to keep consistency The coding and maintenance costs would be higher, on the other hand we would have a feature that probably no other wiki has and probably very few ppl use in the real life, also the UI would be cluttered with extra controls and the wiki would not be consistent with the rest of our modules. I personally think we should stop abusing modules for something they are not designed for, wiki is by definition a collaboration tool, so we should imo encourage group work in wiki and just describe potential workaround in case somebody really wants to use them in a different way. If somebody needs a personal notepad with wiki syntax support, it could be a My Moodle(dashboard) block. We should also concentrate on grading of work done by students in wikis, this could be best done as new gradebook reports that other modules may share. Another example is the Forum module, it could be hacked to support one-on-one teacher-student communication, but it would be an ugly hack with many problems, so instead I created the new consultation module. News forum type is yet another example of problematic - there are so many differences in news and forum discussions that it will be significantly easier to create News module instead of trying to fix the current new forum subtype. We had a little disagreement with Martin over this issue, unfortunately I do not remember if I managed to persuade hit the last time we discussed this ;-)",

One of the topics was Grading on Wikis. We also debated this topic with skodak when he visited UPC. Now that I the Wiki 2.0 looks stable enough to build \"fancy\" features upon here are my philosophy principles and requirements for the develoment that is starting as soon as Wiki 2.0 hits the moodle head cvs . --- Its not obvious and easy to define how to grade a Wiki activity. What is clear is that there are as many ways to do it as teachers willing to. So everithing I describe needs to be optional and customizable \"a la Moodle\" (As pigui says in every meeting \"use the moodle built in scales and don't invent new things\") --- We have two different sets of \"things\" to evaluate: - Pages. And its evolution. Its what I will call \"page rating\" and \"page progress rating \" - Grades. Wich are related to he work done for one student, and how does THE TEACHER consider that should be evaluated (and bound to the moodle grading engine... and all its complexity) Page ratings and page progress activity. --------------------------------",

          "Text": "Hi Ludo, and thanks for bringing this topic to the list at this (still) development stage. I would suggest two things: (1) that somehow the \" type of contribution \" concept (i.e., \"Adding information\", \"summarizing information\", \"formulating new hypothesis\", \"improving markup\", ...) is added as a multiple select box to the wiki edit interface. (2) And that the size (b, kb, ...) of the new contribution is recorded . This way, basic information about \" quality \" and \" quantity \" of information can be reviewed later on by faculty, provided that the report tool allows that in the future. So that we can keep track of student activity (single students and average per group): not only the number of clicks (page views, page edits, etc.), but the quantity and quality of that information added or deleted by each student/group of students. As you know, , at University of Barcelona we did some research about this field, and we found out that this type of information is EXTREMELY useful for teachers before attending a tutoriship session with students (with individual students or in groups). Of course, some short training & feedback has to given to students in the first weeks so that they know what the \"type of contributions\" are for, and how to select the right ones, etc. (the faculty should be able to edit the records of those \"type of contributions\" to avoid misuse and pollution in the database of actions, which will be used later on by him/her and other faculty to provide feedback, grade students, etc.) --- And on another stage, that information about \"type of contributions\" should be linkable to the \"outcomes\" that we expect the students to acquire with the course activities . The goal for this is two fold: a) we promote that students see/remember the outcomes that we want them to work/acquire through the learning activities (promoting experiential - reflective learning is social-constructivist scenarios - their mates see also how their mates indicate what their are doing, so they learn from this metacognitive process from themselves and their mates) b) we help (allow/ease...) faculty to assess student activity along the course, and not just at the end when they have the final version of the wiki finished/delivered at the assignment deadline. This helps single teachers to review in short what has happenend (in order of magnitude) for a given time frame with single students or whole group/s, looking and some summary graphs/tables. And students have the change to report better who where they working with when they submitted something to the wiki (or to the forum, spreadsheet, etc...) Once this is implemented in Moodle, if others see it interesting for their use cases with wikis inside educational scenarios (opinions?), I would expect any automatic grading at the gradebook, but just a new column at the gradebook, and yes, some automatic feeding of a new table with students in raws, and type of contributions in columns, with the size of the change as value in the cells, for a given time frame selected by the theacher. With that, we can let every teacher convert the activity of students into a grade for the gradebook. Does it make sense for you? Ok, enough for my suggestion of improvements (from the perspective of a faculty not using Moodle yet with my students when I need to use wikis for real). I wish someday I can use also Moodle for that (without having to clikc in so many places to have a broad idea of what has been happening with the activity of my students). For those interested, more details and examples of graphs/tables of summary data of \"quality and quantity\" of contributions by students (and groups) using some other free software tools, can be read at: * \" New Method Using Wikis and Forums to Evaluate Individual Contributions in Cooperative Work while Promoting Experiential Learning : Results from Preliminary Experience \" X. de Pedro.

As Kate suggests, there is a method that is, well, a bit obscured for creating student wikis that allows for multiple pages, but it also might help you to see the difference.",

You do indeed set up an initial folder, with one or more of the pages that you would like the wiki to be pre-populated with in that folder. The files must be text format but they should have no file extension. You then upload them to wherever you need, create the wiki activity, select the specific file you want to start with. All pages created with the links in square brackets work because they point to files with identical names (e.g. [foo] will successfully create and link to a file called foo, but not one called foo.txt. So obvious once I thought about it but at least it is here for anyone else searching on this problem. Cheers Ed",

Read information and get it here Not many new features but it does include bugfixes, including the one Glenys posted about in this forum! If you had problems trying to install an older version, please give this one a go. For those wondering what's happening in future, there are no major changes on the horizon. We are planning to add a couple more administrative features - including the ability to revert to a previous version without having to copy/paste it - in the autumn. Also just a note - I am posting this to the wiki forum because it seemed most appropriate, but I don't actually read the wiki forum (obviously, we have our own wiki, so most of it is not relevant). I'll try to remember to keep an eye on this post for the next few days. However, if you need to report a bug, please contact me directly by email/Moodle private message. --sam",

          "Text": "A group of people at our college use a wiki to collect names and addresses of people who have signed up for part-time courses. I originally created an empty table structure that they could use and each course (a page on the wiki) uses this table structure which they fill in as somebody enrols. From time to time my original template for the table is not big enough so they use the wiki toolbar tool to add new rows. OK so far - I'm guessing there are a whole load of people who already think I am mad. Tables in wikis? Is he asking for trouble? Well as it happens it has been working fine up to a day or two ago. Suddenly one of the people with editing rights discovered that she could no longer add rows. The toolbar icons still exist (in the expanded view) but when she clicked on the icon to add a new row absolutely nothing happened. I couldn't understand that but put it down to something odd with her PC. Today the others in the group are reporting the same problem and now it also affects me. One bright person suggested that everything was OK until the updates and she was referring to automated Windows updates. I thiink she is right because those updates have just been applied to my PC as well. The questions are 'What update could have caused this?' and 'Is there anything I can do about it?' A long shot I know but I hope somebody can help Dave",

          "Text": "Hi All, I have created a very simple module that allows you to add MediaWiki links as activities to courses. You simply set the url of your MediaWiki installation in the module settings, then add a wiki to your course. The name you choose is then added to the url you provided and the page is displayed in an iframe. For example, using the url ' http://wiki.example.com/index.php/' and the name 'Main Page', the following url is displayed in an iframe: http://wiki.example.com/index.php/Main Page MediaWiki (+browser?) is clever enough to tidy up the url, e.g. add '_' instead of spaces. Also, if the page does not previously exist then MediaWiki is clever enough to show you the edit links etc. This module's main intention is to provide a neat way to link to existing MediaWiki pages, with most administration still taking place within MediaWiki. Please let me know if you find it useful (we do!), or have any other feedback. As far as authentication is concerned, we are using transparent NTLM authentication so the user will not need to enter login details. I have not tested with the Moodle login plugin, but i would imagine it would work just as well, with the obvious drawback of the user having to enter their credentials yet another time.",

If I navigate the directory on the webserver, the files ARE there. If I try to re- upload the images inside the wiki, the wiki tells me the file already exists... Any ideas?",

We found in ewiki that the html editor could sometimes produce html code that gets convoluted and can causes problems in the view mode of the wiki. We found this also to be true in dfwiki when using the html editor .... perhaps this is an intrinsic problem in all wiki software (and that is why the standard editors in lots of wiki software are fairly simple ...)

Not certain about later versions of firefox (sorry) 8) If you run Windows XP there is a useful 'powertoy' you can download which makes it easy to shrink .jpg files.

This is too bad, as wiki is one of the most useful recent additions to Moodle.",

Also, I tried using the attachment tab in the wiki instead, but when I click the upload button, the message back is \" We are sorry, but something went wrong during the file upload.\" Yet the attachment function works in the forum. So I'm wondering if there is a permissions problem. I'm running Moodle on a windows 2003 server with IIS . The students can upload their profile pictures, and attachments in the forum activity, but in the wiki activity, neither the upload image process as described in the above tutorial, nor the attachment tab function work. Even as the teacher, the two functions fail. Thanks for any light on this!",

Are you sure you have pop-ups enabled? If you are using Firefox, the page with the shortcut code can open in a new tab, depending on your settings. Also, make sure the filesize was not too big - keep it under 60kb, I believe. However, when I tried to upload an attachment, the wiki refused, and I got uplrejsect and 'no files uploaded yet'. I tried this as a student and as the site administrator, and in IE as well as FIrefox. No joy in either. Also tried it with a variety of (small) filetypes. No joy with any. Initially, Firefox was giving me 5 javascript errors (??) related to mod/wiki/view.php on line 2. I have been trying to replicate the upload and re-generate the warnings so I can investigate further, but Firefox still will not upload, and has stopped displaying the errors. Like you, I have no problem uploading files elsewhere on the site (outside wiki) Edit : Did a search for 'uplrejsect' on the moodle.org homepage, and it appears this is a bug that has been reopened. Maybe go vote on it. Matt",

          "Text": "Hello, I am with the Liverpool Hope University . One of the course leaders uses Wiki's to run her course and she contacted me saying it was extremely important that the students be able to upload images into the wikis.We are currently usking OUWikis and the above mentioned problem seems to be plauging us all. The problem with us was that the students were about to turn their assignments in, and it was at the very last moment that the course leader realized that they couldnt upload images. She contacted us immediately but we had no more than a day to fix this. So we came up with this solution: We customized the code so that the student were allowed to upload images from their computer to a local folder within the htdocs folder and then automatically insert the image link in the textbox for the image url, then the student can proceed with the normal process of aligning the image etc, and go about his normal work. Screentshot : http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/7265/image1ut5.jpg Screenshot2: http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4624/image2rn6.jpg Screenshot 1 shows the Upload image popup box for students. When the browse button is click they will be shown a browse dialog to select the files on their computer. Once they select a file the local file path will be populated in the box. They then click on the upload button which uploads the picture on a folder on the webserver. The image name is hashed along with the time ( (md5(time() . $file_uploaded) . $file_ext). This makes sure that any file that is uploaded is given a unique name.  The file upload is done in a different windows (form submit points to -> upload_image.php). Once the image has been uploaded, the new windows inserts the image path into the child window's text box (javascript opener.document.form.f1.f_url.value = http://moodle.university.com/uploaded_images/hashed_value.jpg ). Once that is done, the new window closes itself, the student will barely notice a new window opening, however in IE, it does ask the student confirmation to allow the window to close itself. Once the window closes, the Image URL box is populated with the new image url, as seen in Screenshot2. The student then adjusts the image borders and spacing and clicks on OK button. Thats it. The image is inserted as usual. Its not the most elegant solution but it seems to get the job done for the moment and it doesnt display the entire course folder to the student preventing them from modifying or deleting any of the course files. Because the images are stored within the htdocs folder, they are backed up along with the rest of the moodledata. I am waiting for official permission to post the code online for everyone to see but meanwhile I wouldnt mind helping people in this regard. Feel free to message me. Regards Ciph",

If it's just a simple idea of how it works then you could put a simple guide (or make a simple webpage) for topic 0, the heading, in your course.

I want them weekly to submit their latest translations including the new lines for the next week, but also any revisions they make to their previous efforts. I want to be able to see any changes they make, and to be able to trace any versions back to their original efforts, in case I suspect plagiarism. I considered using the multiple file option of the assignment task, and allow them to resubmit any number of new files (versions), but it seems that a better option might be to use the wiki and have history to show me the versions. A couple of issues occur to me: Will I get notifications when they change things? And will this be too much, if they edit online? Is it possible to compare arbitrary versions of a page, like on mediawiki, or is it just two sequential versions? Can I take a snapshot on the due date, to be sure that assignments are properly characterized as on-time or late? Is this the best way to do all this?",

We use OU Wiki because the NanoGong HTMLArea works with it (Moodle 1.93 - you should test this first in other versions) allowing audio annotations which might be useful for translation feedback. The wiki allows comparisons between any two previous versions (not just sequential versions), and it also allows you to revert to any previous version. The only downside is that it doesn't have a mechanism for assessment/grading, but then perhaps taking a snapshot copy and submitting it in a proper assignment might be better as it would generate a gradebook entry. An alternative to the wiki might be a forum (which is gradable), but this would only be practical for shorter texts. Regards, Mike Smith, Brisbane",

I'm trying to create Wiki's for three Year 8 classes enrolled on a Year 8 ICT course; the three classes are enrolled on the course as three seperate groups. Now, whenever I create a Wiki it only ever assigns it to one group and doesn't give me any options that I can see to change this. This has the effect that only that group can access the Wiki's properly and get all the edited pages; the other two groups can open the Wiki's but they get a blank Wiki displayed instead. They can edit this and it saves the changed for themselves only. The Wiki's are set for \"Groups\" and \"Seperate Groups\". At the top of each one it says \"Groups Wiki for 8AL\" (8AL is the one group that everything gets set to, the others are 8CP and 8GH). Please can anyone offer any advice, as I am stumped!?

          "Text": "Hi, I am trying to find a solution for being able to grade Wiki entries and tie them to Gradebook. From an educational point of view, we are trying to motivate students to create a Wiki (because of the Wiki nature of allowing to build content over time) but also have the capability of grading what each student enters in the Wiki. The grade should be reflected in gradebook and be able to be aggregated as part of the overall grade. Is this possible? I have searched a few hours and have not found any information or plugin about this. I'm currently working with the standard Moodle eWiki installation but am open on upgrading to nWiki if that's the case. Would Moodle 2.0 have this functionality? Is it even worth considering building a plugin? I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction on finding a solution for this. Thanks.",

We (dfwikiteam) have designed and developed ( in this case thinking is the tougth part ) a way to grade wikis and integrate it with the gradebook and the moodle philosopy. We are testing this feature and I don't want to release it until is stable and is well documented for you guys to try it. I hope to be able to release it ina few weeks. Best",

Bug is CONTRIB-1370 and fixed ouwiki version is 2009062200. By the way - thanks to Helen for passing this on to me! I'm afraid I am not subscribed to this forum because most of the discussion is not related to OU wiki, so it would really help if you could report ouwiki problems using the tracker. If you select 'contributed code' to start with, and then 'Module: OU wiki' in the component field, it will go straight to me. (Of course I welcome forum discussions as well, you can link these in the bug if you want me to read them!) (If there's something that isn't a bug but just a discussion about ouwiki that you'd like me involved in, um, let me know!) --sam",

Recently we \"discovered\" ( MDL-19460 ) it was causing some annoyances to pages named \"Wiki: whatever\" and others, causing the module to automatically redirect to other URLs (interwiki ones). As long as the feature is an undocumented one (and unsupported) we have decided to disable it by default. So starting next weekly build (June 17th 2009) those interwiki links won't be working anymore under Moodle 1.x. In any case, as last resort... if somebody was using such feature it's possible to enable it again by defining: $CFG->wiki_allow_interwiki = true;",

I have both the dfWiki and the built-in Moodle Wiki modules (& am playing with the new \"Wiki\" wiki in beta from the dfWiki folks) available for use as course resources on my sites; either or both can be added as a course resource by instructors.  I'd suggest installing them both, playing with them a bit, & seeing which suites your purpose(s) better.  The Wiki module included with the standard MOODLE package is very simple (=sometimes the best choice, depending on what is needed).  dfWiki offers many more features, & the dfWiki course format - which structures a course around a Wiki - is a very nice feature, if this is what you need. will taylor moodle-master at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine Portland, Oregon/US",

If your'e looking to muckle together a mess of platforms, this can get more than a little messy.  re links and forums, I run several sites & have been totally happy with the built-in functions in MOODLE.  These may work in ways that differ from the platforms you may be used to using, but you may find that after getting used to them, they really do accomplish what you need. Another solution that might work if you REALLY feel the need to step outside of Moodle for some functions, is to use the MOODLE integration with PostNuke (or Mambo/Joomla).  This would allow you to pull in the functionalities of the PostNuke platform, with a single login to the integration.",

It currently requires that both installations reside on a single server , but it supports transparent integration of the two sites. The mediawiki side is based on Martin D.'s AuthMoodle.php extension, but goes a little further to provide auto-login. This integration is based on Mediawiki 1.9 and Moodle 1.7, but it shouldn't be too hard to backport it to other versions. Here it is attached, with some documentation inside the archive. Do let me know where else I should put it on Moodle.org as I still don't know my way around the site very well. Cheers, -- Luke Hudson",

Just for starters the HTML editor option that most students prefer when given the option (dfwiki allows to choose format every time you create a page). and Mediawiki does not have an impoprt format ( lats time I checked one year ago) it works out of sql dumps of the mysql database...

Talking to some other people, I'm thinking that it's probably best to keep Moodle and Mediawiki separate, although I'm not upper management will agree. I think the two main reasons they wanted to integrate Mediawiki into Moodle is that we've had so much success with Moodle that they want that success to continue with Mediawiki, and they also wanted to be able to do SSO so that users could log into Moodle and then go right to Mediawiki without having to sign on again... something that I just could not get working with your solution or any others that I tried. Oh well, maybe we'll be able to do something with our AD Federated Services. Thanks again for your assistance.",

The blog we have set up now doesn't allow others to comment.  Are we better setting up a Wiki or even a Forum?

Students would have to take turns to download the spreadsheet, add their dadta, and re-upload. At least the wiki organises things with date and time stamps so that the latest version could be downloaded and editted. Another alternative would be to have a table in your wiki with the format you have in the spreadsheet and have all the students enter the data. When all the data has been enetered you upload the spreadsheet with the formulas and they copy and paste the data from the wiki into it. Cheers, Sally Mack",

You also need to install OU search along with it to make it effective. It supplements and doesn't replace eWiki or nWiki (see below). When you install nWiki you replace eWiki and get either a fantastic full-featured wiki with all the features you'd expect from a wiki, great navigation and integrated discussions and some neat extras like PDF export OR You'll get a mass of problems, admin headaches and a wiki that students can't save changes to if they use IE . And if that happens you won't know which till you've done it, won't be able to go back to eWiki nor will you be able to fix it easily if it is wrong. (You may be able to guess my experience ...) nWiki is set to be the 'standard' wiki as from moodle 2 - however at the moment the problems, options and legacy systems of wiki provision in Moodle is, in my opinion, it's single greatest weakness for teaching/learning/collaboration - we've run out of time to get nWiki wokring in IE so we're using OU wiki but hoping nWiki will work sometime soon.

At least I can save images from Safari and Firefox which was not possible for me on eWiki. BUT, testing that, I also cannot save from IE, whether logged in as student or as teacher. So if looks like I am pretty much stuck: Not being able to save images from Firefox or Safari as teacher using eWiki. Which I could do in moodle 1.8. Not being able to save anything from IE as student using nWiki. Looks like i have to abandon the whole wiki idea for now until this all clears up. thanks again Robert",

We are about to go to moodle 1.9.4, are not heavily invested in any wiki's but have people clamoring for them. I have been afraid to recommend anything based upon tracking the wiki wars within moodle for over a year. For someone who has to deliver a wiki soon and does not have sunk costs invested in a wiki yet, I would appreciate a solid resoned recommendation. I have heard PB wiki might be good but would prefer to local host and integrate with moodl. It has to work with explorer and at least one browser on the mac side, preferably camino or firefox, and be reliable. Thanks to anyone who can help me, -matt",

It will also migrate wikis from std Wiki, NWiki (1.9) and OU-Wiki. This being said, we found some time to fix a number of well know bugs of NWiki for 1.9. Important to mention the bugfix in IE (my first proposal is to NOT USE IE, but since some users keep on it...), fix on separate groups, some installation bugs when fancy gruops wikis are migrated and postgresql issues. We even created a new users guide . You may find the new NWiki release in www.dfwikilabs.org and in the old site . I hope this is rthe last version of NWiki and we will start talking soon about Wiki 2.0 Ale!",

Then I cut and pasted into NWiki, but it required way to much cleanup of html code with the default NWiki editor. I changed everything to the HTML editor, tried again, and vola! I only needed to add brackets for internal links and redo the graphics as regular images. 2 hours later, and the job is done! Whew!

This includes some bugfixes and two minor features which were previously absent: 1. the ability to revert to a previous version 2. the ability (restricted by a new capability, students can't do it) to 'delete' a version The reason for #2 is that if a student posts something offensive, you want to get rid of it from the page. You can edit the page, but then it will still appear in history... So now, those with permissions can delete versions. The old version is not really deleted; those with permission can also view it (to check the evidence of the crime!) and undelete if it was deleted by accident. Also you can now download the wiki reports in CSV format if you like. (Woo-hoo!) These features might not sound exciting but you should probably upgrade anyway if you use ouwiki because it includes fixes to some minor security problems (thanks to Petr from moodle.com for doing the analysis to find these). ouwiki download page",

It seems moodle does not actually create the wiki instances until they are accessed. The work around: 1: Create everything as normal 2: Log in as teacher 3: Use the drop down menu to open each wiki (to force moodle to create the instances) This way the instances will be generated and available to all the students. I am also pretty sure that simply waiting for all students to log in and check their own wiki would solve the problem (but I have not verified this)",

I also fixed another bug in the wiki_tags_save_tags() method to handle the case where an argument to the method is null. If you drop in the tags.lib.php file attached above in mod/wiki/tags (replacing the one that's there) this should fix the problem with IE.

I load the videos into files by grade level, have the students create their Wiki, then use the hyperlink controls to link the videos to the student's Wiki. The problem I am encountering concerns the way videos are linked to student wikis. My videos are created on Mac as a \".mov\" file, and Moodle is automatically embedding them in the body of the wiki. This creates some problems loading each wiki and presents problems if I want to place multiple videos on one wiki. It also messes up student formatting of their wiki. I have tried a number of solutions to try to prevent video embedding, but none (at the code level and otherwise) has yet to work. Anybody have any ideas about how I can still used \".mov\" files but prevent automatic embedding? Thanks, Kevin",

You can use QT Player Pro to Export your .mov to mp4, don't recompress, just \"pass through\" the video and audio. iTunes can also convert .mov to m4v (same as mp4), use Advanced>Create iPod or iPhone version. But the data rate will be about 1500 kbps. Change the m4v extension to mp4, Moodle seems to like it better. Then the href link to the mp4 will not embed the movie, it will just provide the link to the movie in same window or a new window. At least that's how it works on our install of Moodle. Of course everything needs to be tested on Mac Safari and Firefor, and Win XP/Vista IE and Firefox , but I think it will work.",

If you are the Moodle Admin and have yourself replicated the issue that is fine, otherwise I suggest you have the user follow my suggestions, to wit: create a new wiki from scratch and take a screenshot at every setting, saving the screen shots as png files, then zip up the files and attach to a post to the forum..... You'll notice that there is an image icon in the editor toolbar in this forumto embed images, but if there are multiple images it is best to avoid the impact to the forum and attach a zip..... There is nothing wrong with setting a wiki to \"student\", but once you do that you create individual wikis, and if you as teacher try to edit the wiki, you are not editing the student wiki, but your own..... But, since you said that IS NOT what the instructor did (you said the instructor edited the summary, not the actual wiki) that is not an issue. The other alternative would be to have your Moodle admin give someone access to your Moodle to look at what the situation is. I'd be happy to do that for you as would, I am sure, others......

On the other side of the coin, the student does not see the material the teacher added to the wiki unless the teacher edits that specific student's wiki. As far as I know there is no way for a teacher to make universal changes to all the wikis, which is one reason it is handy to learn how to set up multipage student wikis.",

The situation is that they had created a single page wiki at the end of September. sometime in the last week, it appeared that all of their changes were gone and it had reverted back to the original entry. After looking around, I found that there were now 2 pages in the wiki and that the \"first page\", the one you go to when you click the Wiki link from the course, was now this newly created page. The same thing happened to all three of the wikis that they had in the course. Can anyone figure out what may have caused that? We did just recenly upgrade from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3, but I think this happened before the upgrade. It's possible the problem could have been caused by that though. I've fixed the \"problem\" for now by copying the content from page 1 to the new first page. It works, but we essentially lose the earlier history. I want to be able to tell the user why this happened and what they should do to avoid this happening in the future.",

          "Text": "Hi Gary.  I've done something similar except I kept each group's work private.  I don't think there's a way to assign pages to specific groups, so that's something to keep in mind and pushes you to many wikis, which you can assign to groups.  Here's my recommendation. Let's say you have 3 groups.  You can create a wiki, call it \"project\".  In the setup page choose \"groups\" type with \"visible groups\" mode.  By doing this, you're automatically making as many wikis as you have groups. When you save your setup, the HTML editor will open up so you can compose the main page.  If you look at the top left of the screen, you'll see that you are actually editing the home page for one specific group.  On the top right, there is a drop-down box labeled \"choose other wikis\" or something like that which allows you to create a main page for each of your groups, one by one.  Cutting and pasting works well if you want the main pages to be the same. Students will see only one link on their main course page - it will just say Project with a wiki icon.  When they click on it, it will open one group's wiki - I would hope the one they can write on, but I'm not sure about that because I've never done visible groups.  They should have a drop-down box that would allow them to navigate among the different wikis. One caution -  you want to make sure that you don't have duplicate page names.  For example, maybe you're thinking about setting up each group with a main page that links to pages called \"overview\" \"outline\" and \"resources\".  You need to individualize the page names to, say, \"overview-1\" for group 1, \"overview-2\" for group 2 and so on.  Otherwise, unexpected things happen when you try to navigate to your own  overview page - you could easily end up on some other group's.  Even with separate groups, duplicate page names were a problem for me, and I can only guess it would be worse with visible groups. Good luck with it.  I think wikis are a great collaboration tool.",

One other point in case this is not clear already:  When you set\nup wikis in groups mode, every group in your class will automatically\nhave the wiki with the same name.  So you need to give it a\ngeneric name.  For example: suppose your project is about flowers\nand you have groups working on petunias, sunflowers, and tulips. \nIf you set up a group wiki named Petunia, EVERY group will have a\npetunia wiki - even the tulip folks.  I would call the wiki\n\"flowers\" and use the specific flowers as group names.  Then, the\nchoose wiki drop-down list will be clear because it gives the wiki name\nand the group name: Petunias: flowers Tulips:flowers Sunflowers:flowers Not very elegant, but it is clear and I think it gives students the navigation tool you seem to want.

However when working with a nwiki or dfwiki created from scratch no problems. Not sure why but it would have saved a lot of time sorting out how the tagging system works if we realised it earlier! Other points it took a while to figure out It was also not clear that tags work across multiple wikis that there is a difference between the tag block (which \"administers\" tags) and the wiki-tags block (which links to them). hope this helps someone else.",

Is this under control of weblib.php now or is this a plugin issue? There is some documentation in xref that there was an ewiki \"fix\" to address some tags, and it is unclear at this point whether the issue is ewiki, moodle or htmlarea. Having said that I experimented with adding the applet tag in weblib.php, which resulted in java throwing the dreaded java.lang.NullPointerException error, and the console indicates that there is an unknown source; i.e. as the applet works fine in a web resource in the same Moodle why is the applet losing its way? On comparison of the code pasted and the code remaining, however, it looks like the underlying problem may be the use made of square and curly braces by javasketch pad..... OY!!! Hoisted by square brackets yet again?!?! The square bracket issue in ewiki was noted with respect to the use of Tex in ewiki (e.g. Tex uses square brackets to set the nth root as in \\sqrt [3]{27}=3, or $$\\sqrt[3]{27}=3$$ ) and Eloy noted that this should be addressed in nWiki..... suggesting that there is still no way to exclude text in ewiki from being interpreted as wiki markup?? Dekiwiki does applets out of the gate and there are extensions to allow this in mediawiki (and arguably there should be a way to allow at least PHMs so to do in moodle docs ) but in as much as the Moodle wiki is not mediawiki and nWiki is not as yet fully operating, it would seem that the mass of Moodle users will be using ewiki for some time..... can someone shed some light on this?",

I thought manually editing the MySQL database might be the easiest way (generating some nice big SQL file which would create everything in one go) but it seems more complex that I'd hoped and could easily mess up the whole thing (in addition to tables mdl_wiki, mdl_wiki_entries, mdl_wiki pages and mdl_course_modules, there's a fairly obscure entry in the modinfo field in mdl_course and probably some others I haven't tracked down). I've also had a look at hacking the php code to create the wikis, but tracing through the code is proving tough (it starts with course/modedit.php?add=wiki&... but my php isn't up to tracing it all through). I'm using Moodle 1.9.2 with ewiki. Any ideas? Thanks,",

Selecting a file in that directory chooses the directory for content and the file for the index (first) page. If you don't select initial content, the wiki will be empty to start. In this case, the first page name can be specified with the 'pagename' field. If this field is blank, the wiki name will be used.

If there is no class definition then text in the paragraphs tagged with the class will simply be dropped when the page is pulled into the wiki. 2) the file must have no extensions (well, your file can have extensions but the extensions must then be referenced in your mark-up) so with MS Windows PCs this can be a royal pain as the OS does not typically show the file extensions in the file name. The manual drudgery amounts to creating a text file, copying the html markup from your wiki mockup, saving the file and then zipping all the files - then upload, unzip, and rename each file, deleting txt - yes there are undoubtedly easier ways to do this..... 3) Watch out for things like spaces in your page names! While the wiki itself may handle spaces in the page names just fine, when you create the text file for that page you have a problem. WHile there may be some more elegant solution, simply putting underscores between words in the files works fine, but this means that you also have to do that inside your text files any time you internally reference another wiki page. And as to html2wiki conversion? This actually worked better than I had expected, but the obvious cautions must be observed: 4) You must have comparable markup. In testing phpwiki there were issues as well as with a number of others.... I will post the question of comparability among wiki markup syntax separately in the hope that the additional question will draw some attention.... 5) Beware of the caveats above, however some conversions will attempt to resolve spaces in the names and other such questions. 6) The results of the conversion is real wiki markup, while the results produced by the process recommended in the prior post (develop wiki mockup and then cut and paste html) produces html interpreted by the wiki module. WIll this work for student as well as group wikis? It appeared to do just that! Bottom line: Yes, this appears to be a way to create extensive wiki \"templates\" that can be rolled out to individual students to provide everything from a senesters reading prompts and journals to laboratory notebooks. Why, you might ask, are details about how to implement this so difficult to find when one might expect that this might be a critical tool in the use of Moodle.... And that indeed is the question....",

We have developed a resource (using a wiki 1.8) for staff as part of our work e-learning program (this is for a Cancer Services department of a public hospital in Australia). The wiki now comprises over 320 pages. Evaluation from staff is indicating they want to use the search bar to access information as it is too cumbersome trying to find information by tracking searching through the wiki. However the 'Search Wiki bar is not specific enough and hence not user friendly. We are in the process of going to 1.9 with Nwiki and so thought this would be a great time to fix this problem. Are there specific design strategies we need to employ to enable the search bar to work? (I am comparing the search userfriendliness of Wikipedia to ours and there is a stark difference).

I beliebe that security issues need to be addressed here before we start building features. - markup and page behaviour - There will be a team working sole on the parsers (ewiki for backward compatibility, HTML(whateever editor) wiki, and Mediawikilike markup, and a new VerySimpleWikiFormat. We will use Unit tests to guide de parser development and be sure the things work as they are suposed to. We need you to send (as reply to this post for instance) wikipages with the page content (wiki format) and how is it suposed to be viewed ( XHTML ).

Students canupload to it. You can limit the upload size so they have to care about file size.Then upload their file to the data base, and right click on the link and choose copy link location then paste the link into the imageURL in the addImage dialogue box. Alternatively put a link on the wiki inside a pair of square brackets, like so:[ ] That only makes a link though. 2. Alternatively, allow attachments, and have the students upload the image file there, and use the procedure above.

          "Text": "We have recently completed a similar upgrade 1.6 -> 1.8 -> 1.9. At each stage, we deleted the native Moodle Wiki code and added an appropriate version of NWiki before running the upgrade script. NWiki seems to be working as well or better than on 1.6 and existing courses containing Nwiki seem to have upgraded OK. That said, we don't (yet) make extensive use of NWiki so have not rigorously tested. However, we did take the precaution of keeping a working copy of our entire 1.6 system. i.e. copied the folders containing moodle and moodledata to a new location and used my sql dump to copy the database which was then reloaded into MySQL . If you are working on the same server (and you are backing up somwhere else, aren't you ? ) you will have to give the copied database a new name and adjust the copied Moodle's config.php to reflect this and any changes in the the details of the /moodle and /moodledata folders. You may also need to run the /moodle/admin/replace.php script to update any hard coded links so that they still work in the new location. In my experience, mysqldump is more reliable than using Moodle's built-in backup and restore capabilities which can have problems with 3rd-party modules. Once you have two working 'clones' of your 1.6 system you can upgrade one of them secure in the knowledge that if it all goes 'horribly wrong' you still have a functioning version to revert to! MoodleDocs has lots of guidance on all this, though I'll be happy to provide further technical details if required. Good luck with the upgrade!",

This happens no matter which editor I use, although the nWiki and dfWiki editors will correctly display double line breaks. I think I just discovered the solution - in the underlying HTML code, line breaks are coded as <br />. If I manually change these to </br> the page displays correctly. However, every time I edit the page the breaks revert back to the incorrect code. I opened a Tracker report for this months ago, but there's been no action on it. If you are experiencing this problem as well, please vote for the issue: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-12197 If you're not experiencing the issue, please let me know.

Also, the comment about br's in that bug report is wrong because the only valid tag in XHTML for doing a line break should be \"<br />\" (without quotes) as the W3C says. Then i say that last NWiki brings some creole marks and you said that's a \"MINIMUM\"; well, NWiki supports MediaWiki syntax since the very beggining because it's the widest wiki engine used, so Creole is not \"the only markup\" AT ALL. After making this clear, i see some solutions to your \"\"problem\"\" in NWiki: · Don't use line breaks (check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_use_line_breaks again) like millions of wiki articles doesn't. · Use \\\\ to force line breaks. · Ask to NWiki devs to if could be possible to add a NWiki option to force single line breaks. · Don't ask them and do it yourself (this is free software, you have the code).

(Although I am very glad there is now a way to force line breaks! Thank you for adding that feature. It makes wikis usable on my campus.) I think the real issue is that there are two different, competing schools of thought here: some people want a full-fledged, powerful wiki tool like MediaWiki, and others simply need an easy-to-use WYSIWYG wiki for use by people who don't want to learn a whole markup language. I would argue that Moodle is a tool geared toward the latter group, and the tools within Moodle should be as straightforward and easy for general users as possible. The reason the \"no line breaks\" convention works for Wikipedia is because its articles are written in essay format, i.e. relatively long paragraphs. Because of this, single line breaks are not needed. Wikipedia's real reason for disallowing line breaks is to prevent users from putting hard breaks at the end of every line. This messes up the formatting and makes the wiki articles more difficult to parse and edit. While this feature is very important for a huge, public wiki like Wikipedia, it is in my opinion less critical for the small, limited-group, pedagogical wikis created within Moodle. I think the flexiblity and ease of use of allowing single line breaks outweighs the potential danger of poor formatting. To make the wiki a really flexible tool, we need to have other formatting options. Not everyone is using wikis to write long paragraphs; some uses do require single line breaks. Adding the ability to display single line-breaks would make wikis much more usable for different purposes. It would also allow students and instructors to immediately create content instead of having to spend their time learning a new markup language or interface. Technology should meet users where they are, no expect users to come to it. There is no reason the Moodle wiki needs to follow MediaWiki conventions if they do not make sense for us.",

Line breaks appear when editing, but all the text goes on one line when saved. It's very annoying that the HTML editor has a different behaviour just in the wiki activity.

In IE 7 I can also change the size of images by using the \"handles\" but I can't in Firefox.That is, I can change the image in the edit box, but when I save the image is the original size? Why can't Firefox do what IE can? In general, I prefer Firefox and try to get my students to use it but in this case IE is much simpler to use. (Yes, I do know how to use the Insert Image icon and define the size of the image there, but it's awfully difficult to explain to non-techie distance students how to do so.) Is there something I should change in my Firefox settings? Cheers,",

It is a system feature, not part of wikis. Unfortunately although some parts of it were available in 1.8 I don't think it worked properly and I'm not sure the user interface was enabled. (We had it here! We did make it work on our system, but it was rough...) GOOD NEWS: The grouping system facility is fixed in 1.9, and as far as I'm aware it all completely works. You may still need to enable the option via a checkbox somewhere in the admin system. BAD NEWS: In 1.9 the old wiki has several bugs to do with groups and groupings. So even though the option is there, you may find it doesn't work properly. (ouwiki does fully supports groupings in 1.9, but as you may be aware it has certain other limitations. nwiki probably works with groupings also, I don't know.) --sam",

The rationale was to have a reasonably functional Wiki for staff development, prior to our upgrade to Moodle 1.9 over the summer. Fixed a few lang strings and help files (en_utf8), tweaked the parser to be more compatible with MediaWiki syntax (though not as complete as the new parser engine in NWiki for Moodle 1.9), and also added a few more buttons to the NWiki editor (== h2 ==, === h3 ===, ==== h4 ====, pre , indent :, bulleted list *, numbered list #, table etc) to try to be more friendly for the novice Wiki user. Will be happy to zip these up and make them available to anyone else still using Moodle 1.6 . Where appropriate, I'll also be happy to port these forward to NWiki for Moodle 1.9. However, I can't get this version (before or after my tweaks!) to work with groups. Group mode: No groups|Wiki in common    - works fine However, if I select Separate groups|Students in group then [Save changes] although I get a 'Change to another group' dropdown menu at the bottom right of the Wiki page, I can't actually select another group (just get 'bounced' back to the top group in the dropdown). Anyone have any insights or a fix for this? I have noticed a few other postings on Wikis and Groups in this forum, though none seem directly relevant. Thanks in advance Geoff",

          "Text": "I'm sorry if this has been covered elsewhere, which it has, but perhaps ambiguously (at least in my model of the world . Given a new Moodle 1.9 installation with no wikis yet created, is the correct way to install NWiki a) to delete the moodle/mod/wiki folder and replace it with the mod/wiki folder from the nWiki zip file or b) to leave the existing moodle/mod/wiki folder in place and to copy the nwiki/mod/wiki folder into moodle/mod/ so that existing files from ewiki are replaced by nwiki files, but ewiki files that are not duplicated remain in situ. I initially used method a) as this seemed the cleanest option but found on editing pages that explorer 7 was throwing javascript errors relating to ewiki. So I assumed I needed some of the ewiki files as there is reference to ewiki as an editor. I therefore deleted the nWiki files, replaced the ewiki files and then copied the nwiki files over the top to create option b). This solved the javascript errors but now results in occasional errors referring to classes which I have seen in other postings as resulting from left over bits of ewiki. If you could confirm the preferred method of installation then I can set my system up in accordance with that so that I have a sound foundation for reporting any subsequent errors. Kind regards",

Our older NWikis have correct created dates, so I'm not sure whether the issue was introduced with this NWiki version or something else in our Moodle 1.6.x. Anyone else with the same issue?

We have however tried to restore backups of the courses that had those NWikis in a 1.8 test installation and we still can't recover all the wikis from the students. What we see is something that looks a little strange. We've been able to recover some of the wikis that the students had written (not all!) but they all appear as if they had been created by the course teacher. These were wikis that were created in the 'group mode' and that appeared correctly assigned to the different groups in the original 1.8.4 installation. Somehow now all the information about the groups that created them has disappeared. This is a disaster since we are in the middle of exam period and the teachers need to evaluate these wikis.",

However there remain issues with editing being locked out if I'm working on it and the possibility/likelihood that if I try to change any settign I could lose the lot... Our hosting company have reached the end of their tether with the amount of support nWiki requires: A number of users are complaining about problems with the latest supposedly \"1.9 compatible\" version of nwiki, and it seems from reading those reports ... that nwiki is still not ready for production use. Especially when you are trying to implement it on systems that already have a wiki (ewiki or nwiki) present - the upgrade processes simply do not seem to have been worked out correctly yet. So, given the effort that [admin name deleted] is putting into this (and that I am having to pay him for) this is becoming economically unviable for us. Either we are going to have to charge you extra for support, or you are going to have to find some other way of experimenting with this, that does not involve us. So it would seem I'm in the unenviable position of: 1 - having a flaky wiki (nWiki) that is unreliable and about as likely as a DC-10 to go down at any moment - and certainly not reliable enough to make a core component of any course. 2 - unable to rollback to a workable, simpler wiki i.e. eWiki as it is a one-way upgrade. 3 - no longer able to call on any support due to the numerous, endmic problems with nWiki from installation to this latest problem - or have to pay more for it. 4 - Unable to find any effective documentation for the wiki with the possibility that any features may cause unexpected catastrophic errors. Suggestions of how to resolve this most apprciated... Am hoping OU wiki and search may be easy and I may be able to add them or look into media wiki integration...",

(b) you can force Word to release its embedded images (including any drawings you created with Word Draw - but group them first) by first saving the Word document as a webpage (don't shudder, I do not use the crappy text) - you will find that the pictures are saved as separate image files as you would expect for any html page.

When you click on the 'view' tab, the wikis created by the students show some of HTML labels. This can be quite disconcerting to many of the students that don't even know what HTML is. Here is one example: I suspect they did a cut and paste from Word but I've tried to use the 'clean Word HTML' to no avail. Is this a bug? The students are frustrated and they are asking for permission to use Word for their assignments to which I'm a bit resistant. Having to get into the HTML source and eliminate the offending tags one by one seems an undesirable alternative for me (even worse than allowing them to work collaboratively on Word documents). Is there anything I can do to solve this problem? Any help will be greatly appreciated.",

And it comes with full WYSIWYG editor, and many-many other improvements. Some of them listed at: http://doc.tikiwiki.org/Tikiwiki+1.10 Moreover, on the friendlyness of the interface, huge improvements have been made, that you can see through: http://themes.tikiwiki.org (select the new themes from the \"theme-o-rama\" section ) It has been used for several years for production university-wide right now at: http://wiki.fub.edu/ And the other sites I know of (or I sue it at), are for individual subjects only, since our universities officially use other LMS. Reports about Tikiwiki usage in education can be found at: http://edu.tikiwiki.org Hope this helps. Xavi P.S. Deki Wiki looks promising to me (and it's free software also), even if I haven't tried for production yet. I would suggest you to go for the free software wiki engines, either on external hosted sites or on your own site.",

I guess the best migration path will be to continue using the glorious old wiki until 2.0 upgrade. Of course there will be a long beta stage, before 2.0 release, and that'll be the time to test and report about such wiki upgrades. Right now we are working hard against Moodle 1.9 to polish all those details that never are detected before release, so we haven't analysed yet how the nwiki refactoring (changes) will be, and what parts of them will be modified. I hope we won't need to modify the DB layer, that will be good news from a complexity (and upgrade) point of view. Obviously, people using nwiki with previous versions of Moodle should be able to upgrade transparently too... but IMHO I'd continue using the old one if upgrade ASAP isn't a must for you. Ciao",

I figured out that I had to change the Student Mode to Students in group for wiki content be visible and left Group Mode set to No Groups .

I tried shortening the name and then it showed up correctly. However, when I experimented to find out the length at which it failed I found I could add letters and numbers until it was way past its original length. Further experimenting suggested length was not the issue but it was to do with the use of upper-case. In particular, if the name began with an upper-case letter it could not move away from upper-case and then back again; if the letter began with lower-case there was no such restriction. So, these are OK... ABcde.jpg ABCDE.jpg abcde.jpg",

However, when new versions of Moodle are released will I have problems upgrading since the new upgrade will have the original Wiki? I’m guessing that I will have do to the following: 1) Install new Moodle to new directory 2) Move over config.php to new directory 3) Move over new modules that I’ve installed on old directory 4) Move over the 4 directories for nWiki Hopefully it will run again. What happens if/when nWiki becomes the new standard and is included - will it expect the old Wiki data and have problems? Any feedback/suggestions? Thanks in advance,",

Just create a folder with only the the contrib modules you installed and your config.php When upgrading moodle cpy th moodle distribution and inmediatelly e-copy the contrib modules of your installation. since nwiki replaces the MOODLE/mod/wiki directory another precaution would be to be sure to remove this directory from de moodle distribution before upgrading. Seems obvious, but is not, be sure to back up ( database and files) eerything before applying the smallest patch. Cheers L.",

I'm using Standard Moodle Wiki in vs 1.8+ 1) When I create my first Wiki page it takes sometimes 1-2 minutes for it to save. When it does save it then gets stuck on a blank page. I did notice that the webaddress has the words \"thank you\" added into it but it times out instead of continuing. It doesn't always do this and it does it regardless of how many users are on. 2) I have a course (German 1) which has two sections . So I have one moodle course with two groups. I would like to create a wiki that both groups can edit and see both groups pages. Since I have seperate groups enforced this doesn't seem possible. Is there a workaround (ie. temporarily changing my course settings to have no groups, then setting up the wiki to have groups visible, and then going back to the course settings and changing it back to forced groups. I'm guessing that won't work...but I thought I'd ask anyway) 3) Is there a way to get rid of the Wiki Discription box that appears on the first wiki page...it takes up unecessary screen realestate 4) Is there a way to change sub page titles and still preserve linking? Is the only way to change the pages to create a new page title and then copy all the content from the bad page title into the new one.",

I remember that when I first started the setup for groups was really confounding me. The friend who was helping me get started gently pointed me in the direction of inspecting the editing icons for the activities on the main page a little bit more closely. \"Oh, my gosh!\" I said to myself. \"Has that little people icon been there the whole time?\" Regarding sharing some of the things I've done and some of the things others have done, I'd like to invite you to check out our wiki collaboration at facultyroom.org. At present, the pages in it give just a rough sketch of what some of us have been doing, but we do have plans for developing a more comprehensive database where you will be able to actually look at fully functioning blank courses. Feel free to look around the rest of the Mentor Forums course as our guest or join us for conversations. We'd love to have your input.",

Should I continue to try and use the standard Wiki activity module (EWiki), which has more and more bugs (e.g. MDL-11816 & MDL-6144 ), or should I 'take the plunge' and download Nwiki ? It seems that every time Moodle gets updated, another wiki function gets damaged. On the other hand, the NWiki module also seems to have a few bugs. I am especially concerned that if I switch to NWiki (which version?), will my present wikis made by students survive the migration? I welcome any advice you have for this teacher in a quandary over how to proceed with Wikis. I am using Moodle 1.8.3., Apache 1.3.33, php 5.2.1, & MySQL 5.0.24a.",

The current version of NWiki for 1.8 ( that I use in my classes in almost the same environment as you) works fine. This summer we focussed specially in the migration of contents and the old wiki data may survive. You may also do the next thing, will take a half an hour or so: * Install a fresh 1.8.x moodle in a workstation (it takes minites using the xamp thing) * back up some ewiki empowered courses from your production server and restore them in the moodle sandboxed on your workstation. * install in the sandboxed moodle the NWiki last release and see what happens. are the pages still there... now try to enable blocks on activities and use the nwiki blocks... if you dare you may also use the wiki format course and really enjoy... Then tell us about it. If something does not work, we will be here to fix it. Ludo",

However, before going ahead I'd like to check with you the order in which I should carry out the installation of and migration to Nwiki. Is this order correct?: Restore (install) courses containing eWiki activites into my experimental moodle system. Via the moodle admin page, delete the eWiki activity module. Remove the wiki directory (i.e. eWiki) from the mod directory on the server. Install the various directories in the ' wiki_1.8_rev2007061102 Folder ' into the correct locations in the experimental moodle directory on the server. Access the admin of the experimental moodle via a web browser: at this stage I assume the system will recognise the existence of a new module (Nwiki) and create the relevant My SQL tables, and carry out the 'migration' process etc. I will then be able to access the wiki activities in the courses and see that migration has been successful. If 1 to 6 is a success I will then do the same with my production site. How does that look? Are there any other steps I should carry out?",

I restored one course into my experimental moodle site that contained one instance of a Wiki activity. I then installed Nwiki following the above steps (without step 2). On re-logging in to my experimental moodle I got the \"wiki module needs upgrading\" message and then a series of 'success' messages but no [continue] button at the bottom of the page: see attached PDF. I then reloaded the page, and got these 'messages' \n```text\n(mysql): SHOW TABLES\n```\n \n```text\n(mysql): SELECT * FROM mdl_modules WHERE name = 'dfwiki' LIMIT 1\n```\n \n```text\ndfwiki installed.

Just to make sure that Nwiki would install correctly into my system, I removed the course that contained the instance of a Wiki activity, so that there were no wikis in my system.

I'm wondering about another approach to the problem. Given that Nwiki does *not* seem to install properly when there's an existing course with ewiki content, what would happen if you did the following instead: Install Nwiki in a clean Moodle Create a course backup with ewiki content (do you need user data, or is it just the Activity definition)? Restore the backup in the Moodle system with Nwiki. Personally, I think that it would be better if Nwiki used entirely different table names so that the migration process did not have to destroy the contents of ewiki tables in order to move to nwiki tables. Does that make sense? It seems to me that this has been the Achilles heel for Nwiki all along -- if migration fails then one cannot upgrade Moodle in situ if the new Moodle version substitutes Nwiki and your current system has content in ewiki.

(It was annoying to have to google to find the language pack to get NWiki help --can that be part of the NWiki release?) Works great! As soon as somebody can report that the new beta installation works, for 1.7, I'll ask our host to upgrade to NWiki for our school, or just wait until summer and upgrade to the latest and greatest everything. But I'm really missing an easy way to put in an \"add to the page box\" so people can just type and submit rather than editing the page. That solved my problem with large classes in the lab all trying to edit at once. It's also a very quick way to brainstorm using a wiki while f2f, or for different people to record minutes for different sections of meetings while f2f. And it reduces collisions as updating a page takes a while, sometimes 10, 15, or 20 minutes while a person has it open. That's too long when students are doing homework at night. An \"add to the page box\" only opens the page on the SQL server for a second, and it doesn't matter that others are contributing as well. Right now I have to use a totally separate Wiki installation on a different server and create new user IDs for much of the work I do with teachers as they have grown to depend on that \"add to the page\" box. Not to push too much, of course, since I know everyone has a favorite feature that they can't live without! Thanks for doing the NWiki!",

It would be available both in discussion tab and main tab. Why? It does two things--it's a VERY quick way to add comments to a page. Since Moodle is intended for education, we also have to look at how people use Moodle. Examples from real life: Students create a page together and put an \"add to the page\" box at the top for the teacher. The teacher, who has numerous ones to look at, can just hit the page, type in the \"add to the page box\" and press submit. The box, depending on options chosen, time stamps with the user name, and can stay at the top of the additions or move down. In-class group work. This is essentially the same as real-time brainstorming. Students quickly add comments and thoughts to pages as they work on them. Real-time brainstorming. In meetings, when we have a projector going and everyone has there laptops, we'll take a 1 minute brainstorming session. That is, everybody types in the \"add to the page box\" and then presses submit at the end of one minute. Since the page is locked only for the very brief update period, all of the comments end up in the page. Selections. This is similar to brainstorming, but when I have a 500 photos to sort and we need to choose the best, it's fastest to have everybody at the computer and we just quickly project each picture. If they like it, they type the photo number (I use a renaming program to give all of the photos a sequential number starting at 100), but all in the \"add to the page\" box on the same page. At the end, I dump the list into a spreadsheet and rank from most votes to least votes. This bring in the \"wisdom of crowds\". Discussions about topics. While the discussion page does exist, you loose the page with content while discussing it. This is good if people when people are only adding two or three lines at a time. In class evaluation: We have 20 students in class writing comments on each others work. Editing with page locking just doesn't work. Multiple points to add: Sometimes, we must have comments in several places. Placing an \"add to the page\" box makes that very simple. While I do know that we can now edit each section, there are numerous reasons why that is not as successful with younger students, such as the nine-year-olds we now have using wikis. We also have to distinguish between development wikis and production wikis as well. Wikipedia is a production wiki. Each page should always be \"complete\", with discussion taking place elsewhere, hence their use of the discussion tab. It's \"prettified\". However, we work in schools. Our wikis are often development wikis. They tend to have intense periods of work, often with multiple people working on them simultaneously. The whole discussion page doesn't have time to develop as work is being done in each page of the wiki when production is due. Now, that doesn't mean I don't think NWiki is a dramatic improvement over ewiki. It is and you all have done a fabulous job.",

I intended to follow these 4 steps, but only got through part of step 4: Restore (install) courses containing eWiki activites into my experimental moodle system. Remove the wiki directory (i.e. eWiki) from the mod directory on the server . Install the various directories in the ' wiki_1.8_rev2007061102 Folder ' into the correct locations in the experimental moodle directory on the server. Access the admin of the experimental moodle via a web browser: at this stage the system recognises the existence of a new module (Nwiki) and creates the relevant MySQL tables, and carries out the 'migration' process etc. On re-logging in to my experimental moodle (step 4) I got the \"wiki module needs upgrading\" message and then a series of 'success' messages but no [continue] button at the bottom of the page: see attached PDF. I then reloaded the page, and got these 'messages' \n```text\n(my\nsql\n): SHOW TABLES\n```\n \n```text\n(mysql): SELECT * FROM mdl_modules WHERE name = 'dfwiki' LIMIT 1\n```\n \n```text\ndfwiki installed. Upgrading dfwiki (start)\n```\n \n```text\n(mysql): SHOW COLUMNS FROM `mdl_modules`\n```\n \n```text\n(mysql): UPDATE mdl_modules SET name = 'dfwiki', version = '2006052502', cron = '2007053101', lastcron = '0', search = '', visible = '0' WHERE id = '23'\n```\n \n```text\ndfwiki installed.

The only way to get back to the top page is to remove the NWiki module from the mod directory. Just to make sure that Nwiki would install correctly into my system, I removed the course that contained the instance of a Wiki activity, so that there were no old wikis in my system. This time, the installation was a success, so it seems that there is a bug in the migration process.",

I am experimenting with a course that has both a wiki for individual students and a wiki for groups. Both contained pages created with the default wiki but after the migration process none of the pages are visible. I noticed two things: first, in the original wiki system the default name for the first page (whether or individual or group) is the name of the wiki activity. However, in Nwiki this seems to have been changed to 'student' for an individual wiki and 'group' for a group wiki. I wonder if this has anything to do with the problem? The second thing I noticed is that in the Nwiki set up page (i.e. the page you see when clicking on the [Update this wiki] button) there is a check box for: \"Students can see the teacher's pages\". If this is checked and then the settings saved, the following error message appears at the end of the page: This SQL relies on obsolete tables! Your code must be fixed by a developer. I hope this information helps.",

          "Title": "Wrong words (eg. \"++\") are matched as CamelCase in spite of \"Disable CamelCase Linking\"",
          "Text": "Hi, Moodlers. I've been in the face of two strange phenomenons under using ewiki on Moodle1.8. Under checking \"Disable CamelCase Linking\" on ewiki (Moodle1.8, 1.7, ...), Camel case words (eg. UsingMoodle, WikiModule...) does not match as Camel case. On the other hand, unexpected words (eg. a++, a]+[, ...) will match as Camel case. For example: for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)    : HTML editor ->  for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i ++ ? )  : View page (ewiki) '++' is linked for new page. I don't expect! Another phenomenons is as following. For example: a[] is an array. a[1]   : HTML editor -> a 1 ? : View page(ewiki) : I want to avoid. a![1]  : HTML editor ->  a[1]  : View page (ewiki) : That's right. a[]   : HTML editor ->  a ? : View page(ewiki) : Oh? a![]   : HTML editor -> a![]   : View page (ewiki) : Oh No! a![ ]  : HTML editor -> a[ ]   : View page(ewiki): huum...O, OK? (How to correct these problems?) The cause of these problems is on following code, in mod/wiki/ewiki/ewiki.php if ($moodle_disable_camel_case) {<br /><font color=\"#006600\">        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"\");<br /></font>    }  else {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"a-z_??$\\337-\\377\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"A-Z0-9\\300-\\336\");<br />    } EWIKI_CHARS_L/U are used for detecting Camel case words. These constants are used on regular-expression as follows, \"wiki_link_regex\" => \"\\007 [!~]?( \\#? \\[\" style=\"border-right:0px;border-top:0px;vertical-align:middle;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;\" alt=\"[^<>\\[\" src=\"http://moodle.org/filter/tex/pix.php/25443382e01c0fa744dccb716a12d8bc.gif\" /> \\n]+\\] | \\^[-\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]{3,} | \\b([\\w]{3,}：)*([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]+){2,}\\#?[\\w\\d]* | ([a-z]{2,9}://|mailto：)[^\\s \\[\\] \\'\\\"\\)\\,<]+ | \\w[-_.+\\w]+@(\\w[-_\\w]+[.])+\\w{2,}   ) \\007x\", and $value = preg_replace_callback(\"/((\\w+：)?([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"] +){2,}[\\w\\d]*)/\", \"ewiki_link_regex_callback\", $value); Most important part is ([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]+){2,} . If we set that the \"Disable CamelCase Linking\" is On, both of EWIKI_CHARS_L and EWIKI_CHARS_U become null (blank?). Therefore, regular expression will become to ([]+[]+){2,} . [*] (eg. [A-Za-z0-9]) is meta symbol that means character class. [*] is not allowed that the inner part of brankets is null. /[]+[]+/ is interpreted as [ ]+[ ] + , then the render of ewiki view page will misinterpret non-Camel case word as Camel case word in spite of Disable CamelCase is On. /[]+[]+/ means that a word matched with the pattern consists of a character ']' or '+' or '['. I propose a modification for this problem. if ($moodle_disable_camel_case) {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"<font color=\"#ff0000\">\\t</font>\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"<font color=\"#ff0000\">\\r</font>\");<br />    }  else {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"a-z_??$\\337-\\377\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"A-Z0-9\\300-\\336\");<br />    } This patch means that CamelCase word consists of 'Carriage return' and 'Tab code', for example : '\\r\\t', '\\r\\t\\r\\r\\t'. This experssion is safe since these strings shall not appear in plain text generally. I'm using ewiki in Japanese. After applying this modification I have no trouble under setting 'Disable CamelCase Linking'  On. If you are also in face of this problem, let's try this patch.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I am a research assistant for a professor and I run my prof's Moodle, which he uses for one of his classes. Both of us think this application is awesome - it's very versatile and based on feedback from his students, many of his students think the same. We do, however, have a recurring problem with the wiki part of the Moodle. Students are required to add content to an overall course wiki, which helps students collaborate and brainstorm with each other and serves as a good central point for study material for the entire course. This is the second semester that we are using the Moodle for a class, and in both semesters once we reach the end of the semester the wiki fails to load. What I mean by fails to load is that the wiki does not load and it seems like the user session \"dies\" - once you click on the wiki link the browser will sit there loading forever. You cannot reload the Moodle in the same browser/same computer, you have to go to a different computer and login (either as that same user or a different one) to load the Moodle up again. I've noticed that after about 20 minutes, you can reload the Moodle page from a 'crashed' session, so I believe it has something to do with user sessions. Furthermore, by the end of the semester, the wiki gets pretty damn big - maybe it has something to do with this size? We were thinking of setting up two wikis for next term: one containing information for the first half of the course, and the other for the second half of the course. We are using Moodle 1.7.1 (I think). I'm not at my web server right now so I cannot give more details right this moment, but if anyone is willing to help I will gladly dig up logs and do anything else. I am running the Moodle off of a Power Mac G5 (that's our web server) running Apache , PHP and MySQL . One more thing. I went digging through the My SQL console and I see that the wiki content is all there (and there's a lot of it!). I know I can dump the contents of the wiki SQL tables out - is there a way I can use this to re-create the wiki? I just want the students to have access to the information they contributed, as the final exam is coming up and it would be good study material for them. Thanks a lot to anyone who can offer insight and help, Fil",

Let me explain: I've been using Moodle for about 6 weeks now with 3 of my classes. In a very small class of 5 students I've used 2 different wiki's successfully having 2 separate groups of 2 and 1 group of 1. Each student adds the definitions of words I listed in a text document. Each student saves their changes without renaming the file. However when I used this method with my larger class of 27 students I ran into problems and had to discontinue using. In this class I set-up 13 separate groups of 2 and 1 group of 1. Each took a text file of terms and had to split the list so that the 1st member of the group looks up the 1st half of the list and the 2nd group member looks up the last half. Students have been advised not to try to make changes at the same time and thus have been coordinating when to make changes. The 1st two groups to use it this week in the larger class could only see their changes when they went to history. Do I have to instruct them to save the page each time they change it using a name framed with brackets something like [student 1 version 1]? Currently, they only hit the save button after making their changes. My smaller group worked successfully without naming their changes.",

Backing up a bit, do you have the wiki set as a group wiki, separate groups or as a group wiki, no groups? A group wiki, separate groups would necessitate using Moodle's group feature; a group wiki, no groups would simply allow everyone in the course to edit the wiki. I'm also wondering whether you might be running into an upload limit issue. I've never tried to upload multiple docs to one page. I usually set up a new page for each of my groups. What about trying the option of copying and pasting changes directly into the wiki?",

Using the Database activity module I have created an 'activity' called 'File Bank'. Students upload their files to that, and then copy the URL for the file that they want to add or link to their Wiki. Students then access their Wiki and use the icons in the HTML editor to either add links to files in the 'File Bank', or embed images that have been saved in the 'File Bank'. This seems to work better than the original method of adding attachments to wiki pages. Hope this idea is of use to other moodlers.",

Now, the problem was in the file moodle_binary_store.php, which can be found within the directory /mod/ewiki/plugins/moodle/ The problem was that the save path and location for the file to be saved was created from the wiki name . I changed this to the following in the function moodle_binary_store_file: function moodle_binary_store_file(&$filename, &$id, &$meta, $ext=\".bin\") { # READ-Only global $_FILES, $CFG, $course, $wiki, $groupid, $userid, $ewiki_title, $cm; if(!$wiki->ewikiacceptbinary) { error(\"This wiki does not accept binaries\"); return 0; } $entry=wiki_get_entry($wiki, $course, $userid, $groupid); if(!$entry->id) { error(\"Cannot get entry.\"); } require_once($CFG-> dirroot .'/lib/uploadlib.php'); $um = new upload_manager('upload',false,false,$course,false,0,true,true); if ( $um->process_file_uploads(\"$course->id/$CFG->moddata/wiki/$wiki->id/$entry->id/\")) { $filename = ''; // this to make sure we don't keep processing in the parent function if(!$id) { $newfilename = $um->get_new_filename(); $id = EWIKI_IDF_INTERNAL.$newfilename; } return true; } error($um->print_upload_log(true)); return false; } I also changed this in the function moodle_binary_get_path: function moodle_binary_get_path($id, $meta, $course, $wiki, $userid, $groupid) { global $CFG,$ewiki_title; $entry=wiki_get_entry($wiki, $course, $userid, $groupid); if(!$entry) { error(\"Cannot get entry.\"); } $dir=make_upload_directory(\"$course->id/$CFG->moddata/wiki/$wiki->id/$entry->id/\"); return \"$dir\"; } So, now it reflects the wiki->id and entry->id instead.

But Why ? ... Because NWiki is not going to be in 1.9 but looks like chances are good for it to be in Moodle 2.0 ... So its a good name. This version does not include any new feature except that the installation procedure has been rebuild completelly... (the great pigui is to take the blame). This means that old issues with installation we all have been sufering should be gone, and postgres and othe databases users can install now nwiki... This version should work with 1.8 and 1.9 beta but please, please, please backup your tables before installing it. More information on the general dev forum thread about this release in the moodle docs nwiki roadmap page and in our site . Ah the code is in the CVS (contrib) and also in a new release in our site , please be careful when trying and backup your database if is a production site!!! May the force be with all of us! Ludo",

          "Text": "Hello, I am using the standard wiki in moodle 1.8.3 +. This bug has also been replicated in the Demo Moodle site (username \" teacher \", password \" demo \"). On older versions of moodle, e.g. moodle 1.8, it was possible to export a wiki as a zip file, which could be saved on a users hard disk. The zip file contained an HTML version of the wiki. This was a great feature since it allowed students to keep an off-line 'portfolio' of their work. This feature ( along with other features of the Wiki module ) now appears to be 'broken'. In order to export a wiki, the user clicks on the -- Choose Wiki Links -- pull-down menu, and selects 'Export pages'. Then teachers or admin can choose where to export the wiki: to a directory in the course files, or a Downloadable zip archive. Click here to see an image of this export page . Students can not choose, and are only able to download their wiki as a zip archive. However, on clicking on the [Export] button, the following appears at the top of the page (this is just a sample): \n```text\nPK ����LR70�������� ���group.htmleQ�n� ��W2SZ��V�cKQG0�F��2$rT�� g�D����;�c�M>j ...\n```\n Click here to see a screenshot of this page . Teachers can still successfully export wiki pages to the course Files diretory. I do hope that this can be fixed (see MDL-11816 ) since it appears the new wiki (NWiki) will not be a part of the standard Moodle release until the end of next year - version 2.0 . Or, should I take the plunge and install Nwiki now?",

I then got the idea to try and export some pages from a MediaWiki site (WikiBooks) to be precise, and try and import them into NWiki ... Well you can all guess ... it did not work, however, after closer inspection of the MediaWiki XML file I realized that it should be possible to write a parser that would take the MediaWiki XML tags and replace them with NWiki replacements. There are many tags in the NWiki XML file that are LMS dependent, these are what makes NWiki more suited to our educational needs. I am guessing that if there is no corresponding tag in the MediaWiki file then they can be simply inserted with defaults. I am imagining a stand alone parser at the moment but I'm sure that this could be written into the php scripts that read in the XML files and it could be implemented transparently in NWiki. What do the rest of you wiki'ers think? Linds",

But now I tell people, \"If you are choosing Moodle because it has a wiki, then you are making a bad decision.\" The manual does not answer my questions, and I see pages and pages of postings here about wikis, but most of them appear unanswered...no reply. It is too late now, but should I have avoided the default eWiki and loaded up some other module like nWiki? I've only been using it for a few days now, but here is what sucks about eWiki (maybe it wouldn't suck if I could figure it out): I checked all of the Student admin options (Allow: 'set page flags,' 'remove pages,' 'strip pages,' and 'revert mass changes'), but students receive a \"Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (Manage wiki settings)\" message. Sometimes links to external web pages work, and sometimes they don't. There seems to be no rhyme or reason. Seeding the wiki with a page name for the first page doesn't work. The students still get a 'blank slate' when they first enter their wiki. Students can't seem to upload a graphic to their wiki. Somewhere along the line, as a student, I was able to upload a file, but the 'location' that I was told that it was stored in, was of no value in its retrieval. So if the student's graphic goes into my database and they can't use it, then what is the point? Am I doing it all wrong, or are these known problems with the Moodle wiki?",

Well, that's one opinion, but I've been using Mediawiki in one of my courses for a couple of years...works great for me. That's not the point here anyway...no one said anything about replacing the Moodle Wiki with Mediawiki. The point is, Moodle has a wiki (or 2 or 3) but none of them are good enough, it would seem, to handle the moodle documentation task. I wouldn't find this strange if Moodle didn't have a wiki, bit it does and chooses not to use it...there is a message there if you choose to see it .

I have to say this, \"There is a LOT to like about Moodle.\" I am using features that my AU experience did not expose me to. Having also used WebCT3 and 4 as a teacher and many versions of The Learning Manager as teacher/administrator, I feel somewhat qualified to compare these three LMS product lines. My opinion? Moodle rocks! At the end of this year, I will be comparing it with my compatriots who are now testing WebCT6 (sold under some Blackboard alias), Blackboard, and Sakai. It will be interesting to find out if they will be able to list as many good reasons to switch to their LMS experience. Cheers, Marty",

And it is as it must be for two reasons: (1)there is pressure to get Moodle 1.9 released ASAP (in the general dev forum we can see that, and who's behind it), and (2) nwiki needed to be reviewed by the community seniors, as was stated in the developers conference last April. Ten days ago, after applying considerable pressure (as you know) finally NWiki got reviewed (I really owe it to the great Knigth in Shiny Armor to take the time to do it and to endorse us, thanks Eloy!!). As is expected to be NWiki requires some modifications (specially in the installation script and data migration process, because was designed for moodle 1.6 and needs to be ported to the XMLDB engine). I completely agree with the Moodle experts resolution. I'm only sad because it came so late that we are almost too late to fix the issues. The story repeats itself again Right now we are (specially Pigui) working on the issues reported. We will try to have another candidate ready before august , but if more issues come up, we will go on vacation anyway. I'm only asking for a little fairness here, IF THERE'S REALLY A WILL TO PUT NWIKI IN 2.0 .. THEN IT MUST BE IN THE 2.0 Branch SINCE DAY ONE. Ludo",

The current wiki is a sorry mess and certainly not up to the standard of the rest of the Moodle activities . Wiki is one of the few purpose built group activities within Moodle (all very well talking about workshop, but how many faculty actually use it in practice?) and the current version is not maintained, and there has been no attention or bug fixes since 1.4 as far as I am aware. Nwiki is clearly superior and I am rather disappointed that it has not made it's way into the general release. Keep it up Ludo -- you've got another winner like Alberto Contador in the Tour! Mark",

I love the blocks that come with NWiki, if Nwiki does not support auto-linking is there a combination of versions of NWiki or DFwiki and moodle that will give me the wiki blocks to display things like an index and have autolinking? thanks",

After I select my template file in the settings and click continue, sometimes I end up with an empty nwiki editor page, some times I get taken to \"http://localhost/course/modedit.php\" and a blank browser page. I've found a few bugs/problems with the timeline feature. Do you want these bugs going straight into the bug tracker or shall I explain them here so that others can more easily comment on them too? Finally, could someone go throught the NWikiMarkupReference page to bring it up to date as it looks a bit corrupted at the moment. That will help the community with testing too. I would help you out by doing it for you if I could, but I can't be sure exactly what markup you have coded for. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you during the moodle HQ evaluation of the wiki! Thanks for your your efforts for the current release. --Stuart.",

If I set \"Debug messages\" to \"NONE: Do not show any errors or warnings\" when I edit a wiki page, the weblib error messages no longer appear. However, the editing toolbar now only shows the smileyface and the question-mark, and there is no toolbar functionality. Also, I can confirm that I still cannot create new pages using the \"Wiki - Create a new page\" block. By the way, this spring I used nwiki with a class of 50 students in my university course \"Introduction to Cognitive Science.\" Most students had no previous wiki experience, and the project went superbly. Students were required to contribute to the wiki four times over a three week period, and we would up with an excellent document that students then used as an aid in studying for the final exam. This was nwiki under moodle 1.7. From both the perspective of the professor (me) and the students, nwiki worked flawlessly. Thanks,",

In order to avoid this confusion, the teacher should be able to make the default editor the only choice. In the meantime, the option \"Change to one of the following editors\" could be moved down below the buttons: save, preview, cancel.

Anyhow, this isn't a corrupted activity, it's just that the lang file is missing. The lang file is a php page which maps placeholders such as preview to language strings such as Preview. In language supported by moodle has one. In the nwiki you unpacked, look for the lang file and make sure that lang/en_utf8 folder inside the nwiki download is copied across to your moodle install. You should note that even after you do this there may still be a few 'gaps'. The nwiki is being developed by the dfwiki team in Spain. I've offered to help them with their language translation. Keep an eye out for nwiki releases and hopefully the gaps in the lang file will gradually be filled as well as nwiki bugs being fixed. --Stuart.",

It takes about 20 minutes to show the backup selection screen. I click the \"import\" link of the wiki I want to restore, and then the \"Import\" button (both \"replace all\" radios checked). The wiki mod id that the course creates by default is in the URLs, also the couse id and the wiki-to-restore name (with blank spaces URLencoded) so I understand that the wiki-to-restore would be restored on the wiki-of-the-course. So I get to a screen titled (in the middle-column) Importing XML file to Wiki with an empty table and with the complete footer (meaning that the page process was done). But the wiki wasn't restored at all. Jose",

          "Text": "I must be missing something - a brain perhaps. The college use Moodle 1.6.5 on a window$ 2003 server. The story so far - I have been volunteered to produce something useful to demonstrate the use of wikis and wanted to use a better wiki than the installed version in Moodle, I have seen this wiki in the database for some time and decided to use it. I downloaded the files and followed the instructions contained in the readme file, Nothing, [nada (the extent of my Spanish) apart from me casa su casa, hola comes da, all probably spelt wrongly.] I went through db setup screens for blocks and course all of which had no continue button but the table set up messages showed success, then the final error message this - wiki module needs upgrading ( mysql ): SHOW TABLES (my sql ): SELECT * FROM mdl_modules WHERE name = ' dfwiki ' LIMIT 1 dfwiki installed. Upgrading dfwiki (start) ( mysql ): SHOW COLUMNS FROM mdl_modules (my sql ): UPDATE mdl_modules SET name = 'dfwiki', version = '2006052502', cron = '0', lastcron = '0', search = '', visible = '0' WHERE id = '38' dfwiki installed. Upgrading dfwiki (end) No continue button nothing and when I attempted to get back to the front page ,I ended looping back to this point. I then exited Moodle and went back in, as soon as I logged in I was returned to this page. I went to 'moodleroot' and deleted the wiki folder contents and I was able to proceed. After deleting the wiki folder contents I returned to the blocks page to the message ' [something] needs to be upgraded by a programmer - and a list of incompatible blocks which I deleted. I have restored the original wiki. On doing further research have found a second set of installation instructions which differ from the read me file, knowing that I can restore the ewiki contained in Moodle easily and having no wikis to lose I will attempt to re-install today. I have seen other mentions in the forum of similar problems, but no solutions, is there anyone out there running Moodle 1.6.x that has this running successfully. ian",

I suggest you come at this from a different angle - instead of thinking I want to use a Wiki, now where can I use it IN MY CLASS?  Why not think of a series of scenarios where you think students could collaborate OUTSIDE the classroom and set a task that requires that to be done, say, before the next lesson . It's 'horses for courses'. Also to lessen the impact of your problem - you could always try creating GROUPS within the Wiki.",

          "Text": "Hi Helen, I myself had to struggle through this topic a while ago. For a newbee in the discussion it is indeed hard to understand why all these Wikis are used - it especially takes a while to understand that some of them are just different names for new versions of identical wikis. Neither the link you posted nor the Help Chapter 11 referenced there really tells what wikis there are which of them are the same why there are different kinds itegrated in Moodle Both ressources are very helpful for someone trying to understand what one can do with a Wiki and how it works in general though. I would therefore suggest to add a small passage to both with the following information: Moodle's wiki is built on top of an older wiki system called Erfurt wiki, which is also referred to as ewiki (second is just a guess but interesting to know if so): ewiki = Erfurt Wiki . So if you just choose \"add Wiki\" you get an Erfurt Wiki (which is helpful to know if you want to look up the syntax). Erfurt Wiki development is not maintained any more, so Moodle devolopment steers to replacing it by DFWiki/nWiki: Moodle: eWiki -> nWiki Where nWiki is a new development line based on the former DFWiki: DFWiki -> nWiki . This is why there are two Wikis in Moodle. Anyway the dfwiki will have a old wiki import and restore feature (for ewiki?) so you will be able to upgrade without much trouble. This is at least the picture as far as I got it after a while - probably I'm still wrong with the one or other - sources (among others): http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=30921 http://morfeo.upc.es/crom/mod/wiki/view.php?id=22 Knowing this, all the rest of the discussion in this forum and some other ressources immediately starts to make (more) sense.

As I understand it you are saying the default 1.8 Wiki is still the E-Wiki which is no longer maintained? This is likely to be replaced with N-Wiki, which is an enhancement of D-Wiki? If this is the case, is it worth upgrading the default wiki to N-Wiki now, or waiting for the 1.9 release.... my main concern here being upgrading of the N-Wiki at a later point in time. It is clear that any future releases of N-Wiki will allow upgrade from the moodle default Wiki, but what about interim releases of the N-Wiki, i.e. if I use the current version of N-Wiki, will future moodle releases be able to upgrade this (non-standard) Wiki? In terms of longer term compatibility would I be better sticking with the current default Wiki and waiting for the 1.9 release? On that note, is it confirmed that N-Wiki will become the new standard in 1.9, or is this a desire as opposed to a hard and fast decision? Any further assistance on this would be appreciated, Jeremy",

We are even thinking about a option migration script that turns ewiki page syntax into Mediawiki (the most standard). Right now NWiki allows choosing the markup of each page in the same wiki activity (at creation time). And that's not everything.. wait a little and you'll see OpenOffice Writter documents exported and imported online from moodle nwiki activities and complete PDF printing and.... uh! That's considered to be a secret... let's say its a rumor Ludo",

Going into one of these folders gives you folders for each wiki created. Then you'll find any uploaded files within that folder.  At this point, if you've found the file you want to get rid of you can click the check box and delete completely. HOWEVER, the reference to this file does not disappear from the Attachments tab in the student's wiki and the file can be downloaded although it does not contain anything. I am not sure whether this has been labelled as a bug but the problem has been around for at least a couple of Moodle versions. The wiki situation in Moodle is a mess. The 'Efurt' wiki which is the one currently  distributed  in Moodle has this problem which I think  renders it unusable (how do you tell students that they cannot delete attachments they mistakenly uploaded?).  Work on this has stopped in favour of Ludo's Dfwiki but installing that one is rather painful and it's apparently not slated for inclusion as the default wiki until v1.8. This is a great shame in my view and in the interim I am having to look elsewhere for a professional wiki such as Twiki. Mark",

          "Text": "Hi there, a question recently raised lately is how does Nwiki deal with old wikis: migration and restore issues. NWiki migrates automatically old wiki contents when is installed. We worked very hard to be sure this works, and so far it does!!!! This process works with moodle 1. to 1.9 To restore old wiki backups in a nwiki the process is not completely automatic. Meaning that when you restore the course the old wikis will not be restored if nwiki is installed. You need to create a wiki activity use the IMPORT XML option and then select your backup file and choose the wiki you wish to restore. I understand this is not the best option but would be very hard to maintain a restore process depending on N wiki formats. The IMPORT XML also works to import old good DFWikis. Cheers Ludo",

That's all. 2. Why I hate NWiki. As the developer I hate NWiki up to depth of soul! We shall recollect dfWiki. It was the good version. Yes, it had lacks, for example, global variables, but they were not everywhere. For this version I could write patch, allowing to insert wiki-pages into any place Moodle ( http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=42325 ). Martin has told - global variables should retire (I agree with him!). What was got as a result? Now there are a huge parameter $WS in which have fallen down everything, that only it is possible. There is no opportunity to understand, what from contents of $WS is necessary in THIS function! And here and there $WS also a global variable. I cannot improve NWiki because it works only through the web-interface. It transfers a lot of information through the hidden fields to displayed page and receives it from there. It is not adapted simply to cause the necessary function. For example, using \"echo\" command. Most of functions should return result, not a send in browser because sometime developer need to get result for next manipulations. Next example. I need to create page. Think it simply? First I searched, where it is doing. Has found. Oh! It seems simply - only one additional function wiki_sintax_find_internal_links with one parameter! But if we look inside - welcome global $WS. Than to fill this huge variable to me it is not clear. NWiki works very slowly. No wonder. $WS it is transferred from one function to another, it is filled on 90 % with the information which not necessary at present. Time and resources of a server is spent for all this. Let's look at development Moodle. It is system which there has begun one person. It too all over again was not ideal. But already for a long time we observe a stable direction in development - all in Moodle becomes modular and object-oriented. Expenses for support and modernization of system increase exponential with increase in volume of a code. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a unique way to curb this process. Abundantly clear, that NWiki should be rewrite to use OOP. The evil $WS should be beaten. In function it is necessary to transfer only that information which there is necessary. Formats, imports, etc. should be easily connected to NWiki.",

Then came the moodle big guns and tod us to change things here and there, each 3 months a new set of issues ( when we took moodle 1.4 code as example and there where global variables and lots of things that have been banned at any point. As developer I also feel that we need to change some of the architecture of nwiki to be able to breath. We are taking this task step by step. The parser has been rewriten, and now we've got full mediawiki suport (without templates and some too mediawiki specific things). We are already wrapping functionalities under layers for developers to hack on to. But we need to take this step by step, because a BIG deal of work has been done to import data from ewiki and impement senseless features simply beacuse they where present in ewiki. I'm open to suggestions for functionalities and changes on implementation. We are actually doing some architecture changes ourselves. But regarding the \"being the oficial wiki\" I must say: * NWiki is WAY WAY better than ewiki in ** usability ** has less bugs ** has a active group of developers willing to improve it and change anything needed So the moodle big guns have to decide whether to upgrade to nwiki with its exposed architecture problems (that will be fixed) or to keep with a wiki module that (auto-censured) as LOTS of teachers have told me.

I imagine that when I upgrade to the newest version of Moodle and the Nwiki my problem will be solved, however in the meantime, can anyone suggest a solution, please? For example, I have access to the Mysql database , so could delete the old versions via phpMyAdmin . Would this be a safe thing to do? Any advice will be most welcome.",

If so is there a way to break up sections and pages within a wiki so you could print off specific areas instead of the whole document? I understand what wikis are but my experience is limited, Any help would be appreciated. cheers, Mike. PS. if there is a better mod for this I'd love to hear it.",

After some boasting and showing off, our moodle people are interested, and I've hacked the ewiki code a little to add a 'view as slideshow' button to ewiki pages, which takes the wikitext and converts it to an s5 slideshow. I'd really like to get this off the ground, it provides a simple way for groups of students to collaborate on creating presentations, gets away from needing powerpoint, and pushes users towards focusing on content rather than form. HOWEVER, the default wysiwyg editor is not really appropriate for this, as it is slanted towards html rather than wikitext, and our moodle people rightly think wikitext is something of a barrier to non-tech people using it. I'd like to use wikiwyg , but I'm a bit lost as to where is the right place to cause the appropriate javascript to be loaded. Can anyone give me some hints? Or set me right as to why this is a bad idea?",

You will ask: why do you want to use wamp and not xampp? Because wamp gives me the interface to access phpmyadmin. Xampp gives it to me only when installing. May be there is a way to do it, but I don't know it. Not using easyphp neither because its version of mysql is 4.1.9 when most modules plugin require 4.1.16 and up. Juvenal",

I have created the Wiki, but for each article read I would like the student to have a Summary page, a Inquiries page and a Contributors page. I am relatively unfamiliar with the terminology used in wikis so I do not know if I need to create the article name as a category and then create the Summary, Inquiries, and Contributors pages as sub-categories (pages). I had tried simply using the brackets; however, then other articles link to that page. I would appreciate any advice on how to accomplish what I am trying to do with the wikis which could be outlined as: Class Reading Wiki Article #1 Summary Inquiries Contributors Article #2 Summary Inquiries Contributors Article #3 etc, etc. The reason I want the inquiries on separate pages is that I want the students to be able to edit at the same time. In other words a student could be working on the summary page while another is simultaneously working on the inquiries. If this could be accomplished by keeping it all on one page (as it appears in Moodle Docs - which I realize is a different type of wiki) that would be fine. Thanks again for any advise as I try to incorporate this in to my class. Peace.",

The closest thing I found was a category but I am not able to get that working. I want my students to do reading summaries and come up with questions based on the reading. I want a summary and questions subpage for each article. I understand how to create a page; however, when they create a [Questions] link on the Article 2 page it takes them to the already completed [Questions] page for Article 1. I would greatly appreciate any guidance in wrapping my mind around this wild wiki world. Peace.",

I am not sure that I completely understand.  I think you are suggesting that the pages be created using names like Article1Summary, Article2Summary, etc. to prevent the linking from taking the student to the same place; however, I want it to be displayed simply as summary. My attempts at using [Article1Summary | Summary] have not worked since even after the page is created I see the wiki new page question mark. When I click on it, then it takes me to the page but it is clear to me that something is not working. I am wondering if on a page, could I have sections ? Where students could modify one section at a time. I want the student doing the summary and the student doing the questions to be able to be writing and working at the same time without interfering with one another. Unfortunately, I do not understand that a legacy wiki page link is but I would happily accept the fudge.",

B) In order to preserve the richness of wiki style interaction, I want all of the articles to be in a single wiki activity. C) I will have to check out nwiki and see if that might not be the best solution since the likelihood of having students simultaneously edit the same page can be reduced. I was trying to avoid some user frustration of being told that someone else had edited the page since them. But I do like the idea of being able to provide a style guide or template. D) Since I am working with high school students in the U.S., disciplined though they may be, it is probably best not to rely too much on a naming convention although that may be my best long term solution.

This secon strategy should be used alhong with the Page list block, because the new page will most likely be an orphaned page. The admin block has a tool to keep track of orphaned pages.

I went to to the dfwiki website and was kind of confused about the steps to go through to install the import/export modules. My question is the following: 1) Is tiddlywiki already installed in Moodle? From what I have read, ewiki (efurwiki) is the prepackaged wiki in moodle. If it is, then it makes sense to just install the import/export package. On the other hand, I didn't see where to download tiddlywiki on the website (dfwiki website). Each time I clicked on a download tiddlywiki link, I got more literature. No files to download. 2) Suggestion: when one clicks on the import/export files links, each individual files open. Would be more user friendly if they were bundled in a zip which can be extracted and copied to either the block or mod. Thanks.",

Copied new wiki folder (and blocks, course, lang) over existing Each time, when going to the admin page, it detects that the wiki needs to be upgraded, but does not complete the upgrade. I get no error messages, it just doesn't complete right through to the 'continue' button and I get an incomplete wiki install. Blank page when viewing the admin area. I have to uninstall both the DFWiki (seems to add a temporary DFWiki when upgrading) and the new wiki (that doesn't work). I can then install the old wiki and all is back to normal.

After some months the module seems to be really near production-ready so we need to perform a KEY test to check if, finally, it's able to replace the old wiki. Such test is about to guarantee that old contents will be migrated smoothly to the new one, without losing anything in the conversion. So, to be able to execute that test successfully we would want to invite all you to create as many and complex wiki activities you can in order to be able to test the migration thoroughly. Here is the Party Plan: 1.- Everybody interested, go to http://test.moodle.com and enter the WIKI Arena Party. 2.- Credentials will be required. They are, simply: teacher/teacher. 3.- Once in the Party, feel free to create one Wiki activity and fill it with all sort of content. The Chef's suggestions include: Copy/Paste complex old-wiki pages from your sites Restore Wiki activities from standard course backups (be careful) Create manually any type of content (links, images...)",

If the conversion runs smoothly (no data loss) and, if the newer wiki works like a charm (far better than the old one), the correct conclusion seems to be to replace the old one. Then, we'll have one better wiki module inside Moodle, better supported and with an amazing future. A cool evolution! Else we'll continue using the current module, with all its limitations and problems. Some sort of work can be performed to improve it, of course, but my personal opinion after looking the ewiki code some months ago, is really about to change to the new alternative (obviously if the conditions remarked in the previous paragraph are satisfied).

Now I must ask you to plat with the wiki arena to hunt for some bugs and to check out if all the content that was suposed to be there is it really. We have allready detected some issues and we are allready working hard on it. DFwiki team has also grown up, and a set of new developers are starting to write their usefull code lines. DFwiki will continue as an alternative module that we'll use to test our mad ideas, before integrating them into wiki. This is a short list of what's to come: * a-la mediawiki discussion pages * pdf printing and html/opendoc export along with wikibook * new improved diff features * complete grading * major/minor edit swich * page voting * new edit modes (specially for those who teach programming languages ) * better atached files management * edit mode speciall blocks And last but not least wikipodcasting : text2speech and podcast your wiki pages.

I have found that it is best to create the first page of the wiki and include every students name in [] brackets so that when they click on the ? after their name a unique page is created in their name. If they add further pages to their page each page name should be unique, so perhaps get them to add their student number or initials to the page name. Hope this helps. Nigel",

On the support side, I had been using PHPBB as a place to enter and store hints and fixes we have found for the various systems problems. So right now I have a phpbb forum for the phone system, and entry for the voice mail system, software, and so on. what I would like is a place were anyone can record the steps the have found that will fix a particular problem and have a place were others can add to the solution if they find something else that works. I tried using the BOOK module, but that is too restrictive in that others don't seem to be able to add to it. I have played with the wiki module thinking that would allow others to add to the entry but it looks like i would need separate wikis for each system, that is on for the phones, one for the voice mail, one for the hardware and so on. Am I correct in my thinking here? I have also looked at using the forum module in the same manner as I did with the PHPBB installation. Here again I seemed to run into issues in that when created on the main page, it seems only the admin is able to edit or add to the forum. Perhaps my problem is in my understanding of how MOODLE works and in how I have it set up. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Regards Rick",

          "Text": "I would say one wiki would be enough, with separate pages for each issue. The front page should be the 'forum overview', with links to each issue. The problem with wiki as forum is that it is mainly a tool for collaborative writing, so it allows several users to write on the same pages. This is also one of the problems you see e.g. on wikipedia, where several authors write on each page, and thus creates a kind of discussion that can be very unstructured, commenting in between each other etc. Forums do not allow other users to change what another user has written. So for a wiki to be successful as forum tool, there has to be some guidelines easy enough for all to understand, and some moderators to ensure compliance. If you create separate wikis - this might make it easier for the users to handle different issues - you should add links on the pages between the wikis so it is easy to navigate between them. But it is important to design the forums/wikis with the users, to see how it best suits them Forums in moodle can be used the same way as forums in phpBB, depends on the settings. It looks like your forum is restricted who can reply - but this is not your fault, the standard news forum is normally for one way communication. Moodle forums have two settings that control who is allowed to post and reply, check them out. And one great thing with Moodle forums is that your users can subscribe to them to receive postings with email or via RSS feeds. So forum or wiki? I think it depends on how much effort you want to use to structure the communication. The forum tool is more focused, the wiki is more open. But to me it sounds like you would be best helped with the forum. /Ian",

But i experience a minor problem. probably a bug? when I have proved in a modle with \"latin\" character set, The Nwiki looks pretty, but Exprot PDF uses UTF (it means that all the á, é. í, ó ú , ñ... were changed to \"extrange\" characters). Then I made a test migrating a moodle to UTF (vers 1.6.1 with Nwiki 20061006 and several Wikis in their courses). In this case, the Pdf exports is readable (all the \"spanish characters\" looks fine) but the wiki isn't: the characters á, é, etc. are changed in the wiki. It sounds like the wiki pages uses \"iso.latin\" as default character set while PDF uses UTF-8. This could explain why in the first case wiki performs well but PDf not, and in the second PDF looks well but wiki not. Anyway, I hope to migrate my production moodle (with several wikis) to utf next month. But I need to know before how to guarantee I will not loss wiki data.",

When I do this - and go to the page and click on edit, then all of the HTML tags show and when I click on Save all of the HTML tags show up in the view. Why?? Should I add some symbol or tag before the HTML tags? 2. How to I get tables to actually work properly? All the text says is something about dashes and I tried different text variations but was unable to get anything to work? 3. Is there any way to do section linking within a Wiki page? I have searched everywhere and cannot see what is the proper way to do this within DfWiki. Some wiki's say you can use double brackets and the pound sign (#) to do this - but am not able to get this to work.

Everyone in the course will be able to see the wiki activity link, and you have to set up each group's initial wiki page. (see attached) I would direct you to a moodledoc that I posted, but it seems to have dropped out of docs, presumably because it is now fairly out of date with the incoming complications of new roles and new wiki developments in 1.7?? In any case, hope this picture helps a little bit. The short explanation: I used Moodle's overall groups setting to separate my course sections , but I then also wanted to set up group wikis within my sections. This picture shows how I did it. I teach five sections and used the basic format of this page to create the main page template for each section. Then I had each small group edit their specific pages. Again, it's a little complicated, so let me know if it doesn't make sense from the picture. P.S. Re: my \"friendly warning\"--I teach fifteen-year-olds; I know it sounds a bit harsh, but you really have to have different structures/expectations in place at that age, so feel free to ignore that part of the picture.",

The solution is NOT what you would think. It turns out that you only need to create 1 Wiki from the front page of your course. The other wiki(s) are \"clones\" of the first one assigned to each of the groups you have set up. Here is a graphic that I captured from setting up the first wiki. Over on the right hand side is a drop down window called \"Other Wikis:\" When you click on the down arrow, you will see all of the \"groups\" that you have made and can go in individually and setup the \"clone\" wikis. When a student logs in to the \"Wiki\" they are taken directly to the group wiki they have been assigned to. Their wiki has the edit tabs available. When they use the same drop down menu, they can \"look\" at the other wikis, but there are no edit tabs that let them 'tinker' with another group's script. Now that is very cool! Here are the basic steps that I followed: 1. Set up your \"course.\" Hope this helps, Tom Clauset\" I'd like to know if anything is different now. Cheers, Glenys",

          "Text": "hi, we are running a 1.5 moodle installation. having set up a wiki with 'html only' option and given students a page to edit with some text already on this, when students from a different location click on edit they see the raw html (including all the tags) on that page rather than how the page should be displayed. they also don't have the 'editor' icons at the top of the editing window (font, size, bold, etc) which they should have. i believe this is a problem not with the wiki as it works fine for students in other locations, but with the computers the children are running at the problem location. i know they run windows 98 but nothing more, as we teach remotely and do not have access to the school in question. anybody any suggestions for what might be causing this that we could ask the school to check and rectify? thanks",

However the new instance also returned a Moodle error page with the same message: Theres's an error in page location I am anxious to check out the nwiki and wondered if you have an instance running somewhere that I could visit with a SandBox or similar page where I could experiment with the edit and page creation routines.

It would be great if it were possible to enable uploading of files when the HTML (or any other) editor is being used.  And unless I've got something messed up with my installation, the upload option is not present on the edit pages.  (no tab or browse button at the bottom of the form) FYI , although I like the mediawiki/dfwiki syntax, I have decided to only use the HTML editor so that my students only have one editor to learn to use (and even that has been a bit of a challenge!).  Ultimately I am hoping that we can have a nice AJAX editor for all user forms (Journals, assignments, blog , forums, wiki etc). Keep up the good work. Cheers, Hugh",

However allowing file upload in the html editor would lead to a real mess with wiki file atachments. I mean that when you export/backup your wiki you expect to carry the files atached with you, but with html editor upload export code go nuts and us with it. When we stabilize the version into moodle core I want to rebuild totally the file atachment features, and to have som sort file repository where atached files (like pages) have versions, owners and so on. But this is dfwiki fiction. What I'm doing latelly is to place my images at flickr and embedd them from there. so my students also learn something more about web 2.0 Cheers Ludo out",

However, I've bumped into an issue with regard to the formatting, particularly with headings and subheadings. According to all the documentation, if I put two equal signs around the text that I want as a main heading, it should be done automatically. However, when I do that, it seems as if the wikiwords is getting the signal to turn it into \"preserve formatting\" ie. everything inside the equals signs appear in \"courier\" or some sort of typewriter-based font. It's a minor annoyance, I know... but I'm wondering if I shouldn't just use the straight up HTML only feature. Suggestions?",

Ofc they use Korean in the page names. Everything seems fine when others open the wiki page, the page name displays correctly in korean and so do the contents, but when anyone (not the last editor) else tries to edit that page, the edit screen reads: Edit this page '?????몰?????를???????' and there is no content in the html box. Is there a way around this - bug - i will call it, since the korean page title and contents correctly show up in the View Tab? Must be the way it passes information to the Edit tab. English titled pages do not have the same problem. I have tried with version 1.6.1, 1.6.2, and even 1.7 and the same error keeps appearing. In scanning this support column it would seem there are limits to the way this wiki handles utf-8 and/or page titles, so we are trying a workaround for now: short English page names. If there is no solution to this, then probably the best solution for us will be the use of an english page name (without apostrophes or spaces) and a Korean alias that shows on the page. Is there a way to accomplish this? I mean, to have the alias show as the hyperlink and not the real page name? Thanks for helping out a n00b, Tito Vergara",

So, instead of being in the \"ㄱ\"  section, a word will show up in the uncategorized \"개\" section. Of course, none of this fits within the latin alphabet - so the glossary changes according to the user interface language... an interesting problem.

To do this you should 'display a directory'. Here's how: Go to the Files area of your course (in Administration block) Create a new directory. It doesn't matter what it's called, but you might want to call it 'excel documents' click on it to enter the directory. Now you want to browse and upload the Excel document that you want to make available. Having done this, return to the main course outline and make sure that Editing is switched on. Find the weekly or topic block that you want to present the file in and choose Add a resource -> Display a directory Give the resource a name, perhaps, 'Excel files' and in the summary say what kind of spreadsheets are going here. Pull down Display a directory and choose the 'Excel documents' directory. Click Save changes. Now the contents of this directory will be displayed to your students when they click the resource link.",

          "Text": "Index block in wiki can be quit confusing when there are several pages included in wiki. When pressing plus/minus icons the index tree opens/closes like expected (it only shows the pages that are \"under\" the selected page). When clicking page name links the tree opens so that it shows all the pages that are on the same level as the selected page. Our wish is to make page links work the same way plus icons work (opens only the selected branch of the index tree). This would make index block more user-friendly. It would also be nice to have the currently open wiki page somehow emphasized in the index block (e.g. bold or different color). This helps the user to see where the current page is situated in the index tree. With these improvements the index block would be perfect. I had no luck when I tried to make these changes so any help would be really appreciated. Best regards, Laura",

I've been doing this on a test Moodle installation and I'm not particulary worried about  keeping  Wiki activities intact -- I have a backup of these and I figure that I can always restore from this backup (correct assumption?). I have read all the entries in the Wiki Forum going back to Aug 29th but I'm still flummoxed. I followed Ludo's instructions but alas the result was that courses that had contained a wiki opened up without showing the Outline. So, following some else's advice I deleted the wiki module from the Admin : modules section. This removed the wiki tables from the database . Subsequently I managed to retreive the site but now adding the Wiki module back in has no effect (the module does not appear on the Admin : Modules) because the tables have disappeared. Soooo, is there a piece of SQL code somewhere that could be run to create the New Wiki tables in the MySQL database? If not, is there a description of the table fields so that I can create it manually? Any other ideas? TA MarkPea",

You can also wait two days or so til we fix it. Regards Ludo",

Even got a continue button! I have reinstalled DFWiki, too. The order matters. NWiki first, DFWiki second. The problem with that is, when you delete DFWiki, you lose all instances of the module. It then becomes impossible (as far as I can tell so far) to convert any DFWikis, even if you reinsert the tables for DFWiki. Heck, I even tried copying all the DFWiki records into NWiki tables. The copying worked, but without an instance in a course, they're no use. I'm going to try fooling with mdl_course and mdl_course_section. I'll delete them in the copy installation and import or copy them from the production installation. I'm not convinced it will work, but it's worth a quick try. Can't hurt. Maybe I'll just rename, add a \"1\" to the name of each table. That way I can always backtrack.",

It might also be a good idea to start appending version numbers, so that future searches will turn up relevant posts when people are interested in a specific version. So where are we now?

Versioning wasn't so important for that (except when adding a discussion to the discussion page took out half the page of text. I could save the damaged version, revert, copy the missing text, return to the present, so to speak, and paste the missing text back in. Of course, it would have been nicer not to need to do that.)

I consider that wikis and blogs (and forums, cause we could consider a blog as a special class of forum) accomplish different tasks, as you expose. Wiki is a tool to create large hypertext collaborative documents where different minds try to create and consensuate a text while understand each others and create new knowledge while they do it ( doing something called social constructionism ). Blog  is a  way of self expression, through comments, permalikns, rss and search engines the blogosphere allows the revision the knowledge created (but within the blogosphere not in the blog itself). We should not forget about the tools that wikis offer us to  review the process  ( page history,  examination of  navigation, vote for pages,  evaluations,  and discussion pages ) those tell much about what's going on also. The use of autoresumees tools and so on can be useful, but I believe that for learning is best to read and follow the links and create the knowledge in our mind. That's my truth, but I've happened to disagree with myself often Ludo",

          "Text": "Hi, David.  I think that wikis would be better as the \"history\" feature would be invaluable in keeping track of work done while keeping it tidy so that fewer drafts show up on the main page for each topic.  I believe that the way I set up my student portfolios in wikis could be adapted by you for this research project purpose.  (See attached slides.) In short--have THEM set up the pages as you deem appropriate by giving them specific instructions for where you want the information kept. ie: CamelCase pg 1 = BrainstormingandPrewriting CamelCase pg 2 = AnnotatedBibliography CamelCase pg 3 = RoughDrafts (As in the slide picture, I suggest that you set \"allow binary files\" to \"yes\" so that they can choose to upload drafts or to copy them in as they choose.) Two caveats: 1) I teach ninth grade and could do CamelCase, but opt not to.  You could adapt your instructions to show them CamelCase versus my square bracket preference. 2) To keep research wikis private to only you and the student entering the information, follow this last step: If you use groups, you have to make sure that not only do you choose \"student\" for the type of wiki when you are setting it up, you also need to make sure the group icon for this activity is set to \"no groups.\" Hope this helps!

Currently, my moodle site is open for Guest Access: http://online.laurelschool.org/course/view.php?id=30 I've been working like the very Devil this summer after the Byfield MoodleMoot to get it off the ground.  Fortunately, I have had several years experience with Dreamweaver and earlier incarnations of a web site for AP US History to fall back on. I also teach at an independent girl's school--Laurel in Shaker Heights OH.  So, I believe our kids are similar in outlook. I'm looking forward to using moodle to facilitate this process.  I do a lot of work on writing historical essays with my students, as you can see from some of the other pages.  Moodle seems an ideal fit for this. Thanks again for your generous help. Best David",

Regarding wiki attachments: You're right--this is a feature that has\nperplexed me as well, but I guess I always assumed it had something to\ndo with what I was trying to attach and that I use Macs--that it wasn't\na bug.  Hadn't taken the time to explore why as there was the\nfollowing, seeming, workaround: Instead of trying to attach a doc in edit mode (which may work for\npeople using PCs not Macs, again I don't know as I haven't tried it\nfrom a PC), click on the \"attachments\" tab in the tab menu (see\npicture).  After the doc has been uploaded, there will be a link\nmessage at the bottom stating, \"This page has attachments.\" \nClicking on that link should take you to the appropriate\nattachment.  Not exactly intuitive, I know. Regarding doc type, I have mostly had kids uploading docs for research, etc., so I do know that it is possible. As an aside, this shot is of one of my research wikis.  As someone\nelse pointed out, you can also set the wiki to \"separate groups\" so\nthat all students in the group can share their research if they want\nto--but only the student can edit his/her page.  That is how I had\nthis wiki set up.  Again, though, if you want only you and the\nstudent to have access, it needs to be set up as \"student\" in the wiki\nsetup page, and as \"no groups\" icon in edit mode from the main course\npage.

Lastly y decide to copy manually all my dfWiki pages (because teh blocks works badly. i.e. backup doesn't work; Add activities doesn't work....). Next I delete the dfWiki module... And the blocks perform well again and I could see the admin page again. I suposse that must be some kind of conflict if you have installed DfWiki and New_Wiki together with Moodle 1.6. For example, I notice that the attachments (files) of my NEw-Wiki are stored in a folder named dfwiki322 (I have another folder named wiki322 but empity).... Now I need to delete the DfWiki blocks but that isn't a easy task.

          "Text": "Hi Ludo-I've been playing with the wiki, mostly with the blocks at this point. I haven't found any critical bugs yet, but some small things, particularly with Moodle consistency and overall appearance/ usability . Here's a summary: Language: There are a lot of language strings missing from en_utf8. Since you developed this in Catalan, I would assume the strings exist there but for people to translate this into other languages, it is crucial you get the strings into en_utf8. Also, grammar and spelling in English could use a lot of improvement. I'd try my hand at it myself but I think the best would be if you could find someone who is fluent in Catalan and English who could make sure that the English translations reflect the original Catalan. Wiki Syntax: I love the fact that the HTML editor can be used in the wiki. This reduces the need for students to know wiki syntax. It would be nice though if there were a help item that would explain what wiki tags are necessary to use in the wiki. I found to make links I needed to use [[]], but I wonder if there is anything else or if the editor itself can do the rest. Editor Choice: It would be helpful if in addition to allowing the teacher to set the default editor method, there was an option to make that the only option available to students. I don't want them using anything but the HTML editor but the only way I can do that now is to hack out the choice. Vote: I see this button that says vote on it appearing on every page that does nothing and I have no clue why it is there. Index Block: This is the first block I installed on my site. I was not at all happy with the appearance of the menu items with the 20 character truncation. I upped the truncation to a number that wouldn't produce any ... for the pages I want to include in it. But that made the Index Block too wide. Therefore, I removed the \"nowrap\" and it looks much better. My suggestion: Make the character truncation a configurable number and get rid of the nowrap. Last Updates (better to call it \"Latest Updates\" in English): First of all, to be consistent with the Latest Activity Block in Moodle, you might want to list the items from oldest to newest. I didn't like the numbers next to the items, so I removed them, and to distinguish the items from one another instead, I added two breaks between them. I also did the same with the truncation and the nowrap as in the index block. The image at 20 pixels is inconsistent with the tiny pics used for example in the online users block so I changed the size to 16 pixels. I changed the false to true so that the student's name is shown alongside their image since I think that is important. In fact, I would rather remove the image altogether but that isn't an option the way the function is written. The date format wasn't precise enough either. We would all hope our students would be adding more frequently to the wiki so I changed the date format to something more suitable. In reality, it would be best of all I think if the format of the entries in this block matched those in the Latest Activity block. In any case, here's the changed code if you want to see what I have done: <td> <a href=\"'.$CFG-> wwwroot .'/mod/'.$modname.'/view.php?id='.$cm->id.'&amp;page='.$page.'\" title=\"'.$page.'\">'.$this->trim_string($page,50).'</a>&nbsp; <small>'.strftime('%d %b, %I:%M %p',$pageinfo->lastmodified).' by </small> '.wiki_get_user_info($pageinfo->author,16,true).' <br><br> </td>",

I don't like the way it automatically shows all the third (lowest) level pages when I am at a third level page. A wiki could have many many pages (mine has maybe 100 at this level) and this index gets too long. It would be better if the student had complete control of the index tree. They can open what they want and close what they want and it remembers the state from page to page for that student (at least for that session). But if I don't have the vote block implemented nor evaluations allowed, then why does the button show up? Especially since I have my wiki set to noeval, this button serves no purpose. As far as I can tell, this button should only be shown if evaluations are allowed.",

The developers are a team of STUDENTS with great skill but they are still gaining experience ( right now the initial developers david and ferran are hired by ouruniversity customizing the moodle production site http://atenea.upc.edu ). We have deeply tested this version on our servers, but there are so many scenarios (previous versions installed, database server, moodle version, old wikis to import, and lots of moodle 1.6 core issues that change from day to day and makes it crack ) For me the most important is NOT TO LOOSE THE DATA,  so please all of you who atempt to install new versions of new wiki and dfwiki make backups or exports of your wikis. We are rigth now working in the backups / restore engines of both versions. Due a some librarys in 1.6 current dfwiki backup/export does not work in 1.6, we are working on it. Those who have backups that you're not able to import please send the zip.files to me ( If the content can be seen of course) and we'll use it as a test case.

One thing that has just cropped up is a request that a course wiki can be pre-loaded with some sort of template that the students can select, for example, and template that inserts standard questions such as: What? Why? How? Benefits? Disadvantages?... I'm not particular familiar with media wiki, however I did notice that it offered some sort of template option and from speaking to colleagues it sounds as if this feature is exactly what is needed.  Does anybody know if the future of the moodle wiki(s) might include such an option.  Will dfwiki offer what I describe above?  I've heard dfwikie touted as eventually being \"mediawiki and more...\", but I'm not convinced yet(!).  What's the current word on the street about moodle and mediawiki full integration?  Is it envisaged that it can be integrated, and allow a per course/instance wiki?

It does have templates but they are generally used for inserting a block of static text into multiple pages. And when the ability to insert custom page specific into templates is used it's primarily for tables of data rather than free flowing text. Have a look at the editing source of this Wikipedia page and see how the infobox on the right and the succession boxes at the bottom are done. It works but it's geeky and tricky to edit if the text grows beyond a few words or phrases. If it was me I'd just add an intial wiki page with the template text (and probably some task instructions too) and then ask the students to view the wiki code and cut and paste it into a new page before they begin. It's hardly an onerous task, works on every wiki ever made and so teaches them exciting and transferrable information technology skills.",

If you catch the analogy. This winter we have been working in the development of the alternative wiki for moodle and this has more to do with INTEGRATING WITH MOODLE than wiki features. Rigth now we have already started to work in new partsers to suport the wiki features of mediawiki... meaning - wiki sysntax - mediawiki import / export - templates - section edit and so on This is all comming but we have firts to hit the HEAD branch on the CVS as wiki One of the current features that is working now is the possibility of having a WIKI course, meaning you can place a wiki page in the focuss of your course.

A descriptions of Wikis as located here on one of the the most popular wikis of all time: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki I am just getting ready to post an assignment (in my Moodle classroom)for the students in my Human Anatomy and Physiology course to create a wiki on the anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology of the skeletal and muscular systems. The project will be a group project but I will still be able to assess individual performance because the wiki application keeps track of all versions of the document and who made each revision. If you want to learn more about wikis, I recommend going to Wikipedia (an online encyclopedia that is in wiki format) and looking up a topic that you have significant expertise - if you see an error or a place to make an addition, just click the edit button and edit away! After doing that a few times you will become familiar with wikis -- they have their own formatting that is lest complicated that html. The wiki in Moodle is even easier to use because it includes a formatting toolbar so learning formatting tags is optional. To create a wiki in Moodle just add it as you would any other activity. If you are not familiar with how to add activities to Moodle classrooms, either find a practice Moodle classroom to play with (the best option) or ask someone.",

We thought that teachers are not programmers, we are used to the traditional two columns differences, but they not. We are developing grades in DFWiki, so we want new and more intuitive way to show teachers the contribution of every student in every wiki page. We thought that green highlighting of new words and red highlighting of deleted ones was most usefull for fast evaluation. Our objective is to use two column diff for admin. and new diff for grading.

What some of my colleagues had problems with in dfwiki (after having used the old wiki before) was the code view. If there are a lot of HTML tags, things can become a bit messy and comparing different versions of a wiki might become difficult. So I, for one, encourage you to continue developing the new diff view. If you are able to combine the two column view with WYSISYG that's good, too. I think it is a very good idea to maintain the two alternative viewing modes, though. People can choose what suits them best. Josep M.",

Unfortunately, I don't have a neat trick to transfer, but what I would have done with my wiki, had I needed to make it edit all, is this: In edit mode, during a time when my students are least likely to be on (usually during the day while I'm on prep), I would go back and forth between the two types and copy each group's page into the new \"edit all\" version.  It's a little on the tedious side, but not too bad if the group pages weren't \"deep,\" just long.  It gets a little more complicated if groups had internal pages in their pages, so I hope yours is as simple as mine was. In this case, my wiki was a class word bank of good words for poems.  I would then go into 2nd Hour's bank, copy it to my clipboard, go back to the main page, click the groups icon to \"no groups\" type in a new page [2nd Hour], save, click the question mark after 2nd Hour that would appear, and paste the old info into the new page.  Then I would click the groups icon back to visible groups, and I would repeat for 3rd Hour, 4th Hour, etc.  Although tedious, it wouldn't probably take more than ten to fifteen minutes for me to do all five of my classes.  Again, though, my classes only had one page per group.  If yours had multiple pages and went \"deep\" with their info, this could be a very tedious way to go, indeed. My solution is kind of low tech, but I don't know code, etc.  If your wiki is more complex, perhaps someone else out there knows a quicker fix? Best, Lesli",

          "Text": "Hi there, Im pasting here a list of issues in wich we have been working these days... The basic list comes from a large document Eloi provided us and we kept from there. Ludo ps. bernardino todoli is makin a hell of a job - SOLVED: There is a\nbug in the versions, so the upgrade from old wiki to new never happens. - There are a lot of tabs here and there.\nThey must be changed to 4 whitespaces each. Where? - There is no userid column in the wiki_pages table\n(author char-string instead). Thats like in the original wiki - The blocks structure isn't build over core blocks\ntables but over its own. Some records are harcoded in the blocks tables instead\nof allowing standard block installation/upgrade. I would create a bunch of wiki_xxxx\nstandard blocks instead, only usable under the wiki pages, of course. Also,\ntheir strings should be present in the propper files and some other details to\nbecome standard blocks. - wiki_synonymous table name is correct? (although\nit's possible that migation become painful, so we can change it in the\nfuture...). Yes, its correct - wiki_synonymous table hasn't pageid, is it needed?\nHow does it work? Just by pagename? Yes, with only the original entry (pagename)\nworks fine - Are pagenames sticky? Cannot they be renamed (moved\nin mediawiki language)? Yes, they\ncan be renamed. Thats at Administration Tools block in the update page xxx utility - The Wiki icon. I cannot see anything meaningful\nthere! (personal opinion, of course) It seems to become corrupt either after the migration process or CVS problem\nwith images - In the upgrade from wiki to dfwiki, as there aren't\nuserids, my wiki-pages were assigned to \"guest\". - SOLVED: When one page\nwith more than 1 version is retrived from DB, I get: Error: Turn\noff debugging to hide this error. SELECT * FROM\nmdl_wiki_pages WHERE pagename = 'One utf-8 page' AND dfwiki = '1' AND groupid =\n'0' LIMIT 100 Found more\nthan one record in get_record_ sql ! It seems to be\nrelated with the anonymous block executing one wrong get_record() call! - SOLVED: Exactly the\nsame error is showed with any of the 3 tabs (view, edit, history) - Some help files are mising (contributions...) Done. CVS updated - Some strings are mising (resultincontent...) Done. CVS updated - Search doesn't work for diacritics. And/or match is\nperformed with case matching (I think). - Search seems to work against titles and contents\nalways (no matter the checkbox was selected or no). Perhaps it's due to that\nusage of globals? Ah! After a\nsecond try I saw that such checkbox is to decide to show the details of the\nsearch in the body of the page. Perhaps the title should be changed to be a bit\nmore clear? Something like \"show results page\" and some sort of nice\nhelp... Ok - The text in some blocks (search, index from\ncurrent... doesn't wraps, so blocks get wider and wider). Done. A trim function is implemented already. - The useful \"who links here\" block isn't\navailable. - Adding a block always jump to module main page. It\nshould be retained. fixed - The wiki title in the breadcrumb should be linked to\nthe main page to be able to go there quickly. Done - Wiki backup and restore don't suppor individual activities ! - Wikies aren't included in the backup/restore at all! - PostgreSQL upgrade script isn't available! - UTF-8 migration always get user_main_language() and\nit should get page author language! Its done the same way as in the Forum\nmigration - There is one bar with one big \"dfwiki\"\ninside at the begining og each block. If it hasn't any use, it should go away. Fixed - In the wiki_pages table there is one\n\"dfwiki\" field. Should be \"wikiid\". Such name doesn't sound\nok. (although it's possible that migation become painful, so we can change it\nin the future...). - If the name of the page contains ' or \" or \\ it\ngets slashes when previewing. Also, < and > seem to be stripped and links\nare broken (because of quotes?). It works fine in my local version. More\ndetails are needed to fix the problem. - Page names containing ' produce this SQL errors\nbecause of un-slashed: You have an\nerror in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 's page' AND dfwiki = '1' LIMIT\n100' at line 1 SELECT *\nFROM mdl_wiki_synonymous WHERE syn = 'Helen's page' AND dfwiki = '1' LIMIT 100 You have an\nerror in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL\nserver version for the right syntax to use near 's page' AND dfwiki=1 AND\ngroupid=0 LIMIT 100' at line 3 SELECT MAX(version) AS maxim FROM\nmdl_wiki_pages WHERE pagename='Helen's page' AND dfwiki=1 AND groupid=0 LIMIT\n100 You have an\nerror in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL\nserver version for the right syntax to use near 's page' AND dfwiki = '1' AND\ngroupid = '0' LIMIT 1' at line 1 SELECT *\nFROM mdl_wiki_pages WHERE pagename = 'Helen's page' AND dfwiki = '1' AND\ngroupid = '0' LIMIT 1 It works fine in my local version. More\ndetails are needed to fix the problem. - dfwiki is inside a lot of places in code. It should\ngo out (although it's possible that migation become painful, so we can change\nit in the future...). Ok - globals, globals, globals usage should be out. Just\nrequest parameters filtered with xxxx_param() functions. Work in progress - Uses ob mb_xxxxx() functions. Fatal error: Call to\nundefined function mb_internal_encoding() in\nC:\\cvs_moodle\\moodle_head\\mod\\wiki\\blocks\\list_pages\\block_list_pages.php on\nline 145. Fixed.

Perhaps we could maintain the numbering for further reference (or send this to MoodleDocs too): There is no userid column in the wiki_pages table (author char-string instead). Must be supported in migration too. There is no intro and introformat in the wiki table. In the upgrade from wiki to dfwiki, as there aren't userids, my wiki-pages were assigned to \"guest\". Once more, userid seems to be critical. Wikis having different wiki_entries (group or user ones) have no support in new wiki (only one simultaneous line of versions is available?) so we get a lot of duplicate version errors with data-lost of such pedagogical feature! Or am I losing anything? With only groupid and version in the UK of the table, old student wikis can fit in the new one. Once more, userid! Search doesn't work for diacritics. And/or match is performed with case matching (I think). Search seems to work against titles and contents always (no matter the checkbox was selected or no). Perhaps it's due to that usage of globals? Ah! After a second try I saw that such checkbox is to decide to show the details of the search in the body of the page. Perhaps the title should be changed to be a bit more clear? Something like \"show results page\" and some sort of nice help... The useful \"who links here\" block isn't available. Wiki backup and restore don't suppor individual activities! Wikies aren't included in the backup/restore at all! Blocks system. Would be difficult to migrate to core block system? UTF-8 migration always get teacher_main_language() and it should get page author language! If we know the author responsible of the version, we must look for his original encoding instead of using the teacher one! Similar to forum_posts (if I'm nor wrong). And we should know the user: userid again! In the wiki_pages table there is one \"dfwiki\" field. Should be \"wikiid\". Such name doesn't sound ok. (although it's possible that migation become painful, so we can change it in the future...). dfwiki is inside a lot of places in code. It should go out (although it's possible that migation become painful, so we can change it in the future...). globals, globals, globals usage should be out. Just request parameters filtered with xxxx_param() functions. Attachment storage (as I've seen in the old-new migration script) seems to be a bit special with a lot of \"dfwikiXXXX\" dirs generated. The old-new migration script seems to be twice, once under the wikimigrate dir (the used one) and under the mod directory (unused?). Under my perspective, the lack of userid is really a big problem, because it's basic for all the system to have such info coded (migration, backup, utf-8, other functionalities...). Also related it's the lack of support for student-based wikis (I assume that you support course (or common) and group based wikis without problems, although I haven't tested it). The big conceptual difference between the old wiki and your great wiki is that the old one supported different lines of versioning (for each group or for each student we have versions 1,2,3...) while your alternative seems to lack this. Hope this helps, ciao P.D.: At home I've some changes pending to be sent, affecting point (2) above and adding some changes to the migration script (without changing anything but the style of database calls and support for (2) ). Obviously the problems related above about the old-new migration will remain until we have userid and student-based wikis in your module P.D.: Another thing that is lately rounding over my head is HOW all these changes over your wiki module will affect your dfwiki module. Does dfwiki module continue its own development? Is there only one module?",

The idea is -> new wiki stable stuff, dfwiki -> mad ideas for daredevils. You know I have lots of mad ideas Thanks again, ciao Ludo ps. If you come to barcelona this friday, you'll be able to see some members of dfwiki team featuring  hard rock songs live http://appserv.lsi.upc.es/palangana/moodle/course/view.php?id=12&edit=off",

They will first need to get up to speed on what has already been done and the standards that exist for that software, and then put their creative skills to work within those parameters. To be fair, I wouldn't say it is a problem only with DFWiki. I find a lot of non-standard modules in Moodle lack conformity with standard ones from the outset and lack the basics of a proper module. Things like an option to hide the module from the beginning for example or add its use to the logs, are lacking in a lot of contributed modules. A lot of people focus on what new things they can create without first building the foundation that will make their module work like a standard Moodle module. It might be worthwhile to put together a list and even code for must-have features in every module. In fact, that might be a worthwhile assignment for some students itself. Have them study the existing standard Moodle code to identify the commonalities between all modules and extract the relevant code to create a module template.",

When they start to master moodle programming and dfwiki I allo them to lay their hands on sensible stuff as new wiki.

I use wikis for everithing - content delivery - assigment inscription. students must gather in teams of 3-4 students, and choose a theme from a list , and choose when they want to make a presentation about it at class. All this is managed througth easyly within a wiki page. - the students write their papers in collaboration within the wiki, and the other students use it as studi material for exams - project management  simulation... students play a RPG developing together a ficticious project but with real meetings reports, planifications and so on... the game is thayed betwen the forum, the wiki and internalmail with copies active And how do you do it?

Students upload questions in dfwiki, I import them to the quizz module. * To supervise research work of Phd students (all the group could read and make suggestions. we use a color code to know who made the changes) ....and each day I found a new aplication to this tool",

I did not experience the problem in another source or activity. This is what I wrote in the forum mentioned above: In a testing environment with a very recent 1.5.3+ version as well as 1.6 beta3, both with the latest dfwiki (that is called wiki now, version 2006042001 ) and using the standard theme I still have this problem with IE6 and also with IE7 beta2. Firefox gives no problems but my students only can use IE6 at school. I hope this nasty problem is solved very soon within Moodle. I don't think that Microsoft is willing to change IE for it.

Again refreshing the page helps sometimes and sometimes doesn't (but if working it shows the huger 900px textarea).

The problem is that I have already created a wiki and I cannot change the name for the first page that was given by default. What you suggest (again, if I have understood you correctly) wouldn't really help because, while it would perhaps solve the problem for this particular wiki, it could create worse problems in the future if I forget again to change the default name for the first page. The name I want to give to the first page in this particular wiki I'm working on is too specific to be the default name for all future pages. You see what I mean? The logical solution is to allow users to change the name of the first page after some content has already been introduced in the wiki. By the way, were you already in Barcelona?

It converted my wikipages very well. After that I deleted my old wiki (erfurt standard 1.5) using the administrative section as well as via ftp . I think the next version was installed directly in /mod/wiki and I did this too. But from now on I had two dfwikis in my activities section. Today I installed the new Version into /mod/wiki and deleted /mod/dfwiki but nothing worked anymore. Now I restored the directory and I can use it again. The Standard Wiki is no longer available in my Administrative section. My questions are now: 1) How can I use only the actual dfwiki-version as standard wiki (1.5.3)? 2) How can I see on which version my wiki is based? 3) How can I make it, that all wikis use dfwiki in /mod/wiki and not /mod/dfwiki? 4) If 3 is not possible. How can I mark the older version in the pulldown menu? 5) How to make the installation in /mod/wiki visible in Administrative section again? It would be so nice if I could get this running again ...

The professor creates an assignment activity the way now it is created but instead of the regular editor, the student gets the wiki to write her online assignment. The teacher can add comments to the space available for that, but she can also edit the wiki. More importantly, the teacher can decide that other users, teachers or groups can also have access to that particular wiki assignment and edit it as well. Would something like this be possible with your contribution. I can see this as being very useful, at least for us. See, Wikis are very useful, but what I find missing in the Wiki module as it is now is a space for the teacher to add comments. You don't want to insert the comments in the middle of the wiki itself, but some times you want to add comments or notes explaining why you have added or changed something. Inserting the Wiki in the Assignment module would be a way to get that functionality. The other is adding a comment and grading functionalities to the Wiki module. What do you think. Josep M.",

This is a short list of what's to come: * a-la mediawiki discussion pages * pdf printing and html/opendoc export along with wikibook * new improved diff features * complete grading * major/minor edit swich * page voting * new edit modes (specially for those who teach programming languages ) * better atached files management * edit mode speciall blocks And last but not least wikipodcasting : text2speech and podcast your wiki pages.",

          "Text": "Thanks so much for the work you guys are putting into this, it's much appreciated. It's come a long way in the past few months. But, please, before you move on with new features, can you concentrate on finishing the existing ones so we can use it in Moodle to replace the existing Wiki? In particular I noticed the following problems in the code base after a quick look on test.moodle.com after the party: use of local global variables in practically every function (eg global $CFG,$cm,$course,$dfwiki,$page,$id,$pagedata,$pagename,$pageaction,$dfperms,$wikieditable,$dfform,$editor,$groupmember,$modname;). Basically the only globals should be $CFG, the rest you should pass to the functions (it's part of good design). a lot of times data is read from the database and written straight back in without addslashes(), causing problems on data with 'apostrophes'.  I checked in some quick fixes for this but it needs to be looked at systematically. overuse of get_records_ sql () and execute_sql () everywhere which means you need to write SQL everywhere. Please use get_records (), update_records () etc instead, I think you can replace over 90% of your SQL calls and we will get shorter, safer, more portable code. lots of output like this: echo 'no s'han pogut actualitzar els hits'; which should firstly use strings from lang page and secondly, use notify (), notice () or error () functions as appropriate. dfwikilib.php should be locallib.php to fit in with mod conventions. Don't use ipatlas, use /iplookup/index.php?ip=xx&user=xx Try to use lib/weblib.php instead or hardcoded XHTML for menus, boxes, tables etc. If you do specify HTML, make sure it's XHTML-compliant. Don't use hardcoded styles and HTML style parameters, make CSS classes and put default styling in styles.php within mod/quiz and each block as necessary. When developing, make sure you have $CFG->debug turned on to catch more errors. Please take these as constructive tips. I think this module has a lot of promise. I like the simple user interface and I REALLY want to see it replace Moodle's current wiki module.",

However, it seems to reproduce an old deficiency I also find in the current wiki module - insufficient support for mixing of alphabets, esepcially Cyrillic. Wikis in general seem to be upset by users writing page titles in other alphabets, and this one didn't recognize CamelCase at all when in Cyrillic. In the text's body I also mixed Cyrillic with other alphabets from my keyboard (German and English) and found that either the Cyrillic, or the rest of them do not display correctly, depending on which character set was chosen in the browser. I used Firefox 1.5.0.1 and the HTML editor mode in the wiki itself. As wikis are an excellent educational ressource (esepcially since they started having HTML editors incorporated in them and learning curve is even shallower for any MS Word user), it would be great to see them as truly international as the rest of the modules. Thanks a lot for addressing this and looking forward to see the (old or new) wiki fully at work Best regards, Kremena",

Even if I change the theme it shows me the old pages. The only thing that helps is CTRL+F5 (not only F5). I tried a lot of things in IE as well as I installed the last nightly built, but nothing helps. I tried it on several machines with the same results. Using Firefox is no Problem.

The problem might be that you (maybe?) would have to dive deep into the inner structure and architecture of moodle itself. The advantage could(?) be that it would be a solution valid for all parts of moodle. I would dream of something like \".. and here you see my source code §§format(sourcecode) int i[100]; ..... §§format \" or something similar. (There would be a textfilter with syntaxhighlighting, references to a glossar0 (what is 'int'), all this configurable, there could be other options for special area in chemics, physics, .....) only an idea - don't know if this could be possible.

But anyway the wiki parser will get the [brackets] as a link syntax. Another way is to use a cool code editor like eclipse or netbeans that has the html print capabilitie, then you paste the cool html into a HTML editor page. The results are great but you'll have the sameproblem with [brackets]... The solution I use is to give the code as atachments. Combining option 1 (spaces in the beginning of lines ) and option 2 you sholud be able to work it out util I release a code plugin for wiki... Regards Ludo",

          "Text": "Hi, some students called my attention about a problem (and big frustration) they are experiencing when trying to edit a wiki (I'm using dfwiki). Before presenting the problem, let me say that it seems clear to me (although perhaps I'm wrong) that the source of the problem is not the dfwiki module itself but rather the HTML editor. However, I would like to say that in order to make the dfwiki module a really successful module, a solid, full featured and friendly HTML editor should be included in it. The dfwiki editor is very good but certain kinds of users will never go for it. The current HTML editor in Moodle is also very good to do little things like posting a message in a forum with a little extra formatting but shows its limitations when it is used in more involved tasks with longish documents and more complex formatting. If dfwiki is going to be used extensively for collaborative work with complex documents, I think we should perhaps start thinking about doing something to improve the default HTML editor. I don't want to complicate the lifes of Ludo and the members of his team because I know they are working very hard. But there are enough problems being reported with the current HTML editor to grant some attention is devoted to this issue. OK, having said this, here's the problem. In the edit screen you see the following: -------------------- But after saving the document, you see the following: So, is this a problem with the HTML editor or is it a problem with the integration of the HTML editor in dfwiki? At any rate, could anybody help me solve the problem? These students are telling me they don't want to work with wikis anymore because it is too frustrating and I don't want to have to do that.

It appeared from our testing that setting up a wiki to have separate groups kept everyone except group members out of the wiki (including the teacher). In other moodle assignments an instructor is not limited by enabling grouping - which is why you do not put a teacher in a group! 2. Visible groups enabled all others to see other groups' wikis, but also appeared to give them editing priviledges in another groups' wiki. What are the plans for updating dfwiki group features to enable a teacher to be able to view and edit all wikis and to keep the visible group features supported so that if visible groups are used, students can view (but not edit) another group's wiki. We like the group features that were supported in efurt wiki in moodle and would like to see the same type of support (including individual student wikis as has been mentioned in other forum posts). Again - I love dfwiki but the support of groups at this point does not seem to be fully implemented yet - do you have a timeline on any of this - or is there a new version that has been released that addresses some of these issues? We are using dfwiki in our courses now and can not just upload a new version each time it comes out without testing first ....",

I am now using dfwiki in our production site (it works wonderfully so far) and I find that I would like to do the following. When I create a wiki in group mode (one wiki for each separate group), I would like to have some prepared content before the students start to work so that the students can work on it and improve it. This is possible when you are not in group mode but if you activate the group mode, whenever the members of different groups start editing the wiki, they see a blank page. This was like this in the old wiki, but I wonder whether it would be possible to allow the teacher to create a wiki with some prepared material and have it be visible for all the groups. Now the way to do it is to access the course as a student of each one of the different groups and introduce the content in the wiki. If you have many groups, needless to say, it is a pain in the butt. Josep M.",

          "Text": "I am experiencing problems when users attempt to login to edit a wiki page.  The scenario is as follows: Users visit the wiki page with guest login access. The page instructs them to use login link in footer to edit page. They login and are returned to the page, but login status is still set to guest and the wiki page doesn't display edit tab. They navigate to other pages of the wiki or anywhere on the site and login status shows that they are logged in. They navigate to the page they want to edit through the wiki site map and login status shows they are logged in. This doesn't occur on the users first visit to the page but on all subsequent visits to the site. Refresh (F5) of the page does not change login status In addition, the opposite effect occurs if the user logs out and revisits the page without closing the browser: User visits the page logged in Logs out Navigates to the page with guest login access When the page is displayed, user login status is logged in to their account User had edit tabs for the page Navigating to the page through the wiki sitemap results in guest login status & no edit tabs A sample wiki page that is having this problem is http://www.wels.net/university/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=469 or http://www.wels.net/university/moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id=469&page=group (link from sitemap) I have observed this behavior using both IE & Firefox browsers.

For this reason I have removed the wiki folder and the 3 MySQL wiki-tables : mdl_wiki, mdl_wiki_entries, mdl_wiki_pages. Then I have installed a new wiki module from the 21. January built. This module is working now, but there is the \"internal server error\". Unfortunately I have no root access to my moodle server, because I'm only a small vhost on a big unix mainframe.

If you create a text file and upload it to the course files area this can be used to seed your Wiki's initial page by using the \" Choose an Initial Page\" setting. Tips: The name of the file you use file you create will create the name of the initial page in the Wiki (you can delete the .txt extension). The file name must be in CamelCase format. This is a once only operation i.e. you cannot change your mind about the use of this feature after the Wiki is created. Create a folder in the course files area and put the initial page file in there or all files in the main course files area will show as pages when you select options from the \"Choose Wiki Links\" drop down menu.

We have a project\nwhere it is necessary that all people participating in the creation of\nmaterials can keep track of the codes and names given to documents that\nare created by other members of the team. This is necessary because we\nwant to build some sort of database with information about the\ndocuments and the documents must have a unique code number. People who\ncreate new documents must know whether the code already exists for a\nparticular document and assign a higher number if this is the case. Excel files work very well for this purpose but the great inconvenience\nis that one must download them and upload them again once they are\nmodified. Since there might be many people working at the same time\nthat might be a problem. I thought that creating a table on a Wiki\ncould be a good solution. And here is the reason for my question. Every\nonce in a while we would like to export the data in the table to be\nable to feed it into an excel file or perhaps some data base aplication\nbut I don't know whether this is possible with a Wiki. Does anybody know the answer to this question? If this is not possible,\ndoes anybody know of some possible solution to this problem? Thanks very much. Josep M.",

I upgraded to the recent version of dfWiki I exported my current wiki pages (no history) I loaded up the new server and imported that the import seemed to work fine -  all the pages were there. Two problems remained, however: formatting - pages created with the wysiwyg viewer lost the carraige returns between lines so all the text runs together. (~1000 pages - yikes!) Performance - each page takes 30sec to load now. The performance issue is the real drawback - the site is very hard to study from now. Has anyone else had similar issues? any idea how to fix this?  I had originally imported the whole wiki with all the historical versions of all the pages - then, thinking that was the source of the slowdown, i recreated the wiki using just the latest version of each page - but still have the same problem. thanks for any help you can offer! -jon",

I have slash arguments disabled in my site, since my hosting provider has it disabled in apache and does not allow overrides. (EDIT: I've just seen a bug in wiki has been corrected in the last days. I'll check that). Second problem deals with international chars. I have no trouble with putting wiki links with accented chars in moodle 1.4.x in my local server , but the exported wiki does not work in moodle 1.5.x in my hosting provider. I think it deals with url charset, but I can't find a way to make moodle unaccent every wiki link (i.e. I know wikipages with accented names will be inaccesible, but other users of this wiki could forget about it).",

Imho, the dfwiki is now ready-to-use - it comes with a pretty-simple interface and a number of editors, including their own editor and std. html-editor of moodle.

For example any table settings imported simply collapse. Using tables to create charts and simple forms is an excellent way of sharing student attainment amongst tutors and the student concerned.

Most of the groups prepopulated OK, but some (who logged on for the first time yesterday) found that the prepopulation had not worked - they just got an empty page. Today I've been trying to add the template content into the pages they edited yesterday. (It's just a table containing heading and empty bullet points.) When I save it the document appears to have been cut in half and reordered. The \"Thank you for your contribution\" occurs half-way down the page with the top half of the document below it. The rest of the document comes above the \"Thank you..\" message. When I go to edit again, a number of tags have been added, similarly to Bug 3721 ( http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3721 ), but I'm using version 1.5.3+ not 1.6 [Edit: just noticed that the break is happening just above the \"referring links\" text. Anything from then on, until halfway down the document is going to the bottom of the page. The split then happens just above a set of bullet points]",

The common conception of a wiki is something that is open to anyone editing it. However, I'm wondering about the applicability of using a wiki to collaborate on a co-authored academic publication. I've talked to two different colleagues (individually) in the past about the possibility of collaborating on a book on a particular topic that each of us has certain strengths related to it and also differing access to useful sources. Currently, we are in three different countriess (US, Egypt, and Australia) and so we face not only physical distance but also timezone distance so synchronous collaborative activity seems prohibitive. I'm pondering the idea of writing the book using a wiki, even perhaps setting up a special Moodle course to do it. Does anyone know if this has been done before in the academic world? Does anyone know of any wiki-authoring guidelines (I'm not talking about technical ones, more the writing process) available that would be applicable to such a situation? Any ideas on this idea?",

          "Text": "I strongly believe that the wiki model is the best one for collaborative authoring of texts of any kind. I agree, there are two approaches for writing together with ICT: The workflow format, better in control of the process, worse in supporting the creativity flows in a collab. The wiki format: the ultime free format tool. Most of the supporting tools of Wiki are there to prevent that it becomes a mess. So if you choose a wiki: You must set rules how to use it together: for example in the past I was moving a text from page 3 to page 5 in collab project, and everytime it went back to the old page.. Until I got a message from the famous Alan Kay that he was the other person, moving the text from page 5 to page 3.. We settled it in our emails, I forgot the solution, so he won? ) I use for years a privat wiki (Swiki) to store al my snippets in a Wiki, for example (see picture) Moodle things I find in the forums. When you start a project you hardly know how the end-result will look like, so it is very important that you can reorganise the pages AND the page names before your final book will crystalize in your wiki. In the example I wrote Moodle 1.3, but Janne's CMS is for 1.5, so I should AND CAN change the title of the page in this Swiki. I hope dfWiki wil get - or already has ? this option Another nice option in the Swiki is the easy way I can lock the pages page by page (as writers) but still can allow other people to add comments on the closed pages: the visitor can fill the commentbox and I get an email. You can divide the pages by simply putting different emailadresses in the edit forms of different pages: the person with the email on that page will receive the messages on that page. When your book gets structure, you can decide who will work on (the comments) of which chapter / subject. If you need a form on some page - in Swiki - you can design a form in your webbrowser and publish that for the visitor (or yourself With forms you can force more page structure, the pages are stored as XML , so the form-pages are easier to harvest. You even can design the form pages in edit-view and view-view with additional html or so, so the form stays not that abstarcat when you fill it.) In the new version of Swiki you even can past a calendar page and hang \"yellow\" wiki pages behind every date. Swiki is a standalone mini- server . I can install and start to use it in less then 30 seconds and if I get a faster laptop I will improve that record. (Before we had Moodle we used it with secondary school children - for example to write their own guide for the visit to Rome. Soem teachers still combine it with Moodle.) If dfWiki will get all these options, I will prefer dfWiki: for advanced users it offers much more support. When I want to close a wiki for a group, but still wish to allow not-moodle-users (I hardly can imagine that these people exist) to access the pages AND FILL the comment boxes, then dfWiki must support the guest account for that purpose. (Maybe that is already built in, I did not look for dfWiki for several weeks or so.)",

I have access to the normal Moodle blocks around the course, but loose the dfWiki blocks. (Can I have both?) I can place a student (or teacher) dfWiki in the social activity box on the left, so students can start their dfWiki there.. If I create several student(group) dfWiki's there, is it possible to export one of these studentgroup dfWiki's and import them as a full functioning dfWiki to the central dfWiki.

Right now the only diference betwen a student and teacher dfwiki aree the permisions. The main course dfwiki is implemented throug a hidden dfwiki and the teacher can change its atributes and permisions. >I have access to the normal Moodle blocks around the course, but loose >the dfWiki blocks . > (Can I have both?) Same question I asked to the programmers but seems to be problems with the import php directive. Unfortunatelly the blocks will have to be recoded as dfwiki course blocks. We could start a quizz: Wich dfw modules you think are most usefull for a dfwiki-course ? So we could start rigth on it. Anyway you can allways enter into the hidden ( wich can be unhidden) dfwiki and use the dfwiki as one. One idea would be : to allow many dfwiki frames into the main window (as in the theme format) and assign a wiki (dfwiki wiki and page) to each one. so the teacher would be able to higlight some wiki pages simply by selecting them. I'll give to it some thougth ... This implies that we need context dfwiki links (as in mediawiki ) so we can make wiki links like courseid:dfwikiname:pagename or dfwikiname:pagename ... so we could implement multi-language dfwikis... for instance.

We think Moodle would be probably best platform to our environment and we are starting our own development work. We are very interested about Wiki and its development like dfWiki. In dfwiki there seems to be some very interested features. Wikiexport is important feature to our project. So, I am asking your help in following questions: 1) When exporting Wikipages, is it possible to include ALL links in Wiki? We have tested Moodle's current Erfurt Wiki, and there is a problem because you can only import \"downward\" links. Referring links (breadcrumb trails) are not included when we have tested wikiexport. So if you look your exported wikipages in browser, you can go from one wikipage to another, but you cannot come back via wiki's links. 2) It would be useful to export wikis to pdf- or rtf. Is anyone developing solutions to this? 3) When exporting wikipages to html/pdf/rtf, it would be also useful to replace Wiki's CamelLetters with normal text. Is there solutions to this? TIA ,",

In dfwiki we have the import / export feature and the backup/restore feature wich integrates into the moodle backup system. I prefer the import export feature because it allows me to replicate wiki contets to any course or moodle installation. In the next two weeks we'll release a new dfwiki feature that will allow us to import data from old efurtwikis to dfwiki (extracting it from the moodle backup files). PDF and XHTML export is scheduled for next month. If you use dfwiki in html editor or dfwiki editor mode you don't need to use CamelCase, you simply use double brackets for links . Regards Marc",

Secondly I tried \"Q - Input & Output devices' and it did the same. Thirdly, when I typed in my first text it would not allow me to put [ or ] around numbers as I needed to - they did not appear, instead a '?' appeared in plase of them.

In order to test a new separate group course, I am logging in under multiple user accounts, my teacher (I am also admin) account plus several fictional student accounts -- made-up names with real yet unique email accounts. I have tried this using both single instances of IE , and multiple instances, each with unique account. One of my wiki resources is set up so the teacher can read/write, students read-only. I find it a great place to create teacher \"space\" for structured resources. When I log in as a fictional student, I can read wiki entrys. If I attempt to edit them as the fictional student, the edit tab disappears, as expected, I think. When I log out as the fictional student, and log in as me again, the teacher, I cannot edit any wiki entries that were tested by the fictional student -- the student is shown as still logged in for the pages in question. However, I am showed as logged in for other wiki pages untouched by the student. I am using Internet Explorer on the same computer for each session. I closed all instances of IE, and tried again. No luck, the student is still logged in. I repeated the experiment with Mozilla Firebird and was successful -- the student was not logged in. However, when I again repeated the test with IE, the student was still logged in. I restarted my computer, suspecting something \"sticky\" with IE, but restarting did not solve the problem, the student was still logged in. Does anyone know what is happening here? How do I clear the \"sticky\" student login? -Ron",

Have you enabled 'debug' mode in your Moodle (configuration/variables/debug). If not, the warning should not appear and mess with your headers. If debug has been set to 'No' and you still get the warning, you can remove it by adding an error control operator (@): \n```text\n  if (@is_executable( ...\n```\n Regards, Jarkko.",

It was in the days that most of us assumed that good education was all about feeding the students on the right time with the right knowledge (sometimes even piece by piece: like in programmed instruction). Then check it with tests and Word-assignments and show them the way to other resources. The first VLE's showed also that face on the early internet. Typical parts in these days: resources, weblinks, quiz, faq, glossary, guided instruction (AICC) Around 1997 the next generation VLE's came up: websites combining the presentation of information with tools to support the communication about these (new) artefacts: forum,  *) chat, poll, shared workspace, It could help the individual student to sharpen his individual thoughts by comparing them with the expressed thoughts of himself and others in the forums or by sharing collected (and self created) artefacts. Moodle was born in this era, focusing on forums and missing in the beginning the shared workspace. With Wikis (popularity starts around 2000) you introduce a new kind of tools: it offers the opportunity to construct - in a loosy way **) - together with other students a new knowledge artefact while the teacher can monitor the ongoing work (and give on-line helpfull cues). Without the wiki the collaboration is happening outside the view of the helpfull teacher: they get an asssignment, construct something in Word and deliver that after several weeks as their masterpiece: difficult to help them during these three weeks and give feedback on their learning process if you only can see the final product. The last innovation is that the focus is more and more shifting from teachers to students: Give students tools so they can monitor (and steer!) their own learning process. (MoodleFN, the project templates and our own humble checkmark-graph, visible in my personal icon are such attempts, I hope Martin spends some time on it.) Giving students access to the tools for creating the education artefacts in a course: students as constructors: glossary, wiki, (So when can we give students AS CONSTRUCTORS access to all these beautiful teachertools like book, multipage, quizz, lesson , (shared) journals, etc... WITHOUT LOOSING THE PRIVACY RESPECTING MONITOR FUNCTION for the professional teacher/coach. Can't we create a mechanism like in the wiki: teacher class group student access under the same button and combine this witha better filtering on the edit-fields, also wished for non-expert teachers as editors...) I disagree with the well meant attempts to limit the teacher in his choices. ***) Why not allow them to add all kind of tools inside a wiki? OR...why not allow them to add all kind of tools in the sidebar of a central forum? Wasn't that the original thought behind the social format? If you want to help the teacher with his design choices, then a growing set of templates would help more then restricting possibilities. *) Social Constructivism is not the inventor of this forum-idea: I found the idea in a book from 1962 by A.D. de Groot (founder of the Dutch Curriculem Institue and famous writer of \"(Misconseptions about) The thinking of the chessplayer\". The book is called Methodology, foundations for research and thinking in the Social Sciences. In this book the author explains that after constructing your artefact you \"as little scientist\" go back to the forum for checking your idea/theory/idola against the thinking of the \"ruling\" community.. **) In the past the Computer Industry was trying hard to build very restrictiv tools to collect and store Knowledge (AI), what never worked in educational settings. ***) Do you remember the early discussions abaout the wish to have a Wiki in Moodle? Now we have two",

He created the patch and then left. Then I was asked if this was still going to be a problem when we started to use ja_utf8 and I did not know how to answer. But after having spent a lot of time upgrading my sites to UTF8 I find that the garbling (mojibake) problems are still pretty much as they were. The Wiki still garbles in places as before The Excel files need to be downloaded in Shift JIS format. I think that GD and the graphs it produces still garbles The mails sent out by moodle are almost okay for many mail software but more primitive mail software (such as that of mobile phones and the mail software used at my university to avoid all the virus problems inherent in Outlook Express) only deals with JSIS or the ISO xyz format, especially in the subject sender, and adressee header fields. Even (?) outlook express cannot deal with UTF in the sender field. By the way does SJIS go under another ISO xyz name? Meanwhile Narumi Sekiya has created a block to allow moodle to send out abreviated mail in ISO xyz format to mobile phones. And the Japanese forums abound with people having problems with garbling related to the above issues. I think that if Mr. Kashiwagi were to return, or someone of his expertises (e.g. Mr. Kagotani from Okayama Uni?) then another patch for 1.5 could be created, but basically there are problems with garbling here in Japan. SJIS is naff but a standard. Untill mail software, mobile phones, GD image processing libraries and the spreadsheet software we are using becomes UFT8 friendly then I think that the old SJIS format needs to be used?? But I am not sure. I also think that DFwiki has a lot of future since 1) I hear that the developer of this wiki is not around, much. 2) It uses a more popular wiki style (that of wikipedia) 3) It is being actively developed. I hear that there are or were some problems (fewer but some) with DFwiki as well but I pray that these may be solved. As co-faciliator of the Japanese Moodle community I feel that I am letting everyone down by not conveying the problems adequately. If anyone wants to contact me in Japanese to tell me what I should be telling the developers, and what bugs I should be posting then please mail me (tim at nihonbunka dot com) Timothy",

I understand the standard bundled version of Wiki module is based on ErfurtWiki. While, many recent (and promissing) messages in this forum refer to \"dfwiki\". My conclusion was the two are not the same thing, and that there are two wiki modules being developed in parallel. Is that right? If yes, my questions would be: What is the general orientation for future bundling, which one will become standard? Which one is currently more indicated (stable, scalable, etc.) for production installations? Thank you in advance for your kind answer. Regards.",

In its due time Martin will have to decide if he wants dfwiki to become the official moodel wiki ( we hope so ). But before we bring this issue, dfwiki has to reach two specific requirements that martin asked: * import capability from the old ewiki. * backup / restore I believe the other requirements are allready accomplished. However, rigth now dfwiki is pretty stable, and if you want to use it within your moodle 1.5 server you only have to download , copy the files and add the activity to your courses. Cheers Ludo",

What would be the loading issues with such a large group of students?  They wouldn't be all using it at the same time but it would be useful if up to a third of them could use it all at one time.  Is anyone else using the wiki with such a large group? BTW I heard a radio 4 program here in the UK the other day, a founding member of the excite search engine (remember that?) was waxing lyrical about his new venture:  selling wikis to corporations as collaborative tools.  He put forward a good argument as to why they are going to be important in the future so I think its really important to introduce students to the concept in their education.

To actually enter teh text you need a syntax, codes to say to the computer \"this is a link\", \"this is bold\". There are several wiki-syntaxes. Moodle offers several, Markdown is one. But you can use the regular HTML editor with Moodle wikis if you like.  So, the key point about wikis is that  they are user-editable, the wiki syntax is a minor point, an optional one. - Enrique -",

Sidenote: The correct term is \"mark down\". \"Question 2: Are the settings above correct for my plan?\" They were correct. The confution occured probably because the type of the course \"visible groups\" was set _after_ the wiki was created. \"Question 3: I want to do a clean-up since the students and teachers are lost in the Wiki jungle sad I though of exporting the Wikis, delete them, recreate and add the text. Since there are only 14 students affordable. Is there a better way of doing this?\" May be. But I didn't want to take any chances: - exported each student's wiki - deactivated the old wiki - created a new one - added the old text manually to each student's wiki For a class of 15 that was OK. It had the pleasent side effect, that I could clean some horrible mark up generated by MS Word cut-and-pasted to WYSISWYG editor. \"Question 4: It is planned to give the students _another_ Wiki to work in groups of two. The students are supposed to find a parner. What is the best way of doing this? For example, can they register the groups themselves?\" Created a \"group wiki\" (after I have set the course type).

Trying to look at the source of the pages that generated that page, I realized that those tricks were not being inserted by ewiki but by the HTML editor. This is a potential source of trouble. For instance, to include an image, some users will use the ewiki syntax [image URL ] while others will insert it directly with the HTML editor in a form that is not the standard ewiki method and which will be very hard to parse by wiki-to-something parsers (they are actually inserting HTML code directly, which is a feature of ewiki, but in a hidden form that goes against the simplicity of other wikis). On the other hand you can see in the SandBox that users waste a lot of time playing with fancy tricks in the HTML editor, rather than writting content without worrying about format. I propose that the use of the HTML editor be forbidden in the Wiki module, even for those users that select it as default.",

I suppose it could be incorporated … If you use the 'No HTML' setting for the wikis, it won't use the HTML editor, but most of the HTML tags Moodle uses can still be coded manually into the text and they will work. This probably means that the Markdown format would mostly work anyway. But, wikis are really meant to be used with wiki format. You could always use the 'wiki-like' format in the other activities. It should be the same for formatting - just won't have wiki links. mike",

          "Text": "As far as I understand it, the wiki-like format is actually quite different from the wiki format (as in your wiki module). The issue arose because I realised that when my students were using the moodle auto-format to build a glossary, which I use a lot (I teach French for Science and Technology...), exporting the glossary was a nightmare as the XML file did not include paragraph tags. The markdown format looks very appealing, and can be used in most moodle activities. I don't think that my students will have any problem learning it. And no more need to type in html tags, which really slows down the writing. So I am thinking of pushing them to use the markdown format almost everywhere. But then, when it comes to the wikis, this means having to learn a new format again. Mind you, it may not be a huge problem, but it could be a bit confusing, if not overwhelming for first year students (although the students come to me to learn French, they come out of my course fluent in html, wiki and markdown...). Perhaps the solution would be to replace the wiki-like format by the proper wiki format in all activities... In any case, this will be an on-going issue in our place... It will be interesting to see which format the whole university adopts for communicating via moodle. Françoise",

Of course, it would be useful if this were an option in the settings of each wiki activity, so that a teacher may decide on the appropriate time frame, depending on what the learners are supposed to accomplish through the wiki. And to make sure that one doesn't \"miss\" the check-in time, we could maybe have a timer similar to the one in the quiz module; and some kind of reminder before the time is up would be nice, too Oh well, my wish list is getting longer and longer...

A second question: if a wiki page is created using ewiki markup (i.e. no HTML editor so no html markup in the first place), it seems to ignore blank lines when there should be paragraph breaks.  I can force a line break with \"%%%\", or insert a <_p>, but of course this defeats the purpose of wiki markup.  Have I missed a setting? I'm using the wiki module that ships standard with Moodle 1.4.2+(2004083129). If it matters, I have the TeX, algebra, wiki autolinking,and glossary auto-linking filters on. Thanks for any insight.

I agree that ewiki is the easiest full featured wiki engine to be integrated into moodle or any other php application (not tikiwiki, I know . However there are plans for splitting tikiwki features into modules (similar to phpnuke'd websites), and also there is tiki-light (which is a wiki and a very little else, afaik). This might make easier to adapt the wiki from Tiki to any other program. Well, if the person which is studying the kind-of-integration of Tiki and moodle succedds (who knows , you'll hear again about it.

Regardless of what underlying wiki engine is used for the module, I think a very important consideration is how well it integrates into the Moodle user interface.

The other wikis mentioned have some positive things going for them (also negative such as TikiWiki \"kitchen sink\" overkill) but are pretty set on their way of doing things. Mike's done great work in adapting ewiki to integrate into Moodle that I don't think can be easily done with many other wiki engines without looking like \"hanging furry dice on a Mercedes car mirror\".

No sign of the pages themselves or their\nhistories. I can't understand how this could happen. There were over a hundred pages on it. With a whole terms' work. I looked at the database and yes, the pages are there in that table - over one thousand. I\nwouldn't be able to re-create it without getting some technical help in so I'm\nhoping that instead, the hosting service will be able to help out and restore to last night's version. If I\ndo use the database, should I re-install moodle and link to that\ndatabase, or should I just re-create the whole wiki? And if I do, will\nI have to manually re-create each page, with all its versions? The students are due to hand in this wiki next Monday. I know this sounds crazy but we didn't do anything out of the ordinary,\nI've no idea how it just disappeared. If you'd like to have a look at\nthe wiki in the site, feel free to mail me and I'll set you up an\naccount. You'll see all the logs of the work on all the pages and that\nit's just not there now.

Mike, I've given you access via email.

It had to be one that they could all edit as they had\noverlapping topics. I'm still waiting to hear from the hosting service to see if they can wipe out yesterday's activity from the database's memory. As I said, I need a quick fix as the class are handing in on Monday. Peter, when you lost material was it a similar thing of checking page versions? Some of the pages in this were quite long but there was really no complex tables - just images. It was is an informative document designed by a group of undergraduate students so I wouldn't have thought it would test the limits of the software, by any means. Thanks again, Sinéad",

In that case, you would not be able to look at the other pages. I'll try and break my test version again, but I can't see any reason why viewing older versions would do this.

To do this use the wiki link '[]' feature. Anything enclosed in square brackets in a wiki becomes a wiki link. Furthermore, if you have a '|' character separating text and a wiki page, the text appears as the link for the named page. So, you could put ' [Raum34|ElberfeldRaum34]' in your wiki, and the text 'Raum34' would be hyperlinked to the wiki page 'ElberfeldRaum34'. mike",

You might contact him and see if he has a new version 1.4 coming out and could he send you an early draft. To explain wiki to other teachers and students, I simply call it a \"group document\". In other words, a group of people can individually edit and re-edit the content. 4. New modules (such as Form, blog , etc.) under development are mostly available in the nightly build of Moodle version 1.5dev. If you have a separate server which you reserve exclusively for experimenting, then you can go to Downloads and try this one. It is unstable, which is why they are not available for general download yet. A few modules which have been under development for a while and are fairly stable (Book, Hotpot, Questionnaire) are available for special download under Add-on Modules in the Download section. By the way, I have another question about wikis. If two or more people edit a wiki at the same time and then save it about the same time, what happens? Which version gets saved?",

This means when I ask for evaluation comments at the end of my face-to-face class, I should not use a wiki. I should use a forum (with setting to one-person/one-comment).

When we mouseover the link, it becomes underlined and looks like a link, but clicking on it does nothing. 2. When we try to upload files, much of the time, but not always, we get an error message telling us the file format is not acceptable. This happens for all sorts of files that were fine until we upgraded. All of this this is taking place only in the Wiki module and with a variety of Mozilla-based and IE -based browsers.

When the page is presented it is truncated ( BTW , in the HTML editor itself I do see the end of the document, but it is not rendered when displayed). This is an issue of the HTML editor, it happens in wiki module, but also in resources. Although using pure HTML text may be useful for a teacher-created resource, it is not a good idea for a wiki. My students (first year at university) cannot edit HTML source. I have solved the problem just breaking the long document into parts, and using each as a separate wiki page. The initial page has the index to access the rest. This approach has other benefits: It is the way the Web should be: small pieces linked together, not a single \"monolithic\" page. It is possible to control access permissions to individual pages. For instance, I have setup index page as Read-Only so students cannot change it. Hope that helps, - Enrique Castro -",

I use \"Safe HTML\" in my Wiki, since I don't want my pupils to mess around with the layout too much. Any ideas, someone??? Thanks a lot. Stefaan",

          "Text": "I agree with the non-default option. Absolutely, it should definitely be a choice if it gets added at all. I'm not sure how well a public wiki meshes with the overall philosophy of Moodle. As Martin noted, our situation is something of a special case. It may not be worth it if it adds a lot of complexity; installing Mediawiki isn't hard to do if someone really needs a public wiki (especially since anyone running Moodle already has PHP and a database installed anyway ) On the other hand, if you can add the option without much trouble I think it would be useful for some. Several of the people associated with my program (including me) really hate the fact that so much student work winds up as essentially wasted effort. The student hands in the paper, the teacher grades it, then no one ever sees it again. Having it locked behind a login wall is almost as bad. A public wiki not only puts the work out for the general public, but also makes it possible for the work to be improved and revised at will, even if the original author is long gone. Think about it for a moment... assume that only one student paper per course per semester is worthy of public distribution (and I think that's an extremely low estimate). Now multiply that by the number of courses per institution and the number of academic institutions in the world. It's disturbing to think of all the useful academic work that simply disappears (okay, maybe not as bad as the burning of the Library of Alexandria, but still disturbing). So far we've gotten around that in Moodle by opening some of our courses for guest access and having the site open to Google, but that's still not a completely satisfactory solution.",

I find it tedious at times to scroll down to the linked pages to go up a level in my 'tree' and would find it usefull to have one click to the site map rather than a pulldown list. alternatively, a way to go back to the referring page would be useful - I know i could use the back button on my browser, but if i have just edited a page it is not as straight-forward.  The ability to go to the last wikipage that referred me to the current page would be useful and intuitive.

I look forward to documents that students build with wikis, but probably even more, the chance to provide in-line comments to student wikis, thus helping them revise their writing. The versioning aspect will be just great. My only fear is the jargon and the remaining wiki feel. I appreciate the way that wiki links are disappearing and being replaced by Moodle help buttons, etc., but I wonder whether it is time to be more radical and to lose more of the wiki jargon. Maybe it is too soon in development and I'm talking about superficial language issues, but I'm still a bit intimidated by this interface. Similar, perhaps, to the way that I'm spooked by the complexity of the workshop module. Let me start with this suggestion: why not call it the collaborative writing module? Do we benefit from teaching students about the wiki concept/history at all? ... should they care? What about the drop-down menus? Wikis are flexible, but users need the simplest functions in the clearest spaces. How about this in the bottom right corner of the /moodle/mod/wiki/view.php?id= page?

Everyone can do that by cutting outr a piece of text (including CamelCases) and paste it on another page: should work there too..

I am planning on adding a more formal comment mechanism, like some other wiki products, but I'm not sure when I'll get to it. Also, I'm not sure whether I should try to integrate it with the existing forum mechanism or not. The 'wiki way' is not complex - just the opposite. In fact it was created to be used by people who didn't have a lot of time to learn new technologies. The basic premise is to create a page, name it. 'If you name it, it will come.' I don't have a problem renaming it - you can call it what you want in your language file. But it is an implementation of the ewiki open source, so I think we should at least acknowledge that. I like your menu ideas; looks cleaner. Michael and I will look into those. I haven't looked at the journal, but what would you want instead of the 'Edit this page ...'? I think the preview should stay. The wiki naming convention must remain, but you don't need to use it. If you enclose any word(s) in '[]' (square brackets), it becomes a page. mike",

Also, I have an ambitious scheme to create a kind of pop-up palette of \"common composition, grammar, and punctuation errors\" (maybe ones that are stored in a glossary and that can be inserted in the way smileys are added in a non-html window). I hear what you are saying about linking a forum to a wiki for comments. That is one way (I was thinking about it myself when I posted feature request, bug 463). Another way might be to create a kind of glossary (contained to the particular wiki), that allows you to highlight words or phrases and to create a kind of annotated comment on the side. (My feature request, bug 1341 talks about this a bit... but I'm sure it would be a pain to introduce...) I agree with the idea that wiki-way editing is far simpler than html mark-up, but I suspect the HTML editor is even simpler. As for the difference between the edit pages of the wiki and the journal, I think, simply, that when you reach the editing moment in wiki, it is odd to look at a line that says \"edit this page.\" The user has already clicked the edit button, he is currently editing, it seems like a disorienting reminder to do so again. I'm probably saying this in a really convoluted way -- please excuse me. Thanks again, Mike, collaborative writing is a critical element of Moodle that continues to transform possibilities for teaching. -Tom p.s. I approached an HTML designated wiki in your last build with a browser that doesn't allow for an editor. It hung. Is there a way for it to recognize such browsers and to offer up the html code instead?",

I would suggest a similar approach, call the module whatever you like, but acknowledge that it is a Wiki so that users familiar with Wikis can understand that they have one.  Don't explain Wikis too much, but include some links for those that care like a link to Wards Wiki or the WikiPedia.  Make pages with more detailed information on topics like Refactoring available on the Moodle site so that users who find a need for them can add them to Wikis that have developed enough of a culture to use them. on the postscripts: * Preview is great and happens to be where eWiki links in the spell checker.  Also some users will be nervous with the markup if every variation they try is saved. * You can remove the Wiki naming convention, but I wouldn't.  WikiWords are easy to guess and remember leading to good references in long-lived Wikis (like a class wiki carried forward from year to year). * This post is just the kind of reaction I got from my boss when I first said the word \"Wiki,\"  He has since come around.  Definately the Wiki plugin should blend with Moodle in every way possible, eWiki is designed for just that kind of embbending and we would accept patches needed to make it more embbedable.  Some of the strangeness may become comfortable and useful with time.

Or changing the MySQL 'id' number of a module. (So Tom, once named SillyPage, always named SillyPage). We could de-camelize a page title before displaying it as a page title, but we would have to make assumptions. In other words, if the title had mixed case, we would have to automatically assume that it was CamelCase, and not something else. Keep in mind, you can now name a page without using Camel Case, as long as you enclose in '[ ]'. I don't think its a good idea to display the page title as anything other than what it was named. I think that would be too presumptious of us. As to using CamelCase, I think we need to always have it. It is the backbone of a Wiki, even if it isn't needed any more.

I now wonder whether the CamelCase could be parsed (as it is created) and stored as a title like \"Words Together\" -- just like a page title that was created between brackets[]. That way, it wouldn't STAY funky in the Moodle system. It would just have a funky birth. Again, I think the best modules allow people to think they are doing something simple: maybe writing a journal. Then, in time, the users realize that the journal can be versioned, can be linked, can create additional pages on the fly...wow! But if a user sits down at a wiki with a big dashboard of flight controls, I suspect there will be a kind of paralysis. Likewise, a dashboard of permanently FunkyTitles SuddenlyMakes a SimpleJournal FeelLike a ForeignVehicle. Mike, you are ever-patient to listen to any of these ideas.

The idea of parsing the CamelCase into Camel Case upon creation, sounds interesting, and probably could be done, but I think that makes it even more difficult than using square brackets. Either we are forcing the writer to stop midstream, and remove spaces of titles they want to use as pages, just so those spaces can be reintroduced, or we are changing what they write. I really think that teaching them the square brackets method will make more sense. They still have to do a bit of backtracking, but they don't need to change what they've written.

Would you want to display EUCouncilofMinisters as \"E U Councilof Ministers?\" \"EU Councilof Ministers?\"  Teaching people to manage the mangler might prove non-trivial.  I use a similar mangling on titles(not text) for my Wiki and the incidence of mis-mangled titles is rather high. I would suggest that display time mangling is worse than turning off WikiWords, which itself is worse than silently depreciating them. If you do go this route, consider doing a save-time mangle with an edit_save plugin to look at the page text being saved and replace any simple CamelCase with [\"{Target Page}\"{TargetPage}].  That would give authors full capability to correct the mangling and allow the plugin to be turned off at anytime without affecting current pages.  See the /plugins/feature/timestamp.php plugin for an example edit_save mangler.

The power of the HTML editor is that one can copy bits of web pages and other documents and paste it straight into the editor. Now, as the wiki documentation says rightly about CamelCase: \"it is very common in the computing world\". So it can happen that the bit one cuts and paste contains CamelCase words. It would be very annoying if these are all converted to links to new pages. People who want CamelCase converted to links can use the \"Safe HTML\" mode.

My preference is for the way it works. I like being able to use both formatting methods. The HTML editor is much more familiar to a lot of my users and results in more success with formatting the documents. The extra wiki formatting codes (bold, italics, etc.) I could live without, but the simple linking and page creation mechanism is critical. Its much easier to teach people that they can create and link new pages just by naming them (whether in camel case or in [] ). As for cutting an pasting, again, because this is a wiki (not an HTML document), I expect wiki link codes to work as wiki links when I paste them in. That way, I could actually create wiki structures off-line, paste them into the wiki, and have them work as expected. So, for me: - HTML editor for easy text formatting, - wiki words for easy link definition. mike",

But I can see a use for being able to just let them edit, and not change any of the versions. I think this needs discussion. My thoughts - If its a 'student' wiki, than the student should have full control over their own wiki - including admin functions. Is there a reason anyone can see why they should not? If its a 'group' wiki, only editing teachers and teachers assigned to the group should have admin prvileges. All other members of the group can just edit. If its a teacher wiki, it should work correctly already. mike",

One of the mechanism to protect a Wiki when it is open for everyone is this page-version-control, so be carefull when you give it away as admin/teacher. The same protection should there be for the uploaded files: Everyone can upload , only the admin can delete. Everyone can overwrite a file with an empty one, to hide the content for others, but in the versions there should be a file version store with the old file for the admin to put it back in place (Like I had in my Swiki ).",

Most Wikis have another approach to passwords: you become member of a group which has access to a certain level with the password of your group. (built inVersion control of pages recovers disaster editing, I love eWiki 's simplicity.) eWiki in Moodle starts from the other side: you start with a environment with personal access and lots of built in functionality and there you organise \"innercircle\" groups.",

If this is a one time move, I can live with it, but I am really missing the 'thumbnail' function of mediawiki. so I'm asking, is it on the roadmap ?

So my comment here is that I think teachers should have always access, because we are an educational setting not a wiki community. I use Swiki as a stand-alone program until this eWiki is fully integrated in Moodle. I like this integrated eWiki now very much: And I prefer the HTML-editor above the Wiki-simple-text-philosophy.. But this Swiki option (coomentbox) was very nice: the only thing a user had to do was place a commentbox symbol on the page, place his email in a \"send me an email\"\" -field and lock the page. (Students can take ownership of a page when they put a lock on a individual page of a group-wiki.) A visitor sees then the locked page with the commentbox. As soon as the visitor types his comment and presses the comment-button under that box, the owner gets an email.There is no database behind it, pages are stored in XML -format. Another option I did like was the possibility for a webuser with editor rights to create a webform instead of the standard fill-in screen. The page-storing mechanism makes collecting the content of the forms to difficult, no database.. Swiki is a standalone server that runs on Mac,  Unix, Windows.. We used it for several years at our secondary schools to collect experience with collab-work on a website. Works great. http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki The program Swiki is written in the Smalltalk version Squeak. The pioneer Alan Kay is one of the founders. Their children project eToys is inspiring http://www.squeakland.org/ During meetings they play the game to install and run this Swiki-server in less then ... seconds.",

You should be able to see any student wiki though, so I'll try and recreate your problem. I can see any student wiki. I'll double check with groups and fix it as necessary. Other activities , such as assignments and exercises work the same way - the student enters them and the teacher looks at them. So just to be clear, the way it should work: - teachers can see any created wiki, - students can see their own wikis, teacher wikis, and group wikis (according to group rules) - teachers can edit teacher and group wikis, - students can edit their own wikis, and group wikis according to group wikis. We can modify it so that teachers could edit student wikis, but I'd appreciate some feedback on that to make sure that makes sense. Again, I'm modeling that function on the bases that a wiki is like an assignment. mike",

          "Text": "Hi Mike! Why cannot another option be, teachers can see and edit any student created WIKI which addresses or is for an assignment of any sort. That would mean that teachers could see and edit Their own wikis Any student group wikis - Teacher's student groups Teacher's Assistants student groups, along with Teacher Assistant's wikis for that activity and assignment Any individual student wiki which is part of an activity (assignment) or side work in a group. I also believe that personal wikis which no one but the students, teachers, admins maintain, view and edit should be allowed, I think however they should be limited to a certain number determined by the main administrator. If it is only a few students, teachers and admins and the institution has a large amount of diskspace they may not care how many personal wikis a student may have. Of couse an administrator should have the ability to see all public wikis including any public Teacher wikis. There is one other thing however, I feel instructors/teachers and administrators should be able to have group wiks and individual wikis that administrators cannot view. Again the question of how many may come up. In essence, I feel that there should be much fexibility in how the wikis permissions should be determined with a policy sent out to other admins and to teachers as to what they are for a particular instrution so it is clear just how public their thoughts and work will be and if private personal wikis will be allowed. Probably needs a Control Panel which addresses the following, STATUS TARGETS Creation Status Main Admin, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?) Type Status Individual, Groups Number Status (of each type for....) Main Admins, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?). View Status Private, Public, Group, [Parents (?) - To check if student is doing assigned work - Eventually]. Edit Status Main Admins, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?), I am beginning to understand wiki's more and more and see what great potential they have in a classroom. The ability to post notes as Ger has indicated and have an e-mail sent out to all involved in a group or individual wiki to notify them or the individual of a change or some type of intervention sounds really cool. If this cold be added it would be nice. Swiki however appears to need a special server to accomplish that function. Time to step back and let the MASTERS work. WP1",

I would like to suggest the option for student assignment s to be edited by the teacher so that comments could be interlined in the work as teachers do with their comments on hard copy.  However, I am prejudiced by years of experience with totally open wikis--where the users are all on their honor. The other use for one-on-one, teacher and student pages, would be to have the assignment pages available for use as student maintained, teacher-commentable journals as part of the wiki environment. I am a wiki buff from way back ... the \"inventor\" of the wiki sandbox and active participant in Ward's wiki. W ith Ward 's help as host and mentor , I maintained an experiment back in 97-99 with a wiki devoted to continuing education, collaborative information sharing, course development and publishing for lawyers and accountants.

          "Text": "Alright, I double-checked the code and tested it. I was wrong; I implemented it such that teachers can edit any wiki - even student ones. So, if you're not getting that functionality, something's wrong. Now, there is an issue with changing the group mode on an existing wiki. I haven't figured out how to resolve this yet. If you were to change a group wiki, that was previously set to 'no groups' to 'separate' or 'visible', and it already had wiki entries, you would orphan that pages that were originally created. The effect you would get is that the teacher would always see the orphaned wiki first when they looked at the wiki. The teacher can see the real wikis by selecting them from the drop-down list. If the teacher edits the orphaned one, only they will see it. No students from the course would ever see the orphaned one. So, to summarize: A teacher can edit and view all wikis, regardless of type and group setting. Group wikis can be edited by anyone in the group. If the group setting is 'no groups', then anyone in the course can edit them. Group wikis can be viewed by anyone, for 'no groups' or 'visible groups', or by members of the groups for 'separate groups'. Teacher wikis can be edited by teachers only. If you are not seeing this functionality, make sure you have the latest code from CVS , and try a fresh wiki. Don't change the group setting once you have entered wiki entries. Let me know any anomalies you see. mike",

Should teacher editing privileges affect this? Should a teacher from a different group be able to view a student's wiki if groups is set to 'separate'? My thoughts: Editing teachers and administrators can view/change/create entries for any wiki. Non-editing teachers not assigned to a specific group can view/change/create entries for any wiki. Non-editing teachers assigned to a specific group can view/change/create entries for any wiki in their group, and view wikis in other groups for 'visible' groups. Make sense? mike",

You can then still do a cvs update just on that 'wiki' folder and it will work (it does for me under Linux, anyway), or On Unix systems, make a symbolic link to the contrib wiki folder from \"mod\", so that it appears to be in the right place. cd moodle/mod ln -s ../../contrib/wiki wiki While I'm here, can I make a request about the Wiki module?   The blocks down the left side confused me when I tried it ... could they be replaced with popup menus along the top?  It would make things more consistent with other parts of Moodle.",

Moodle does not yet include the wiki module and because we are still in heavy development, there may be more releases for the wiki than moodle-releases - Yes.

Ability to set 'read-only' function. (Any Others?) Nice To Haves: Comments on Wiki pages. Comments on changes (versions). Attachments. Software: PHPWiki ErfurtWiki PMWiki My cursory investigation leads me to believe that ErfurtWiki will be easier to integrate into Moodle than PHPWiki. ErfurtWiki, or ewiki, has been built as a library rather than a stand-alone application. It is OpenSource and has many plug-ins which can be integrated or not. If anyone has any information that can affect this choice, please post it here. Some Moodle specific functionality I will look into: Visibility - Can we define a wiki at a global, course and topic level? In other words, can a wiki be limited to a topic such that it will only link to other wikis in that topic. Same with course. An can we make it global so that it can link to all wikis (or, in fact can we prevent this). Any Others? mike",

Somebody will probably be interested in grading the collaborative documents, so you might keep your idea on the forum code (that is also used in the glossary module) that allows flexible scale assessments (for each version?). I would recommend that we don't create new pages with wiki-style StickWordsTogether formatting. Your module has great potential of being wide-spread and IMHO ThisParticularConvention speaks to webheads more than classrooms. Maybe links don't appear unless the corresponding pages are already created? (Hyperlink/Library/Glossary style?). When you choose the non-html formatting controls, you might want to post them up for some discussion, as folks might want to wrangle over the most sensible formats. Comments are cool (and appropriate), but I wonder whether it might be more useful simply to attach a forum to the document, so that all of the cool functionality of the forums gets sewn onto the end of the wiki page (I've thought about this similarly with the glossary module). This is a huge project--thanks for jumping into it. A bunch of us would be happy to test the code as it develops.",

I'm thinking of having am alernative way to create pages as well - I need it to create one in a course/topic anyway. I cam probably make it WikiPageCreate an option, or something you can turn off if you didn't mean that word to be a Wiki. Most also use another convention as well, like enclosing words in \"{{}}\" or something. I'm going to use what comes out-of-the-box for formatting control initially.

The basic design of a wiki allows for all wiki pages to access all other wiki pages simply by using their names. Obviously, wikis will have much more value to Moodle if they can be separate structures that only access pages within their own structure. These whole structures can have limited lifetimes (as long as a course runs). As a minimum I can see that we would need to be able to have self-contained wikis by course, group and user. I would like to have them also by category and site. Unfortunately, ErfurtWiki doesn't support multiple wikis directly. Its based on the basic concept of \"one open document\". The good news is that the developers of ErfurtWiki are looking into it to see how much effort it would take to make these changes. I'll keep you posted. mike",

For example when students will work together on a WebQuest and are on the point to start collecting and reshuffeling the results for their final presentation.

          "Text": "Michael - Very cool. It seems we did do some overlap, but I think it'll make both versions better (I haven't uploaded mine, yet). Two problems I had installing yours: The MySQL . sql file has an extra comma after the 'PRIMARY KEY ('id') statement for the first table, which prevented the table from getting set up. You'll see it between the two parentheses - ' ),) ' If you set titles to 'on', it initially tells me I'm editing 'mod/wiki/view.php'. This title sticks with the first page from then on. I like the 'Allow safe HTML' and 'Fill in Default Content' options, not sure about the title one though. I got around the multi-wikis issue by talking with the Erfurt Wiki developers. They gave me a plug-in (feature/subwiki.php) which allows me to specify a prefix for any wiki. That gives me any level of separation I need. Is that what you are doing with 'ewikimoodlelib.php'? I believe I can re-apply the multi-wiki code to your 'ewikimoodlelib.php', or should we use the 'feature/subwiki.php' code? (I've attached that file here for your persual). Another option I put in mine was to specify using the name given to the Wiki activity as the name of the first page. That would probably fix the second problem I had above. For mine, instead of giving the option 'Allow students to contribute to the Wiki', I created a 'Wiki type' options which could be 'course', 'group' or 'user'. If its is a 'course' type, anyone registered in the course can edit it. If its a 'group', anyone in the group can. If its a 'user', only that user can. For 'course' wikis, every wiki page is prefixed by the course id; if its a group, they're prefixed by the course id and the group id; if its a user, they're prefixed by the course id and the user id. I was planning on uploading mine tonight or tomorrow, but I'll wait and see if you can solve the problems I had. I think it might be better for me to force fit my changes onto yours. Do you handle multiple wikis in a similar fashion? mike",

The idea having the Wiki-Name as the first Page is very good, but I am not sure if I can implement it. These pages are read from static pages. What OS do you use ? We just use Linux with PHP 4.3. I am very sorry, I have no Windows-machine to test it. It would be great if someone could make it portable if it is not. For the Wiki-Separation: I went a different way. There is a system in EWiki to hook on the database -functions. I translated all database calls to use the ones from the moodle-library, this should make it much more integrated into the system with the advantage, that the ErfurtWiki-code did not change at all. Also on this hook, I added the Wiki separation, and as far as I can see, it seems to work. I am not very fond of the idea replacing this working code, or do you see a special advantage I have overseen ? BTW : I will set up a website for this one with a download section for new versions if you like. BTWBTW: Very cool: Glossaries work inside of the Wiki ! Moodle is so great ! Thank you very much for your response. You can change the code however you like, I do not own it and I would like to take your changes also for our Moodle-Site.",

This code should be considered 'in development' for now, and not used on a production system unless you are prepared for potential problems. For Developers: To implement the wiki types, I believe we will need another table. With the current implementation, wiki's are differentiated by wiki id's from the wiki table. This id's are specific to a wiki instance added to a course. If we were to set one as a 'student' wiki, we need another level of differentiation. To stay within the Moodle standards, the wiki table should probably remain as holding records for every specific instance of a wiki added to a course. Therefore, we need another level that keeps track of specific wiki structures (per student or per group). Then we need to update Michael's code to use this new identifier. For now, I have left the 'allowstudentstowiki' field in the database, pending the resolution of the wiki type issue. Thoughts? mike",

          "Text": "In several forums, desparate teachers of writing have been dreaming of collaborative document-making.  I just discovered your forum today and want to jump in with lots of questions and comments. First, in teaching writing, the trend is completely in the direction of process writing.   Process writing involves multiple drafts of a composition including peer-editing, self-editing, and teacher -editing in the process.  Until we have group documents, this is almost impossible online. Now I am puzzled why the wiki features do not use the HTML editor like we have here in the Forum module.  It is great.  It allows color highlighting which is the best editing tool.  Instead of telling students what the mistake is or problem is, you highlight the word or sentence and let them focus on that area and figure out the problem themselves. Next, we need to make a switch onto the forum module or journal module, to allow multiple individuals or groups to edit.  And make editing time non-expiring.  For example, couldn't a particular forum be set this way?  Why do we need a \"wiki\" to have group collaboration? I have also used the wiki module which has been part of the Documentation section  (see detailed step by step installation instructions under Apache , PHP, MySQL ).  I believe it was phpWIKI.  It was so clumbersome to operate.  I would say it is even terrible.  Also it had no highlighting, no way to attach comments, and no indications of who added what. So my list of essential features to Group Collaborative Document Module is as following, in order of importance... 1.  Non-expiring editing 2.  Groups can be designated for editing rights",

In he full-blown D3E version you hang annotation-anchors in the paragraphs of the running text on the left and you can comment on this comment in the forum-threads on the right. Only one drawback: You cannot do re-sead the forum with an improved draft.. So Moodle should install D3E as a Modul, PLUS: one student (or a group!) must have access to the left column the modul must support the reworking of the draft on base of the comments then a re-sead of the discussion, that leaves on resolved comments open etc.. Wikis are starting from another perspectiv: you are less concerned with the actions of each independent student and more concerned with their collab construct and the collab activities aound that. You trust that working together regulates a lot of teacher-replacing-support. (My old Smalltalk Wiki allows to place a comment box on each page, but I prefer now eWiki inside Moodle!.) OK, i know, groupswork is most of the time: 2 students do the work, two are just sittinh there and the others are nowhere, that's where the discussion is all about... (How can we find trics to handle that..no how can we ways to teach them to cope with that situation, their first job will look the same.)

It doesn't have the HTML editor integrated out of the box, but is something we will be looking at - its kind of a 'non-wiki' solution though. There is a lot of wiki formatting you can do; read the page on editing when you are editing a wiki. Wiki will have full group implementation. As to your list: Non-expiring editing as built in top wiki, unless I'm not understanding what you mean by that. Moodle groups will be implemented. If you use a group wiki, and have 'visible' groups, only members of a group can edit their wiki. All others can read it. Color highlighting will happen if we can get the HTML editor integrated. Commenting is high on my priority list; as is rating. mike",

From a practical standpoint, avoiding HTML mitigates the gobs of security and parsing issues that tend to arise.

The only thing where most Wikis are easier is when it comes to tables.. Wiki formatting is not an educational target on it's own, easy formatting is: \"how can I make it more easy for a user to put information on a webpage.\" If you combine these thoughts with the alternative of a built-in html-editor, with tables AND A FUNCTIONALITY THAT RESEMBLES WHAT THEY KNOW: WORD... then I think even Ward Cunningham will agree..",

Embedding or attaching comments is another way. The key point is that the writer, several classmates and the teacher all need to comment on the document. So some kind of group collaborative document is needed. It could be a forum with non-expiring editing or it could be a wiki. It is a tool we desperately need. I have been teaching writing for 20 years, so it feels like a \"long-term\" appeal to me. Hi again WP, Yes, definitely the students use the highlighting.  For example, I will give them a task to go through a partner's writing and highlight topic sentences in green, supporting examples in yellow, etc.  Or give them a grammar task to search and color.  They love it.  But I don't need to turn on or turn off highlighting.  They just use it when I give them a task to do.

Additionally, having a systematic method for feeback and updates is a key component in the pedagogical merit of this module. It seems, however, we are now talking about something other than a wiki. Perhaps I'm just focussing on semantics, but by incorporating the worthwhile features people have asked for, the fundamental tenet of the wiki (a self-evolving, self-correcting, traceable literary free-for-all ) is lost. Again, this is not a necessarily bad thing, but we are talking about a different paradigm than the wiki. Perhaps the system would be something like that used to produce the Zope Book. Take a look at the document and notice how the commentary can be interspersed with the text (be sure the comments are turned on and click on the Preface for a sample. Click on the little bubble to add a comment or turn comments off at top of document to hide commentary) http://zope.org/Documentation/Books/ZopeBook/2_6Edition/ Another source of ideas is the Silva document management system: http://www.infrae.com/products/silva This is complete overkill for what we're discussing here, but there are some interesting capabilities that could be valuable. I think Ger found similar shortcomings as I with the straight text markup. Although, the latest specification for structured text (called ReStructured Text in the python camp) provides astounding flexibility in markup and document generation, asking students to learn its nuances would be frustrating. A quick note to Don in response to his earlier post: I don't teach writing, but rather chemistry. I do have students post answers to questions, both essay and numerical problems (hence my interest in LaTeX markup!). They then critique, annotate, revise each others' answers. It's been an interesting learning experience for all of us as I learn what they buy into and what they don't. I'm getting a bit of on-the-job training in learning psychology! Regards, Steve",

But rethinking this I think that it is a nice and elegant descision: Wiki is a little bit a different kind of sport then the rest of Moodle. The changing of the menu on the left is for the user the hint that the functionality changes: You enter pages that are not only from your own (in group and course setting) You get extra options like the version control and the CamelBackFunction for hyperlinks to new created pages. You as user/owner can attach binary files on every page. (Should these go in the database? IF you can change it then the moodledata area would be better. They only should be locked for write and delete...) Personal grading? not possible, only in the privat WIKI, so should the functionality be available there? Should we develop a kind of group-grading and then let themselves divide the difference in points under the participants? What I also like is that the grey words are also available inside each wiki page, fun!",

Not having looked at the Erfurtwiki library you're using, I'm curious if it possible to include this feature without too much trouble? Given the that Moodle TeX and algebra filters are already available, how difficult would it be to massage a wiki page for math markup prior to display or storage? Careful regex parsing would be required, and I have no idea how flexible the Erfurt parser is. I'd love the capability of full TeX markup, but even simple symbol/super/subscripts would be valuable.
