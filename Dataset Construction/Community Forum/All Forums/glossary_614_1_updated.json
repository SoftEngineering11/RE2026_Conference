One is to configure the TeX notation filter as in the other discussion. The other is to manually wrap the mathematics in a span with class 'filter_mathjaxloader_equation'. The filter is suppose to do that, but it does not appear to do that.",

So  I then followed the previous threads and after some study found an acceptable solution on my XAMPP set up. I basically looked at the TeX settings and the Default paths it was showing and created the path on my C drive having downloaded the dvisvgm.exe file. This worked perfectly. My next step was to change my production site.  The default paths are /usr/bin/name_of_file, the current active one being /usr/bin/convert. I imagine the easy solution is to simply upload the dvisvgm.exe file into the same folder and activate it in TeX. However I can´t find that path not folder. I am hosting the site with  cPanel access. Or is it not that simple? Sorry to dump all this on you  but do you know how I find it? I have searched and come up with nothing! Thanks, Ian",

As far as I understand it, it'd make the concepts infeasibly long. Also, if this helps at all for quickly generating glossary definitions that help students to understand & use new language, I use ChatGPT to do the following... I input: a complete source text, in order to give context to the vocabulary lists (This makes the definitions & examples more accurate & helpful), the target vocabulary list, & the following prompt: \"Using the above text for context, for each of the items in the vocabulary list, write a brief definition, two example sentences, and  a brief, controversial, provocative discussion question which uses the vocabulary item.\" The generated output typically only needs minor adjustments so that everything makes sense & doesn't contain more challenging/difficult vocabulary that the items themselves. The \"brief, controversial, provocative discussion\" part seems to get questions that'll actually encourage students to think deeply about what the items mean, & so process them more deeply, connect them with prior knowledge (AKA schema-building), & ultimately remember & be able to use them better (AKA transfer of learning). I usually copy & paste the output into a text editor & use search & replace to get it into a CSV format (tabs as delimiters) that'll load into LibreOffice Calc & go from there.

As you might have guessed, blended means Moodle to me. Well, before Moodle there is Unicode, which is not so universal in this part of the world, where local languages are still seen as \"Microsoft Word fonts\". But that is not the topic here. The topic is, what else is needed. Word lists, one-to-one mapping either direction, is the next, I imagine. That is where we are. I hope, you understand that we are no at a higher pedagogical level (yet, if ever). We get word lists coming. Right now they are technical terms, separated in to their respective subjects.

The glossaries titles display the order that they were created. And then I just organized them in a different order to see if that would affect which concept would auto-link.

          "Text": "All Q: I would like to use the Glossary to search on exact terms based on the title of the CONCEPT field, NOT every time the term is mentioned in the definition field for any other entry. We have HUNDREDS of terms... when students query them - lets say they query the term \"attack\" ... EVERY ENTRY with that term will display... NOT JUST THE EXACT ENTRY FOR THAT TERM. In other words - JUST the exact entry with that exact string value as the stated in the CONCEPT FIELD for that term or phrase of the glossary, NOT EVERY ENTRY WHERE THE TERM IS MENTIONED IN THE DEFINITION OF ANOTHER TERM... The way the glossary currently works is contradictory to how humans actually use a real life glossary... in real life, they go look up the term exactly relative to what Moodle considers the CONCEPT FIELD. They don't and ask the glossary to barf out every reference to the mention of that term in the contents of EVERY ENTRY. So, I want to eliminate this design flaw by using what I think was a feature implemented to mitigate the problem, Match whole case words - from https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/Using_Glossary: \"Match whole words only If automatic linking is enabled, then turning this setting on will force only whole words to be linked. For example, a glossary entry named \"construct\" will not create a link inside the word \" constructivism \". Click Save changes to save your entry.\" Fine. Sounds like that if I check this box for the concept, the term ATTACK will NOT show up when I query anything with the term ATTACK nested in it OR any aspect of the definition, including and especially the content as listed in the definition field of other terms.",

          "Text": "I think you’re maybe getting confused between the auto-linking functionality and the search functionality. The “Match whole words only” tickbox does what it says on the tin. It will link “Ice” as a concept but will not highlight that concept when the word justice is displayed. And it only highlights concepts, not content in the description. With the Glossary auto-link filter, you can choose whether to highlight the first occurrence of the concept, or every occurrence. The search functionality will search all of the glossary for occurrences of the concept word/phrase. It works more like the “index at the back” in the “how humans actually use a glossary” example you have given - ie. multiple occurrences will be shown. There is also a tick box under the (Glossary) search box which allows you to also search the full text of the entry (ie. concept and description). The alphabetical index at the top (depending on how you set the Glossary up) allows someone to browse directly to an entry (again, using your example, more of a “I know what I’m looking for”). The Global search takes things further and will search multiple contexts for the phrase, not just the glossary. So - are you talking about Global search, the Glossary search, or the auto-link functionality? The “match whole words only” tickbox will have no affect on the Global or Glossary search functionality.",

There are grammar rules for plural so it *may* be possible to add those to the filter so that if the concept is linked, any plural version of the concept would also be linked.

Also, the Glossary auto-linking filter needs to be on elsewhere in the course. It can be turned off for particular activities, for example often teachers turn the Glossary auto-linking filter off in quizzes. To answer your extra questions Unless the glossary is global, auto-linking will just be within the same course as the glossary.

I've tried searching without the checkbox marked. I still get similar results. I changed the auto-linking option to match whole words only, but that didn't change anything (it wouldn't - the entries aren't autolinked).

          "Text": "Hey Eoin, thank you very much for your answer! I think I might have expressed myself misleadingly 1) It is indeed true that GlobalSearch uses Solr succesfully to find Glossary entries. But for doing so the User needs to use \"Global Search\" and NOT the \"Glossary search\" field in the Glossary-activity. This can be very confusing since the position of the Glossary-Search right under the Title suggests that this is the field to use if you want to search the Glossary.... To make myself clear i made a screenshot: Or can I at least somehow hide the misleading and irritating glossary-search-field so  that the user goes the \"correct\" path and uses the global search field instead? 2) Unfortunately my usecase requires to \"link\" the documents from nextcloud and not attach it. The reason is that I want to link a huge chunk of documents to many different glossaries and in case one of the documents gets updated in the repository (nextcloud) all \"linked\" documents (that means all glossary-linked-documents) should be updated immediately. So I would somehow need the Repository Plugin to index the \"linked\" documents as well. Since my non-profit association is now just starting to implement Moodle I wonder if these urgend-needed funcitonalities described above are \"very hard\" or \"impossible\" to realize from a developers perspective? Since you Eoin are a Plugin-developer-yourself: what do you think? Can i forget it? Might there be any chance to get these \"features\" into the global Moodle-Development-Pipeline? Or might it be worth to look for a developer to let them be individually developed for our needs? Maybe I could organize some money for that purpose but I would need a raw notion of how elaborate and costly the development of such features might become? Thank you for your help! kind regards Philipp",

Using Solr to search the Glossary: you could use a Generico filter to configure a glossary-specific search that used Solr to search the glossary in this course only (see this related post: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=434583#p1748773 ). 3. Using Solr to search linked files on NextCloud: this is probably very hard, and would require a lot of custom development. You should first check whether or not Solr actually indexes linked files on Nextcloud or not. Perhaps it all just works already! If not, then as an alternative, you could instead use Nextcloud, which seems to have its own search facilities, see https://apps.nextcloud.com/categories/search . You could probably integrate the Nextcloud search facility into Moodle somehow, and use it to search the glossary in some way. If you host your own Nextcloud instance, then perhaps you could get Solr to index it and use it within Moodle. You would need to get some advice on this from the Nextcloud people.",

Templates can be easily edited by some who understand HTML well without other coding experience. The revised template can be placed in the theme where it will override the core template making upgrades more easy. The existing search there could be replaced with a HTML form that directs to global search instead of the glossary. An experienced developer should take a couple hours to do this with proper testing.",

Each glossary entry is in a separate structured table in Word, and each cell in the table contains a different component of the entry. It's not as space-efficient as Excel, but it does allow for much richer text definitions, including tables, pictures, equations, and multiple languages. A sample file is located at https://github.com/ecampbell/moodle-local_glossary_wordimport/blob/master/tests/fixtures/glossarytable.docx . You can also export an existing glossary into a Word file for editing all the entries in bulk, and then re-import it.",

I think it's doable for course or activity but what about glossary entry ? I don't mind if it opens on an \"entry not found\" page. or 2. Is it possible to share a glossary between courses in the same Moodle instance ? Obviously I can create 2 course and set up the same enrollment but maybe there is a different way. or 3.

This really did slow the loading of the course depending on how many glossary terms were on the page. The work around that we did was for example when we created a resource using the book module, which you can turn on glossary auto-linking we would put those terms in the glossary description and then made sure that the description show on the course page.",

However, this makes follow up for the teacher hard. Glossary entries can only be viewed in chronological order, not by student.

          "Text": "Hi all, I'm working on a set of courses mainly for individual users. I want them to be able to make a Glossary each (if they want) that only they and teachers+ can see. For example, user Aya opens a Glossary in course Colours, and starts making their own entries for 'mauve' and 'periwinkle'. Ideally, an individual Glossary would hide these entries from other users. The workaround I've seen is to allow student submissions, require approval and then never approve them. But I don't want to have to rely on teachers+ remembering which entries not to approve, as this is bound to fail at some point. I've had a look at Databases as well, which also lack this feature. This link ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=51992 opens in new window) discusses this more. Finally, Wiki activities (or the simpler 'OU wiki') allow individual settings like I need, but both wikis require a large amount of overheard for user training. I'm trying to keep these courses as accessible as possible, and I want to include users with minimal tech experience and confidence.

I have not explicitly tested glossary links in Moodle, so cannot give a definitive answer about this. I haven't come across any issues with this so far, but it doesn't mean they don't cause issues. I would suggest testing this yourself in several ways: - a quick check to make sure you can navigate to the definition and close it again only using the keyboard. Many visually impaired and blind screen reader users will be accessing web pages using only the keyboard. - assuming you don't have access to Jaws you can test it directly using the free NVDA ( https://www.nvaccess.org/download/ ) screen reading software. - you can also use the Wave accessibility tool ( https://wave.webaim.org/ ) to see what accessibility issues it finds on the page in question. I think the browser plugin will work best with Moodle, since you will probably have to log in to gain access to the page. I hope this helps. I'd be interested to hear what you find out. If you want to post your results back on here I'm sure that would be useful for others too. Kind regards, Jess",

(Someone far more techy installed it; I sort courses' structure and content.) One of my courses had a Main-type Glossary activity (2) that I'd imported from a different course (1). I deleted this activity (2) since deleting every entry in it would take too long -- public release is coming up fast. I added a new Glossary activity (3) but it's stuck as a Secondary glossary only. Problem: Any new Glossary (4, 5 etc) is now stuck as Secondary too. Is this as expected or a bug? I hope it's just a mis-clicked setting somewhere. Attempted fixes: I thought it was from uncleared caches etc so I cleared them and ran the relevant scheduled tasks. Just in case, I then logged out, closed all tabs ( Firefox 65.0.2, 64-bit) and reopened the site on our test server. After no luck, I purged all caches (very few test users so nbd). Still nothing, and no upgrades have been pending (except v3.5.5 and 3.6.3+).",

Were you for example using course back up, selecting only the glossary, with or without the users in the course, and then I'm lost with the disabling calendar entries.

Can entries that were made in a course, later be imported to this glossary? Yes. The way I have been doing it is by having secondary glossaries for each unit and then pushing them to the main one. This way the students are not bombarded with a mammoth list. One thing I have not been able to figure out is how to restrict a word list and not have it show up in the main one. Currently, I am forced to do little things like this manually which is tedious work. What is the relationship between a courses main glossary and making spelling / vocabulary lists? As I understand it glossaries can be used for any number of things including the things you have mentioned. There is no reason why you could not have them all and even have them under the main glossary or separate. Do I create a separate physical glossary for each word list (spelling list) or do I just create a category? I myself am also fairly new with Moodle. So far I am not using categories but that may change. My workflow has been to create a secondary wordlist for each unit. Making the list in Libre office (calc) and then importing in bulk saves a metric ton of mouse clicks. Summary: I am teaching an English class. Each week the students have a weekly word list.  How do I organize this? I also confused the keywords.  Do Glossary entries only allow a single keyword?  I would like to organize the glossary by Part of speech vocabulary list I have also been trying to do this but not found an effective way to do it. As there is only room for the concept and definition I have had to make to within those confines. Maybe I should add keywords, I just have not had enough time to try it out.

          "Title": "Random Glossary sideblock - does it have a future?",
          "Text": "Hello, We're in the process of building a bank of 'scenario based' learning activities for vet students, using the lesson activity to enable our students to practice clinical decision making and professional judgement. Rather than displaying a long list of links to the cases (initially 8 but will grow), I thought a good way to present this supplementary content would be to add a link to each case in a glossary, then present this as a 'case of the week' using the random glossary entry sideblock. This seems to work perfectly, but I'm concerned about how it might work in future versions of Moodle. We're about to upgrade to 3.3, and it looks as though Moodle have taken a decision to phase out the use of sideblocks to be more mobile device friendly - for a start, the new mobile moodle app doesn't display sideblocks even if they are present in a course. If Moodle does do away with sideblock functionality completely I'm sure we'll cope - it just means having to redesign all of our courses so that they don't rely on information presented in blocks. I'm concerned that this \"feature\" needs a clear exit strategy to give us time to adapt - eg \"sideblocks will be discontinued in Moodle 3.5, prior to that the mobile app will still display sideblocks\", and guidance on which tools can provide equivalent functionality - or will we have the option to add (or move) existing sideblocks to the main screen? Apologies for this becoming a bit of a rant - my actual question was Can anyone suggest an alternative to sideblocks as a way of serving up the case scenarios, either randomly or sequentially in a way that doesn't clutter up the page? I'm anticipating we will have 30 scenarios by next year so don't want to simply list all of them. One reason for wanting to randomise is that real-life vets can't predict which cases they'll have to deal with on any given day. Regards, Gordon.",

(Functionally, I would have to decide how often to change the entry, then have to actually spend time doing that). I would have to convert the activity to a Database activity, but would lose the randomness and presentation. Please note that I'm not normally big on blocks.

I added a new glossary from scratch and started manually putting in new entries. Important: I did not import another glossary. 7.

There is a Description field when creating a new profile field, but the text I type in there does not appear on the registration page (or anywere else for that matter). I tried to solve the problem with a Glossary - I made an entry named one of my custom profile field names, and linked it.

If you don't have any specific suggestions, could you recommend a friend who is a Glossary Superstar? Thanks in advance, Tom e.g. NAME: Observations from Reading DESCRIPTION: Every night that you read from Tim O'Brien's novel, The Things They Carried , please also do the following: Create a glossary item including: A name/concept/main idea A sentence introducing an idea that you noticed in your reading. 1-2 sentences quoted from the text (include page number) 2-3 sentences of analysis/evidence that support your idea. e.g. Truth The soldiers in the story have experiences that they can barely believe are real. “A thing may happen and be a total lie; another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth\" (p22). The narrator summarizes the way that truth becomes a casualty of war.  One also wonders what lies are being told in the story and to what purpose. SETTINGS: approve by default always allow editing no duplicate entries allowed allow comments on entries automatically link glossary entries HOW I TEACH WITH THIS See who is up to date on reading Select glossaries to discuss/challenge/celebrate with group Students co-create a reader's guide while reading Provide a variety of ideas for future essay topics Assign specific roles to students to review glossary items (angel of repetition, angel of clarity, angel of evidence)",

Also check out the following discussion for some older ideas but also a glossary of the ideas that were added back in 2006 or 2009.  Also some of the postings have backups of the glossaries that can be used. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=54403 The Moodle Exchange that is the predecessor to the Moodle.net Hope that helps.",

They may be able to give you a course that isn't reset, that will allow you to host your recurring activities. You can then just import them into your new course whenever you want. Exporting/importing entries will also work well, you just need to remember to export before the course is reset. You can also backup your forum. Yes, you oculd create a page, but you'll lose the autolinking, search, categories and keyword functionality. I suppose it depends on how useful you want it to be.",

My site ( www.supplychainenglish.com ) is in English and Turkish, and in the glossary, I need to show the English word, and give a Turkish definition. As far as I can tell, the Excel macro provides Turkish-language output just fine, but when I try to import it into Moodle, that's when things error out. I haven't figured out how to import Turkish characters into the glossary yet, so I settled for using the English alphabet only, when writing the Turkish words. I'm missing Turkish characters, but they are close enough so my students can figure things out. For Chinese, I figure that approach would be of no use whatsoever, though. However, it's only half a solution. For me, too, figuring out how to get those non-English-alphabet characters to import into the glossary will be very useful. Perhaps it's an easy solution, I just haven't had time to look into it deeper. Best regards, Matt Krause",

Recently I had to import 21 Google Spreadsheet sheets (exported as .csv) to Moodle glossary for one of our faculty members. I use Leopard (OS X 10.5) on Mac, so my solution is probably not very useful to most of the people here, but I want to share it anyway. Originally, I wrote a Ruby script, but Leopard comes with a bridge (available for free) between Ruby and Cocoa. So I put interface to my script and made it a little fancy (this is why my program only runs on Leopard, though you might be able to run it if you install RubyCocoa on Tiger; no guarantee). I'm not a programmer (a Humanities grad student working as a tech support), so my script is messy, but it worked fine for my purpose. Basically what it does is take CSV or tab-delimited text files encoded in UTF-8 and export an XML file that Moodle glossary module can import. If you are one of the rare people who use Leopard now, feel free to try this. I also created a Read Me file, but it's too big to upload here. Is there any other way? Anyway, if you find any error, please post it here. I will try to fix them if I have time. Yasu",

          "Text": "Hi all, I think I've found a workaround for those which are using non-english characters and wish to import the file from an excel worksheet through one of the xml converters. I've tested this with spanish characters (á, é, í, ó, ú and ñ and they work perfectly). Yasu's glossaryXMLconverter.zip file works perfectly for most, but for those which have multiple lines (separated by an alt-enter in excel) in a definition, it will all a quotation mark before the first definition of the concept and an end quote after the last. With David Fountain's MoodleGlossaryPrepSheetWithCategory.xls macro file, it works perfectly with the enters, however it does give problems as many of you mention when importing special characters. Apparently the problem has to do with the encoding of the xml when the macro is run. To solve this, quite easy: 1. make your glossary in excel using David Fountain's MoodleGlossaryPrepSheetWithCategory.xls file. Save the file to the desktop or somewhere obvious. 2. Right click the file, and select \"open with\". Here choose notepad as the program to open the file. 3. Once you open, simply go to file - save as and save the file with a different name (add a one for example to the end) and make sure the extension is xml. VERY IMPORTANT that in the encoding box at the bottom, you choose UTF-8. 4. Upload the resulting file to Moodle. Non-english characters should appear and if you have multiple lines in your definitions, these should show up correctly. In my case I get a series of rejected entries which state \"--- No Concept or Definition Found\" but I think this has something to do with certain blank cells in excel, since all terminology is successfully imported. Hope this helps other languages with special characters as well. Please post to confirm if this workaround is successful!!",

I think I figured it out more or less, I came up with a system in which I had to clean up the code afterwards, but kind of did the trick Your spreadsheet seems simpler to use though, which is great news for my colleagues and myself. I'll give it a go tonight after my courses. Then again, I didn't completely waste my time, at least I've learnt something. I found an answer for html code, I think: in definition, just type html code but replace all < and > by \"& l t ;\" and \"& g t ;\" (without the spaces). The file still needs converting in UTF8 afterwards (we have a lot of latin characters in our courses) I created a spreadsheet with an additional column for lexical information, and the macro automatically adds the html code to put it in italics and add a line break after the lexical information. So the entry looks a bit like this: (EN-FR glossary): come: came, came venir The info in that extra column is added between the <DEFINITION> tags... I can upload or send you the spreadsheet if you want (yup, we're a language school, we need detailed glossaries) Again, thanks! I'll give your spreadsheet a go. Do you mind if I customize it to fit our needs? Have a great day!",

By „connected “ I mean the possiblity to export an\nitem inside the standard glossary manually by klicking on a plus sign to the\nmain glossary.  Is it possible to export\nan item that way from a standard glossary in a course to a main glossary on a\nhigher level (e.g. start page)? Basicly we want to let the students fill a glossary inside a\ncourse. By default each new item is invisible. It should become visible after\nour approval. If an item is useful for a wider audience we’d like to\nexport it/(better map it on the fly by a klick)  to a global or main  glossary on a higher level preferably on the\nstartpage in order to let each user share it. At the moment I’m reading the forums ... would cool if can\nget me started here ... ideas? Experiences ?

Which browser did you use? If you used IE , try Firefox , and check the text encoding is UTF-8. If the characters are ok in the box, then the text (or xml) file you created might have a problem. Assuming you use Windows, when you save the xml file, make sure you select UTF-8 for Encoding. If you use WordPad, select Unicode Text Document for Save as type. If you use Mac OS X, the default encoding is UTF-8, but you need to save the file as a plain text file (not as a RTF file). By the way, I think the file name doesn't have to have .xml (I mean it can be .txt) as long as the content is in proper xml formatting. Anyway, I tested the five characters, but they came out OK and I was able to import them without any problem. If this doesn't help, can you upload the original file and the file you uploaded (imported) (in .zip?)? I'll see what I can do. By the way, I attached the html version of glossaryXMLconverter to this post so that people who don't use Leopard are not bothered by unnecessary items. Yasu",

Someone else in a different thread also had the same problem and the source of the problem was encoding. If you don't see those characters in the output, that's the script's problem, but because you see it, something happend between the converter and the Moodle.

I have auto-linking enabled, and glossary terms are appearing as links which, when clicked, open the definition in a pop-up. The pop-up is causing a problem as far as 508 accessibility goes - when testing the course with a screen reader, the screen reader proceeds to read the popup definition, but then does not go back to the next word after the glossary term, it jumps to the page footer instead. I think a better solution might be to disable the popup and just have the link direct to the glossary page. Then the user could just go back to the page where the term appeared.  But I have been unable to figure out how to do this. Can anyone help/advise on either how to disable the glossary popups, or have a better solution?  Thank you!",

          "Text": "Dear All, Please can you help me with what is a very simple query and yet I cannot find a simple answer to the problem. The closest I got to an answer was a post in 2005 which managed to illicit the dreaded \"you can't do it\" answer. I am hoping some kind soul has changed the code since then? One of my Science Colleagues has set up each unit of her senior Biology course as separate Moodle courses. She has also set up a separate area called Toolkits where she has a glossary. Now what she wants to do is have direct access to the glossary in every course, but naturally only update it once with new changes. I thought I was being very smart (after the usual hours of trying to figure it out) by having the Sharing Cart installed. It works like a dream, its seamless!!! HOWEVER, when you make changes to the original glossary the copied glossary does not reflect the changes i.e. the glossaries are not linked. I did see a very early post by Martin suggesting that one puts a glossary on the front page , but this is just for the Biology category so that wont work. I might be missing something simple and if I am I assure you it is not from the want of trying and looking for the answer. Please help........or at least tell me that its absolutley not possible and maybe it might come in Moodle 2??? Thank you as always",

The impossibility to share glossaries (and other resources) between courses is in my opinion one of the main weak points of Moodle. I'm afraid the answer to your query is - as it was back in 2005 - \"You can't do it\". There have been in the past years a fair number of ventures to make Moodle resources shareable between courses, but those ventures often involve complicated workarounds and I have found none to be fully satisfactory. What is needed is a strong body of moodle users who do need this feature, are are vocal enough to make their voices heard, plus an institution (or group of institutions) with the manpower or money to contribute to the necessary development to make it happen. Maybe in moodle version 3.0... Joseph",

          "Text": "All still looking for a neater solution, I think there is a solution that can give you all you need in Moodle 1.9 or 2.0. Essentially, if the 'global' nature of glossaries is fixed first, then you could use the Random Glossary entry block as your connection to the glossary. Firstly you actually have to make global glossaries 'global' and Anthony Burrow created a patch for 1.9 for this at MDL-20131 , and I've attempted to modify this for 2.0.1 see discussion http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=89732 Once done, you can create a global glossary in a common resources course, likely using meta / child enrolments to keep the users the same in this donor course as in all its recipient courses, e.g. so that all the Biology students can see it (as suggested above). Now you add the Random Glossary Entry block to all those recipient courses, you rename the block and probably remove the randomness with the 'Last modified entry' setting. Now all your course participants can see the latest entry and click once to jump to the glossary itself, where they can add or view according to the permssions you've set for them. Very simple.

What I would really like to happen is that the clip appears to be embedded in the page rather than a link. If I upload via the site files the clip gets corrupted and won't play anywhere. If I create a folder in Moodle and put the files into it and then use the embed tag e.g. <embed src=\"http://moodle0/default/moodle/gloss_images/Blonde.wmv\" /> then on the edit page of the glossary I get exactly what I am after. The movie clip is embedded on the page and plays just fine. If I then click save changes and view the glossary the video clip seems to have disappeared entirely.

If you want fine control over the way that the media is embedded, then you can turn off the editor and insert what you like it seems. I just found (thanks) that turning off the editor allows you to insert just about anything. Here is a sample video that comes with ULEAD photoimpact, my image editor.

But when they browse by author, and say, their last name is \"Jones\", they will see all the authors whose last names start with \"J\" besides just themselves. Is it possible to restrict the browsing by author so that they would be able to see ONLY their own glossary entries? If not, then is it possible to only PRINT just their own entries.? My goal is to have students print a vocabulary study guide that they themselves created. This will allow students to, in a sense, create vocabulary and/or other types of study notes that belong only to them, and if needed, to share their notes with other students who have other notes. In that way, the entire class can collaborate, but they can also have their own private notes. I thought of using the database , but its print function is poor, only being able to export as Excel or ODS files. The glossary print function is much more robust. Thanks.",

Is the suggested \"work around\" in Glossary FAQ still applicable?  Does the 4th line in the work around mean you need to replace \" https://moodle.org/pluginfile.php/159/mod_forum/post/1157954/ (and only that) with something like        \"Mydomain.edu/images/ mean that that second word (images/) is to be added as well OR is that supposed to be a stand in for the name of the individual jpeg file? I ask because I tried doing this replacing the item on the left with the item on the right and the end result was the same as before I tried the work around.  It's been more than 25 years since I programed (in BASIC) so I know that a stray anything can make a world of difference.

          "Text": "Hi José, Autolinking used to work for HTML uploaded files in Moodle 1.9 (and previous versions). I have never used SCORM , so I cannot say if it worked for SCORM in Moodle 1.9. Did it work for you? See this discussion . Unfortunately in Moodle 2 autolinking no longer works in uploaded HTML files. This bug completely ruined my Moodle courses, which were based on uploaded HTML files containing lots of words needing autolinking to the course glossary. Fortunately (for me), this happened just when my university switched to Moodle 2 and at the time I retired from my teaching job! However, I am surprised there have not been more protests at this regression since Moodle 2 has gradually superseded previous versions. Reported as bug MDL-37830 for which you may vote. Joseph",

Then, I updated the version of PHP and headaches started . I applied the patch you mentioned and all become ok . In Moodle 2.x that patch is still required but , as you say , the HTML links to uploaded files are dead . I do not understand why the option is not available if it does not work ... Indeed , in some web pages explain how to activate the auto-link and it seem to work for them .... What am I doing wrong ? I've more than 500 courses with several SCORMs and HTML pages. Remove static links from SCORMs and find an alternative to glossary in uploaded files will be a nightmare. Any solution from official Moodle staff?????????",

Put your terms and definitions in a spreadsheet. Your first column should contain all the terms, the second all the definitions. The headers should be named “term” and “definition”. Make a dummy glossary entry in Moodle and export the glossary to your desktop. You will use this as your master XML Glossary file template. Open up the XML file in an HTML editor such as Frontpage or Dreamweaver (I used Frontpage at work – I’m sure Dreamweaver would work as well, I'll try when I get home). Minimize this; we’ll come back to it later. Open a new Word document, save as .txt file. (Important) Start a mail merge: Tools > Letters and Mailings > Mail Merge Choose the Directory option in Select document type (Step 1 of 6 in the merge wizard) Use the ENTRY item template below to set up your merge. We are interested in getting the items into the proper format for the XML file.

Don’t worry. Complete the merge (Step 6 of 6) All your entries are now nicely XML formatted.

I was very surprised no one had replied to your suggestion. But here I am, 7 years later, trying this method in Moodle 2.4 and finding that it works very nicely, even for someone who was not even aware of Mail Merge inside Word. To clarify her directions, for anyone who might like to try this in the future, during the Mail Merge process, you copy and paste the XML code that she has into your document. If you have named the column titles in your spreadsheet \"term\" and \"definition\" as she suggests, you do not need to do step 4 of 6 because the \"merge fields\" she speaks of are the items \"<<term>>\" and \"<<definition>>\" that are included in the XML you copied in. Step 4 is just necessary to create those two text strings, so that Word knows to insert one item from the \"term\" column where <<term>> is in the Word file, and same with definition. If you've titled your columns in your spreadsheet something else, you need to replace <<term>> with <<whatever your title is>> and same with <<definition>>. Thanks again, Kristi!",

          "Text": "Hi everyone. I'm finding the Glossary brilliant, however, I have a few quirks I would like to work on. We are using Moodle version 2.4+. When search full text is unchecked, Moodle still seems to search full text regardless (e.g. search for telephone with search full text option unchecked, and you'll still get results in which telephone is not part of the keyword). Suggestions? I really don't like the way that an auto-link appears. When a user clicks on an auto-link, It appears as a pop-up and is not scrollable (at least not horizontally). This is fine for short, text only entries, but not so great when an entry includes images or multimedia. I would like the auto-linking functionality so that: an entry opens as a hyperlink on a new window or tab; OR so that the pop-up is scrollable/can be expanded to the size of a full window. Has anyone succeeded in changing the way that auto-linked content appear? Looking forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, Peta Statham",

          "Text": "Hi Peter, Point #1: how \"search full text\" works in Glossary The wording of that option is misleading. Actually it means: Search full text not ticked = Search Concept (and Keywords) only Search full text ticked = Search Concept, Keywords and Definition . Point #2: how the definition popup is displayed Prior to Moodle 2, the popup window was a \"real\" window, which could display anything, was moveable, resizeable, etc. That was extremely useful. Unfortunately, it seems that such popup windows are now deprecated (not only in Moodle but everywhere on the Web). In Moodle 2, the Glossary popup \"real\" window has been replaced with an AJAX pseudo-window, with very limited functionality, as you have found out. I very much lament that fact, and have protested (in the bug tracker), but to no avail so far. In general, I am very irritated when an existing feature is replaced with a new feature which does not offer better or - at least - equivalent functionality. Joseph PS.- I have numbered your 2 points for the sake of clarity. Please follow the usual \"rule\" on forums: only one point per discussion .",

I noticed there was a bug reported a while ago, but couldn't see any fixes. I was also hoping to limit search results by searching using phrases. e.g. if I search for the term Change of Account, I would rather that Moodle search for 'change of account'. At the moment it seems to default to: 'change AND/OR of AND/OR account' I have tried using some of the techniques that would commonly be applied to Google and other searches (e.g. search for exact phrase) but all to no avail. If you have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them! Cheers and thanks, Peta",

What I want is the nice bold that you see on the concepts in 1.9 and the block, but I can't figure out how to do that when adding concepts to a glossary, I tried adding some HTML code around the concept, but the Moodle didn't seem to recognize it in that field (interestingly, it didn't display after saving the entry either). Any help would be great. Thank you very much for your help and for your time, Paul",

We tried the \"groupings\" as mentioned in here, but (1) I can't find any site administration level settings when I do a keyword search with keyword \"groupings\" (only came up with \"Version 1 import\" which I don't even know what that is). So I'm assuming that the \"groupings\" should be enabled by default in Moodle 2.4.6. Now, if this is enabled, I wonder why there is no such setting at the Glossary level for me to choose \"Groupings.\" I do have groupings set up at the course level, but couldn't find related setting in the Glossary level.

But I don't want student users to be able to edit glossary entries. Is there a way of allowing students on a course to export glossary entries without also permitting them to edit them?  It would be extremely laborious to go tinkering with lots of settings to see which combination works. At the very least I think the documentation for mod/glossary:exportentry should make this clear.  For that matter the Glossary FAQ http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Glossary_FAQ does not mention exporting glossary entries, only importing them.  The same is true of the Import/Export FAQ http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Import_and_export_FAQ",

One way for an \"ordinary teacher\" to find out about the Moodle version of their site is described in the documentation here . See also this discussion , especially the last post by Helen Foster. I personally disagree that displaying the moodle version would be a \"security issue\" and strongly advocate a return to a clear display of the version being used by a site, at the very least to teachers. You may add your vote to MDL-26852 . And what is your moodle version, then? The link you provide http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Using_Glossary leads nowhere. Now as regards that \"green arrow\", I see from your screenshot that it only appears if a \"Portfolio\" add-on is installed on your moodle site. I suggest you contact the author of the Portfolio add-on you are using (or ask your admin to do so) for any problem related to that add-on. Joseph",

          "Text": "I have recently migrated some tutorials to Moodle. In their former location they had a facility where the user could add URLs of referenced sites that they liked to a 'links basket' which they could then export at the end of the tutorial to add to their bookmarks or a file of links.  An experienced Moodle user suggested that I use a glossary to replicate this functionality in Moodle. I set up a glossary with the export feature enabled and added links to the relevant part of the glossary (anchored by initial letter of the glossary entry) from the main part of the tutorial.  It would have been nice if the 'autolinking' to the glossary could have been used here, but it didn't work because it just popped up an isolated definition without the chance to export the glossary entry.  Linking manually to the glossary as I've done is a reasonable substitute, though if you look at the tutorial on a laptop you tend to see only the header part of the glossary page rather than the entry! I have the impression that some at least of the functionality I've used is fairly new in Moodle (because it doesn't appear in older documentation).  So may I suggest the following ideas for future releases? a) a bit more flexibility in autolinking (e.g. optionally allowing you to export the glossary link, or taking you to a page of the glossary rather than a popup). b) a rather shorter header on glossary pages for glossary entries beginning with a particular letter.",

One way is to create a metacourse which includes the glossary, and having several child courses with students. 1. Autolink does not work from the metacourse glossary entries to the child course text. How do students know that the phrase is in the glossary? 2. In order to enter the glossary, students will have to switch from the child course to the relevant metacourse. Isn´t that confusing for students? 3. The platform wide glossary is no solution, as we have several countries and this way languages on the first level of course navigation, and in addition to that I (= admin) am not responsible for course content. Is it possible to have several glossaries defined in the context of a course category (e.g. = country)? Do you have any better solution to share one glossary across several courses?

The downside of this is that we can´t use autolink. But for us today, copying resources to several courses is the bigger pain (\"version chaos\").

This won't give you the definitions in the block. I was wondering how many terms you will have in this glossary.  If you have many, the block will become very long and take up a lot of space on the page even though it's down one side of the course page.

But in the gradebook, it continues to show \"1\" or \"100%\" for each student's grade no matter how many entries they have entered into the glossary.  We have tried using \"count of ratings\" and \"sum of ratings\" and they both still show \"1\" or \"100%\" in the gradebook. I thought it had to do with \"total grade\" or \"maximum points\" but that isn't showing anywhere in the glossary settings to even set a max. grade.

If <span class=\"nolink\"> WORD </span> is used to remove a word from the autolinking in the glossary then I guess <span class=\"link\"> ADD WORD </span> can be used to autolink the word. What I really want to do for my school students moodle is to autolink images so that when you click on the image it gives you the glossary entry. This is particularly true when we want to do work on key revision terms which we illustrate via images (see attached). Is it possible with some clever html to link the image via the alt tag eg if the alt tag has a word in this become the link to the glossary.

No, it does not work that way. The \"nolink\" class simply goes to a filter which prevents auto-linking. A \"link\" class does strictly nothing (as you have found out). Yours is an interesting suggestion, but would need some development. I have no idea what the picture you appended to your post means. If your need is to create an activity in which your students would associate an image with a \"definition/description/...\", then have you thought about the following: Use the matching questions in the Lesson or the Quiz activities . Install the Flash Card Set activity. Joseph",

          "Text": "In order to give students permission to rate, we have to go into the permissions section.  Could there not be a checklist on the glossary form? Well, the Forums settings also use the permissions section in the same manner, so this is not proper to the Glossary module. In permissions, there is a plus icon for allow and there is a plus icon for prohibit.  That is strange. Nothing strange here. Take a closer look at the Column headings: So if you click on the + icon in the Roles with permission column this will enable you to add a role with Permission (=Allow=; but if you click on the + icon in the Prohibited colum, this will enable you to add a \"prohibited\" role. Everything is very well explained on the next screen after clicking those + icons I should think. When I switch role to student,  they can delete and edit an entry that I, as administrator, created. Bad. They can add comments. Good. But they cannot give a rating. Bad. Although the \"switch role to... (student)\" is a very useful feature for testing how things will look like to a student in a Moodle course, what you see and the actions you can perform are never guaranteed to be identical to what a real student will see or be able to do when logged in. This is the case of the particular scenario you mention. When testing things on a Moodle site, my advice is always to log in with a \"real\" student role. Hope that helps, Joseph",

Have you already tried showentry.php?displayformat=dictionary& eid =<glossary entry id for 'concept'> ? This solution depends on the database of the Moodle instance: the drawback is that you cannot distribute your SCORM content in several instances without changing the eid for each Moodle instance.

          "Text": "Well, thank you for seperating the questions. I thought they were related so I asked in the same post. My objective is to remove 'browse by authors.' This is for an online class where people don't know each other. The instructor wants the students to add items in glossary and have other students rate it. We want the glossary posting to be sort of as anonymous as we can get, so that students can rate it without knowing who posted it. So basically rate not for the person who is posting, but for the content of the posting. (I hope that makes sense). As for hacking the core moodle files, I will speak to my institution, however, I doubt the answer will be yes. However, I would like to know how it can be done. Thank you!",

          "Text": "This is something I was wondering about too (using Moodle 2.3).  It seems irrelevant for students to be able to browse by author if there is only one author, and \"browse by category\" is irrelevant if categories aren't used. To avoid hacking core files, I'm wondering if creating a plugin is the best way to do this.  It appears that filters only alter user-readable text (?), in which case they wouldn't do, unless one could get them to alter HTML, which would let one make the irrelevant tabs disappear.  If not, I'm thinking that a \"local\" plugin might be the best way. Another way would be to put JavaScript in the theme that would search for the tabs from their title tags (since they don't have IDs) and set their CSS properties to invisible, but that would be a really ugly way to do it.  Or another \"ugly hack\" way to go about it would be to put one's own filter function around $OUTPUT->main_content() in the layout; you could replace any particular string of HTML you didn't like that way. Anyhow, if anyone has found a good way to deal with this issue, please let us know your experience, as I'm sure there are lots of people who would want to make those tabs go away if they aren't relevant for a given glossary.",

The only options for how to display items was (random / last modified entry / next item)  which meant that if items needed to be presented in a specific order that had to be the order they were first uploaded into the glossary.  This is necessary if you plan on putting 2 glossaries in sync (puzzle today and yesterday's solution). At the time (2009) I was told that Moodle 2.0 would allow for that type of presentation (alphabetical).  QUESTION: Does Moodle 2.x do that?  My school's version doesn't but that could be (most probably is) because the admin hasn't checked something or downloaded something that is in Moodle 2.x.

One workaround (for Moodle 1.9) in your case is as follows - tried and tested, it works! In your Glossary settings, Grade, select 24 . When you grade your students' entries, give each entry a score of 24/24 if it's OK for you and 0/24 otherwise. When you have submitted all those Glossary grades, if you go to the Gradebook you will see that the students get a grade out of 24, which I hope is what you wanted. Example: if for one student you grade 18 of his 24 entries 24//24 and grade the remaining 6 entries 0/24, his final score for that activity will be 18/24. See attached screenshot. Hope that helps.

It's heartbreaking. I'm off work for a week and thought I could upgrade and add some input. Instead I've been sitting here for 4 days trying to work out why things don't work. This error suggests that the database issue is indeed causing problems, unless you know better........ Can anyone help? Thanks, Brian",

I don't know anything about databases but it obviously refers to a field name. I've spent some time looking at every file that might relate to the glossary and in mod/glossary/db/install. xml there is what appears to be a list of fields or tables that moodle creates at install. The field referred to in the error message and in import.php isn't one of the fields moodle thinks it has to set up. That's if I'm right. It's hard to believe I am, as otherwise this would affect everybody who downloaded this version, and I see no other comments. However, thoughts anybody?",

          "Text": "Hi All, The issue of putting up a front page Random Glossary Entry block with its content sourced from a global Glossary in another course has not gone away in Moodle 2.0, and Antony Borrow's patch won't actually run correctly in Moodle 2 because things have moved round a bit! But I have had just the same problem as others above and I've modified Anthony's patch to fix this. I don't have the tools to creating a patch to hand at present, so I will list the code edits here. Perhaps a proper patch will come in due course. All these edits follow Anthony's patch closely, or emulate the same thing at least. In file /blocks/glossary_random/edit_form.php we change the line: $glossaries = $DB->get_records_menu('glossary', array('course' => $this->block->course->id), 'name', 'id,name'); to $glossaries = $DB->get_records_select_menu('glossary', 'course = '.$this->block->course->id.' OR globalglossary = 1', NULL, 'name', 'id,name'); so that global glossaries can now be found in the block's config page. We then make a fair number of small edits to the file /blocks/glossary_random/blocks_glossary_random.php but there are too many to list so I've attached this file. This file replaces the one in Moodle 2.0.1 in fact. Now the random glossary entries taken from another course appear in the front page block, so long as the user has the right to view the content in the donor course. This implies that the administrator will want to be very sure that all bona fide users have moodle/course:view rights there. Well it solved my problem. John",

          "Text": "Hi, I have found one bug in my fix (above) which I will seek to fix properly when I get the opportunity. Its where I inserted an extra check to see if the user has the right to see the glossary entry, within the donor course, before displaying any content. The main effect of inserting this bit was to block the glossary view to someone not logged on. In fact I was being fooled into thinking this was working, probably by 'sessions' on my computer. So for the moment we need to change back one in my block_glossary_random.php edits... To make this change open the file I gave above, look for //Obtain the visible property from the instance, and the user's right to view the content and put the next phrase back to being: if (isset($cm->uservisible) && $cm->uservisible) { $this->content->text = $this->config->cache; ...in other words we're getting rid of the condition... && has_capability('moodle/course:view', get_context_instance(CONTEXT_MODULE, $cm->id)) ...don't accidentally insert a closing } or things will really foul up! The effect of this is that the glossary entry is visible to all , so long as the glossary itself is 'visible' in its own course. For the most part this is probably the setting admins would want anyway, as it is a good way of making the pre-login face attractive without giving away loads of content. But I will do some more research on this issue. This fix is running on www.3dstorytelling.co.uk/Exchange John",

But when you export a glossary with images in the entries using the XML option, the images are not stored as part of the XML file as the are with the moodle XML format for questions as in the question module of moodle. I believe this would  be a natural feature to add to the XML import and export for the glossary moodule so that you could copy a glossary of a particular subject area from your class to a different class easily. I started a issue tracker for this, but it was closed. See MDL-28526 I thought this should get more input from the moodle community. So I have posted this thread here.",

          "Text": "Hi there, As an English as a foreign language teacher, one of the things I use a Glossary for is grammar/vocabulary/captialisation corrector for common mistakes. Unfortunately most students don't seem to notice the underlined/highlighted words in their published posts. I feel it would be pedagogically more effective if the underlining/highlighting were done in real time as they type - as is done in spelling correctors. In TinyMce I can't even recommend they install and use the Firefox spelling corrector - far too complicated to explain how to do it. Am I asking for the moon? Is it just a pipe dream like the possibility of delivering a (small) electric shock over the Internet every time students write, for example, \"since two years\"? Cheers, Glenys",

Sound L2 pedagogy. I have an alternative solution. I have embedded virtualwritingtutor.com 's index page into a metacourse. Virtualwritingtutor.com is the only free online grammar checker I know of that specifically addresses L2 writing errors. Try embedding this code into either a label or webpage: <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"1200\" src=\"http://virtualwritingtutor.com/index.php\"></iframe> It is a whole lot faster that using a glossary to check text.",

My suggestion about the iframe was to add the code to a label you create and that students have access to. You set it up using your role as teacher. Students use it to check their text. I also noticed that it has trouble with apostrophes and wants to escape them. Perhaps, this issue will be resolved. There is an email address for suggested improvements. I am tempted to say that this limitation doesn't matter as the goal seems to provide corrective feedback, not to spit back error-free text--a pedagogical advantage to my mind since it provides the location of the error, the nature of the error, and a suggestion for correcting it. The job of actually correcting errors remains with the learner. With Word, when it catches an error, learners can simply right-click and the correction is automatic. > I couldn't get it to highlight my deliberate errors What were your deliberate errors? I am eager to see the limitations of this resource, both in terms of language pedagogy and usability . Thanks, Nick",

Currently thinking on good pedagogy has it that  languages are learned most efficiently through a combination of attention to form and the exchange of meaningful messages in communicative contexts. Attention only to form through rote learning outside of a communicative act is not expected to lead to what we call creative automaticity. In other words, learners are unlikely to be able to deploy memorized chunks in new contexts as they arise in the heat of conversation because knowledge is adapted to the environment in which it was acquired. Cognition is situated. Therefore, teachers try to situate learning in contexts that more closely resemble the communicative contexts in which the knowledge will be needed. Moodle forums, chats, wikis, peer-reviews and its many other marvelous features help to situate learning in communicative contexts. Adding automatic corrective feedback on errors to communicative exchanges allows learners to test and revise their hypotheses about the form of their messages in situ. The old-fashioned way needs an update.",

This may work for some and not for others. And one doesn't know until one makes a considerable attempt (and one can't even know for sure what counts as considerable). I, too, think that adding automatic corrective feedback on errors to communicative exchanges allows learners to test and revise their hypotheses about the form of their messages in situ. But automatic corrective feedback may be as simple as 'sorry, you got it wrong, please try again'.

This file didn't exist in the 1.9.12 version and doesn't exist in a clean install, and there is no option to delete this in the Manage Filters section. So where is the error coming from?

It is not clear whether you noticed the \"mod/glossary/dynalink.php is missing\" error message when you did the upgrade (i.e. last year) or just now. If you noticed this last year, why are  you reporting this today only? Maybe the error message is being displayed following the restoring of older courses to your current moodle site? What is the complete history of your moodle site? Which version of Moodle was it first created with, and which successive upgrades did you do? Is this error message displayed each time you visit Your site administration >> Plugins >> Filters >> Manage filters ? Does it prevent your glossary hyperlinking from working on your site? This is the most important thing, after all. Please provide a screenshot of the complete Site administration ► Plugins ► Filters ► Manage filters page, showing the error message and the list of your installed filters. Joseph",

I see that one way to get around this is to make each of my topics a separate \"course.\"  But conceptually, they aren't really courses, they're just part of one course. So what I'm wondering is how to do one of the following? 1) Put a glossary inside of a topic instead of making it it's own. or 2) Customize the numbering so that, for example, the glossary can be \"topic 2a\" and then the next topic would be \"topic 2b\" so that the one after that comes out as topic \"3\" instead of being \"4.\" PS - If I go ahead and make my topics into separate \"courses\" but use the automatic linking feature in the glossary, presumably that won't work, right?  ...

If you want all of the various course glossary entries to be accessible from any course on your moodle site, the obvious solution is to NOT have course glossaries at all, but just ONE comprehensive Global Glossary on the front page. If you'd still like your entries to be \"grouped\" by course, just use Categories inside the Global Glossary, called \"Course 01, Course 02, etc.). How are glossaries used in your moodle courses: a) glossary entries are hyperlinked in the text resources so that students can click on the hyperlinked words to see the definitions; b) students actually browse the glossaries?

Actually, I haven't implemented yet glossaries in my Moodle platform so I was trying to figure out the best approach for my case: your suggestions are really appreciated! The long version of my need is: in this web site, italian students learn the Japanese language step-by-step, starting from the greetings, then the first words (e.g. about daily life) and so on; each course introduces a set of new words, so I'd like to give an easy entry point for this set to my students (and this implies to create a course glossary, I suppose) and, at the same time, I'd love to give them a comprehensive glossary as a facility if they want to search for a word or if they simply want to use it as a review resource (and this implies that, as long as I write new words in my course glossaries, the same words flow also into the global glossary). I understood your suggestions but I don't know exactly how to bend the front page-global glossary also to a \"local\" course usage... If someone clicks on the global glossary in the front page, then he/she should see the comprehensive glossary. If someone else clicks on the course-version of this global glossary, then the category corresponding to the course should be shown to the user (and it would simulate a course glossary): am I completely wrong? Now the answers to your questions: (a) is the way I want to use glossaries and I'm using a Moodle 2.1. Thank you so much for your support, good night! Nicola",

I'm not getting any postgres errors but I did notice in the glossaries that some key word terms were entered incorrectly. eg instead of a new line they were entered with commas.

Students can now edit entries that they did not create (as long as the Glossary creator has allowed editing to be available in the Glossary set-up). 2. Students cannot change any of the settings of Glossary activity itself. 3. Students will not be listed as the \"author\" of the entry they edit.  You will need to figure out some other way for students to be recognized for contributing to specific entries (if that matters to you). Maybe they can leave some sort of comment in the comments area for the entry...

I am attaching a \"fake\" screenshot; is that what you would like to see? On a more general principle, I do not think it would be logical to have a glossary where the entries would consist of words in different languages (as in my attached example) and would therefore need more than a single alphabet listing to appear. I cannot imagine dictionaries (paper or online) where entries would be in mixed languages. However, what might be quite useful is to have the possibility, in each individual glossary settings, to select - for the alphabetical listing - between the languages available on the moodle site being used. So you might have: an English - Russian dictionary with entries in English and the English alphabetical listing a Russian-English dictionary with entries in Russian and the Russian alphabetical listing an all-Russian glossary with entries and definitions in Russian and the Russian alphabetical listing etc. Please anyone interested let's have your views.

The need for such functionality comes from existing online glossaries (in other platforms) that are used in many academic courses in our university. On the principal level - I believe that the need for such functionality is very important in counties with alphabet different to English. In such places students often need to know the \"English\" way diff rent terms are written. Example 1: A higher education course in chemistry in which the teacher wants to teach the students scientific terms (in English) that are commonly used in academic papers. In the same glossary the teacher also wants to have the same terms in Hebrew, so students who read academic papers in Hebrew or English will know them in both ways. Example 2: A course about famous music composers. the English way of writing the composer name is important but also the Hebrew (the local language) way is needed. Does it help to explain the need?

          "Text": "Hello All, As like many moodlers I have extensive glossaries, which are auto-linked within my other resources, the ' lesson module' is the most heavily affected. I have students ask me this question quite frequently and thought this to be a good idea to action some changes on my site: \"How do I turn the glossary links off? It makes reading the text difficult\" And to be honest, I'd agree! Auto-linking to the glossary is a Great feature! However there are downsides..... Within Diploma/Degree level courses where a lot of textual content is a requirement it's an arduous job manually using the nolink features or \"<span class=\"nolink\">term</span>\" for each word (or indeed page) I do not think should be linked. Aside from this being a long winded task, it means I have to make the decision whether a term should or should not be linked. Although this really should be the decision of the student. Students are at different levels, expertise and backgrounds. Many are from all around the world where English is the NOT their first language. The qualifications however, are taught in English as per the examining bodies requirements. Students also have different learning styles and preferences, some use the linked terms in the glossaries heavily, others not at all. So to my point - Shouldn't the feature to turn on/off the auto-linking for glossary terms to available for the student to toggle according to their personal preference? Well I think so..... and I was wondering what other moodlers, teachers and admins alike think about providing this as an option to the student. I'm still running a heavily customised 1.8.8 Moodle.....Upgrading to 1.9 isn't really an option and the jump to Moodle 2, well let's just say is problematic for us at present. Regardless of which version of Moodle you are using, I don't believe this is an option in ANY version for the student to turn off/on the glossary auto-linking feature. Unless of course I'm mistaken? I was hoping someone may have developed or hacked-up the code to allow for this.... If there are people out there with a solution I'd be very happy to get hold of it!! I'd very much like to see this as a feature. Does anyone else have any thoughts about this? All the best ;) Steve",

Here's an example of what the style now looks when doing some glossary terms tests. We use a lot of health and safety terminology and it's quite repetative within course text. You'll notice the word Safety appears a number of times but only the first word 'safety' term is highlighted. The dotted underline is not as prominent making reading easier. The hover on mouse over changes the background colour to grey (this only happens on mouseover, again much easier to read as this background previously was always visible before the changes to css) Terms after css change Terms before css change (for comparison) As you can see making changes to the css style really helped with readability! Imagine this in an A4 sized page stuff with glossary terms.... it's very difficult to read. I hope it helps someone, it's just a simply tweak and it's much easier on the eyes. Steve",

My current version seems incapable of doing this.  I can paste arabic script into the definitions box during the \"edit\" phase, but the script is displayed as a series of \"?\" after finishing the editing.  I tried different formats: moodle auto format, html, plain text, and markdown format.  Nothing works! First, I would like to know if I can have a glossary that mixes languages in the definition portion.  If so, how would I do this?  Second, I can see that incorporating different script into glossaries seems reoccur regularly.  Is there any documentation that discusses this issue?

As far as keeping the colors typed in the TinyMICE for instructions, labels, etc, it did not work for glossary linked words, only words not in the glossary. For example: The bird flew through the window. If bird was in the glossary and flew was not, flew would stay blue but bird would flip back to black because it is in the glossary. Any ideas on where !important should be placed? I tried it in various places to no avail. I am just starting with web development so thanks for the tip on Firebug. I have just begun using it.

Are you absolutely sure of what you are seeing? Do you clean the themes cache after you switch themes? 4.- In the zebra theme, all links are underlined throughout the moodle site/course that uses that theme. So this is not a problem with the glossary autolinks only. If you do not want glossary autolinks to be underlined, then simply do not use a theme that underlines them. Joseph",

To have the same theme running throughout each course is one, boring for the student to look at and two makes it difficult for students and myself to remember which course we are in without looking at the top of the screen for reference. Do most Moodlers only use 1 theme throughout their site and courses? I thought with Moodle 2.0 and the My Moodle page, people would be allowed to choose different themes according to their choice. 2) I understand these are not standard Moodle Themes . I uploaded them from Moodle.org. 3) Discuss and Artic do have underlined glossary words, even after purging the site and going directly to that theme. The glossary words could be underlined due to the non-standard themes on my site. 4) Thanks for the this, I did not realize it and it could be a cause of #3 as well. I am going to contact the developer of these themes but will probably just choose different themes, it is what I have done in the past but I was hoping there would be a way around it. Thanks, Jeff",

This is not a huge thing but I wonder if such capability exists? Thanks for your time, Roy C.",

          "Text": "We have a large Moodle support glossary which has embedded images, and attached files. While the glossary contains only text (and no attachments or embedded media) I can export it as XML and do bulk edits in the XML but as soon as I attach files it appears that I can't edit the glossary outside of Moodle. Does anyone know of a way that I can edit the glossary in an XML format and still maintan the links to the attached files or embedded media?  Thus far I have tried editing the BACKUP file and then using RESTORE but the results have not been sucessful. The background is that the glossary is based on the excellent Moodle FAQ from the University of Bath at http://moodle.bath.ac.uk/faq/ They have made it available to others as an Open Educational Resource http://andyramsden.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/oer-faq-database/ Thus far I have massaged their XML file to get it into a format that the Moodle glossary will read. Editing the XML is useful as bulk changes can be made throughout the file but it appears that as soon as we attach files to the glossary entries or embeded media we are forced to edit the files only in the Moodle Glossary interface. We will be talking about our progress at the upcoming Australian MoodleMoot. http://moodlemoot.org.au/ Peter Evans Moodle support at ANU",

The autolinking configurations have varied a little bit from version to version, so this info would be helpful. In the meantime, here are a few things to try: 1) Here's a link to a discussion a while back talking about problems with linking when text was copied from a source outside of Moodle: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=25746#121341 2) I've found on occasion that auto-linking is not retroactive, so that if an entry is posted after a resource, for instance, that resource will not contain the links. BUT, resources and assignments posted after the glossary entry should have the links available. 3) I do have autolinking working in one of my courses on a site using 1.6.2. If you are using this version, I'll post a shot of how I have the admin configuration set up. If you're using an earlier version, this info wouldn't be very helpful, so I'll wait to hear back from you first. Regards, Lesli",

By looking, in the HTML code of the wiki pages I noticed that the URL addresses  generated in the two cases were not the same.

Is there any way  for me to go back to nolinking and then to auto-link afresh properly?  I would like to do it myself for my pages, without bothering the moodle administrator.

First, enclose the files in a folder called \"forvo\" before compressing. This way, when people extract it to their filter folder in their Moodle installation, it will be ready to go and web masters will have one less step to worry about. You can call the compression whatever you like, but the extracted folder should be named consistently. A few other developers tend to name the uncompressed folders of their plugins after the latest version and users have to rename them. It's a bit of a nuisance and can cause confusion for people who don't know what's going on. I was going to suggest not putting a Forvo link in the Filters menu, but I see that Emoticons and Media plugins have links there, so I guess you're in good company. I'm not quite sure how to use the filter for what I want, but it has given me the notion that if I look long enough, I can probably find something in the Glossary files to tweak to get the effect I'm after. Supposedly, understanding how your filter hijacks Glossary's code to do that will help in that quest.",

It's either every instance or only the first instance so far. I wonder if it would be possible to have, someday, a force autolinking button to go with the prevent autolinking button, so that additional instances could be linked if desired.

Anyway, Main or Secondary glossaries are only available in the courses where they reside. If you want to show random glossary entries on your Moodle front page you'll have to create a glossary on the front page, to select random entries from. Joseph Edited by JR Sorry about the confusion in my post, Emerson. Here is the correct information (hopefully). In any Moodle course (and on the front page as well) you can have glossaries which can be Main, Secondary and optionally Global. The only Help is somewhat useful to understand this rather confusing terminology. Anyway, here goes. If you create a Glossary in any course (or on your Moodle site front page) and you tick the Global box in the settings, then that \"Global Glossary\" will be available everywhere on your Moodle site (on the site front page and in each of the site's courses). Please note that you have to be logged in as Admin to be able to tick that box. \"Available\" means that any piece of text - anywhere on your site - which contains a word that is an entry in that \"Global Glossary\" will have that word automatically linked to that glossary. Unfortunately, and that was your initial problem, a Global Glossary is only available to the Random Glossary entry block in the course where it resides and where the Random Glosssary block resides as well. That is a bug feature of Moodle. To create your Random Glosssary block on your site's front page, follow Jon's advice, and create a glossary on your front page (it does not need to be set to Global if you only want to use it for the Random block feature).

          "Text": "Emerson, You can check the little question marks in Moodle next to the features. They are very helpful. Glossary type: Defining the main glossary of the course The glossary system allows you to export entries from any secondary glossary to the main one of the course. In order to do this, you need to identify one glossary as the main one. Note: You can only have one main glossary per course. Before Moodle 1.7, only Teachers could edit the main glossary. In Moodle 1.7 and later, if you wish to control who can edit any glossary (including the main one) you need to use the Override roles interface. 2. Global: Defining a global glossary Only administrators, and other users with the capability site:doanything allowed, can define a glossary to be global. Any course may contain a global glossary (but particularly the front page). The difference to a normal local glossary is that the entries are used to create automatic links throughout the whole site (and not just in the same course the glossary belongs to). 3. Random glossary: We have 1.9 and when an admin turns editing on in the Front Page, another topic box opens at the top and allows adding resources or activities ... so you could add a glossary there.  Once you add something to that topic box, it will remain open when you turn the editing off. Hope that helps.",

It still exists in 2.0.1 so I have modified Anthony's patch to give a similar solution there too, as we plainly need Global Glossaries to mean Global . With the patch, users who have the right to view the course content where the glossary exists will see the random glossary entries on the front page. In the original patch its possible that ALL would see the entries on the front page (this probably needs an additional 'switch' in the block config, eventually, so that Admin can make a choice about this issue).

This doesn't look like a theme issue and is there any way to change them back to the grey boxes ... easily in terms for coding dummies please Regards Allan",

In the standard theme, the whole glossary autolink background is gray, it's not just a \"box\". However, it seems that most (if not all) of the 2.0 themes (other than standard) have chosen to not display the glossary autolinks on a grey background, probably because their designers felt that it is too obtrusive (and I agree with them). If you absolutely want to display your glossary autolinks on a colored background, you'll have to modify one of your theme's CSS files. Which theme are you using in your moodle 2.0 courses? If you let me know I'll tell you what to change - if you tell me what color you want. Joseph",

I cannot see any options to create a skin (interface) that will have a glossary FRONT for the database I create. At the moment I have setup a dictionary using glossary and then when I add each new word, in the KEYWORDS section I add a translation in Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese. Now when I search a word, I can search by any language. THe problem though is that all languages show up at the same time (no button to select the language I want) and English is ALWAYS the main language. I'd like Chinese learners, for example, to be able to access the dictionary in Chinese and then get an English translation of the word. I could set up an excel file in each language and then import into 3 or 4 different glossaries. The students could then select which glossary they would like to access. It would be nice though if I could link all of the glossaries together. Any suggestions? thanks Steve",

It offers the powerful feature to automatically generate autolinks to the entries in many of the various resources and activities on a moodle course. If you need to retain the autolink feature, then you would need to enter your \"dictionary\" into a glossary. But... buidling a glossary or dictionary is a tough task, it is really a job for professional lexicographers. On top of that you want your glossary to be multilingual, which will stretch things even further. If, on the other hand, you do not need the autolink feature and all you want is to provide your students with an online multilingual dictionary, the simplest solution is to provide in your courses a link (or links) to one or more online dictionaries - there are plenty available, in all the languages you need.

I have a course with a glossary working beautifully. The course also contains a book module. My question is: Is there any way of not linking the Chapter titles in a book? I have used the html: <span class=\"nolink\"> ... question text goes here ... </span> in other situations successfully, however I can't seem to find the html for the chapter title and therefore can't edit it. Here's an example of a linked title: and here's a screen shot of where the chapter title is inserted: Has anyone encountered this problem before? Or do we just live with a linked title?

You cannot just import the Moodle Glossary activity into a non-Moodle website, because that activity requires the Moodle API. You can only export a Moodle Glossary's data and re-import that data into a database of some sort which is available on your other website and link that database to some PHP (or Java or Javascript ) script which will retrieve the data and display it on your website. It is not a trivial operation. Joseph",

I can go into any course (within any Catagory) and see the Global Glossary words highlighted in grey. So far so good, but here's the problem: When I click on a grey highlighted link it opens a window but doesn't desplay the glossary term. Instead it shows in the 'Link-chain' (I don't know the actual term but it is the link bar below the header of the page showing how I got from the front page to the current page) that it is trying to search glossary terms for the course I'm in. Which there are none because the Global Glossary is on the Front Page. Ex of 'link-chain': frontpage->coursecategory->search I checked the source on one of the links and this is what it showed: <a class=\"glossary autolink glossaryid4\" title=\"Masters Program Glossary: Blood\" href=\" http://mysite.com/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7&amp;concept=Blood \" Xonclick=\"return openpopup('/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7\\&amp;concept=Blood', 'entry', 'menubar=0,location=0,scrollbars,resizable,width=600,height=450', 0);\">Blood</a> I think to find the Global Glossary listings it needs to search the front page.

The entries are indeed highlighted in all courses and in the session listing the courses in my front page, BUT a word definition is shown on the pop up window ONLY if it is on the text corresponding to the front page. If the same word belongs to the \"Available Courses\" area of the front page or the \"categories\" area of the front page the pop up window comes up but the definition for the word is not shown. Also when the definition s shown, it doesn't wrap (text) properly on the pop up window size. Can I change window size or assign text wrapping? I believe the attempt to make the glossary GLOBAL meaning available anywhere in the moodle installation failed to show the word definitions,while it worked to highlight them in the context of all courses etc. Is there a proper method on how to make the Primary Glossary available to all courses, (all installation) ?

Question #1 As Glenys says in her reply, the look of the auto-linked words is controled by the visual theme you are using on your Moodle site. Which theme are you using? Here in these moodle.org forums, auto-linked words look like this: constuctivism. They are simply underlined with a dotted line. If the visual theme you are using does not display autolinks the way you like you can a) switch to another theme or b) learn CSS styling and change just that style yourself. For example, the following CSS rule, added to the current moodle.org stylesheets will result in the autolinked words to look blue when hovered over (see attached screenshot). \n```text\n.glossary.autolink:hover {color:blue!important;}\n```\n Joseph",

          "Text": "Hello all, One our trainer who's a glossary enthousiast stumbled upon a combination of glossary settings which result in the glossary entry not being displayed. He switched on the 'automatically linking' and uses the 'entry list' display format. When clicking on an entry from the list, a popup screen appears with only: [-] navigation / bread crumbs; [-] the title of the glossary entry as a link; [-] button to close the window. We tried a few things and found out that when the 'automatically linking' setting is switched off for this forum, the entry is displayed correctly in the pop up screen (where the glossary title is displayed black and is not a link). We remain wondering if we are doing something wrong or if our Moodle perhaps displays an oddity. FYI , we're using moodle 1.9.1",

          "Text": "Hi all, I have a small development project about to get underway regarding glossary and am wondering if people would want this feature in core Moodle (2.0 or 2.1) so I thought I'd post here to see. Basically the idea is, a global glossary search for teachers which they can use to find definitions in other courses on the site, that might be relevant to their own course (ie so they can copy/paste it). The intention is, let's say you are working on a science course and you are about to write a glossary definition for 'photosynthesis', then you think, hang on, we've done loads of other courses, I bet somebody already wrote one. So you search across the whole site or across the Science category, you find one, you copy it, then just add a new glossary entry as usual, paste it in, and maybe tweak it a bit to be more relevant to your course. So there would be a link from the glossary to a 'search across glossaries' page. You would then be able to choose to search all glossaries across all courses in (a) the current category, or (b) any parent category, or (c) the whole site. The search would just be on the glossary term (wildcards permitted, so you could search for 'photosy*' if you're lazy or if you think other teachers probably misspelt it), and not a full text search. Results would be shown as normal paged results 10 at a time or whatever, you could click on them to go to the glossary entry or just copy/paste it straight from the page if desired. There might be a button you could click next to a glossary entry to add it to your own glossary, this would just open up the glossary add form, with the text from the existing entry filled in, so you could edit it and hit save. I haven't figured out quite how permissions should work, but presumably it would only include results from glossaries you are allowed to actually see. The link itself would appear to anyone who's allowed to add entries in the current glossary. I can code this thing locally just for us, but if there is an interest in having this in Moodle 2 core (and if I can agree it with Martin etc) then it would be nice to add it to that. Seems to me it might be useful to other sites.",

That is the glossary in the second topic, you should do automatic link in the words that are inside this topic 2. 2. Sign the word \" flame \" in the glossary.

I have one on the right sidebar, which I use as a 'term of the day' feature. The entries in the (main) glossary that the terms are pulled from range from short text definitions to longer ones including pictures. All are set to 'encyclopedia' style. The size (both horizontal and vertical) of the random entry block varies greatly depending on which entry has been selected. What I would *like* it to do, is truncate the definition after a line or two (all begin with text), ending with ellipses, and have the entry title link to the full entry in the glossary. However, I can't find a way to pre-set how much of the entry is to appear, or to get the entry heading (title) to link. At the very least, is there a way to lock the size of my sidebars so that they do not squish my course up more or less depending on the entry showing? [In my search of previous topics before I posted this, I did find that you can't set the height of the box, but I thought this was a slightly different issue. I don't mind if the exact height of the box fluctuates a little, I just don't want my whole sidebar taken up when the longer entries are showing]",

However, for what it's worth, it is my feeling that the random glossary entries block was never meant for anything else than short, text-only, entries. Something like \"thought of the day\", \"proverb of the week\", etc. If your entries do contain images which are wider than the right (or left) column \"normal\" width, then all sort of weird things will happen. I can only recommend to use, in the random glossary entries block, special glossaries with no images (or only thumbnail images no wider than something like 120 pixels) and a limited amount of text in the definitions.

You talk of \"topic outline page\" and \"topic title\", but these objects do not exist in Moodle. Do you mean \"topic summary\"? If so, let me re-phrase your problem and suggest a solution. In your course glossary you have an entry for \"Web\" (and that entry is set to This entry should be automatically linked ). The \"summary\" for your Topic 1 is \"Learn all about the Web\" That \"summary\" is of course displayed showing the autolink to the Glossary entry \"Web\". Is that what you do not want displayed? Edit Topic 1 summary. In the HTML editor, select \"Learn all about the Web\", click on the Prevent automatic linking button and save. The automatic link has disappeared. If this is not what you want, please explain better what your problem is, provide screenshots, concerte examples, etc. Joseph",

          "Text": "Hi Mary, Unfortunately there is no way to \"un-approve\" approved student entries in the glossary through Moodle's teacher/admin interface. However, if you have an access to your moodle site database , you can easily do it as follows. As usual, please backup your glossary before you do anything you might regret. identify the glossary instance's course-module id ; it appears when you view a glossary, something like \"/moodle/mod/glossary/view.php? id=27 \" Supposing that the glossary you want to update has that course-module id = 27, using phpMyAdmin or similar tool, type the following sql request: UPDATE mdl_glossary_entries SET approved = '0' WHERE glossaryid = (SELECT instance AS glossaryinstance from mdl_course_modules WHERE id = ' 27 ') AND mdl_glossary_entries.teacherentry = 0 When you view your glossary after the request has been executed you will notice that the \" Waiting approval (99) \" message appears again at the top right of your glossary view window. The reason for the mdl_glossary_entries.teacherentry = 0 condition in the sql request is that we do not want teacher entries to be unapproved, only those entered by the students, of course! Hope that helps, Joseph",

The have made their free glossary generator Moodle friendly. Link: http://dictionary.k12opened.com/ Allows users to build a typical glossary with definitions. Will download in several formats …including Moodle xml format How to blog entry: http:// www.k12opened.com/blog/archives/305 Users type in words for glossary. Website program will add the definitions that are on file. Users can edit those or add their own if any of their words don't have a definition yet. When list is complete, click on Moodle tab at the top of the page. When the link comes up to download the export , right click and save as somewhere easy to find. Import the file into your glossary!

I suppose the courses on your moodle site can only be accessed by logged on users? Create a new course, name it e.g. \"Global Glossary Course\". Make that course \"not available to Students\" In that course, create a Glossary, set it to Global. Results: that global glossary will not be visible to un-logged users no-one will be able to access that glossary (except admin and, if you enrol them, teachers) no-one will be able to add entries or comments or ratings to that glossary (except admin & teachers) I hope this is what you want.

I can go into any course (within any Catagory) and see the Global Glossary words highlighted in grey. So far so good, but here's the problem: When I click on a grey highlighted link it opens a window but doesn't desplay the glossary term. Instead it shows in the 'Link-chain' (I don't know the actual term but it is the link bar below the header of the page showing how I got from the front page to the current page) that it is trying to search glossary terms for the course I'm in. Which there are none because the Global Glossary is on the Front Page. Ex of 'link-chain': frontpage->coursecategory->search I checked the source on one of the links and this is what it showed: <a class=\"glossary autolink glossaryid4\" title=\"Masters Program Glossary: Blood\" href=\" http://mysite.com/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7&amp;concept=Blood \" onclick=\"return openpopup('/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=7\\&amp;concept=Blood', 'entry', 'menubar=0,location=0,scrollbars,resizable,width=600,height=450', 0);\">Blood</a> I think to find the Global Glossary listings it needs to search the front page.

In other words, if I have a page with 10 instances of the word 'Hello' on it, is it possible to just have the first hello highlighted? Otherwise the page may look a bit... 'highlighty'.

I agree that it should be possible to have hidden glossaries, but... However there is a workaround. In your course's settings, have more Topics than necessary. Place your glossary in one un-used topic, hide that topic but do not hide the Glossary. The entries of that hidden glossary will be available for hyperlinking but the Glossary itself won't be visible. Unfortunately, because there is a link to glossary in the entries' popup windows, the students will still be able to access the glossary from there. To remove that link, see my post here . Joseph",

You can do that by enabling: Admin -> Front Page -> Front Page settings -> Include a topic section Plz, do that, save changes, go to your front page and the glossary should appear there (if it was created in that optional section). Ciao P.S.: If that doesn't work, try adding one activity (any one is ok, you'll delete them later), first in the topic, later in the main menu.

Each entry a student makes in the Glossary is worth 2 points, up to a maximum of 30 extra credit points for the course/Glossary. The problem we're having is with the grading of the Glossary entries. What the instructor would like is to provide the students 2 points on the rating scale for each of the entries they have added and then have all of those entries totaled in the Grade Book. Unfortunately what happens is that after the instructor rates the first entry (2/30), the student's grade stays at 2/30 regardless of how many additional entries are added and rated by the instructor. This Glossary is a semester-long activity, so having the Glossary as a non-gradeable activity and adding a manual grade book item to total the extra credit points isn't an option - the instructor wants the points totaled automatically within the grade book. Does anyone know of a workaround (other than a manual grade book item) to get a Glossary to be graded similar to a Forum's \"Sum of Ratings\" Aggregation type?",

Re: the size of the dictionary, well, I can't do anything about it at this stage. It is actual part of a much bigger project involving corpus linguistics and I have a big class (44 students) divided in 10 small teams. Each team created a specialised corpus on a topic of their choice (ranging from the Turkey application to join the EU to spectroscopy, cloning and ethical issue, anorexia, etc.), which they analysed using some concordancing software. So the terms and expressions they chose are quite specific to their corpus and they are providing samples of authentic use in context (extracted from their corpus). There are many words I have never heard of myself, especially in the chemistry corpus... There are also many common words that are used in a specific way in certain domains. So it is a highly specialised glossary... I have also asked them to select grammar points or discourse markers that are also quite frequent in their corpus and that usually cause problems to them. So they based their selection on the feedback I gave to individuals and the whole class, hence all those small words that are not mastered, even by advanced learners. The whole thing is also linked to group wikis, which students use to produce original texts or translations into French on their chosen topic. So I need the autolinking so that they can check their usage of the terms or structures and also read and understand their peers' production on topics they may not be familiar with (I have a mixture of scientists, engineers, translators and applied language students in the same class...). My next problem will be to export the glossary... So far, I haven't managed to preserve the line and paragraph breaks when exporting... But I'll cross that bridge later! Françoise",

It doesn't work in a few non-standard modules such as dialogue, exercise and questionnaire (probably because filters don't work on them at all!) Also, it doesn't work on calendar events, but does work on other calendar items drawn from course activities (such as a workshop, etc.). This is a great improvement Eloy, thanks so much for your work. I really hope this makes it into the standard moodle as an admin setting like \"link all occurrences\" or \"link only the first occurrence\" - maybe even on a per glossary basis? By the way, I'm interested in another glossary feature , which I added to the bugtracker some time ago, namely I would like all students to see each other's grades so that they can learn from each other, just like in the forums. This is a very important pedagogical learning process, so I really hope the glossary can do it. Any chance of working your magic on this bug too?

What I mainly need is some testing about it working in PHP 4.1.x and 4.2 installations (Win32 and Unix). Both PHP 4.3 (Unix) and PHP 5 (MacOS X and Win32) seems to be working fine. It's important for me to test it intensively under different PHP versions because it uses a PHP feature (hidden or at least, not documented) never used before (by me) and it's very important to check its behaviour under distinct versions. About the ability to selectively mark the activities where filters work (bug 2284), I'm not pretty sure that, although working, using the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] was the correct approach for an \"official\" solution. Anyway it has to be analysed to see what has to change in Moodle's core to be able to add such functionality in a proper way. And I've to admit that, at least for now (and for me), it isn't one of my priorities (it's in the list but under a lot of tasks). Sorry to be sincere, but I think it's better, isn't it? Ciao",

In Course A go to Administration/Backup include only the Glossary(ies) you want to export/import to Course B. include user data, Users, Course files, do not include , Logs, User files, Site files used in this course, Grade histories when finished, in Course A/Files/Backupdata : you can see the export file e.g. backup-courseA-date.zip In the Action column, click on the List link and check that the Glossary attachments are there, under Files ► moddata ► glossary ► 00 (numbers) Download to your computer the export file from Course A/Files/Backupdata : e.g. backup-courseA-date.zip Go to Course B go to Adminsitration/restore upload file backup-courseA-date.zip In the Action column, click on the Restore link in further screens, do not include Users nor Groups & groupings select the Glossary(ies) you want to include include Course files only if some of your Glosssary entries in Course A pointed to resources (e.g. images or audio files etc.) ; otherewise you don't need to include course files. Eventually, your restored glossaries in Course B will contain links to the attachements, which have also been restored to Course B under Files ► moddata ► glossary ► 00 (numbers). I do appreciate that this manipulation is far from intuitive. However I can guarantee that I have tested it and it works. Note that the backup/restore screens may appear differently according to your Moodle role (i.e. whether you are acting as admin or teacher). I only hope I have not missed mentioning a step somewhere.

Have a 2nd glossary B (entries 301S, 302S, etc) of solutions to the puzzles (same style, same format). Wanted them to follow in sequence from 1st to last entry - on right side of Moodle Page today is puzzle 304 while on the left side is solution 303S. Already discovered that I had to upload them in the order I wanted since 'alphabetize' though it shows them in proper order when you look at the entire glossary does NOT display them in alphabetical order but order of upload. Don't know why; only know that that's how it works! Fine, I went back and re-uploaded all the entries. Works fine in the Moodle Class (Algebra) that I created them in. Wanted to have same set of glossaries in different Moodle Class (Geometry). Set up glossaries, etc. Went to Algebra and exported Glossary A items in XML file and then shifted to Geometry and imported Glossary A items. Should be a cut and dried operation but . . . the items do not appear in the proper order! It picks an entry somewhere, say, in the middle, and proceeds from there in a systematic way. Is the only solution to go and re-upload the entries again?!? That's over 300 puzzles and 300 solutions! Should I have labeled the entries with letters instead of numbers? But what would you do after you've run thru a-z? Any thought? Len Kamiensky",

I will address your question #1, re the order in which glossary entries are displayed in the Random Glossary Entry block. You are correct, when you select Next Entry, the online Help says: The option Next entry will cycle through the entries in order . Unfortunately it does not specify that \"in order\" means in the order in which the entries were created in the Glossary, not the alphabetical order, as you wish. The way these settings work should be improved in Moodle core, and I will post a report in the bug tracker. When I've done that I will put the bug tracker report reference here so that you (and other interested moodle users) can vote for it. By the way your idea of having a sequence of 2 \"Random Glossary Entry\" blocks, one with the \"puzzle of the day\" and the other with the solution (but on the following day) is quite ingenuous.

Not very encouraging information. By the way, FYI , I noticed that Moodle tolerates 'division by zero'! If you generate problems in 'calculated' quiz questions and get a denominator example of,say, 15/(4-4), rather than indicate an error, you get an overall answer of zero. Such an attack on the integrity of the order of the universe can be dangerous! Thank you for your help (in passing on the qwerk).

Since I need entries (and solutions) for 9 months, we're talking a lot of clicks & scrolls! I uploaded them in batches of 8 jpegs for that same reason - fewer clicks. With each batch I then proceeded to upload them to the glossary and gave them 'concept' names 390, 389, 388, etc. (The concepts were the same as the jpeg file names.) Then went back and went thru the routine with the next batch until all 90 were done. When I then did the 'next entry' choice on my Algebra page, I got 390 1st, next one to come up was 389, etc even though 'alphabetically' they showed up as 301, 302, 303, . . 389, 390. I went back and did 'show date', I saw that alphabetical order was not followed. I went back and deleted the glossary and re-uploaded from the Moodle server folder to the glossary starting with 301, 302, etc. At this point, they show up as 301, 302, 303, etc both 'alphabetically' and 'by date'. Then did the 'next entry' choice on my Algebra page, and they showed up as 301, 302, 303, etc. Now I wanted to have the same setup on my Geometry page. I switched over and created the Random Glossary Block and and created the Puzzle Glossary for the block. I went to the Algebra page and 'exported' the glossary to desktop; went to the Geometry page and 'imported' the glossary from the desktop; linked the glossary with the block; did the 'next entry' choice and they showed up on the Geometry page as 390, 389, 388, etc. This was the case with 6 of the 8 glossaries -- why not all 8? who knows. Since other glossaries (Quote of the day & Pix of the day) are run randomly, it makes no difference but since the puzzle gets progressively more difficult (and have to be linked with the solution entry for the previous day's puzzle) proper order is necessary. At this point, I've redone 4 of the 6 qwerky glossaries entry by entry because once school starts I won't have the time to do it. At this point my greatest fear is that the admin will upgrade from 1.7 to 1.9 and all the links will go bonkers (as they did when we got the dedicated Moodle server). Well, that's what i did and what happened . . . Len Kamiensky PS: I realize that this is a 2nd 'question' but how does one 'vote' for a bug report?",

You should really upgrade to latest 1.9 version of moodle as soon as possible. Thanks for the detailed information in your latest post. However I find it very hard to understand because you are not using the \"moodle terminology\". I do not understand those sentences : \"Dealing with 90 entries, I 1st uploaded them from my computer to the file folder on the Moodle server in reverse order ...\". OK, I think I understand that in your Glossary entries you are using jpeg file names as \"definitions\" and numbers as \"concepts\". That is OK, but it should not make a difference to the results I mentioned in my previous post, that is to say that when you export a glossary and then import it into another course on your moodle site, the \"order\" of entries is not changed. In fact, the \"order\" in which glossary items are displayed in the Glossary is determined by the Browse by... tabs. As far as I can see, the solution to your problem is the small hack I gave in my post here. But it is related to Moodle 1.9. Sorry I can't help you any further.

          "Text": "Thank you Helen. You just saved me a bunch of work!! Philip maybe this will work for you….. I just set up and started using Moodle. I had 453 terms that need to be made into a glossary for my Biology students. I had the terms in an excel workbook. I am not a programmer. I don’t know XML, but using Helen’s suggestion I was able to do the import. Here’s how…. First, I exported a Moodle glossary with a few of the term as suggested. Then I downloaded a free XML writer called XMLwriter2 ( http://xmlwriter.net/ I couldn’t tell you anything about this program except it was free and cleared my virus software). I used this because attempts to import files which were saved as xml did not work. Then I opened the Excel workbook file and deleted everything that was not a term or definition. This left one column with the term and another column with the definition. I then opened up the exported Moodle glossary file using the XML writer to see how the terms and definitions were formatted. Next, on the Excel worksheet I inserted column before the terms, and a column after the term. I then went back to the XML writer copied what was before the terms into column A in the spreadsheet (<ENTRY><CONCEPT>). Now back to the XML writer and copied what was between the term and definition and pasted this into column C of the spreadsheet. (</CONCEPT><DEFINITION>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;). Note: Column B has the term. Finally I copied from XML writer what was after the definition into column E. (<FORMAT>1</FORMAT><USEDYNALINK>0</USEDYNALINK><CASESENSITIVE>0</CASESENSITIVE> <FULLMATCH>0</FULLMATCH><TEACHERENTRY>1</TEACHERENTRY></ENTRY>) Next, I copied all the columns and pasted them into a Word document. In Word the pasted material was in a table so I highlighted the table and then converted the table to text using paragraph marks. Then I copied from XML writer the beginning part of the exported Moodle glossary into the top of the Word document. This part for my files was from the line “ <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> “ to the line which ended as <ENTRIES>. I copied the ending code from XML writer of the exported file which was </ENTRIES></INFO></GLOSSARY> to the end of the terms in the Word file. With all of the copying I made sure there were no spaces between the letters. Next, I copied the entire Word file into a new XML file in the XML writer program and saved the file. This is the file I imported into the glossary. Only a couple of terms did not import. Once I had figured this out, it only took me abou 20 minutes to do the import. Again, I am no tech and there is probably a cleaner way of doing this. Maybe it will work for you.",

I found i wasted ALOT of time trying to use the file that Moodle exported, and to play around with the mappings. This took a long time and led to no where. ***The one problem that I ran into was that my glossary had some characters that are not recognized by Moodle. One character in particular, a quesiton mark with a box around it. I found that I spent most of my time figuring out that this character was the problem. Unknowlingly, I thought that the problem lied in the XML mapping, however this was not the case*** So if you find that Moodle does not want to import your glossary please make sure that you do not have any strange characters in the file you want to upload !",

You need: openoffice Calc Yasu Imao's Moodle glossaryXMLconverter_html MIcrosoft XML Notepad (free download but needs net2) Using other languages than English in Moodle, makes it often tricky to get out of the trouble. This is my solution: Start openoffice Calc with an empty table Start glossaryXMLconverter_html in your Browser ( Firefox /IE7 or whatever) Start MIcrosoft XML with an empty file Write your list into openoffice Calc columns A B (C D) * Select the entries and CTRL-C to copy the list Switch to the Browser Paste with CTRL-V the list into the left window Click CONVERT Copy the entire converted list in the right window with CTRL-A CTRL-C Switch to Microsoft XML Notepad Paste with CTRL-V the list into the right editor field Save the file (xxx.xml) What the last two steps do for you is, the editor seems to convert the characters properly into the html format.

Here is the workaround I have found. I do hope you'll be able to fix the bugs and that your module will be integrated in version 1.4 soon. Tested in Moodle 1.3 and 1.4 Current version is a little buggy, and only works (for me) using the following steps: NOTE: if you want to ADD imported entries to an existing Glossary, go to 2 1- if you want to put all imported entries into a NEW Glossary, create a new one in Moodle ( Add ... Glossary in version 1.3 or Add an activity... Glossary in version 1.4DEV) 2- Go to an existing Glossary 3- Click on the Import entries hyperlink 4- in the address bar replace import.php with import 2 .php... 5- ... and press RETURN key on your keyboard (or click OK button in IE navigator) DO NOT CLICK ON the Save Changes button 6- you'll get 2 error messages: \"You must specify the file to import and define the criteria of the process.\" \"Submit your request and review the results.\" 7- in the File to import window enter address of .txt file to import (AGAIN!) 8- NOW click on the Save Changes button... et voila!

I have combined your code with the current 1.8 XML import code and the script appears to work. (I imported a few glossaries on my Mac installation of 1.8). It seems to find one more glossary entry than is actually in the glossary and unsurprisingly fails to import it. It will preserve html, which was a key feature for me. However <object> tags do get stripped even though my installation has this feature turned off. I've probably missed another location where I have to turn the \"stripper\" off. What I really want is a modification of Dan Stowell's whole course import which will import glossaries in html format (as here) and with any files referred to in the entries (which are in the XML exported from WebCT). Dan's scripts appear to bring text entries across well but html entries have code characters converted to &lt; and so on. This is beyond me in scripting terms - anyone out there still converting from WebCT now they're not supporting CE any more> - offers? James",

          "Text": "Ha Ha... Oh yes, silly me. I was a bit caught up in several pieces of work, that's doesn't really make to much sense. I'll shed a little more light. My problem is that I have the word \"Culture\" in my glossary. I also have the \"safety\" in this glossary and the multi-word phrase \"safety culture\". I want \"safety culture\" to be auto-linked, but instead the term \"safety\" is auto-linked in the description fields of the glossary term \"Culture\" instead. This should be obvious by looking at my previous post. If you notice the term safety culture is actually linked to my glossary on my moodle. I have tried every combination of the available options within the glossary settings & editing options on each entry and I cannot get this to work reliably. I've tried toggling the following options:- This entry should be automatically linked - always on This entry is case sensitive - on & off Match whole words only - on & off I have also experienced similar problems with other multi-word phrases linking to a similar single term that makes up the phrase. The single word which is auto-linked is always the first word, the following words in the phrase are ignored and not linked at all. With some similar phrases by using the \"match whole words only\" option I can tweak the language to link correctly, but this is too fiddly and no solution at all. To get around the problem of multi-word phrases not being auto-linked correctly I have added manually some html and linked the mutli-word terms within the glossary description; as the glossary ignores text within href's. This Effectively forces the auto-link. Here is what I used : <a href=\"http://www.sheilds-elearning.co.uk/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=41&concept=safety+culture\" title=\"safety culture\" class=\"glossary autolink glossaryid21\">safety culture</a>. So it looks like this : safety culture . and an explanation of use from my notes. \n```text\n<a class=\"glossary autolink glossaryidXX\" title=\"Glossary: XXXXXXXXX\" href=\n\"\nhttp://www.sheilds-elearning.co.uk/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=41&amp;concept=multiword1+multiword2\n\"\n>TERM_HERE!!</a>.\n```\n OK so where is says : \n```text\nglossaryid\n - replace \n with the ID number of the glossary term.\n\ntitle=\"Glossary: \" \n- replace \n with the glossary term\nhref=\"\nhttp://www.sheilds-elearning.co.uk/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=\n&amp;concept=multiword1+multiword2\" - Ensure ID number course of the course is correct : replace with course ID\nhref=\"\nhttp://www.sheilds-elearning.co.uk/mod/glossary/showentry.php?courseid=41&amp;concept=\n+\" - replace  with 1st part of the phrase, replace  with the 2nd part of the phrase, use \n\"+\"\n symbol to add more words\n>\n</a> - replace with glossary term/phrase\n```\n This method works and will produce the mouse hover/help icon and link correctly overriding any wrongly linked terms. As a side note: I have also used the onclick code for the pop-up window, but this then prevents me from re-visiting the editor and switching to code view to see the html. But this isn't a problem. I'd rather have a fix for the actual issue than a workaround. Thanks for any help you can offer Steve",

I can add new entries to an existing glossary and I can create a new glossary and add entries. But when I try to update I get an error message. I suspect that something has got corrupted, but am at a loss where to start looking. The history of the bug is that I was trying out the games module, and using a glossary to create a crossword. I entered a few entries manually, then exported the xml , edited it and then reimported it. It appeared to work, but then I made another change and now I get the error message \"Could not update your glossary\". I've tried deleting all the recently added glossaries, and I've reinstalled the games module, but the problem remains. Has anybody had any similar experiences?",

The structure is great, but what I wanted was for the children to be able to upload picture files from the hard drive as they can anywhere else in Moodle, and then add supporting text. Unfortunately, when the children click on the insert picture icon in the editor, they DON'T get a Browse button (how crazy is that?!!!) but instead they are asked to provide the directory path to the file! The only option the children have is to upload attachments. Copy and paste works with pictures from websites, but not from documents, so that option won't work either. PLEASE can you offer advice on this one? I am using Moodle version 1.9.2 with Key Stage 2 children (mainly 10-11 year olds) Many thanks, Diane",

What we'd like to have happen is for the glossary to deliver a sum of these ratings to the gradebook which could then display as a percentage. It's really hard for me to figure out exactly how the gradebook is converting the text scale into numbers -- it shows the glossary scale and then a category total from 0 to 4.00.

This is weird, if you resize it, the HTML editor adds something like this in the HTLM code of the <img> tag: \n```text\nstyle=\"width: 302px; height: 187px;\"\n```\n This will not work, because an image size parameters are simply the width= and height= values inserted inside its <img> tag. There are 2 ways to achieve what you want: recommended: resize the image (before uploading it to moodle) using a photo editor (in a pinch you can use picnic, an online photo editor which allows to resize, crop etc.) in a pinch, insert your image, then click on the Toggle HTML Source button; in the source, change (or add) the width paramater to the value of your choice.

What you are doing is introducing some extra markup that tells the client's browser to display the image with a certain style ( for example: style=\"width: 302px; height: 187px;\" ). The image then appears smaller, but you have not altered the image itself. You still have the same large image (and the associated file size overhead), with some extra markup telling your visitors' browser to display the image within (smaller) width and height parameters. I understand what you are saying, and understand the effect you are getting. Experimenting with this, the editor in IE and Firefox will accept the extra style into the markup, and sometimes, on saving, will strip out this extra markup. This results in the image displaying in its original large size. You can make a browser display a large image in a small way, but to edit the image, you must use a photo editor. The html editor in Moodle cannot do this. Matt",

It can put in markup that tells the browser to display a large image in a small way, but it does not alter the image itself. The danger here is that people will post big images (big in dimensions and big in file size) and simply use the 'handles' in the editor to resize the image. Everything displays fine, but behind the scenes, an image that only needs to be, say 200x200, and 10kb in size is actually 600x600 and 700kb in size. If you have a visitor to your site on a dialup, and they display the first 10 entries to the glossary, and this is happening with even one or two entries, the page will be slow to load. I think that if you want to display a 200x200 version of an image, then you should (must, from an accessibility and usability point of view) edit and save a version of your image with these dimensions and quality. Here is exactly the same image, being called from the same place, but displaying in 2 different ways. I resized the second one by dragging the handles, but I did not alter the image, only the instructions I give to the browser about displaying it: Matt",

Curiously, in FireFox, the \"resizing handles\" do enable you to make a proportional resizing, plus the values of the new sized are displayed. This is good, except that the resized values are not saved upon saving. Looks like it's impossible to have the best of both worlds.

I eventually figured it out myself, so for those poor individual (now and future) who are also trying to figure out how to do this, here is how I managed to achieve it. Keep in mind that I’m using Moodle 1.9.2, and that the theme we are using is a third party theme that has been developed for us, so I’m not sure if this will work the same for everyone. (I’m still a noob when it comes to Moodle in case you haven’t noticed ;P) Anyway, my Theme has 4 separate CSS files, they are: styles_fonts.css, styles_color.css, styles_tabs.css and styles_layout.css To address point no 1. In the styles_fonts.css file, there is a section called “Modules:Glossary”, there I edited the “.concept” class by adding “font-size:larger;” To address point no 2. In the styles_color.css file, also in the section called “Modules:Glossary”, I edited the “.glossarycategoryheader” class by changing the “background-color” attribute to a color of my choosing. To address point no 3. On the server , in the “Mod -> glossary -> formats -> continuous” folder (in my case it was “continuos”, as that is the display setting I chose for my glossary. i.e. “continuous without author” if you have chosen a different display option then find the corresponding file in the corresponding folder) there is a file called continuous_format.php (or whatever format you are using) In the “whatever”_format.php file, you will find “<div class=”concept”> ….some code and “: </div>” The colon “:” just before the closing </div> tag is the colon that is displayed in the glossary. I simply deleted it and uploaded the file back to my server. I really hope someone finds this helpful ;D Julian",

I simply added a field for selecting a language pack and modified the alphabet function to use the alphabet string from the selected language pack. I am also having some unicode problems along the way with the section headings that are printed in alphabet mode. Variants of Greek vowels with differing breathing marks are not being recognized as the same letter. It works fine with letters that have modifiers, since the first \"character\" is the same. However, using modifiers for diacriticals does not display well in Firefox for capital letters, so I am using pre-composed letters such as Ἰ.

          "Text": "Hi Mustafa, the problem you are addressed is one limitation (caused by one feature) of current glossary module. The main thing is that, each time one glossary entry is printed, the entry definition is preprocessed to mark all the occurrences of the entry concept as \"nolink\". That way, when filters get the control, such \"concepts\" aren't highlighted in their own definition. And that \"nolink\" mark is the one that is breaking your compound concepts. Following your example, if in your \"Energy\" concept entry you have one definition like: There are different types of Energy. Some of them are: Kinetic Energy Potential Energy The glossary, internally, to prevent self-linkings later, will do something like: There are different types of <span class=\"nolink\">Energy</span>. Some of them are: Kinetic <span class=\"nolink\">Energy</span> Potential <span class=\"nolink\">Energy</span> And obviously, that breaks your \"Kinetic Energy\" and \"Potential Energy\" concepts to be linked later by the filter (they don't exist anymore in the text to process, hence cannot be linked). The problem is that it's really heavy (in terms of processing time per entry displayed) to modify the glossary to be more accurate and avoid that \"excess\" of \"nolinking\". The only workaround I can imagine is to make the \"main concept\" different. Perhaps you could use \"Energies\" or some completely different concept. That way, the main concept won't interfere in the compound ones. Hope it helps, ciao",

Would it be possible for the teacher to make changes and/or comments to entries but the entry remaining hidden until approved?? I'm afraid the answer is 'no'. That's why I thought of a possible solution to this handicap. Maybe it would be useful if the same parameter existing in databases which works like 'x' entries required before seeing the entries already published was also present in glossaries.

Briefly: Within the framework of a European project, we (at the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium) modified the glossary in two ways: - First, we integrated a lemmatizer which allows the autolinking to recognize all word forms of one word (eg go/goes/going/gone/went are linked to the glossary entry go ) - then, we changed the interface to enable teachers to add or modify an entry while reading the text without having to go back to the glossary interface.

So for example in Moodle you could create a new 'Gallery' in your course (which is actually linked automatically to the Gallery2 installation).

I strongly advise against doing this. Pasting text from Word into the HTML editor is prone to all kind of formatting problems! The proper ways to make an HTML document available online with glossary autolinks in it are: use an HTML editor on your local computer to create the document, then upload to the Files repository in your Moodle course (best method); or, if you do not have a good Wysiwyg HTML editor at hand, create your document in MS Word (or even better in Open Office writer) and export/save as HTML, then upload to your Moodle course as in #1.

When you run the macro it has three checkboxes for you to tick and it will populate columns c-f with 1's or 0's. Use dyna link - (dynamic linking) is the setting that allows the definition to be linked to from other moodle activitie. Setting this to 1 means that wherever that definition appears in your course it will have a link to the glossary entry. (For example see the term HTH in this message) Case sensitive - whether or not the matched word has to have the same case structure as given in the definition inorder for linking to work. Full match - does the definition have to be on its own or can it be part of a larger word, eg definition is \"Start\" should it match with \"Starter\" or not. Category - in the glossary you can have categories, there can be only one category per definition for this spreadsheet. HTH Dave",

I run into a problem when trying to create a glossary of Korean words - they are not assigned into the correct first letter, but viewed as a first unit of two or three letters. So the word \"개관\" ( (outline - for the curious) does not appear in its correct placement under the first letter \"ㄱ\" but in a newly created division \"개\". Of course, it does not even register in the English alphabet index of the english users glossary. It just shows up in a list format categorized under \"개\". In other words, it seems that moodle (i am running 1.7) glossary is not indexing korean characters correctly. Above that, the use of two languages is confusing it even more - specially at the user interface level: where would the word \"개관\" be indexed using latin characters? Interesting problem, hopefully with a partial solution to come.",

I am a bit confused as to where the comments sit within Moodle as once a comment is added to a glossary item, the only way back to the glossary using the breadcrumb trail is to go back to course home page and then navigating back to the glossary, this seems daft to me (see attachment). If I use the back button the comment will not appear unless the page is refreshed, so that is another potentially confusing/irritating issue. Is this because of the way moodle is set up for me? Is it because there is a kind of store for comments and I just don't know where find it? and finally, why does the link to the glossary dissappear when I am adding an item into it? It just seems really weird that I can comment on a glossary item, but cannot then return to the main glossary from the comment page. any help with this appreciated. Tina Rowe",

It would be helpful to have secundary glossaries with the \"real\" data, and having main or global glossaries referring to the content of them. What we then need is kind of category showing where the glossary entry resides, or whom to contact in case of questions (teacher of the respective course?). At least it should be possible to aggregate secundary glossaries to a main glossary withou copying data.

          "Text": "Hi, Jason. I had a similar misunderstanding with the way ratings worked when I first started using Moodle and set up my first forums. Ratings for forums and glossaries work on an averaging principle, not an aggregate principle. For the forums, this means you need to track user replies separately within the forum (if you require more than one reply to a discussion) or through user profiles. For glossaries, this means you need to track through the show entries by author option and tally them separately in a new graded column that you set up in the grade book. See attached pic. For these types of assignments, I usually find that the tab option in Firefox is handy so that I can flip between the two screens pretty easily and quickly. If your Moodle grade book is your only grade book, then I would turn off the rating in the glossary so that there is no extra point showing up in the grade book. You could also set ratings at 4 and only rate one of the entries once the four have been entered, but that might confuse students. \"Why did I get a four on this one and nothing on the others?\" It would also then be imperative that you remember it is averaged, so if you allow late entries and rate the late entry at four after having already given the student a 3, it will show up as a 3.5 in the grade book. Hope this is making sense. Good luck!",

I rate the entries & overrode the student role, so that all students can view the entry (to help judge it's reliability) -- I want students to be able to read comments on their work & make changes, as I go through, I will re-rate the glossary from time to time as entries are improved. Right now my students can post an entry, and commenting is working fine, but they can't get back in to edit an entry.

          "Text": "Hi everybody! In a glossary, it is possible to display a selection of articles belonging to a category; or in alphabetic order by selecting all articles beginning by one letter; or using the Search or Search full text facility. Then, from the display screen, one can click on the Printer icon to print the selected articles. One would expect the same to be true for the Export entries facility. Unfortunately, whichever selected articles are displayed on the Glossary page, Export entries will always export ALL entries from the current Glossary! I am attaching PATCH files against current version 1.8.3 for mod/glossary export.php, exportfile.php, lib.php and view.php . These patches enable the user to do all kind of selection of articles and to export to file only those articles which have been selected and are displayed. It goes even further than the Print facility, as articles selected and displayed through either the Search or Search full text facility can be exported to file. This new facility can be tested on my moodle test site: http://rezeau.info/moodle . Log in as teacher1 , password teacher1 , go to the Questionnaire module Demo course and experiment with My Test Glossary . If there is enough interest in this little hack I hope the Glossary maintainer will accept to commit it to current Glossary files in moodle regular distribution. Please vote for MDL-12653 . Joseph PS- Attached zip file contains both complete hacked files and patches. Please use with care, on a test site and report any problems here.",

In summary this is simple to do In Excel copy and paste the glossary terms into a particular spreadsheet (this is attached) then follow the spreadsheet macro instructions to create an import file In Moodle create an empty glossary in the appropriate course/topic and upload the file of terms created via the spreadsheet Step 1 – Create a Spreadsheet Glossary Within the Moodle Training Course Glossary Topic is a spreadsheet attachment called Moodle Glossary Prep Sheet Click on this spreadsheet to open it. Click on the enable macros button in the message box that appears Use File and save as to create your glossary as your own spreadsheet and save it in your curriculum shared area appropriately named Open up the document or spreadsheet that holds your glossary terms Copy and paste the Glossary terms and definitions into the first 2 columns of your copy of the Glossary prep sheet Note – at this point you may need to tidy up the glossary spreadsheet content to ensure that each row has a term and a definition. Step 2 - Run the spreadsheet macro to create an XML file Select Tools Macro Macros Click the Run button Ensure there is a tick in each of the 3 tick boxes (if not then click in each to put a tick in) Click the Assign Values button to update the spreadsheet prior to exporting it. Click the Create XML file button In the Save as window that opens Browse to find the appropriate folder in your curriculum shared area Amend the file name to describe your glossary contents Click on the save button Close the Moodle Glossary Preparation for Import dialogue box (shown above). The XML file is now available to import into a Glossary. Step 3 - Create a Glossary Go to the required Moodle course and turn editing on. In the required topic select the Glossary activity. Name the Glossary Enter a description Scroll down the screen Initially you can leave the system defaults as they are. Scroll down Save the glossary by clicking on Save changes The Glossary is then generated Step 4 – Populate the Glossary with your XML file To import entries click on the Import entries link The screen below will appear. Click on the Browse button and find the XML file that you created in step 2. Click on the Save changes button to import the glossary terms. A report will then be generated telling you how many entries were imported or possibly list any that were rejected and why. Glossary entries will be rejected if they are duplicates or if they contain special characters such as the degree symbol . Review the Import and rejection report. If necessary correct the spreadsheet entries and re run the spreadsheet macro (follow step 2). Click the continue button at the foot of the import report and you will be returned to the glossary. You can now either review the glossary (see the Fareham College guide to glossaries) or import more glossary entries.

Using one normal Moodle installation such status should show one \"forbid\" message stopping the process completely. I really don't know how \"Fantastico\" performs its magic job but DB seems to be created with an incorrect encoding. Such incorrect encoding could be (though I'm not 100% sure) the cause of your problems, so I would suggest you to try installing into a new, utf-8 database to see if the problem disappears. Also, it seems that Fantastico builds its packages based on Moodle releases and that causes not being 100% updated. I would suggest to use the latest 1.8+ available to install/test the glossary categories behaviour. Finally, I think that the missing \"iconv\" problem shouldn't be a problem at all because if it isn't present, \"mbstring\" should do the job perfectly. Anyway, if you can enable it, better. Hope this helps, ciao",

In the mean time my little fix will let you select a single category per term. In my application thats fine. I would bet the problem here is affecting other forms in the system, but I haven't noticed any yet. I don't use that many modules. If you have a glossary with terms that have more than one category already assigned, this fix will not prevent them from being messed up.

Thanks for the idea of using the overLib scripts. I will explore that. What I have been able to achieve so far involves both hacking one moodle file ( mod/glossary/filter.php ) and adding CSS rules in a moodle theme. It is not satisfactory, as the \"box\" can only be displayed in a fixed position away from the autolinked word, but it's a way forward (seen attached screenshot (2), actually taken from a Moodle site). Ji, it might help us find a solution if you told us exactly why you need this resizing of the tooltip balloon (1a). Do you in fact want the text inside that box to appear in larger font ? (1b) If not, I really don't understand why you would want the tooltip balloon to be larger. Finally, Ji and Oswald, this has nothing to do with Java.

The range of entries among the 12-20 books we'll eventually put online varies a lot. Some are \"selected glossaries\" of only a page or two while others run to many dozens of pages. I'm specifically wondering whether it would make most sense to do each book's glossary as a secondary, or to make a monster primary glossary using the books as the categories. The only factor I've been able to come up with so far is the (frankly far-off) possibility that online courses may be built around the texts, and in that case we'd want a stand-alone glossary. So I guess I'm leaning that way, but wondering what I might be missing by not going the category route. Ideas? Thanks in advance for helping me think it through.",

Because it was my first try at writing a block, I decided to make things easier by limiting the teacher's choice to glossaries inside the same course the block was used in. This of course limits the usefulness of the block as a sticky block / especially as a sticky block on a MyMoodle page outside of any course. Two possible solutions: I could give you an ugly hack which allows every teacher to choose every glossary in every course, BUT then the links at the bottom of the blocks will no longer work (because they point to a specific course). Tell me if that's ok. I am working at writing a similar block which displays random entries from a database activity. That one allows teachers to reuse database activities from all courses. There is however still a problem with images: because they are stored inside the files area of a specific course, only students from that particular course have access to them. I really don't know how to solve that issue.",

          "Text": "We are using Moodle 1.6.4+. Many of our departments have used 'courses' as repositories of information i.e. worksheets, course details, assignment sheets etc. resulting in 'courses' containing huge list of semi-organised, difficult to search for content. In many cases it was necessary to know where the content was before you could search for it. These 'courses' were not for student consumption but for tutor reference purposes. After completing an exercise to create a searchable glossary of the NLN material (UK based ' SCORM ' content), I began to realise the potential of glossaries and started to suggest that tutors use glossaries to create searchable 'repositories'. A number of tutors then contacted me, passed me the information and asked me to create glossaries, using the excellent spreadsheet supplied by David Fountain . At this point I should note that I am aware of the database module but I seem to have some sort of mental block when creating tables as I cannot visualise their appearance from the set up page. It has now become obvious to me that creating glossaries for this type of resource is useless without attaching or linking to the 'document' that is the subject of the glossary entry. Using the view source option in browsers I have been able to recover the 'addresses' of the resources but cannot find a way to use this information - my knowledge is sadly lacking, it comes from being self-taught - and not too well at that. So far I am only able to create these links manually and it is 'mind-numbingly' tedious and prone to errors. Is there to anyone's knowledge a way of automating this process? Although I have been an administrator for over a year, what I know about php, xml , macros and scripting would fit on the head of a pin, so please be gentle. ian",

They offer a searchable database of the resources. In the long term I would suggest moving to a \"proper\" content management system. But in the short term, it sounds like the situation is this: - You have content sitting as resources inside the courses - You have one or more glossaries which act as the gateway to those resources. I don't know a way of automating the resource collection. I'm sure it can be done, by reading the course's XML file (in the backup) and creating a glossary from it. But, like you, this is beyond my current abilities (and time to learn). The quickest (and safest) manual way of getting the resource's URL (address) is by right-clicking on the link to it in the course, and copying that into the \"insert link\" dialogue box in the glossary entry. It's easier than trying to find the URL using view source. Or have I misunderstood what you're trying to do? Cheers, Mark",

          "Text": "I have a teacher who created a set of secondary glossaries for his course (a glossary per topic). He then exported the entries to a Main Glossary for the course. As expected, when the Topic 1 Glossary is selected in the original course you are able to view the entries for Topic 1, with the notation \"Exported entry\" indicating the entry has been exported to the main glossary. All is well. However, when importing the glossaries into another course, or restoring from backup, the Main Glossary entries are restored, but when you select the secondary glossaries there are no entries! Is there a way to preserve the relationship between the entries in the secondary glossary and main glossary in the export/import process?",

However, if you have access to your Moode site database, through phpMyAdmin, here's a little example illustrating how to do it. Suppose in your Moodle course you have 2 glossaries: \"Giang's glossary\" and \"Joseph's glossary\". in \"Giang's glossary\" we have created 2 categories named Category A and Category B. in \"Joseph's glossary\" we have created 2 categories named Category C and Category D. Enter your Moodle mysql database using phpMyAdmin. go to Table mdl_glossary to identify the id number of Giang's glosary, (extract below) Id course name 2 2 Giang's glossary 3 2 Joseph's Glossary In course id 2 we have Giangg's glossary id 2 and Joseph's glossary id 3 go to Table mdl_glossary_categories identify the categories id Id glossaryid name usedynalink 4 2 category A 0 5 2 category B 0 6 3 category C 0 7 3 category D 0 In Giang's glossary (id 2) we have category A, id 4 and category B, id 5. we want to move all glossary entries from category B (id 5) to category A (id 4). In the sql query window, we type this command: UPDATE `mdl_glossary_entries_categories` SET `categoryid` = '4' WHERE `categoryid` = '5'; or (without the queer apostrophes): UPDATE mdl_glossary_entries_categories SET categoryid = '4' WHERE categoryid = '5'; Joseph",

Just select defaultmode = cat, save changes and, voilà, your \"Encyclopedia\" glossaries will start with the \"Browse by category\" tab displayed by default. Ciao",

          "Text": "Johannes, Glad to know you liked the schema. To know exactly what all these elements stand for, I would suggest the following. Create your own glossary, make a note of all the various choices you make for the parameters. Then create one or two categories, create half a dozen entries, trying each time to change the parameters offered. Finally, export your glossary and look at the generated XML file. You can easily deduct from your choice of parameters the value that is required for each field. Also, the schema I posted will help you understand what kind of value is required (numerical, text) and whether the fields are required or optional, etc. But you really have to familiarize yourself with the workings of the Moodle glossary first of all. Joseph Example Glossary editing XML file Students can add entries: <xsd:element name=\"STUDENTCANPOST\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> Duplicated entries allowed: <xsd:element name=\"ALLOWDUPLICATEDENTRIES\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> for each entry <xsd:element maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" name=\"ENTRY\"> Concept: <xsd:element name=\"CONCEPT\" type=\"xsd:string\" /> Definition: <xsd:element name=\"DEFINITION\" type=\"xsd:string\" /> This entry should be automatically linked (tick box = 1; not ticked = 0) <xsd:element name=\"USEDYNALINK\" type=\"xsd:int\" /> etc.",

If there are no categories in one glossary, then new entries are assigned to the default Not categorized \"category\". But this means it is useless to click on the Browse by category button .

And how does this glossary get populated (and updated) with it's data on my moodle site? Do I import/update it from moodle.org somehow? Slightly different question: Any idea why my moodle.org glossary pop-up references sometimes work and sometime don't...seemingly on the exact same machine/browser each time (from working to non-working executions)?

Is there a difference in encoding between the two systems? 1.6 supports UTF-8 databases. If there is an encoding problem then you could try unzipping the backup, converting the ecoding of the XML inside and rezipping. How about creating a test 1.5 moodle with the glossary and upgrading that installation to moodle 1.6. The upgrade routine may do more checks than the backups. I know that the upgrade has in the past sometimes checked for known database issues. If the worst came to the worst, there is probably a way of reformatting the database XML (again inside the backup zip) into a blackboard style glossary and importing it as a flat file, somewhere on the forums. But you would loose keywords and other information. Tim",

A very kind lady on this forum, Heather Jackson, has been most helpful in getting some of the glossary in a form which will load but the rest is dangling in the wind. I am coming to the conclusion that the glossary section may be flawed intrinsically. My glossary worked for over a year. When I changed my site location it refused to move. So, I know it works. Unfortunately Moodle doesn't. If you come up with a solution, please let me know.",

For example, see the image below that is in my files folder of a class. The class is set-up to allow guest access. http://www.kentuckyclassroom.com/teacher/file.php/145/Monkey_to_Man.jpg This is something that caught me by surprise a few weeks ago. I had always \"assumed\" that only teachers (and admins of course) were allowed access to files in a course files folder (unless they made someting available via a resource)...that doesn't seem to be the case. It seems anyone who has access to the course, can access those files if they can figure out the proper path. See the discussion below that made me aware of this. http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=48883 Again, for the purposes of the original question asked in this thread, I think that most people would not know how to link to an item in the course files folder (which is good), but it is possible to do so (which is bad, in my opinion). This is something that I think is not well understood and has the potential for causing problems if a teacher believes that the files upload area of their courses is only available to them. Caveat...I'm no programmer. I'm only drawing this conclusion by testing, so if my testing is flawed, then this may all be wrong . Steve",

To accomplish something very similar to what you want to do, I have elected to have different groups create their own wikis (which do allow groups) in which they define terms or concepts.  It doesn't have the nice alphabetical search that a glossary does, but I came up with a main page that will serve as an index.  My plan hasn't met live students yet, so take this as a suggestion rather than  the voice of experience Cheers!

I can't really see any pattern to this, it seems that any activity in other parts of the course can cause this. Also I've allowed students to add their own entries but if I log in as a student and try to add a picture there is no browse/ upload facility, whereas there is if I'm logged in as a teacher. Am I missing something or is that the way it works",

Filters slow down your site becuase every page displayed needs to be processed and all the relevant words need to be hyperlinked. That's why the filter has a cache lifetime: during that time pages are not checked for any new links. This speeds up the delivery of that page, but as a side-effect some links may temporarily be unavailable. You can increase/decrease the cache lifetime by visiting the `/admin/filters.php` page of your moodle installation. (see screenshot with explanation) The second problem is caused by Moodle currently missing a student file area. If they upload pictures inside the HTML editor, there needs to some way of managing/controlling all of these uploaded files. Someone is working on adding this functionality to Moodle, but it is not finished yet. That's why the HTML editor doesn't have a upload facility for students using it. Students can however add one picture as an attachment to a glossary entry which gets displayed inline.",

          "Title": "the behaviour of the [nolink]  tag",
          "Text": "Hi everyone, I'd like to share some thoughts about the present behaviour of the <nolink> tag in Moodle (using version 1.5.3 stable). 1- Usefulness of the <nolink> tag There are a number of reasons why a teacher would want to prevent the \"overzealous\" automatic linking of Glossary entries in his course resources. It is possible to restrict the automatic linking to one occurrence per page or one per text, by using these lines in \\moodle\\config.php $CFG->filtermatchoneperpage = true; //To autolink each term only once per page $CFG->filtermatchonepertext = true; //To autolink each term once per text block It is also possible to use either the <nolink></nolink> or the <span class=\"nolink\"></span> tag in passages of HTML documents or whole HTML documents (resources, forums, lessons, quizzes, etc.). 2- Using the \"Prevent automatic linking\" button in the HTML editor If you use this button to prevent automatic linking and apply it to a selection of text which contains already formatted passages (i.e. italics, font color, heading, etc.), it will remove all of your formatting when surrounding your selection with the <span class=\"nolink\"></span> tag. Workaround A : do not format any part of your text if you plan to Prevent automatic linking in some parts (or the whole) of it. Type all of your text, apply the Prevent automatic linking and only then can you format your text as you want. Workaround B : do not use the Prevent automatic linking button. When you have finished typing your text, click on the Toggle HTML Source button, add <nolink> right at the beginning of the code and </nolink> right at the end. I always do this. 3- Restricted use of the \"nolink\" class The <span class=\"nolink\"></span> tag was introduced in version 1.5 (I think) but the former <nolink></nolink> is still valid in current versions. Unfortunately the \"class\" interpretation has not been implemented to its fullest, I think. At the moment, using the two linking-prevention systems, here is what works (no links) and what does not work (links). result 1- <span class=\"nolink\"><p>...</p></span> no links 2- <nolink><p>...</p></nolink> no links 3- <div class=\"nolink\">...</div> links 4- <p class=\"nolink\">...</p> links 5- no links-preventing links The way the \"nolink\" class is implemented at the moment does not conform to strict HTML syntax, as it leads to a) a mixture of tags belonging to different levels in the DOM hierarchy and b) the mere impossibility to use the \"nolink\" class within HTML tags other than <span>, as shown above. In fact, I do not see what we have gained over the former system with the introduction of the \"nolink\" class since its use is strictly limited to the <span> tag. Can we hope to have an implementation more compliant with HTML syntax in further versions of Moodle? Joseph",

          "Text": "Joseph, Revisited the glossary linking in quizzes and the nolink solution and saw your Feb 11 post.    I almost thought \"Dawn was breaking over Marblehead\" but it is minus 10 F this morning and it was too cold.  I am probably misunderstanding or doing something that is not exact enough in the right places. You wrote: It is also possible to use either the <nolink></nolink> or\nthe <span class=\"nolink\"></span> tag in passages of HTML\ndocuments or whole HTML documents (resources, forums, lessons, quizzes,\netc.). I was hoping this said that I could insert some html code at the start of a lesson and turn it off at the end.   Probably don't understand \"whole html documents\" defination.   Suspect what I call a branch is a whole html document. I just played around with nolink in a lesson question 1.5.3+.  I have not played with quizzes.   I found out that with a question in a lesson, every \"question/introduction\" and \"answer/jump\" needs to have the nolink applied.     I was able to turn it off and on inside the question. But when I inserted a \"<nolink> before the end of the question, it did not carry to jump 4.  Something converted it to the span class and automatically inserted an \"</span>\" at the end of the question.    I was able to turn linking off and on inside an answer. Got to go back and look to see if GIFT format supports HTML, then see if my marblehead can tweak the most excellent \"Word.doc to GIFT.txt\" template's VB code to automatically insert the right stuff as part of the export process. Seems to me the majority of users  want to have the glossary links turned off for any question in a lesson or in a quiz.  Is there a template PHP is going to when we create questions via (insert question) in a lesson or in a quiz?  A little clutzy to add the no linke code there as a default but wouldn't that work as a temp fix until the global switch thing is added as a feature.    Pardon my non-technical language.

By HTML documents I meant HTML files that you create on your computer and then upload to your Moodle course, to the moodledata files, and link to as uploaded resourses. This has nothing to do with the contents of the lessons or quizzes. To turn off automatic glossary linking in a lesson or quiz, the only method available so far is to insert the <nolink></nolink> tags by hand for each and every question. Obviously what is needed is an option somewhere, either at Lesson (or Quiz) settings level or at the level of each question page or question for turning off automatic linking. I have no idea how this can be done, however. All the best Joseph PS I hope you managed to warm-up.",

I've been told to keep it real simple, one topic per course with a following quiz.  The courses are always available for someone to start and finish at anytime.

          "Text": "Thanks for your suggestions, Cindy; it worked perfectly--almost. Using your advice, I was able to export a test file into XML from the glossary. I then used that schema to create an Excel file, and to convert that file into XML. After that, I successfully imported 24 terms into the glossary using the properly formatted XML document. The one problem: the glossary's export function doesn't export code for the term's category. On my test export file, for example, I assigned the term to category \"X.\" I could even browse the term under category \"X\" within the \"Browse By Subject\" interface in the glossary. But when I exported the test glossary, there was no tag for the term's category: in other words, I couldn't find any code that read something like <CATEGORY>X</CATEGORY>. Undaunted, in my import XML file, I created a tag called \"CATEGORY,\" and assigned variables ranging from \"X\" to \"Z.\" I hoped that the categories would be assigned properly once imported. Let's say that 5 of these terms were assigned to Category \"X.\" When I finished importing, I was hoping to browse by Category X, and to see 6 entries under \"X.\" (That is the original term, plus the five imported terms). But only the old entry showed up under Category X. When I run the moodle import script, the screen reads that 24 terms are\nimported successfully, and that 24 categories were imported too. But\nwhen I try to browse by category, all 24 terms show up as\nuncategorized. I even looked at the MySQL table that holds the categories. I saw\nthat each category is assigned a unique numerical ID, which relates to its name. Thus a category with the name \"X\" shows up with an ID of \"1\" in the table; \"Y\" would be \"2\", etcetra. So I changed the XML,\nreplacing the category's text \"X\" with the numerical value \"1,\" and \"Y\" with \"2,\" etcetera. I hoped this hack would work. When importing this amended file, I got the same message: all 24 terms & categories were imported successfully. Yet again, the 24 new terms all show up as uncategorized. When I looked at the My SQL table, it added an entirely new category--just one category--for all 24 terms. So the table which had three categories before, now had four. The fourth category, however, has a blank name, and all of the 24 imported terms are assigned to this blank category. What am I doing wrong? I'm hoping not to have to assign categories by hand (as I have dozens of terms to import). Any ideas what I'm doing wrong, or perhaps what the proper XML schema is to include categories along with terms & their definitions? Thanks.",

This looks rather silly and doesn't add any value to the glossary. There is no option to get rid of the Browse by Alphabet tab (although I could comment it out in tabs.html). Here's what I was thinking for a workaround. Add a keyword to the begining of the entry so it is picked up by the first letter in the keyword (e.g. Stress--How do I... gets sorted under S instead of H). Then change the word Alphabet to Keyword for the tab. But, I was wondering if it would be possible to define an alphabet for that glossary with keywords instead of letters. That way, the category header for the alphabet would show keywords instead of letters, so S would be shown as Stress. (And show alphabet could be set to no so it wouldn't be too cumbersome) It seems like having the ability to define an alphabet for a glossary (rather than a site-wide alphabet) might come in handy for other reasons too.",

          "Text": "Hi Carl! Yes, the behavior of the formatting of glossary entries can look strange. Let me try to explain. Case 1: you type in a definition text without any formatting (in the HTML editor, the format drop-down list remains blank) → the definition text follows immediately upon word entry Case 2: you type in a definition text and you format it (e.g. Normal or you give it a title, e.g. Heading 4 , etc.) → the definition text will start on a new line. One easy way to check this out is to Toggle HTML Source in the HTML editor: you see exactly the HTML coding which will be applied to your definition text. Actually, this dual behavior is interesting: according to what you want, you may wish the definition to follow on immediately the entry work OR you may prefer it to start on a new line. You only have to be careful how you handle it (see above). Hope that helps, Joseph",

Selected items can then be easily exported to a separate \"approved\" list. The glossary category, comments and display options appear to make it more suited to this purpose than a forum.

We had the course on one server , eventually had to move it to another because of space reasons (the University limited accounts to 300mb at the time!) and continued to develop it there.  It is now on an entirely different server (and installation) and appears to work in all areas except for the glossary. During one of the moves, the glossary files did not get carried over to the backup (they are stored under user files, it seems, and we moved only the course files).  So we exported them from the original site and imported them into the new installation. In any case, on our new installation of moodle (and of the courses), the glossary links to the old site for the glossaries.  We still have access to the old course, but students are faced with having to log in again (as guests, even).

Before the upgrade I had about 22 different glossaries on my website of various formats. Since moving to 1.6 they have all stopped working. Whenever I go to one I always get taken to a Teacher-Defined Glossary. The url's are showing correct, but the content is listing the Teacher-Defined Glossary with the default content. Also, should I try to edit any glossary, I get taken to \"Updating forum in section 0\". Both of these errors are extremely odd. I have tried reverting back to my old 1.5.2 glossary but the error persists. As a student, If they click on any glossary the error \"Course Module ID was incorrect\" appears. I have also tried creating new glossaries from scrtach but the above always happens.",

          "Title": "Wrong displaying of glossary entry popup window in HTML files",
          "Text": "Hello! When one clicks on an autolinked word or phrase in a resource text, a \"Glossary entry\" popup window is displayed. This popup window is created with the following parameters: menubar=0,location=0,scrollbars,resizable,width=600,height=450 For all types of text resources created online & residing within the Moodle database, i.e. text page, web page & label , the popup window is indeed displayed with those parameters. However, the appearance of that popup window is not correct when the resource text is an uploaded HTML file . The reason is as follows: both types of resources are parsed for the\ndetection of terms present in the glossaries and autolink links are\nthen dynamically created, including the parameters mentioned above. So far, so good. But only the resources of\n\"online type\" are output as HTML with the appropriate javascript\nfunction openpopup(). That function is not added to the <head></head> section of an uploaded HTML file. Consequently, the popup window opens as a \"normal\" window, complete with menubar, not located in the top-left corner and not sized 600x450 . I posted this as a bug report some time ago but it has not been answered. For anyone irritated by this glossary entry popup window wrong behavior, I can propose 2 workarounds. Workaround 1: modifying Moodle file \\lib\\filterlib.php using latest version 1.5.2, around line 220, just before returning the modified text with autolinks in it, add this: if (!empty($ignoretags)) { $text = str_replace(array_keys($ignoretags),$ignoretags,$text); } //MODIFIED JOSEPH REZEAU 22 JULY 2005 $nopopupfunction = '</head>'; $popupfunction = '<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">function openpopup(url,name,options,fullscreen) {var _url = top.location.href;var _start =_url.indexOf(\"/mod/\");var startUrl = _url.substring(0,_start);fullUrl = startUrl + url;windowobj = window.open(fullUrl,name, options);windowobj.moveTo(0,0);windowobj.focus();return false;}</script></head>'; $text = str_replace($nopopupfunction, $popupfunction, $text); //END MODIF JR return $text; caveat: this relies on the presence of a <head></head> section in the uploaded HTML file, i.e. we suppose it is \"correct\" HTML Workaround 2: modifying your HTML files simply add the script for the missing openpopup() function in the head of your HTML FILES before uploading them to your Moodle course; if you have a large number of such files, that function could of course reside in an external *.js file and you would refer to it in the head of all your HTML files. Here is the script: <script language=\"javascript\"\ntype=\"text/javascript\"> function\nopenpopup(url,name,options,fullscreen) { var _url =\ntop.location.href; var _start =_url.indexOf(\"/mod/\"); var startUrl =\n_url.substring(0,_start); fullUrl = startUrl + url; windowobj =\nwindow.open(fullUrl,name,options);windowobj.moveTo(0,0); windowobj.focus(); return\nfalse; } </script> I hope this will be useful and am looking forward to your testing it... Joseph NOTE: in the scripts above, you will notice that the HTML editor has replaced language with X language; please remove the superfluous X to make the scripts work...",

Only someone with knowledge of the Greek language can help me, pls anyone that is a moodler and knows Greek or is Greek and can help me, do so. Does anyone have encountered error like this before, how did the glossary worked in languages that don't follow exactly the latin alphabet? Thank you.",

First of all I think that I have now found what the problem is, MySql cannot arrange greek words in the right order. Has anyone encountered a problem like this before with a language that doesn't uses the latin alphabet, I can't understand why MySql has a trouble doing this because it seems that it doesn't have a problem with the greek language. Is it because of the version of MySql that I use? I use EasyPhP for this local installation that I have for tests, which had in it a version of MySql, and on my site I use the 4.0.25v of Mysql but the problem is the same. Should I use some other kind of sql query? But every query that I use, with a different order I mean, doesn't give me the proper arrangement. Help anyone? Best regards to all Panayiotis Iliopoulos.",

It's come from an Excel spreadsheet, merged into a Word document (where each piece of data is surrounded by the appropriate XML markup which should make it OK for importing), then merged to a new (long) document which is saved as a text/xml file. On importing, anything between 1 and 6 of the entries arrive successfully in the glossary - there are over 240, so I really could do without entering them by hand. I would post the file here, but I don't fancy sharing its contents with the world (lots of contact information in there), but if anyone's got the time to help, then I'll happily pass you the file.

I\nbelieve the the problem is that there are too many simultaneous\nconnections to the database . The hosting company told me that there is\na limit of 10 simultaneous connections, that this was plenty, and that\nit could not be increased. It has just occurred to me that the\ncause of this problem may be that the auto-linking function of the\nglossary is causing too many connections to the database. Is this\npossible? In both my online courses there are student created\nglossaries. The idea is that as English language students they add\n'difficult' words and phrases they come across in the online course\nmaterial. This has been very successful; after a month of classes there\nare already 700 or so entries in each glossary. All these entries are\nautomatically linked.

In other words, how do you design the link to appear on your site? Or, does it make a difference to you?

I hope it gets some sort of \" virtual economy \" system. I have just uploaded a short glossary of tourism terms in Japanese and English (the ones that we found difficult to translate) in WebCT format and EUC-JP encoding. But perhaps I could make some more glossary entries. Are you thinking of a glossary that is from English to Korean or an English to English glossary? I may be able to cooperate. As of this April I will be part of the department of Tourism, and I am one of three teachers doing a \"Tourism Communication\" course. I am also teaching something Tourism related (to be decided) at another local university and I am trying to persuade that university to do online education. On a more general note about sharing, It is sad how much we are sharing so much of the work of open source software programers and not sharing our course content. Perhaps this is not true? Or there are good reasons for this? I used to upload stuff to the Moodle for Language Teaching exchange forum but: 1) I realised that I could not persuade people to put tests only on password protected sites (so that my students would not practice them by trial and error). My tests were out on the open Internet, which made them useless since 90 percent of my students will only do homework if they are marked on it. 2) I failed to drum up support from others at that time. I took the tests down - except the ones on the demo of the language section - but many of the worksheets are still there. I see that the Exchange is starting to work so I think I will upload some worksheets. Or perhaps I will wait till the new exchange arrives. Moving stuff from exchange to exchange takes time.",

Since the main way for students to access a glossary will be through the automatically linked words in resources & activities , I don't quite see the point of not automatically linking glossary entries. However there may exist cases where the glossary will be used \"on its own\", as it were, in which case that option will prove useful. 2. On the other hand, once a glossary has been created with the \" Automatically link glossary entries \" option set to Yes , I fail to see the logic behind having to click again - for each and every new entry- the This entry should be automatically linked option! The way things stand look so illogical to me that I often forget to tick that box and am puzzled when words are not autolinked in the resources... 3- Again I do accept that there might be, within an \"automatically linked\" type of glossary, a few instances of entries which should NOT be autolinked (why? I wonder), but it would be more logical if - in that type of glossary - entries were by default linked (still retaining the possibility to have some not linked).",

          "Text": "There is one feature I've desired out of Moodle that the Glossary module is remarkably close to: a bookmark manager The motiviation is to have students discover resources on the Web which are relevant to the current learning activity. As these resources are found, they can be added and annotated to a bookmark manager. Just as comments can be added to glossary entries, so can they be added to bookmarks. Rather than starting from scratch each term, the bookmark manager data could be reused and expanded--becoming quite a useful student resource over time. As a testament to this idea, several years ago I programmed such a beast in perl and I still use the tool today http://www.opencentric.com/wrcc/xml/linker/link.cgi . At a technical level, the only major difference between this bookmark manager and the glossary is the addition of a single field (the name of the link) and some changes in terminology. Combining the two into a single module might take some doing, but starting with the Glossary module code and modifying it to create a Bookmark Manager module would probably be pretty straightforward. I would bite the bullet and crank it out myself but as a doctoral student I'm currently starved for time. So, I offer this post as a hope that there is someone else out there who finds the idea valuable and has the time to whup up a new module. Thanks, -TAG",

I have created a technical FAQ for staff showing how to setup an mail address, with the title \"Creating an Account in Entourage\".  If I do a search for \"Account Entourage\" or \"Account +Entourage\" - minus the quotes - it isn't found.  It seems that if you search for more than one word it must be an exact phrase. Am I missing a configuration setting, or is there a workaround for this? Mike",

Isn't there a better way?!?! (dramatic movie music) Thanks! Tan",

Quoting Maxi Picero: '''To use these pages you have to unzip the attached file in the folder moodle/mod/glossary. Then you go to the Import entries tab of some glossary, replace in the address bar import.php by import2.php and push Enter so you load the new page.''' The file you choose to import needs to be plain text like something you would make with notepad *not* a webpage or something made with msword. The format is a full colon followed directly by the key word you are defining then a new line followed by the definition (all on one line). example: :diplopia double vision, usually caused by a strabismus Don't know what else I can add to help. You can email me your glossary if you want me to convert it for you, so you'll see just what they need to look like: pevans@catholic.org I liked it so much I replaced the original import files and use import2 exclusively. Hope that helps.",

I'm using the \"Simple Dictionary\" and it is working just fine to list in alpa order....Sounds as if you may be using a Continous format? Display format This setting specifies the way that each entry will be shown within the glossary. The default formats are: Simple Dictionary : looks like a conventional dictionary with separate entries. No authors are displayed and attachments are shown as links. Continuous : shows the entries one after other without any kind of separation but the editing icons. Full with Author : A forum-like display format showing author's data. Attachments are shown as links. Full without Author : A forum-like display format that does not show author's data. Attachments are shown as links. Encyclopedia : Like 'Full with Author' but attached images are shown inline. FAQ : Useful for displaying lists of Frequently Asked Questions.

I did have it set up dictionary style, and I even tried a few of the other settings just to see if that would change anything, and regardless of the format,  all 337 entries are under 'A'. So I just have it set to show 'ALL' rather than the A-Z. It kind of sucks, but it's better than nothing. When I imported the glossary, I used the import2.php mod and uploaded a .txt file with the concept & definitions defined (not xml , just plain text, moodle formatting, not categorized.) It didn't say anything about defining anything else, so I thought maybe that's where I screwed up, I didn't define the alphabet somehow. Thanks again, Christine",

I also reduced the number of items per page to some small number (since using it directly as a glossary is not my primary aim for it) as it then has less work to do. At first I increased max execution time in /etc/phpconfig too, so the 'All' wouldn't time out. On my copy of moodle cvs1.4xx turning it off in the glossary setup didn't turn it off from alphabetical. Finally I nuked it from the page by the simple expedient of \"translating\" the word 'All' in the language packs I use to \" \", i.e. just a couple of spaces which don't show up and, hence, can't be clicked. If you are stuck on windows to talk to your *bsd server , have you tried these? : winscp which includes this putty The former is very good for msw users if you copy keys and make them a shortcut as it gives them an ssh connection with a fairly normal looking msw window to drag and drop from with no fuss about logging in and passwords. It will even use scp to copy to a tmp file so you can use e.g. notepad to edit files transparently and save back to the server. I use them all the time when I'm stuck on an msw box at a client's place. Then you can grep, pipe, sed, awk, etc to your heart's content. I know I just posted about commenting out the filtering somewhere on this site, but I've been cruising through the quiz module for the last little while and haven't seen where exactly that happens yet for that particular module; a recursive grep on 'filter' wasn't helpful. Dunno. When I find it (and I will, because I have Been Told To), I'll post Funny. It's obvious in other places. It's 0340 for me here in PST, so I'm turning in now … Thanks for your kind words.

          "Text": "Dear Paul, I think that your suggestion for decreasing the load created by filtering (by implementing filtering by module) is the future, and I look forward to a time when the filter management page has setup options for each of the modules (perhaps, one day). But since I have already hacked my 1.4.1+ extensively, and I am going to have to hack 1.4.2 in the same way, I have not yet found the energy to remove the filter calling parts of thevarious modules. And if you can't find where it is called in the quiz -- the most important module for me-- then I am pretty sure that I will not be able to find it either. There are some parts of your post above that I do not understand since I am not nearly as savvy as you. Please do NOT feel oblidged to explain to me. I am unwashed. But I include a brief list of my confusion since I don't want to pretend to have understood. That would be an insult to your dillegence. Reducing the number of items per page... Is this a setting in the glossary I wonder. Or in the glossary code, I wonder again. I am using the glossary as a glossary (or dictionary) so I don't think that I can take this path if so. I am not sure what the \"All\" you mention is! winscp and putty look beyond me but I guess it is a way of gaining linux/unix like control, and grep in particular, on windows systems. I seem to remember attempting to install putty or something vaguely similar so as to be able to access the moodle cvs from my windows boxes. I can't code php but the Japanese language translator wants help translating so I tried to join the moodle cvs community. The software I attempted to use, and failed to install, was a sort of linux command line for windows. Putty? Gutty? I have in the distant past downloaded a text editor that allowed me to search for strings in files on windows. Can't remember what it was now. The windows search capability says that it searches for strings, but I find that it does not! But anyway, since I am not linux/unix savvy and am a windows waller, I don't think putty is for me, in this case. I beg to be forgiven for waiting in the hope that, to put it bluntly, you will find the filtering parts of the code for me. Ach... and even then, I probably will not have the time to hack them all out. No... I think that I should just give up on my mammoth glossaries and for the time being and hope for more filtering control in future. I am still wondering how http://rikai.com manages to filter so much so quickly. Tim takemoto",

The 'All' I'm talking about is the one which the user can click to get 'all' pages - it really eats up cpu and time doing that. About winscp: just download it and try it out, trust me, it's very simple to install and use. If you don't have a shell account on your University's servers, just write me real email at pevans@catholic.org and I will make you an account on one of my boxes so you can play with it until you are comfortable (don't worry, it won't be on a production server ) About the quiz thing, it was late and I was a little burned out. Here's something that seems to work ok. It relies on matching a word in the URL to prevent the filtering, so you could use it for other modules too. I just used strpos() instead of a regex to speed things up, but that's why I included the forward slashes around the target word. strpos() isn't as a 'bright' as a regex can be. So, try this out if you like: edit the file filter.php in /mod/glossary. Locate function glossary_dynamic_link, which is right near the top and right after the line with 'global $CFG' put \n```text\n \n\n\n\n        // Nolink for quizzes (or any other word in the path you like)\n\n\n\n        // $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] looks like e.g. : /mysite/mod/quiz/view.php?id=21\n\n\n\n        if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], \"/quiz/\")) {\n\n\n\n            return $text;\n\n\n\n        }\n```\n You can extend it to other modules by using their name instead of quiz I imagine. You could do it 'nicely' by looping through a (possibly stored) list or simply make more copies of the above. Let me know if that works for you please since I haven't tested it too much yet. Mind you, it doesn't seem like much could go wrong with two lines of php famous last words. cheers, Paul",

I have a Redhat 9 box, but I am not familiar with using it (other than the redhat gui, a bit), I only use it as a server and can't get my knees under the table where it is, so I don't use it much but I have ample oportunity for practice.

This is not putty though. I need to install that seperately it seems. Yankee Clipper looks very helpful too. It is something I have wanted for a while. I have photoimpact so I don't think I will be using ifranview (which I have used many years ago. Just befoer I bought photoimpact I experimented with GIMP but it crashes on this msw. For the time being I am very happy with the friendliness of winscp over and above the ftp client I have been using till now. I had tried to set up Samba and had failed but this requires nothing more than copying accross the details from my ftp client. It looks like winscp is going to be the answer to my backup worries too. The compare directory and synchronisation features look very promising. I had been using AJC directory sychroniser (shareware) but it does not lie well with Japanese folder names, unlike winscp. When I have a bit more time I will implement more of your advice. Gratefully Tim",

I am using ADSL. My textbook has about 600 terms in the glossary I would like to upload . Short glossaries are okay for content teachers but for language teachers longer ones are needed. So, as a solution, is it possible to autolink the glossary * only to certain pages *, e.g. Solution A) page with a tag in them saying \"autolink to this page\" (Ideallly) Solution B) pages of a certain type e.g. resource pages. Either of these would kill two birds with one stone. If users were aware that they are opening a page with a special, wonderful, auto linked feature then they would be prepared to wait. And quizes would not be linked either. Tim",

Autolinking works in something that we could call \"Moodle-Output-Chain\" where EVERY Moodle content is passed to one CENTRAL function. This function executes (in a chain) al the transformations (convert to html, add smilies, process filters...) as needed, depending of your configuration. So, adding/modifying code in theme header and or enclosing everything inside \"nolink\" tags won't have effect, because filters are applied at \"individual content\" level, not at \"page\" level.

          "Text": "Thanks Eloy, Sorry I should have read this before I posted about the possibility of somepages with autolinking and some pages without. It looks as though I am not going to be able to use the glossary. Sadness. I compiled the list of 600 (perhaps 550 unuiqe) words. I have almost finished formatting them to webCT format ready for input, but I realise that the 260 word glossary I have on another course is probably too long. I am not sure of the difference between \"page level\" and \"content level\"...other than that one is a bit longer than another. But okay, I can see that if a page is built up heirarchically then it would not be possible to just autolink the whole thing afterwards. However, it should be possible to do a check to see the type of page that one is on, even inside the most CENTRAL, low level of Moodle functions. AHA, sorry, even if there were some message going to the glossary saying \"don't link to non resource pages\" the glossary would still be in the output chain and still slowing things down? But the problem is the number of the words in the glossaries I am trying to use. If the glossary curtailed its job after the first word in non-resource pages then there would be no problem. So while the autolink filter would be in the Moold Output Chain, the auto link filter would NOT be going through 600 words to see whether each of them match the processed text. I guess that the glossary really a glossary and not an index and certainly not a dictionary. Pehrpas I will offer a mini dictionary of the 100 most difficult words. Tim",

I've looked at your site, but because your site is in Japanese, I can't get the answer to some questions I have, and that is how to deal with the specific terminology used in the glossary module that could make it confusing for book review use. For example, in the English version, one can \"browse by author\" which means the author of the review, not the book itself. I could see this leading to confusion. And then when adding an entry the term \"concept\" is used, which doesn't really fit a book or even its author. And then people are asked to write a \"definiton\" which would be better called \"review\" for a book review or even \"description.\" In short, is there a way to modify the way these terms are used so as to not confuse students? Perhaps there needs to be a mechanism of defining such terms on a glossary-by-glossary level?",

I am unaware of a way to make changes on a glossary-by-glossary basis, but you can change the terms globally rather simply. I just now went into the \"en\" language pack and did some find/replace to switch \"Concept\" to \"Title\", \"Definition\" to \"Review\", and \"Author\" to \"Reviewer\", I use the Glossary module exclusively for book reviews, so this small change will not have any confusing effects for other glossaries, but it would be nice to have a better solution. It would be nice to have a \"book review\" option in the module, but I know not how to create one... Perhaps a Book Review Module? Maybe there is not enough demand for one, but I think that by using the Glossary module as a base, that one could create it fairly easily, with the proper knowledge of course...",

The alternative would be to tweak the glossary module to allow for more combinations of types of entries. For books, for example, it would be nice to have at least two concept fields-\"title\" and \"author\" that could be sorted . Having multiple concept fields might be useful for other things as well-I could imagine a history teacher creating a glossary of important historical events-with two concepts-\"event\" and \"date.\" A biology teacher could create a glossary of species with two concept fields \"common name\" and \"scientific name.\"",

In the meantime, one could use the Keywords for this situation. Take a history teacher as an example, in the Glossary Definition he/she writes something like this:\nPlease add new entries in the follwing format: Concept=Event Definition=Brief description or summary of the event Since the Glossary Description is posted on top of the \"New Entry\" page, it would serve as a good guide to students while they are posting.",

If you have a biology teacher and a history teacher both using the same installation, and they both want to edit the terms in the glossary module, why not just create separate language packs? If you are using the \"en\" language pack, then make some copies, change as many terms as you like in the files, and then save the new language packs as \"biology\" and \"history\". Then, in the \"Course Settings\" page, use the \"Force Language\" option to apply the proper terms to each course. This may cause issues if there is a global glossary on the main page, but it seems like a simple solution. Editing the language files is not too difficult. I was able to change mine is less than five minutes.",

A cache is a collection of duplicate data, where the original data is expensive to fetch or  compute (usually in terms of access time) relative to the cache. Future accesses to the data can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than refetching or recomputing the original data, so that the perceived average access time is lower. Caches may mark the cached data as 'stale' when the original data is changed, but this is not always the case. The reason caches work at all is that many access patterns in typical computer applications have locality of reference. There are several sorts of locality, but we mainly mean that often the same data is accessed frequently or with accesses that are close together in time, or that data near to each other are accessed close together in time.

The time necessary to auto-link your tests is directly proportional to the number of items in your glossaries. Perhaps you should reduce the number of items to be linked (deactivating their \"auto-link\" variable). Obviously, the speed of your server is a crucial variable. Differences can be notable!! And finally, increasing caching time for filters can help to improve things, but the 1st time or when the cache is expired you will notice the slow-down. As Moodle is evolving every day, I'm sure we'll see some improvements in this area soon (I'm thinking about some possibilities just now). Ciao",

I am fairly familiar with various database formats so I won't cry too much if the answer gets fairly technical! Any help at all would be much appreciated. Best regards, James Phillips",

I put the encyclopedia format for glossary module, that seems to be the correct one. But when I try to attach a file, it just ignores me.It shows the text, but nothing else. I've benn around in configuration but nothing seems to solve the thing.

          "Text": "Hi! I experience a problem with my glossary entries. If I define the term \"Journal\" with a capital \"J\" it translate every \"journal\" into \"Journal\" in my glossary entry where the term is defined. The same happends if I define the term with a small \"j\": Moodle automatically change all \"Journal\" into \"journal\" in this glossary entry. This doesn't affect the same word used ie. in resources or in other glossary entries. This is annoying because in the norwegian language it's quite strict rules about when I can use a capitol or small letter. Another problem is that I can't define a term like \"add...\", it gets linked as it was \"add\". This cause som problems in my local Moodle course where the glossary is one of the most important and powerful tools to explain and help. Anyone know about a workaround?",

We have created two entries so far and the text within the course that matches these entires is highlighted by a grey box. When you are within the course and click on the highlighted text a small window opens but does not show the glossary entry for that word. Also when you go directly to the glossary it does show all entries but when you try to browse alphabetically, for example looking under A , it shows no entries even though the word annotate has been added to the glossary by a teacher and even though when we set up the glossary we slected yes for Show Alphabet . Can anyone suggest what we may be doing wrong or if perhaps there is a setting in Moodle's overall administration that may need tweaking by our technician. Many thanks and kind regards Sue",

If I make entries case-sensitive, there is a stong possibility that the search function will cease to be effective in returning full matches. I was hoping for another solution... and I think I have it, but not sure how complicated it would be! Instead of coding the URL into the Definition, it would be good if there was another option when Adding an Entry - perhaps 'Related Website(s)'. I see this is as similar to 'File Attachment' in that it is separate from the Definition. Then presumably the search engine could be set to ignore the URL fields?? As I say, I'm not sure what this means in terms of effort/complexity/impact on the rest of the module, but perhaps Will could comment.",

I agree that ideally the data in the glossary should ideally be maximised in this way. Export files from the glossary might be imported to the lesson module, or the test module, or both, possibly using the GIFT format (perhaps that is not necessary). So getting the modules to speak to each other more, rather than extending the glossary itself in that direction seems more Zen. Please try the lesson modules flashcard fucntionality. There are two types of Flashcard setting. Please let Ray know on the Lesson Module forum , which (or both) is the better type. I confess I have not tried it yet. Sorry Ray! today...today...he says.

I have tried using these sites from within Moodle but the Moodle login screen gets in the way, so I can't  use their external parsing functions. Would it be possible to import the dictionaries that they use such as the ones at Edict http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/edict.html (assuming that I could get it into the correct format) or would this put too much strain on the php. If so, how are they managating to do it? Happy user of the glossary.

Since links that contain the glossary title will probaly be quite common, perhaps adresses/links not have auto insertion.

I get this: \"Course Module ID was incorrect\" if I click on a category name outside my main page, say, within another course. I can work around this for a while by fooling the category linking system and naming my Categories in all upper case letters; i.e., FRUIT instead of Fruit or fruit.

I just couldn't resist all the great new features, and I'm happy to muddle through as it gets fleshed out and debugged. By the way, I have a group of students who are doing some exciting stuff with Moodle.  They're a group of a graduate students doing conflict resolution applied fieldwork overseas, and they're using Moodle as groupware for keeping in touch, planning their projects, sharing resource and contact informaiton, etc. I originally set up their web page for the course instructor, but the students quickly asked if they could just all have instructor access so that they could create their own forums, redesign the page, add resources, etc. Anyway... one of the reasons I jumped to upgrade to 1.2--development status and all--was that I thought the glossary was a great way for them to build information on all the organizations, individuals, resources, etc. they were working with.  I'll let you know how it goes.   As it is, the course instructor's daughter is doing her PhD in educational psychology, heard about Moodle, and I think she's going to look at it as part of her dissertation work on online evaluation tools and pedagogy.  Good stuff, all around.

But I have some questions about some of them before make them public (even before add some new files to CVS ). - The very first printer-friendly version is in CVS actually... Give it a try and post your suggestions.. It's quite basic. Should the icon be where I put it? Is it the most convenient location? - Default settings is in CVS also - The aliases... I wonder where should be the link to manage the aliases... I though to put it inside the edit entry... But I prefer to make it available right when you see an entry so I'd create an icon. See the attached image... I can't figure out any better graphical metaphor for alias/synonims than that.. Any suggestion or even an image will be appreciated (I'm not a graphic designer anyway.. )... However... I want to hear suggestions if it should or should not go right when you are viewing the entries or if it should be in the edit entry page. By the way.. An entry might have zero or more aliases... I was thinking about the user interface,  and I thought on a text area where every line is an alias.. Is it OK with moodle? Or should I create a more worked interface? - Regarding the export/import features... The exporting is done but not available... The importing will be available soon... I'm waiting for a hand on the xmlize function which I don't fully understand yet... I don't want to reinvent the wheel. You will be able to export the whole glossary and import the entries to a completely new glossary or just to append the entries to the current open glossary.. Thus, the categories would be restore also. It will generate an exception report with the entries that couln't  be restore (due to it broke a duplication rule for example).",

Complete the task with a save button. Likewise, you could a third button (next to these two) called \"export/import.\" Just an idea. Thanks for doing all of this work!

          "Text": "Williams I am afraid that I have not uploaded the CVS yet. But about \"printer friendly version.\" I think that this was originally my suggestion, and while I think that your printer friendly version is a good idea, I was thinking of something else: not that the glossary *itself* should be printer friendly but that resources with glossary entries could be printed with the glossary entries as footers (at the bottom of the page), or endnotes (at the bottom of the document) or even imbedded in the text.   This is probably a lot more difficult and only of use to me. Also, while aliases/synonyms are a great idea, I think that if the concept definition area becomes a text box as opposed to one line, students are going to think that they should put their definition in there with the word. My students have put the concept in with the definition below, using a dictionary format, like this. Concpet: Followed by a colon and this is the definition. As an alternative, you might consider allowing synonyms to be entered aliases using \"/\" ? The reason I have not uploaded the CVS is becuase I have hacked the glossary to make the input area simpler: no categories, no questions about autolinking, questions about capitals, and whole words, and no upload files, no header, and no footer. I would get rid of the \"choose forumat\" menu if I could but my php is clod. I am using the glossary as a simple dictionary. All the increased funcions are wonderful but it would be nice to have a button to remove them all when they are not needed since my students are not very computer friendly and get confused.

          "Text": "Hello, I updated my production moodle and, yippee, my course page is covered in delicate patches of pale yellow (since that is the colour I have set autolinking too - FFFFCC). However the autolinks do not show up in the resources of the same course. And alas it is the resources that are the important bit. My guess is that the Japanese characters may be getting in the way, as you suspected it might. When I saw the autolinks on the main page I thought that autolinks were working generally. Here is the non linked resource (note the word \"globalisation\" and \"Globalisation\" are not yellow) And this is the main page. I had my mouse over the central \"globalisation\" when I did this screen capture. I am using a 1.2 development moodle from 10/22 which I uploaded this evening. I have $CFG->textfilter1 = \"mod/glossary/dynalink.php\"; in the config.php in the moodle directory. As you can see, I have something in mystyle sheet. Again as you can see, I have set the autolinking in both the entries and glossary as a whole. And I just tried setting the language of my site and me the admin user to \"en\" but still resources (both text and html) in the same course are not linked, whereas the words in the main page are, even if I create a new resource. And the strange thing is that the high lighing appears in the main page and the excercise page (I am setting an essay this week) as well. So if I get students to ignore the icon and the submission date, I could upload all the texts as excercises. I don't know whether this is relevant but, the problem with Japanese is often that some Japanese characters contain the \"/\" character which is used in databases to seperate entries. Only some EUC encoded Japanese characters contain the character \"/\"  and I seem to remember that one of these was the Japanese character \"so\" which is used in the word \"riso-su\" (resource). But this may have no connection with the problem. Especially since it seems to have the same problem when I set the moodle lang settings to en. Congratulations on the good news though Will. We are trying.",

I imagine that we all could trade good glossaries on biology terms, historical figures, author biographies, etc.. (I think this can be done with backup/restore, but this might be easier). Attached are the .php files that do this in library. They may (or may not) be of use to you. (You might also double-check category linking because Computing terms on this page seems to error out).",

In that time I though that a more \"terrenal\" format (CSV, for instance) should be used for user easeness sake (god, did I spell it or wrote it gramatically correct? anyway, I bet most of this post is not correct either!). Perhaps a teacher wants the entries to be used in, let's say, a MS Word document, etc... And there's a chance that XML could not be recognized.. I know..

Oops, I see you are using alt alread, but only for \"Glossary of Common Terms: entryname,\" rather than putting the entry there on the page. An easy way of creating a glossary entry box popup window would encourage students to make glossary entries, and approach the functionality of Tom's Library. Perhaps this can be done already. I would like to add it to all my resources. Perhaps even a frame with the entry box at the right. If you do away with the make entry button and simply add a entry text field box that would make one less click to make an entry. Admittedly there may be a confusion with the search entry box, but I can't see many people searching the glossary now there is dynalinking, so I would rather that the entry field be to insert a entry, than search field. The possibility of \" teacher approved posting \" rather like a mailing list. When a student posts a glossary entry it might be checked by the teacher, ideally via email. I am not sure that this is essential but I can see my students adding a lot of incorrect entries if the next feature is added. Evaulation for entries . Many of my students (rats?) don't do anything unless they are evaluated for it. And I would like to reward them for helping each other. Settable defaults for the entry (dynalink etc) properties. At the moment it is set to \"don't dynalink.\" I would like to set the default to dynalink. Perhaps I should just hack the file. Which one please? Minor issue , when you jump to a category (e.g. to Computing terms) the terms link to themselves, such as the word \" CSS \" in the entry for CSS links to the entry for CSS.",

I knew someone would come up with it.. sooner or later! 8D For the same reason that I explained early this evening, the answer is it can't be possible as it is currently coded (not even with an easy/moderate hack I think): The parsing function does not know who or what is calling it so I can't prevent it from parse a specific text. Even more when glossary could accept duplicated concepts, or being showing concepts from different glossaries, etc. It could be linking CSS from the same glossary (it means, calling itself) or be calling a concept in other glossary. I don't know if I made this clear.. :/ Two questions: 1) Are dynalinks working properly in japanese?

Also, can these links appear everywhere in Moodle--not just resources (I'm talking about forums, labels, instructions, summaries, etc..)? Can you use the existing library hooks for this?

I mean, I think the parsing function should not be included in the common lib file of each module... it could take forever to parse a text if you have many text filters defined... In the same vein... I think this file should be a good candidate to be exclude from one of the coding convention (the one that say that all files should be linked to ../../config.php and to lib.php for the same reason...

This now works if I have this in config.php: $CFG->glossary_link[5] = 5; It's a quick hack, though ... it would be much better to have a \"dynalink\" field (on/off) in the \"glossary\" table (as well as one for each entry). I am really starting to love this glossary module! I have two more suggestions to add to your list that starts this topic - only search for \"whole\" words ... for example \"url\" is currently linked within \"hourly\". - the format of the entry in the popup window should match the format chosen for the main glossary display.

One field in glossary table to mark when text filters should be applied against one glossary at all.

I put the above in my config.php, and saved it. (Here is the top of my config.php) <?PHP  // $Id: config.php,v 1.19 2003/09/26 08:04:48 moodler Exp $ // config.php - allows admin to edit all configuration variables require_once(\"../config.php\"); $CFG->textfilter1 = 'mod/glossary/dynalink.php'; Then I added a glossary to week 0 of my file. It is a secondary glossary so the students can add to it. Then I added two entries. One is an entry (word) that appears in one of my resources. The other is an entry that appears on the comment of week 0. Both are entered exactly as they are in their respective places in the course. I have waited now for about 5 minutes. No, 15 minutes. I think that I heard in reference to the library that there is a cron or something that parses the database every X minutes, updating links. Perhaps I need to wait for longer. Or I am waiting for the wrong thing. I was anticipating that the instances of the words that I had entered in the glossary would be magically linked to the respective entries. This would be really great for language teachers. It is not quite as good as the idea of a library because I don't think that I will be getting too many of my students to come to the  glossary and make entries. They are shy for one thing. But maybe they will. The chances that they would come to the glossary and make entries would be radically increased if there were marks for glossary entries. In the longer term the possibility of grading would be nice, but either way a default point or .01 point per glossary entry would be nice. But this is all an aside, since what I am really wondering about is the lack of automatic linking and for your kind suggestions about what I might have done wrong. Hold on a minute. Perhaps I need to upload a later version of the glossary? I will try that. I have yet to to use the \"cvs.\" It will be a big challenge. I am sorry if this is just because I have an old version. But perhaps this will serve as a warning? Update I tried uploading the latest CVS of the dynalink.php to my glossary module. This did not seem to do anything. I also updated style.php from one of the standard themes to my custom theme (vanity). That did not do anything either. Then I downloaded the latest \" nightly \" (hourly?) changed my glossary to \"oldglossary\" and uploaded the whole thing, plonk. Then the below appeared in my latest activities framething on the right. (I now have turned latest activities off!). Fatal error : Cannot redeclare glossary_upgrade() (previously declared in /home/tim/mootim/moodle/mod/glossary/db/ mysql .php:5) in /home/tim/mootim/moodle/mod/oldglossary/db/mysql.php on line 5 One of my two glossary entries has dissappeared. I don't mind the fact that it has dissappeared but I hope it does not cause a database corruption that has nasty side effects. Then I tried reentering the missing entry. I was taken to a pink message saying that the entry alread exist. And then to a page which says \"Glossary module needs upgrading\" and a lot of success signs, with Fatal error : Cannot redeclare glossary_add_instance() (previously declared in /home/tim/mootim/moodle/mod/glossary/lib.php:13) in /home/tim/mootim/moodle/mod/oldglossary/lib.php on line 15 Aha!

A Moodle arena so to speak All those \"revolutionary\" changes in Moodle works, in fact, very smoothly as far as your current version is at least 1.0.9.. Thus, you will be enjoying far more cool features than before. Perhaps it could make yourself more confident in doing an upgrade (because you have already test it and knows its pros/cons or hacks to perform. 2) I have no tested this features with multi-byte languages.. Perhaps that could be a problem... Here the step-to-do list to make autolink happen: Be sure to have a recent version of moodle (there's was an important change in weblib.php yesterday! -no crucial but will could loose the ability to specify that certain words won't be linked in the process). Modify your theme: Styles.php and add a style named autolink Upload all the glossary files to its current directory (don't rename the first one! Move it \"out of the reach of Moodle\" if you want) Modify /config.php and add the textfilterline somewhere... The standard location is right before the comment of the include of setup.php That's it... Get into your admin area, watch that all upgrades went fine and get back to the course where you have a glossary defined AND that this glossary has the Auolink setting enable AND that some entries has that setting enabled also. There are other switches that you should care about. I hope it helps, Will",

          "Text": "Hi Will, What time is it there? I would like to suggest two forms of evaluation: manual and automatic using the forms of evaluation already in place in the quizes and forums. Manual I suggest this should share the scales used/created for the forums, and include the options provided for grading of forums (the only option I can think of is, whether grading be teacher only, or teacher and  students). The creation of an extra default scale, perhaps \"excellent definition, good definition, fair definition, poor definition, incorrect definition\" would be nice. This might be used in forums too, since one might imagine a forum where the topic is \"What is the definition of X.\" (By the way, I don't know how these user definable forum scales translate into points/percentages.) Automatically I suggest that this should share some of the functionality of the method of evaluting quizes. This means simply alloting a point/percentage (e.g. 0.1% of grade) to each and every entry submitted automatically, ideally with the option of manual regrading. ( It would be nice if this sort of automatic grading were a function in the forums too. ) Automaticaly Continued I suppose that in the extreme, one might make the glossary a sort of quiz by giving points to glossary entries that conform to the entries given in a higher level glossary, but that sounds too far too complicated. I don't know. In science subjects where the definition of terms is more precise, then it might be feasible, but probably too much work to code. For my subject (English as a second language) it would need some sort of fuzzy matching and or multiple correct entries. I am not seriously suggesting that you go to this trouble but, I could see it being quite motivating.",

It is surely one of the best features (other than the system as a framework itself) available in Moodle. I really like the row of tabs, and the \"pending approval\" one especially. There is someone asking if this functionality to the forums here, http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=3101 At first I did not notice that the autolinking was working since the default style for the link is not to show it as a link until someone puts their mouse on it. I have changed a.autolink:link { text-decoration: none; color: #000000; background-color: <?PHP echo $THEME->autolink?>; } a.autolink:visited { text-decoration: none; color: #000000; background-color: <?PHP echo $THEME->autolink?>; } TO a.autolink:link { //    text-decoration: none; (despite the // the underline is still not there) color: #000000; background-color: yellow; } a.autolink:visited { //    text-decoration: none; color: #000000; background-color: yellow; } Which is a bit garish. I will fiddle around. I do not see the place for specifying the shade of grey that is used here at Moodle.org. Japanese works no problem at all. I see also that you have made autolinking the default - which is a good idea. I have not used the commenting but I think that it will be a great place for students to say thank you to each other. I look forward to the grading. I am not sure whether students will add glossary items without grades or not. I may attempt a hack to make tooltips (or \"ALT\"  or \"annoation\"?) work. This would have the added advantage that I could perhaps change the stylesheet to display the glossary entries in the page, or at least  allow students to \"show source\" and print out the page with annotations. Students like to work off line, so the ability to print a page complete with the glossary entries would be a real boon for them. Since I have started using moodle, for reading comprehension, students are bring heavily annotated pages of English text to class (Perhaps I will scan a page one day). This is good practice for them, but I would like to allow them to cooperate. I really hope to get this online soon. Alas a problem with quizzes in the latest update prevents my using this on my production site, but soon, I hope. Thank you Williams, Tim (I was born Timothy Williams, and called \"Williams\" at at least one school)",

The default values for the settings is temporal... I'm planing to change it and allow admins to specify them in the admin modules page. To make the hack of the ALT tags.. just change dynalink.php. It should be easy... but remember that you will have to do so everytime you upgrade the glossary... Oh, by the way, comments could be far more useful than a way to express their graitute.. You could use it as a way of co-evaluation of user entries (everyone talk about other's entries)... which is a very interesting use, I think. And last but but least... The feature you are requesting, a printer-friendly version of the glossary, seems to be useful... Please, file a bug in moodle.org/bugs in order to have an eye on it in the future.

I've noticed a few things that might be improved - nothing serious, really. 1/ If, in the glossary settings, the teacher chooses NOT to have the \"Special\" or \"All\" links, the explanation still says that \"Special will show all concepts that does not begin with a letter. ALL will show all entries in one page.\" This might be confusing to students, because they will see a description referring to \"Special\" and \"All\", but they will not see anything like that. 2/ If \"Special\" link is not shown, the line breaks between the explanations and the alphabet are missing. 3/ Before the teacher creates any categories, he can add entries which are not categorized. Once he has created at least one category, \"not categorized\" entries are not possible any more. 4/ In the category selection drop-down box, there is a \"Jump to...\", which is not necessary (and therefore confusing), because the list is filled with \"Not categorized\" by default. 5/ It might be useful to have an \"all categories\" option in the category selection drop-down box. 6/ I've found a few minor mistakes in the language pack. See the attached file for corrections. Cheers, Przemek",

Why are we differenciating them? I can't find any other reason.. Please, help me on this one, I'm not a teacher nor an educator or constructivist expert. Well.. Back to point.

However, the problem is that it is just as possible to edit one instance without chaning the other. As a result, the definition of the same word in the main and in the secondary glossary may eventually become totally different. I think it would be better if exporting an entry meant linking it to the main glossary, so that there is only one record in the database , but it is displayed in both glossaries.

I get \"You are not allowed to edit or delete entries\". I seem to be keeping you very busy (sorry for that), but I've got some new suggestions. 1/ Why not display attached images inline (the way they are now displayed in the forums)? That would be perfect for illustrating entries. 2/ When viewing entries alphabetically, it would be useful to have an indication what category each entry belongs to. E.g. if the entry \"behave\" belongs to category \"verbs\", the entry display will say \"Category: Verbs\" and the word \"Verbs\" could be linked to the category view of \"Verbs\". 3/ When you enter Standard View, you get entries staring with \"A\" by default. When I first saw that, I thought: \"Why A? Why not display all by default?\" But then it occurred to me that this is a very good way of avoiding long download time when users enter the glossary. However, in category view, the default is \"All Categories\", which WILL cause long downloads. It might be better if either the first category or the \"Not categorized\" entries were displayed.

          "Text": "This might be a useful feature to add to the evolving glossary. Here's what I would like to see, let me know if it makes sense. I would like to have the one main or primary glossary store all entries and have an option for multiple categories, in addition I would like to see a \"Class\" list similiar to the category list. This way I could have a main glossary that contains all the entries, which I could show on the main page of the site. I could then use the secondary glossary feature to display only those entries relevant to a specific class. The secondary glossary would then be filtered by the class ids and allow me to just show those entries related to that specific class. For example if I had a class called law101 and a class called internet101, by associating law101 with a main glossary entry that entry would show-up in the law101 glossary, internet101 would show only those entries that had internet101 associated with the main glossary entry. Also we should include an \"ALL\" category for classes, if we had an entry we would like to display in all of the classes. Also we should consider multiple class entries similiar to what you mention in categories. Having one glossary with multiple filter capability would make import/export easier and also avoid the problem of maintaining duplicate entries in different glossaries. Appreciate your consideration, I'm already seeing a lot of future potential for this module with my classes. Have a look at what I've started so far at: http://www.kvento.net/moodle click glossary, then login as guest to see the entries. Thanks Kam",

Remember that in a near future it hope it could be a graded activity. And last but not least... Implementing this will makes things extremelly hard to manage with the backup/restore process and, maybe, other features I could not see right now... Have you noticed that no module (resource or activity) is shared between modules? Perhaps we could transform this idea in something easier to implement and maintain... Let's keep ideas going...

If we want to use course assignments, quizzes, glossaries, etc. we have to export them to another class. I believe this is related to how Moodle is designed. I guess I was thinking of a global resource concept, where any resource could be attached to any class. I think your glossary module got me thinking along these lines because there are glossary entries I would like to include in all my classes, for example MLA writing format guidelines. Also it would be useful to maintain one database and maybe be able to set filter locks by the instructor. I need to figure out how to export/import entries between glossaries, so I can set them up for classes. I still would like to figure out a way to maintain one master glossary, for example on my moodle home page, and be able to populate the secondary glossaries from the main one. <Note: Just discovered I can't backup the data from the glossary I created on the Moodle home page, I guess data needs to be associated with a class, before it can be backed up >In any event, the glossary will be a module I can use.
