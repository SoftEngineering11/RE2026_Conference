          "Text": "ADVANCE NOTICE: We plan to remove our proprietary MNet subsystem from Moodle 2.3 (planned for release in over a year, June 2012 ).  It causes us constant problems, is not well-defined, and only implemented by very few other systems. We plan to redesign the functionality completely, replacing it with standard web service functions, standard protocols and probably standard authentication schemes like OAuth 2.0. We want to work with the Mahara developers (and anyone else who may be using Mnet) to ensure a smooth changeover, but it's unlikely that the new system can be directly backward-compatible with MNet. This means that if you use MNet in a significant way, you need to upgrade all your networked systems at the same time and reconfigure the networking. At this stage the design for the new systems is not defined at all.  My own thinking is that we should think holistically about how Moodle can share authentication and the old MNet services with all kinds of other systems, not just Mahara.  If you have any ideas on what we should do and how, then now would be a good time to start brainstorming!",

I've lost count of how many SSO solutions I have coded for Moodle but all were written from scratch because I never managed to get my head around MNet (or needed the levels of security when, inevitably, both systems were on the same subnet behind a Firewall). In reality, that would probably mean a configurable level(s) of security - or plugins even. It would seem very sensible to use existing technologies (e.g. OAuth as you suggest) rather than reinventing the proverbial wheel if at all possible.",

I can't comment on the technical architecture but would plead for whichever mechanism is selected to be able to support batch enrolment (defined roles) as well as account creation/authentication. Our current patch (for 1.9) is based on creating a shell course on our site and mapping this to a specific course on the peer. We enrol users as students in our course shell using our own bulk enrolment process and their enrolment is mapped to the peer course. A peer can also define what roles we can enrol our users to within a course.",

          "Text": "OAuth is much more simple than the MNet protocol. It still uses SSL (This could be made optional I guess, but it would open security holes), but it uses it in the standard way (MNet almost reinvented SSL). To use SSL the OAuth way you simply need to use https:// in the URL . The OAuth provider will need to have the SSL extension installed on thier webserver (eg mod_ssl for apache) and have SSL set up for the site.  One of the really nice things about OAuth is that priviledges are set on a site-to-site and user-to-site basis. An example here might be that site A grants site B the ability to sync user profile data, user's picture, allow the user to enrol in its courses. When a user comes from site B to site A they are asked if they are happy for site A to provide user profile data, user's picture, allow the user to enrol in its courses. If the user agrees then Site B and Site A can share just that information about that user / allow the user to do those things. This could easily be extended to: sharing of grades, enroling in courses, profile information, or for single signon only (no course sharing) with other providers (eg moodles, facebook, google, yahoo, or any other site that has OAuth and you've got API keys for....) OAuth is an authentication protocol, it's not involved in transferring data between systems for this you will need something like REST.",

OAuth seems to be designed to allow two systems that are maintained by separate entities to share data, whereas from what I have seen, MNet is mostly used in situations where both ends are administered by the same people, in which case, it's easy to set up a special user, exchange a token, etc. OAuth only gives you authenticated web services in one direction, whereas MNet is bidirectional.  I think that it is possible to hack the protocol to get both directions, but that would be non-standard. The direction that OAuth gives us is the opposite from what we generally want.  For example, in the Moodle/Mahara case, currently Moodle is the identity provider and Mahara is the service provider.  That would make Moodle the OAuth server, and Mahara the OAuth client, which means that Mahara could make requests from Moodle, but not the other way around (without the above-mentioned protocol hacking).  But the portfolio and repository APIs want to communicate the other way around -- with Moodle making function calls to Mahara. OAuth generates a token for each user, which seems a bit wasteful in this situation.  For trusted systems, it's simpler to just use a single token for each networked connection. From what I can tell, OAuth isn't a good match for an MNet replacement.  Am I wrong in my assessment here?",

Either way, I've thought through the flows, and both OAuth and token-based webservices need to be initialized by exchanging some sort of secret token, so the setup is essentially the same between the two.  The only things that I can think of that give OAuth an advantage are 1. slightly better security, since requests are signed (but if you really care about security, you should be using SSL/TLS), and 2. it's more \"standard\" (but token-based authentication is super-simple -- it's just an extra query parameter).",

With MNet, each function call has an implicit parameter, which is the remote host that is calling the function.  With the current web services system, the only way I can think of to get the same type of behaviour is to enforce that each MNet peer must be linked to a different user.",

          "Text": "Hi Martin Last year I under took (with funding from the Ministry of Education NZ) to implement a SOAP based web services stack in Mahara as a plugin https://gitorious.org/mahara-contrib/artefact-webservice .   This has since been extended with XML-RPC, REST, and OAuth v1 authentication (operates as an IdP - there is no reason why client infrstructure cannot be implemented).  The entire stack was based on the excellent work done in Moodle, so they are highly compatible to the point that token, and user based auth function in the same way if necessary.  As a trial I made a few small modifcations to the MNet stack in Moodle, and managed to get that working against the new Mahara Web Services stack - not that this is necessary, but it gives flexibility to possible paths forward. Since then, a lot of work has been done by the Mahara development team to get this into core, and with luck and determiniation it could be there in Mahara 1.6. I put this out there as a possible path forward for solving atleast the immediate Moodle/Mahara integration dilemma. Cheers, Piers Harding.",

The removal of MNET support is a backward step when carried out without a replacement system already in place. I have Moodle working together with Mahara, and many assignments and projects in place. In order to keep pace, and maintain security I have to update my Moodle platform regularly, and I now find that with the step to 2.4+ that all my work has effectively gone out the window. I really hope that Moodle/Mahara are going to find a solution to this highly valuable compatability issue since I am sure it affects more people than just me.",

          "Title": "Important changes in the upcoming Moodle 5.0",
          "Text": "To all As we are rapidly approaching the release of Moodle 5.0 we wanted to ensure that you, our community, are well informed about the major changes outside new functionality that may impact the work you need to do prior to upgrading. As you will be aware with the change to the version numbering that was announced approximately 12 months ago ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=457946 ) the start of each new series (the X.0 version) will be when final deprecations will be occurring, and when we will be making other big changes to Moodle.  The rationale and benefits for this change are detailed in the linked announcement, so please take the time to review it. All of the changes listed here have previously been announced. We are collecting them into one communication summary ahead of the release to help increase awareness and aid you in planning your upgrades. Plugins A number of plugins have been removed in Moodle 5.0.  These plugins will be available either in the Moodle HQ github for those who wish to continue to use them, or if they are adopted by a maintainer, in the Plugins directory .  Specific details can be found in the listed tracker issues. Please note that if these plugins are not reinstalled before completing the upgrade process the data tables will be removed as part of the upgrade process.  These plugins are: MDL-82457 - Chat (mod_chat) MDL-82457 - Survey (mod_survey) MDL-78778 - CAS Authentication (auth_cas) MDL-77005 - Atto editor and its sub-plugins (editor_atto) MDL-84652 - MNET plugins (auth_mnet, block_mnet_hosts, enrol_mnet, mnetservice_enrol, portfolio_mahara) Oracle Database support  ( MDL-80166 ) Oracle Database support has been removed from Moodle 5.0 and community members who are currently using Oracle will need to migrate their database to a supported system before upgrading.  This decision was made due to the lack of ongoing support for Oracle in PHP and the very low usage of the platform within the Moodle community, Oracle has not been a recommended platform since prior to Moodle 3.0. Course formats ( MDL-83527 ) With the work being done to modernise the Moodle course look and feel, support for some legacy course formats libraries will be deprecated in Moodle 5.0.  All course formats that still depend on libraries from Moodle 3.11 and prior will be deprecated, this is primarily to remove the use of YUI from Moodle but also to allow the code to be cleaned up and made more maintainable for the future. From Moodle 6.0 the deprecated libraries will be completely removed.  Details from migrating a course format from the 3.11 libraries can be found in the dev docs . Bootstrap 5 ( MDL-71979 ) Moodle 5.0 will be the first version of Moodle to use Bootstrap 5.  This is a big change but a lot of work has been put into making this as seamless as possible.  The team has invested in creating a compatibility later between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 to ease the transition, however the complexity of this change will mean for many with custom themes and other customisations that it is recommended that these are checked prior to upgrading.  The dev docs provide guidance on the major changes between Bootstrap 4 and 5 and how to migrate between them. Quiz and Question Bank ( MDL-68806 and MDL-71378 ) There has been considerable work in improving the functionality of Quiz question banks to simplify management and sharing of questions within Moodle.  This is a major change in functionality and as a result if question bank sharing is commonly used at a Category or System level please ensure that you fully understand the impact to your processes before upgrading.  Documentation is currently in the process of being created and will be available close to the time of release. Additionally a new option has been created that allows institutions to pre-create quiz attempts before the student commences the quiz.  This has been designed to help mitigate database loads when Moodle is used for large scale synchronous exams.  Use of this is optional and needs to be enabled in the administration settings, however if it is enabled this will affect events appearing in the logs and potentially other reporting that utilises data from the quiz attempt tables. MimeTex removal MimeTex is being removed as an option for TeX filters.  The underlying 3rd party library that is used was added as a fall back option if other TeX filter options were not available, the library has not been maintained for an extremely long time and as a result is becoming a security and stability concern.  If your installation uses TeX filters please ensure that an alternative such as MathJax, LaTeX, or another is installed to ensure the proper functionality is maintained. Final deprecation policy update Finally a reminder that there will been a small update to the deprecation policy ( https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation#step-2-final-deprecation ) in the coming weeks clarifying the retention of the method signature.  This will be important to be aware of moving forward.  As always please check the release notes when they are available to see a full list of final deprecations in this release. Thank you in advance for your continued support and happy Moodling! The Moodle Products Team",

          "Text": "Hi, This summer is the period of platform updates for many of us. I had to change server (Debian 12 Bookworm) in which the version of OpenSSL integrated is v3(.0.9 for me). However, on platforms running Moodle 4.1.4 with MNET, the connection no longer works, displaying an 'opensslsealerror' message. I've done some research and it seems that OpenSSL v3 no longer uses the RC4 encryption algorithm. I've tried changing the OpenSSL configuration (by adding legacy providers) but it still doesn't work. I've looked to see if there's a way to downgrade but it seems not. Surprisingly, a Moodle 3.9 platform on the same server did not encounter the problem! I'm still using PHP7.4 at the moment but I don't know if moving to PHP8.0 would improve things. Has anyone found a solution? RC4 seems obsolete (see MDL-73518 ) but not supported with recent server distributions. Thanks for any help, Patrick",

I followed Mnet documentation at https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/MNet . At some point 2.2.1 it says: \"1. On both, go to Site administration > Plugins > Enrolments > Manage enrol plugins and enable the Mnet remote enrolments plugin (click Save). Click on 'Edit' and enable 'allow_allcourses' or select some courses or categories to be remotely enrolled.\" First of all, when enabling the plugin it is automatically save. The second thing, which is more important \"Click on 'Edit' and enable 'allow_allcourses', this does not appear to be anywhere, I looked at different places including permissions, but could not find it.

But, if you wish to purse ... on Moodle A, turn on debugging.  Also check your web services error logs. MNet had two issues that constantly had to be monitored and corrected if they went south ... 1. the certificates generated by each Moodle had to be exchanged with the other Moodles in the  MNet.  Had to regen them and copy and paste the certs from the two MNet servers not talking. 2. MNet was very sensitive about operating system time clocks ... so MNet servers had to be set to use NTP servers so MNet servers clocks would be sync'd.   Could not be more than 5 minutes difference, if I re-call correctly.    This part not so bad once set. Also, if I re-call correctly, an MNet course had trouble exchanging user data ... Moodle A linked to Moodle B course and Moodle B had a quiz ... data from the Moodle B quiz had issues getting back to Moodle A data.   Never resolved. 'SoS', Ken",

I have setup Mnet so students can access the second VLE, and I can enrol the students into courses on the second VLE also. I'd like to know, is it possible to unenrol students from the second VLE through the second VLE's CMS? It doesn't seem possible to unenrol students, or edit their profiles. Can this be done, or will it all need controlling from the Master VLE? 2) When using remote enrolments, I'd like to enrol using different permission /role types. At the moment, the settings only seem to let me have one MNet enrolment method, setup to assign all users that are enrolled with a preselected role (e.g. student). I would like to enrol most users as students, but sometimes set them as teachers. Can this be done? Thanks",

If anyone is willing to help me, I would be prepared to re-write the documentation on MHub to make it easier for others to do this too. The effect of other options and situations on MNet functionality are, for me at least, unclear. Take the following situation for example: I have an MNet hub set up and \"Moodle-A\" as a peer. If I have \"Email-based self-registration\" enabled and \"MNet authentication\" I would expect that registering a new user on Moodle-A would actually put their registration data on the MNet Hub. But it doesn't - the user only exists on the Moodle-A server . Another situation: I have an MNet Hub and Moodle-A and Moodle-B set up as peers. Mary is allowed to access Moodle-A and Moodle-B. John is only allowed to access Moodle-A. I don't see how MNet Hub allows me to authorise access in this manner. Some of the documentation I found seems to imply that perhaps a course needs to be available on the peer Moodles before peer-specific access can be applied. It is also unclear what, if any, other choices (such as location of the moodledata directory, MySQL database , etc.) might effect successful operation on MNet. Drop me a line here if you are willing to help me tackle this - I am sure there will be plenty of users who would be happy to have a clearer explanation of MNet too. Thanks!",

All the other Moodle instances have got only MNET login. There aren't any local users anymore. I am quite enthousiast about this solution. Because I can now login to all the platforms with one login. Bulk enrolments is possible with a feature called \"Remote enrolments\". On the moodle installation, where all the user accounts are created, you can enrol the users to courses of the other Moodle platforms, even if they did not login to those platforms yet. A workflow is described at: http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/MNet_remote_enrolments I have also a modified version of the standard theme. That theme allows you to simplify the login on remote hosts. It hides the local login form and generates a login link with automatic redirect to the page where you came from. I just tried to upload it here, but it is too big. You can get it from here: http://ubuntuone.com/1coVBiEBR2bvC1gxz32Sqh (it might not be there forever...) Using the theme might lock you out of your site! (loginform is only hidden, so you can make it visible with firebug , change display:none to display: block). You also have to define your site admins in the config file, when you use that theme, because remote users can't be defined as admins in the web interface. $CFG->siteadmins = '234,3,21,24'; The numbers are the user ids of the remote users who should be admin. We have a complete workflow how to migrate multiple Mooodle platforms to SSO authentication described in my first post. But the documents are in german. Best regards. David",

The question is - are there any tools to let users search courses from one site through both sites without logging in on the other site? Both sites support mNet authentication, maybe there is any mNet search? The feature is strongly needed, especially during the permanent course migration. Can anyone help please? Thanks, Max",

What should work is the following procedure: Let us assume you have Moodle A and Moodle B sites right now with their current users, courses and such. Make sure you have backups so if anything goes wrong, you would not blame me too much. The first thing to do is to set up the Moodle C that is to become the home server of all your users and the entry portal into your MNet network. Create an empy course at Moodle A and enroll all users into it. Backup it and restore it at Moodle C. This should re-create all user profiles at Moodle C. Repeat the same for Moodle B. Now all your users from both A and B should have their account at C, too. Set up MNet between A and C (Moodle C to become SSO Identity Provider, Moodle A to become SSO Service Provider) and between B and C, respectively. In the database of Moodle A, a new MNet host record should be now created in the table \"mnet_host\" for the remote site C. You need to get know its ID. For all users at server A that should become remote users, update their records in the table \"user\" and set \"mnethostid\" column to the ID from the previous step. Also set their \"auth\" column to \"mnet\". Repeat 4. and 5. at Moodle B, respectively. I must admit I never did it personally but as far as I know, this should be enough to do. In MNet environment, users are identified by the combination of \"username\" and \"mnethostid\". Users' username should retain unchanged during the restore so you just need to set their mnethostid correctly. Let us know how it goes. And best luck.",

Server C - Main server, Server A and B: future MNET hosts. Some thoughts before testing ist: Instead of restoring courses with all users from A and B on C, we could use a csv-file. Then there would be more possibilities of controling how users are created / updated on C. Some persons already created accounts on C and B and A, so there could be overlapping accounts. And there is also a possibility that existing usernames on C are identical to A and/or B. The usernames could belong to the same real person, but could also belong to two different persons. That could be a risk to acquire a wrong identity. (We still have to evaluate if this risk is OK for us and how to proceed with identical usernames. A possibility is to only match users with identical username AND email) For step 5: I think this could be done with a csv file too. According to http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Upload_users the csv fields can contain an auth column, but mnethostid column is not mentioned, so updating mnethostid via csv has to be tested and is not guaranteed to work according to the moodle docs . In case it does not work, a my sql query should do it. I will let you know how the tests worked out. Best regards, David",

In fact, if you have a no identical users on the two platforms to merge, the workflof described by David works perfectly. We did tests and replacing the mnetuserid with the host changes the user to a remote user. I thought this could be done with csv files. But uploading a csv file with mnethostid is not supported. So you have to do this step with a SQL-query that looks similar to this one UPDATE mdl_user SET auth='mnet', mnethostid=mnethostidgoeshere WHERE msn='changetomnet' (You have to be careful in this step: Do not change admins mnethostid!!) We marked all users that are to be changed to remote users in the msn field with \"changetomnet\". None of our users used the msn profile field, so for reasons of simplicity we decided to use the msn profile field (we downloaded all users as csv, then uploaded a csv file with the msn field set to \"changetomnet\" for users that should be mnet users), if your users use msn profile field, then do not do this, you could setup a custom user profile field, but the SQL query would be more complicated. We have a more complexe situation because, the platforms we are merging have also identical users (some users are identical on A and B and C). So we find out first who are identical,...

Right now, there are one moodle instance per academic program -actually, 29-, so I think there's a lot of work and the administration becomes tedious and I think it's impractical, because one user -admin, student or teacher- have to log in with different -even being the same username and password- credentials to different moodle instances. So, I've read about MNet and I've came up with a idea which I describe next: I think that implementing a central moodle -moodle A- that act as the main moodle where the main information is displayed and where all the users of the university will have their credentials stored. The idea is that this moodle A won't have any academic courses. A moodle B, moodle C and moodle D will correspond to one faculty respectively -for example, Health, Science and Engineering-. This ones are the moodles that will have the active academic courses and where the users will be enrolled in via MNet and SSO. The enrolment method to be used is the External Database to keep our students synchronized with their courses. Would be any difficulty with this approach? I'd appreciate any help, suggestions or best practices recomendations. Thanks very much in advance!",

We are hosted multiple moodle's on the SAME server and got this time gap error when we tried to do the networking between them. Same server 'should not' cause a time gap between servers, since only one server , at least that's what you would think, but the error kept happening. I found that load_user_capability() was a really slow query, (still looking into why it runs slow when networking) and I think this caused the \"time gap\" for us. Since I couldn't find out where to, via moodle admin controls, to change that 15 value I added it to the code in mnet/xmlrpc/client.php right after the \"if ($time_offset > 0) {\" around line 267, so we have: $time_offset = $remote_timestamp - $timestamp_send; if ($time_offset > 0) { set_config('drift_threshold', 60, 'mnet'); etc... Probably just a band aid solution but just wanted to throw it out there in case someone else is pulling out their hair over this. M=",

Would it be possible for me to create 2 New System Roles in a College Moodle, one called Staff and the other called Students and if that student or staff member is is in either role then that will be reflected through to the Resources Moodle ?

We have our learning content on Moodle B which is in the cloud on a Linux server. We have firewall ports open on 80 and 443 in both directions for communication between Moodle A and Moodle B. LDAP authentification is working just fine on Moodle A. We've had single signon working ok with users logging onto Moodle A then getting to courses on Moodle B. Then it stopped working with users getting an MNET timeout error:- \"Ooops! Your MNET communication has failed! Here's that error message to pass on to your administrator: connect() timed out!ERROR 28: 28:connect() timed out!\" Some users get the 'page can't be displayed' instead of the MNET timeout error. Then it started working again - it wasn't clear why. Then it stopped working again. And it started working and stopped.... alternating over a period of three weeks. Our supplier for Moodle B in the cloud has a number of customers using a similar credentials-forwarding configuration without problems, but they are all using LAMPP (Linux) for their Moodle A. We're the only customer with these problems. We find that on Moodle B we have to paste in the public key for the Moodle A peer, it doesn't pick it up automatically. We get a message on the peer page that the public key doesn't match the one on moodle A and the public key for Moodle A is reported as being blank: \"The public key you are holding for this host is different from the public key it is currently publishing. The current public key is: <BLANK>\" However in spite of the above error message we find users can still logon to Moodle A and get to content on Moodle B SOME OF THE TIME. Is anyone aware of similar MNET issues for the windows platform? If so is there a resolution to these problems? Any ideas at all out there? If you were me would you throw away Windows Moodle A and start over again with a Linux/LAMPP Moodle A? Thanks for your attention so far.",

The Moodle ‘in the cloud’ (i.e., remotely hosted) is it in the same time zone?  Is your Mooble B operating system time clock on an NTP service? Have you turned on debugging to see if there is anything more reported? Begin opinion ... This might start an OS war … but … so be it … MS has extended the life of server 2008 (just last year) so you will be looking at moving upwards soon (and shelling out some more $). Moving to a long term supported version of Linux (Ubuntu Server LTS or CentOS 6.5) means $0 … no more cals, licenses, extra ‘taxes’.  Will provider of service also provide remote support for your Moodle? Then again, it might mean a learning curve for system admin … I understand that … but, if one looks at the tech world globally … there’s more *nix’s (or at least based on *nix) out there than ever before … iOS, MacOSX, Android, Chromebooks, etc..  Don’t know how one can ‘avoid’ them!!!  Administering a Linux server, BTW , isn't all that difficult and there is tons of free support forums/blogs etc. to help.  Just have to be willing to learn and work a little. ... end opinion. Again, what does the provider say/recommend? And a question for the future of whatever remote resources using ... is provider looking at LTI ? 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

To get them to talk to each other, we deleted the public key on B. A new one was created and shortly afterwards it attempted a keyswap with server A. When that happens, our server (A) will respond with the following message: \n```text\n<?\nxml\n version=\"1.0\"?>\n```\n \n```text\n<methodResponse>\n```\n \n```text\n   <fault>\n```\n \n```text\n      <value>\n```\n \n```text\n         <struct>\n```\n \n```text\n            <member>\n```\n \n```text\n               <name>faultCode</name>\n```\n \n```text\n               <value><int>0</int></value>\n```\n \n```text\n            </member>\n```\n \n```text\n            <member>\n```\n \n```text\n               <name>faultString</name>\n```\n \n```text\n               <value><string>Sorry, but that hostname (0) could not be resolved!</string></value>\n```\n \n```text\n            </member>\n```\n \n```text\n         </struct>\n```\n \n```text\n      </value>\n```\n \n```text\n   </fault>\n```\n \n```text\n</methodResponse>\n```\n Based on some of the suggestions at https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=4584 I added some debug statements to the bootstrap function in moodle\\mnet\\peer.php. I print the value of the $ wwwroot argument on entry into that function and again after the set_wwwroot function call. In both cases the output value is 0. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the result of the call to mnet_get_hostname_from_uri is also 0. We believe that this is the reason that the UI on server B (under Site Administration >Networking > Peers) says that the currently published public key for server A is <empty string>. I’m going to follow the chain of function calls backwards but whilst I do that, does anyone have any idea what the problem might be? Kevin Note: It’s worth reiterating that after a period of not talking to each other, the two servers will establish a trust relationship and the system will function normally (exchanging encrypted messages) for a while but will eventually fall out of sync again.",

Our Moodle server (the Windows server which is handling the auth) can resolve the names of the other Moodle server as well as itself.

FYI , our server is using Google public DNS. I have no idea about the remote server but it's our server that's reporting the resolution problem. It can certainly resolve our FQDN as it sends requests to us. I think the problem might be deeper than DNS resolution as peer.php (which is throwing the exception) is trying to parse and resolve a $wwwroot value of 0.

Am almost certain I'll be corrected if I say the following incorrectly ... would think twice about relying upon MNet for anything of a major feature/nature.   According to previous warning/postings concerning MNet, it was either 'going away' or functionality would be greatly modified. Please see: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=175158 IMHO , it was one of the features that made Moodle rather unique, but with the coming of things like Web Services and LTI (consumer as well as provider), having something 'proprietary' may not be the best approach to 'future proof' Moodle.

It's been the bane that we over multi Moodle/Mahara sites  need to preserve and transfer the student intact. So to speak. On the mahara side I replaced 2 files the register.php and lostpass.php with custom files that redirect to the Moodle login or register. Because I am lazy I left the Mahara Login box, need to fiddle with the themes to do that. To make the whole thing a little more rounded I use a WP machine as a launch pad.  Sorta MOOCS in a slightly structured way.",

I could guess that the load balancer is a SW one ( Apache , HA Proxy, Pound, Nginx, <whatever>) and the nodes behind the balancer are on a private subnet while the public IPs of both the farms, Moodle and Mahara, are VIP owned by the load balancer being clustered for HA i.e. the two Application Clusters (farms) are sharing the same load balancing infrastructure. Under this context , it could be possible that, when the two farms talk each other, - being their traffic managed through the same balancer - the request is sent to the VIP as expected but the balancer replies on the public network and the backend nodes could not receive it because of e.g. you're NATting the traffic of the single nodes in both farms. To test it try to make a wget call from an external network as well as to create an MNET connection between a Moodle instance on a server having a public IP address and your clustered Moodle or Mahara: if it will work, add a static route on the farm nodes to correct the issue.

          "Text": "Hi, we are using MNET as single sign on solution for 5 moodle sites. We have got one MNET master site with local users (let's call it #1) and 5 (#2 to #6) remote moodle sites, that all are SSO with #1. We have to subscribe users regularly to courses from #1 to the other remote instances. The problem: Even if we create cohorts, or profile fields with keywords, so that these users can be selected via a search for bulk enrolment, the actual enrolments do not support cohorts and searching for special profile attributes. We did a workaround: Give the users a \"second\" first name (csv upload -> change user profiles), then search for that firstname, enrol all the users with that second firstname, change the user profiles back to their normal firstname. Disadvantage: On the remote sites, the profile stays with the fictional second firstname (ex: David Remoteuser Bogner) until the specific users logs on to the remote site. So we want to have either (what would be easier to create as local plugin) search for cohorts and/or custom user profile fields for bulk enrolment user syncing with the remote moodle sites. Has anyone an advice how to proceed? Best regards, David",

          "Text": "Good question.  To the best of my knowledge, no syncing is done between MNet servers except when user from Moodle A attempts to login to Moodle B. So a Moodle A user (hpotter) is a unique user.  If the user name in Moodle A is changed, then Moodle B wouldn't be advised of any change and probably try to register the user as a new user.  EMail address changed as well? One way to find out for sure: create a user hpotter in Moodle A, enrol that user in a Moodle B course via MNet.  Make sure hpotter does participate (post to forum/take quiz, etc.).  Change hpotter user name in Moodle A and see what happens! ;) If the system won't do it, the 'backdoor' *might be* to edit mdl_user table on Moodle B to match changes made on Moodle A.

          "Title": "Transmitting custom fields through a MNET jump",
          "Text": "Hi All, Here is a small solution that allows transmitting custom profile fields of a roaming user. We focus here a uniform MNET implementation in which nodes are belonging to the same operator and replicate all or part of the custom fields added to the user profile. This can also be of some use for networks in which administrators agree on some field semantics. Basically we consider that the shortname of the field mostly defines a rough semantic group that makes possibility of transfer consistant in a majoprity of cases. The following solution DOES NOT provides optionality switching, wich might be a better choice in the general case. The solution is quite simple and needs only reconsidering two segments of the auth/mnet/auth.php library. The principle is that we add provision to the user_authorise XML -RPC call for collecting user custom values, and aggregated them to the transmitted user profile as profile_field_<fieldname> addtional params. At the other end (confirm_mnet_session()), we capture those fields and try to detect a matching semantic in the landing platform (based on matching shortname, though ignoring category concerns). If a field is know with that name, that most probably induces semantic should match, we transfer the value to the localuser profile and update (or insert) a field data adequately. In user_authorize(...) (auth/mnet/auth.php) if (!empty($user->picture)) { $imagefile = make_user_directory($user->id, true) . \"/f1.jpg\"; if (file_exists($imagefile)) { $userdata['imagehash'] = sha1(file_get_contents($imagefile)); } } /// get user's custom fields and aggregate them to the user profile $ sql = \" SELECT f.shortname, d.data FROM $userdata['myhosts'] = array(); if($courses = get_my_courses($user->id, 'id', 'id, visible')) { $userdata['myhosts'][] = array('name'=> $SITE->shortname, 'url' => $CFG-> wwwroot , 'count' => count($courses)); } In confirm_mnet_session(...) (auth/mnet/auth.php) if($key == 'myhosts') { $localuser->mnet_foreign_host_array = array(); foreach($val as $rhost) { $name  = clean_param($rhost['name'], PARAM_ALPHANUM); $url   = clean_param($rhost['url'], PARAM_URL); $count = clean_param($rhost['count'], PARAM_INT); $url_is_local = stristr($url , $CFG->wwwroot); if (!empty($name) && !empty($count) && empty($url_is_local)) { $localuser->mnet_foreign_host_array[] = array('name'  => $name, 'url'   => $url, 'count' => $count); } } } // capture profile fields, check if corresponding entry is defined and update data if (preg_match('/^profile_field_(.*)/', $key, $matches)){ $fieldname = $matches[1]; if ($field = get_record('user_info_field', 'shortname', $fieldname)){ $datum->fieldid = $field->id; $datum->userid = $localuser->id; $datum->data = $remoteuser->{$key}; if ($oldrecord = get_record('user_info_data', 'fieldid', $field->id, 'userid', $localuser->id)){ $datum->id = $oldrecord->id; update_record('user_info_data', $datum); } else { insert_record('user_info_data', $datum); } } } $localuser->{$key} = $val;",

Working through admin/mnet/services.php I get to line 44 - before this information is being passed, but when it hits this it crashes. $mform = new mnet_services_form(null, array('peer' => $mnet_peer)); Commenting this line out I just get a blank page, no crash.

We are conscious that we need to start considering the move to Moodle 2. Our strategy is to split our current site up into four (the four 'areas' listed above). We plan on creating a Moodle 2 site for our Staff, the thinking being that if they embrace Moodle 2, rolling it out to the other 3 sites in 2013 will be a lot easier. My query is about networking and accounts. I need to backup some courses and install them into a fresh 1.9 site, which will then be updated to 2.1. But what do I do with the  users? Some courses have submissions and forum discussions and other user-content. Do I include Users in the course backup, or will the networking features 'link' the two together? We have used email-self-registration as our enrolment method. Hope that makes sense. I would hate to have to ask our staff to enrol into their courses again, or to tell them they have 2 logins, or that their login doesn't match with previous work. HELP! Dan",

So in theory, use shibboleth login to moodle should setup the moodle login session so SSO to mahara would still work. I wasn't able to setup the IdP entirely on my own and don't know enough to setup another one, so I'm not able to setup a test rig to prove this. What we are looking at doing when we go Active Directory for PCs (next summer the last I heard) is setting it up something called Kerberos. What this means (in as English as I can get) is: user logins to PC using the AD system Kerberos automatically sets up a token, which can be used as Single Sign On This token is passed to Shibboleth login page the first time it's called Shibboleth then lets users access anything they have rights to (and our staff portal, a homebrew job, could be adapted to accept shibboleth logins So true single signon seems achievable.",

We had run a single Moodle instance for 20 school districts in the past, and used the parent/mentor role to allow a local  staff member to monitor student activity and grades.  Many of the students using this new system are enrolled in courses outside their home district. I have set up the parent role and assigned the role to a staff member for a number of students, but the role does not allow them to see grades from courses on other Moodle instances. The individual instances are connected using MNet. Is it possible to modify the role to allow the mentor to see student grades for courses on a remote Moodle instance?",

Within Moodle 2.1 there will be a link which will SSO them to Mahara 1.4 (e-portfolio, PDP system). But! There is a problem with this linear style setup, there is a limitation on remote users bouncing from one system to another then to another. Ive read through this post: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=108982 but can't find the code to overcome the bounce limitation. Has anyone else worked around this as we need this linear style as certain elements in Moodle 2.1 will be used as part of their PDPs, which will be exported to Mahara using the new export feature?

The extranet has also an MNET link to Mahara and works quite well but not what I would have liked. We have started our plans for the 2012-2013 academic year and will keep an eye on Martyn's annoucement of removing MNET for Moodle 2.3 next June ( http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=175158 ). Also, with the new feature of Multi-tenancy ( MDL-28946 ) for Moodle 2.3, which would possibly assist us with our 8 Moodle installs and maybe our VLE/extranet setup next year. Also, we stll do not have some form of authentication for the students logging in, which is out of my hands at the moment, but hopefully we will for next year.

When we try to set up the link to the other school, my server retrieves the public key from them fine, but they can not get my key. If I email my key over and they paste it in, then Networking runs fine... Anyone have any clue as to what might be stopping the key getting through? We can both retrieve files from each others server using wget without any issues?

I checked the following: in my Moodle 2 installation (where I want to give access for remote users coming from Moodle 1.9) I went to the page Setting > Site administration >  Networking > Peers > my Moodle1.9 host > Profile fields. Here, in the list of \"Fields to import\" nothing was selected, instead the checkbox \"Use the default settings instead\" below the list was checked. Unchecking this checkbox and selecting the \"confirmed\" field in the list results in the following: Now when a user coming from Moodle 1.9 for the first time to Moodle 2, a new user record is created in the Moodle 2 mdl_user table with the \"confirmed\" field set to 1 (before it was 0). Is it this what you mean? If so, at least a hint in MoodleDocs should be given: I followed the instructions on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Network#Peer_to_Peer_Network and here the information of importing/exporting user fields is missing. By the way: As a Moodle admin I expect that \"Moodle works fine with the default settings\". So if the default in Moodle network configuration for imported/exported fields ist \"use default settings\" - do I have a chance to see that my users coming from remote are not confirmed and change this setting to \"confirmed\" somewhere in Moodle? Or in other words: If the default configuration leads to the fact that users \"after a while will disappear\", than it seems to be a bug or not? At least it is a lack of complete instructions on Howto setup Moodle network, isn't it? To prevent missunderstanding: I dont want to critisize the programming, I just want to understand what the default settings in this case are good for Best regards, Gisela",

I understand that users get two different accounts if they on one day log in to Moodle A and them roam to Moodle B and on the other day, they log directly into Moodle B. As we have activated LDAP in Moodle A and Moodle B, we would want our users to have one account only in each Moodle instance. We would want to try to add a \"feature\" into MNET in Moodle 1.9.x that does the following: 1. User clicks on a roaming (jump.php) link at Moodle A to roam to Moodle B. 2. Moodle B checks if the incoming username (with mnet_host_id from Moodle A) is present locally (mnet_host_id from Moodle B). 3. If present, log in to the corresponding Moodle B account. If not present, create a local (!) Moodle B account and go on with SSO. (Probably, that would make the mnet_host_id to not be needed anymore for our scenario, I guess ...) Could somebody please point me in a direction? Are there any problems with that? Which file would be best for putting that functionality in? Thanks in advance! +manuel-",

Once the users log in and authenticate to the main instance (we use ldap) an account is created there.  (first account created)  They then roam to the other instance and do not have to re log in but a duplicate account is then created on this instance - the main account is not associated to the courses, the duplicate is (second account created). Is this not how it works?  I really hope I am missing something as if there were no duplicated accounts created on instance B, our problem would be solved",

Not sure if it is moodle's fault for having a block point to the wrong place or if it is mahara's for not having the directory there that moodle's networked server block points to or mine for not knowing where to fix where it points.  At any rate it works for now.

There is no easy/automatic way to handle this as far as I know. But there is a hacky way to achieve this, I believe. Mahara uses a table called \"auth_remote_user\" that maps remote users to local user accounts. You can try to populate the table in advance with the required values. For example let us say there is a record: \n```text\nauthinstance = > 3, remoteusername => ellen.murphy, localusr => 42\n```\n that maps your 1.9 account to a local Mahara user with id 42. If you create a new record for the new 2.0 account like \n```text\nauthinstance = > 4, remoteusername => ellen.murphy, localusr => 42\n```\n then both remote accounts are mapped to a single local account in Mahara.",

Let's say the local system is Moodle A The internet-accessible system is Moodle B Both are in two completely seperate domains (physically and otherwise). On Moodle A, we have URLs which are pointing to content on Moodle B. I want some sort of authentication method/communication method such that if a user on Moodle A logs in using his Moodle A credentials, and he clicks on any such URL which is pointing to content on Moodle B, he should not have to login to Moodle B. And the content should be accessible to him. This could be a behind-the-scenes login, or (the closest that I have seen to work in theory) is MNet. However, with MNet, the major issue is that I am not able to get Moodle B to communicate back with Moodle A, because Moodle A is only accessible locally. I hope that makes sense. Any help in this regard would be really appreciated. Thanks. Regards, Ali",

After digging around a bit, I found that Moodle is writing session information to the mdl_mnet_session table. If I delete the row containing the session information for the demo user then logout works fine. If I don't delete the row then the user is unable to logout at all on any successive logins. The Mahara xmlrpc error log shows the following errors: [27-Jul-2008 18:09:08] [WAR] e2 (api/xmlrpc/client.php:78) An error occurred at the remote server.

That might be the problem in this case, but on the other hand you do have a valid Mahara backtrace there so you might be alright What version of Moodle and Mahara are you using?",

Mahara doesn't have an XMLRPC authinstance using that wwwroot, so the error you're seeing confirms this.

I've just been digging around for a while on a hostmonster hosted site that gives the exact same error! - I traced it down to a call to xml_parse which was failing. then I found this post about a libxml2 bug that wordpress users were working around: http://blog.hoofoo.net/2009/01/14/wordpress-patch-for-problamatic-libxml2-version/ which relates to this php bug here; http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=45996 Adding the code posted on the wordpress blog to the specific xml_parse call that was failing got a lot further, but xml_parse is used in many places in Moodle, so that would mean adding a workaround for the php bug in every place we call xml_parse. The same would need to be done in Mahara. The fix for this would be to get hostmonster to install a less buggy version of libxml2 - if they're unable to do this, then you should find a new web host (if you haven't already!) I do think we should at the least notify Moodle administrators that a buggy version of libxml2 is installed to allow them to resolve it, so I've created MDL-20220 to look at getting this added. I've also added an FAQ to the Mnet FAQ's detailing this as well: Moodle_Network_FAQ#I.27ve_set_up_the_keys_and_configured_Moodle_Networking.2C_but_when_I_try_to_SSO_into_Mahara.2C_it_doesn.27t_work hopefully this saves someone else the time I spent tracking it down!",

          "Text": "Thanx Dan I added the entry on both Mahara and Moodle config files and applied your patch to allow Moodle to generate the public key by opening the cnf file using the config file. now my Mahara generates the public key using the hardcoded path of the cnf file, so i will be waiting for you to update mahara core to allow it to generate the key using a more reliable way (i.e. through $CFG). but again, Mr. Dan, this is not the main issue, the issue has nothing to do with the keys or with the way how keys are generated, the problem is that Mahara cannot understand Moodle keys, after I clarified my problem in the last 2 posts above, I managed to follow Mr. Nigel scenario to change the keys on both sides: ---------------------------------------------------------- On the Moodle, delete the Mahara peer In the moodle database, have a look in the mdl_mnet_host table, and see if there's a Mahara record. If there is, delete it (leave the other records alone) In the mahara database, go to the config table, and delete all the entries that have a name that starts with openssl_. In SQL terms: DELETE FROM config WHERE field LIKE 'openssl_%'; In Mahara, visit the networking page in the admin section. That should give you a new key, which you can verify by looking in the config table (some of those openssl_ vars will be back). In Moodle, add the Mahara peer again. ------------------------------------------------------------ but this method didn't change anything. However, I noticed couple of things when I tried that scenario (Moodle full debugging is turned on and the patched of cnf file applied to Moodle using the $CFG and applied to Mahara by hardcoding the path of cnf file): the first thing : when I try to delete the entry of Mahara from mdl_mnet_host table (in Moodle database), it will be deleted successfully but the debugger shows the following message at the top of the deletion confirmation page : --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 'moodle.mdl_mnet_rpc2host' doesn't exist DELETE FROM mdl_mnet_rpc2host WHERE host_id = '4' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the second thing: each time i try to sso into Mahara and get the error message, I return back to Moodle (by pressing the browser's back button) , and at that point when i try to log out, the debugger shows the following lines (which I told you about in my last post above): -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Warning : openssl_sign() [ function.openssl-sign ]: supplied key param cannot be coerced into a private key in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\lib.php on line 172 Warning : openssl_open() [ function.openssl-open ]: unable to coerce parameter 4 into a private key in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 216 Warning : openssl_open() [ function.openssl-open ]: unable to coerce parameter 4 into a private key in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 229 Warning : openssl_open() [ function.openssl-open ]: unable to coerce parameter 4 into a private key in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 229 Warning : openssl_open() [ function.openssl-open ]: unable to coerce parameter 4 into a private key in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 229 Notice : None of our keys could open the payload from host http://localhost/mahara with id 6. in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 238 Server side error has occured on host 6: 3:No key match line 1130 of auth\\mnet\\auth.php: call to debugging() line 1020 of auth\\mnet\\auth.php: call to auth_plugin_mnet->kill_children() line 2138 of lib\\moodlelib.php: call to auth_plugin_mnet->prelogout_hook() line 29 of login\\logout.php: call to require_logout() ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- and then I log out without other errors by pressing the (continue) button (because the debugger disabled the automatic redirection due to warnings). But if i log in again (with the same user or other user) and I don't attempt to sso into Mahara, after that if i try to log out, the Moodle logs me out successfully without displaying any error. so the above warning lines shows only when I try to sso into mahara then try to log out from Moodle. the third thing: After I delete the Mahara peer from Moodle, and then try to SSO into mahara for the first time I still get the same (famous ) error message, then I go back to Moodle, and try to log out the debugger shows the mentioned above warning lines with the following additional notice lines: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notice: Undefined property: mnet_peer::$application in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 127 Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Program Files\\Zend\\Apache2\\htdocs\\moodle\\mnet\\xmlrpc\\client.php on line 127 Server side error has occured on host 5: 7:User with ID 2 attempted to call unauthorised method auth/mnet/auth.php/kill_child on host ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I ONLY get this notice only once and after ONLY the first time I try to sso into Mahara and then log out from Moodle; that means, if i log into Moodle again (with the same user or other user), try to sso into Mahara, then return back to Moodle, then log out, I will get only the warning lines mentioned above (at the begining of this post) and i don't get the notice lines. I hope you got what I mean. The question is why I still get : Sorry, we could not log you into Mahara at this time. Please try again shortly, and if the problem persists, contact your administrator",

My question is how to prepopulate the courses with students that will be coming in from the directing server?  It would seem that we'd need to add something to both machines, but I'm just not clear on how it would work.  Is this something that others have dealt with before?  Is it something that can be done out of the box, or will we need to do a little development work to make it work?  Am I going about this the wrong way and there's an easier road I should be taking?

One last question.  All of our Moodle instances authenticate to the same LDAP source.  If we go the mnet route, will users always have to login to their \"base\" moodle to get to their courses, or could they login directly to where the course is?  I know that Mahara , which uses MNet, has the option for direct or MNet authentication.  I may have to read back through the documentation on how that's done. Any code you can send my way would be greatly appreciated, and I'd be glad to send back anything we come up with. Thanks, Nate",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We're looking into using MNet as a possible architecture solution for allowing our centrally provided LMS to be broken down into multiple instances. The reason we're looking at this is to allow more granular administrative control over certain groups of courses. For instance to allow Faculty X to be able to limit or add plug-ins or different system-wide defaults to only those courses. Also this would allow us to connect and integrate currently running Moodle systems on campus. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this type of setup? What were the benefits and/or drawbacks? Just a couple quick thoughts so far (perhaps there are easy ways around some of these?): Only a single role can be set for remote enrolment. (eg. either Teachers or Students can be remotely enrolled in a course but not both) MNet doesn't allow creation of courses on remote systems, so a centralized course creation system could be problematic unless that system has integration with each and every instance. ( By default theme ''home'' buttons return to the home of the local instance where only the local courses are listed. So it seems, short of having a single/few custom themes which force the home to return to the 'central' instance, where all enrolled courses are listed this could be a problem. No cascading permission /defaults/settings to other instances. So if there were a large number of instances a single global change would need to be made separately on all of them. What are your thoughts?",

I would really appreciate if you could give me some  advices. We wanted to enable users to roam to different moodles from different faculties and we also wanted that they wouldn't have to know in which moodle reside their courses to access them...let's say, some student has a biology course in moodle A, a maths course in moodle B and a geography course in moodle C. That student logs into moodle A and he should see the 3 courses in mycourses block (and be able to access them, of course). Users, courses and course enrollments are made automatically in moodle A, B and C. (we have information system records integration)...so, no need to create new users records... I wonder if someone is using MNET with a similar scenario, and if yes do you have any design advice? --- I made some experiments (only with 2 moodles) and I noticed that when student enters moodle A for the first time, moodle B courses do not appear in mycourses block, but only after the student enters site B using the link available on Network Servers block. Is it possible to have the course list automatically updated? (simulating the user entrance on siteB?) Thank you in advance, susana",

But several aspects has to be taken into account. in MNet environment, every student has one server as their \"home base\". That is the only server that asks the user for user name and password. Such a server is called as identity provider (IdP). Once they are logged to their home server, users can then roam to other MNet peers. at every other server, user record has to be created, too. MNet does this automatically during the first successful roam to that server. since the remote user account is created at a host , Moodle works with that account as if it was ordinary user. So enrolments, role assignments etc all work. If you want to display the information about the enrolled courses at the remote MNet peer before the user ever roamed to it, you will have to push their accounts into remote servers manually, setting their mnethostid field to the correct value.",

Instead of populating the tables manually, I would suggest to call the XML -RPC to update the remote enrolments cache when needed.

          "Text": "Thanks, Dave - though I knew this much already. The problem I am facing is a little more complex. Since I want to link from one Moodle instance (Moodle1) to a course in a second, networked Moodle instance (Moodle2), the above solution WILL take users directly to the course in question, but they will be stopped by the second Moodle instance's login page. This is a problem because while users in Moodle1 can travel to Moodle2 via the Network Servers link (which takes them to Moodle2's course-list page and shows them as logged in as \"USERNAME from Moodle1\"), those Moodle1 users do not have a LOCAL user account in Moodle2. If they try to log in to Moodle2 with their Moodle1 account, they will get the error message \"Invalid login, please try again If you are a Moodle Network remote user and can confirm your email address here, you can be redirected to your login page.\" What I want is a link that takes Moodle1 users seamlessly to a specific course in Moodle2 so that all the Moodle1 users have to do is click on the link and they will be taken directly to the course page in Moodle2 and show up as logged in as \"USERNAME from Moodle1\". Is this possible? I noticed in mnet/land.php a variable called \"wantsurl\" can be passed, but I have not been able to find any documentation that I can understand which would show me how to use it - nor do I even know if that is what I'm looking for. Hope that clarification of my question makes sense!",

Thanks] I've got an xml -rpc module that can that can be used by an external client to make a course announcement. (Side note: Any interest in making this a built-in service in Moodle?) In Moodle 1.9.5, set up was: Copy my rpclilb.php to .../htdocs/moodle/mod/forum Add name and description entries to .../htdocs/moodle/lang/en_utf8/forum.php Enable networking and add the client's IP address to the XML -RPC trusted hosts. I recently tried my module with 1.9.9 and initially it did not work. After tracing error codes to the source and backtracking, I found that mnet/lib.php:mnet_permit_rpc_call() needs some entries in tables mnet_host2service, mnet_service, mnet_service2rpc, and mnet_rpc. I put these in and my module works. With 1.9.9, is there a UI or automated way of making these table entries? I also tried 2.0 RC1 and have had no success getting my module working. I followed the above steps and also tried to follow this thinking the various mnet_ table entries would be created automatically. I end up with Fault 7021: 'The transport method you are trying to use is not permitted.' The snag seems to be with mnet/remote_client.php:plaintext_is_ok() which does not recognize my box as a trusted host . If I hack plaintext_is_ok() to return true, I get Fault 711: 'The signature verification failed.' Do all XML -RPC client calls need to be signed now, and if so, how? Are there any XML-RCP server and client samples for 2.0? Thanks in advance for any help! -Bill",

Or do I have to create similar methods at same urls so that the SP(moodle in my case) can call IdP (my application - java web app / not moodle) for session and user verification? { SP calls \"auth/mnet/auth.php/user_authorise\" on IdP via XML -RPC with token and user's useragent string as parameters IdP verifies MNet session and returns user data SP may fetch additional data from IdP, add user to its own DB, update enrolments on IdP, etc. } Please correct me if I am wrong in interpreting the mnet document. About passing params, I am able to pass params to moodle. Thank You",

Now I want to add another Moodle and I want 30 different students to go from my first Moodle into the second Moodle What I don't understand -because I haven't tested it yet- is how I can ensure the first 30 students can only go to Mahara and the second 30 students can only go to the other Moodle, because that is what I want.

I've set up the networking to the best of my understanding, but now we are running into a bit of a problem. I can not get an account (demostudent) to connect from Moodle A to Moodle B without having \"auto add remote users\" turned to Yes. The problem is that both Moodle A and Moodle B are authenticating against the same active directory, and when auto add remote users is turned on, a second account is created. For our students, they may log in from any number of different sites - all of which operate at different subdomains: moodlea.myhost.org, moodleb.myhost.org, etc... How can I allow for roaming without the creation of duplicate accounts?",

I'm way out of my league here, but I'll postulate a bit and the community can tell me if my idea is not feasible. Essentially the \"network\" blocks are SSO links. Why can we not use the LDAP capture authentication information and pass it through to a remote moodle instance that has already been \"verified\" by my moodle instance. I work for an Educational Service Agency, and we have been able to get SSO from inside of Moodle to Learn360, Discovery, ELGG, and a few other sites. It seems reasonable that if we can capture and authenticate our LDAP information from within Moodle and pass it on to these external resources, we should be able to do it with another instance of Moodle.

In your case, you would have to have a single Moodle instance as an entry point to the whole portal - let us say login.myhost.org. This Moodle instance would authenticate your users against your LDAP. All other Moodle servers - moodlea.myhost.org, moodleb.myhost.org etc. - would be just SSO'ed via MNet with this main portal. These Moodles would not be connected to your LDAP. The central hub server would be the place where the master copies of user profiles are kept. All students would have to go to this login.myhost.org portal first and then they would roam to their courses at different remote servers. That is how MNet is supposed to be used if all servers in the MNet cluster (peer network) share the same LDAP.",

In the block I created an image that when clicked on executes a hidden form that passes the credentials to the login/index.php of the second Moodle site. All that the user needs to do is click on a hyperlink (image) of the moodle to which they want to navigate. Providing that both moodle A and moodle B are authenticating against the same AD, it should work. At least it did work between my sites. Maybe this isn't true/pure SSO, but in the eyes of the end user, they never have to retype in their username and password, so the functionality is basically the same.

Hope this is the right place for me to share this good solution. follow step by step of my instruction: 1) Open php.ini in your xampp/apache/bin/php.ini uncomment extension=php_openssl.dll that mean you must remove the symbol of ';' 2) Open config.php in your moodle folder xampp\\htdocs\\moodle\\config.php 3) This is the tricky one. Just include $CFG->opensslcnf ='C:\\xampp\\apache\\bin\\openssl.cnf'; -> you must insert the right path to your openssl.cnf and a very simple in xampp you can find it in xampp\\apache\\bin\\openssl.cnf see the config.php file below with text blue color. I use XAMPP 1.7.0 and Moodle 1.9.7 Stable version and it works. <?php /// Moodle Configuration File unset($CFG); $CFG->dbtype = ' mysql '; $CFG->dbhost = 'localhost'; $CFG->dbname = 'moodle'; $CFG->dbuser = 'root'; $CFG->dbpass = '*****'; $CFG->dbpersist = false; $CFG->prefix = 'mdl_'; $CFG->opensslcnf ='C:\\xampp\\apache\\bin\\openssl.cnf'; $CFG-> wwwroot = 'http://localhost/moodle'; $CFG-> dirroot = 'C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\moodle'; $CFG-> dataroot = 'C:\\xampp/moodledata'; $CFG->admin = 'admin'; $CFG->directorypermissions = 00777; // try 02777 on a server in Safe Mode $CFG->passwordsaltmain = 'Vol!d;`!{[FFFO,YVX5{^;N?9r~G'; require_once(\"$CFG->dirroot/lib/setup.php\"); // MAKE SURE WHEN YOU EDIT THIS FILE THAT THERE ARE NO SPACES, BLANK LINES, // RETURNS, OR ANYTHING ELSE AFTER THE TWO CHARACTERS ON THE NEXT LINE. ?> *REMEMBER* Dont try to do something funny to install opensll in XAMPP, reminder... OpenSSL is already installed in your XAMPP machine. Its great, isnt it?? 4) Then thats it.

With this setting on, any user from the identity provider can land at the CP without have any course enrolment.

The easiest way to assign this, is to give it to the \"Logged in user role\", but of course your requirements may be more granular than this. So - if it's a roles/permissions issue, this should fix it. The error message you're reporting can only eventuate if: The user doesn't have permission to roam The user is a remote user who has already roamed to your Moodle The user's username is the literal string 'guest' The user's ID is not set (which can't be the case here) Of these issues, \"inadequate permissions\" is the one most likely to be causing your problem.

Until Monday, our trusted relationships worked perfectly. Since Monday, however, schools trying to connect to the collaborative Moodle are being met with a time gap error, such as: RPC auth/mnet/user_authorise:Time gap with moodlename (16.5 seconds) is greater than the permitted maximum of 15 seconds ERROR 6:6:Time gap with moodlename (16.5 seconds) is greater than the permitted maximum of 15 seconds. After some troubleshooting, I can confirm: (a) multiple Moodle installations on the hosted server allow roaming between each other, without issue (b) the Moodle installations on the hosted server allow roaming out to other, external Moodle installations (c) when external Moodle installations try to roam to the hosted/collaborative Moodle, they get this error about the Time Gap. I've read the few threads on this site that pertain to this, and have tried manually overriding the threshold limit to take it from 15 seconds to 60. No dice! The last time it worked was late Sunday evening, and since then I have made no changes on the admin side --- which suggests, of course, that the problem lies with the hosted server.",

This became more important when we trialled a virtual Mahara server (connected via MNet) where Windoes Server Something Or Other was the host . The time was slipping on it terribly, so much that we had to modify CRON to run once per hour on the virtual server. A pain, and shouldn't be necessary, but the end result is working a working Mahoodle. TV stations can show several minutes' difference in time, so I suggest that it's not impossible for different Moodle installs, on different servers, to exist outside of 15 seconds syncronisation. If yo have shell access to your servers, try: ntpdate -d uk.pool.ntp.org ...or another time server to see how far off (or not) you are, and if possible, try the same thing from the 'incoming' servers too.

Sadly, the issue persists and external Moodle installations are not able to connect to the collaborative Moodle. Everyone is still getting a time gap error of anywhere between 16.5 and 18 seconds.   Moodle installations hosted on the same server as the collaborative one can connect to it just fine, however.  The collaborative Moodle can connect \"out\" to other peer modules without issue, too. I am still convinced that this is a time issue, but am not sure what else I can do to troubleshoot this.  Are there any safe hacks to override this setting, behind the scenes? I have already hard-coded a value of 60 for the threshold in in mnet/xmlrpc/client.php, but that doesn't seem to have done the trick. Any other ideas would be much appreciated!

From there I went back to moodle and under networking / peers i added the peer using the correct wwwroot. set the services, saved, and deleted the old one. whew.

Let's assume that this is the problem you're having... we need to make the networking block appear for you student user. Is the student enrolled as a student in the site course? If not, then the networking block won't appear when the student user is at the Moodle homepage. If you think this might be the problem, could you try enabling the network block on a course that the student is enrolled in?

Anyway, I have one install of Moodle (1.8.2+) with many, many sites using the one install.  I am at a County Office of Education and we are supporting numerous school districts, education programs, and a series of online courses that I have written.  I have enabled networking with the online course site and with one of the education programs.  We want to offer the online courses as a \"freebie\" to those enrolled in the education program.  I have also enable networking in the program.  When I login as a teacher, course creator, administrator, I can see the network block on the program site to the courses site.  Good.  When I login as a student, however, I do not see the block.  This means that the students (actually program participants) must go to the courses site and login a second time.  The students have the same roles and permissions on both sites. Did I answer your question?",

I am running Moodle on a windows 2000 server, and using Uniserver V5 Nano to run the Moodle website I made the following changes, which solved the problem. 1. I added the Listen command in httpd file from ....\\ server \\apache\\conf as per reply from Cal Handy. 2. I also editedthe \"conf.php file in my www folder to read the following ($CFG-> wwwroot = ' http://10.1.72.9 ';). Where \"10.1.72.9\" is the IP of the Server on my local network. 3. I also added a line to the windows \"hosts\" file to read (Dizzy-web 10.1.72.9) where Dizzy-web is the name of my web server, and 10.1.72.9 is the IP address. I now call up the website, from anywhere on the network, using either the server's IP address (10.1.72.9) or the name (Dizzy-web) I hope this helps you and closes your problem Regards DizzyG",

Try changing the instance name in the Moodle Admin panel and hope that admin has got the DNS correct. Then regenerate the certificates. Try again. Mnet has it's own certificates that it shares with other moodles. The base problem will be that the certificate is generated for the domain name not the machine name. The domain name will be something like www.mymoodle.com/moodleA the machine it runs on beastie.mymoodle.com. This may take a bit of thinking.

The only differences being: portal has \"Auto add remote users\" set to no whereas elearning has it set to yes. portal has LDAP authentication enabled as well and appears above Moodle Networking I have also got ticks in every box under services on both hosts. Still no joy! Doing a bit of digging: Clicking the link in Network Servers takes me to [HIDDEN]/elearning/auth/mnet/land.php?token=cdf0ff5ce156e05093e74abed3c7314fe25f3db8&idp=[HIDDEN]/portal&wantsurl= Looking at the code in land.php I see confirm_mnet_session and track the error message down as coming from line 276. So the test (($mnetrequest->send($remotepeer) === true) has failed. Looking further this is a result of SELECT * FROM {$CFG->prefix}mnet_rpc r, {$CFG->prefix}mnet_service2rpc s2r, {$CFG->prefix}mnet_host2service h2s WHERE r.xmlrpc_path = '{$this->method}' AND s2r.rpcid = r.id AND s2r.serviceid = h2s.serviceid AND h2s.subscribe = '1' AND h2s.hostid in ({$id_list})\"; returning no records. Echoing the SQL gives me $id_list of 1,2. But in my database for elearning the id of the remote host is 3. I did a print_r of the $mnet_peer object which is used to get the id and looking at it, it appears to be from the database which supports portal and not elearning. Have I got confused and this is right? Or is it getting the records from the wring database (possibly caused by our config hacks to use the same code files?) Thanks again for your time, Ian",

Mahara is fine if you log in normally (at least as an admin) but when you try to navigate to it from Moodle it fails completely. I see EXEC failures in the error log (it's been disabled by the host ) but I don't know if that's related to me not being able to single-sign-on?

Yes, they should be able to run fine on the same host. Even using the same hostname, e.g. example.com/moodle and example.com/mahara. Mahara needs exec to detect image files correctly - at least in Mahara 1.0. Exec isn't required for MNET, but if you don't have exec you won't be getting the best out of your install. For example, the image blocktype will appear to not give you any images to choose from to put in a View. The last thing I think you could try - if you turn the debug setting all the way to the maximum (it's somewhere in the admin settings for Moodle), do you get any messages when trying to delete the key?",

First, please put all debugging messages on and I assume that you have done all setup for Peer to peer Network from 1 to 3 on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Network . my situation is that I would like to enrol some of courses which remote moodle offers to a local user. go to Admin>Networking>Enrolments click a link for a remote Moodle host name I have the following Notice Notice : Undefined property: stdClass::$defaultrolename in /var/www/moodle_norie/enrol/mnet/enrol.php on line 480 in enrol.php file they get course object, (line 444) $courses = $mnetrequest->response; when I print_object($courses), no attribute called defaultrolename so I change the code from $dbcourse->defaultrolename = addslashes($dbcourse->defaultrolename); to $dbcourse->name = addslashes($dbcourse->name); after that this Notice message disappear. then another notice Notice : Undefined index: xtfa211 in /var/www/moodle_norie/admin/mnet/enr_course_enrol.php on line 144 Notice : Undefined index: xtfa211 in /var/www/moodle_norie/admin/mnet/enr_course_enrol.php on line 145 Notice : Undefined index: xtfa211 in /var/www/moodle_norie/admin/mnet/enr_course_enrol.php on line 148 Column 'rolename' cannot be null INSERT INTO mdl_mnet_enrol_assignments ( USERID, HOSTID, COURSEID, ROLENAME, ENROLTIME, ENROLTYPE ) VALUES ( 15231, 4, 8, null, null, null ) line 1554 of lib/dmllib.php: call to debugging() line 149 of admin/mnet/enr_course_enrol.php: call to insert_record() I check enr_course_enrol.php and found when we enroll a user for a remote course for the first time, (line 88) $all_enrolled_users = $mnet_request->response; $all_enrolled_users is return to 0 for $ sql query (line 111) which return most of users from local mdl_user table, but I have not selected the local users to enrol. then the code adds the users to mdl_mnet_enrol_assignments table such that INSERT INTO mdl_mnet_enrol_assignments ( USERID, HOSTID, COURSEID, ROLENAME, ENROLTIME, ENROLTYPE ) VALUES ( 15231, 4, 8, null, null, null ) and as ROLENAME is not set, it is complaining.

IIRC, where moodle is sending out emails, and the mnethostid of the user is not the localhost id, it will try to make it work such that they bounce through their home moodle to log in.

          "Text": "There are a few significant negative consequences of allowing MNET users to roam again. They mostly center around the fact that you'll quickly end up with many duplicate accounts for users, depending on which host they enter another host from. Example: Let's say you have just four moodles in your network: Moodle 1, 2, 3 and 4. And for simplicity, let's assume that users only ever get accounts on Moodle 1 initially. When a user roams from Moodle 1 to Moodle 2, they will get an account there. This account will be marked as having come from Moodle 1 (mnethostid column of user table). Likewise, the user roaming from Moodle 1 to 3 will have the same effect. Now if this user roams from Moodle 2 to 3, they will not be put in the same account as if they had roamed from Moodle 1 to 3. Instead, a new account will be created for them associated with Moodle 2. And if they roam from 3 back to Moodle 1, yet another account will be created for them. You can see the problem I hope - soon there are many accounts on all the Moodles, all associated with this one user, and you're unable to get to them except by browsing through the Moodle Network in the explicit path it took t create them. This problem gets worse with having more Moodles, and worse again if users can initially sign up at more than one Moodle. Until someone traces through all the consequences and works out a solution, it doesn't make sense for now to even make this configurable.",

          "Text": "Thanks Nigel. I was gathering something like this, as I already saw some duples in our test system. As it is a \"mandatory\" requirement in our architecture. I'm up to find a turn around for that. My idea is to find the location to keep the \"origin\" of the account safe through any bounce. Of course this will require that the \"origin\" mnet_host is registered in the landing location, so a valid mnethostid can be found for this incoming user. In this case we should keep a unique identity of a user across all our moodles, as long as he has a unique entry point that he will capture as origin. In case we have no registered host for him, there would be a real issue to take the incoming host as reference. This would break again identity unicity and present a risk of duplication : say A -> B and C, B and C -> D, user a from A comming to B and registered as a::A, a comming to C registered as a::A, a comming to D through B registered as a::B, a::A comming to D through C would want to register as a::C. That not fits. So would we reject registration in this case. There is another turn around in our case : as we have a unique \"username\" scheme, it would be easy to disable mnet_host caracterization on auth/mnet/auth.php§start_jump_session() so we default mnethostid to the first identified mnet_host for that username.

Without knowing how your Moodles are distributed would there be potential for any confusion around this? Do you envision users being able to roam across the network freely or will you be controlling the courses they access via some automated enrolment process? Do you expect to have their home Moodle Themes follow them through the network or will they just see each sites theme? There are implications for how networked users access support services etc that we have used theming to solve in our own mnet project. Also interested in what makes Moodle networking a better solution than some federated identity/access management system like Shibboleth ? Cheers David",

          "Text": "David, Nigel, Answers for you two : The roaming mechanism is now completed and runs nicely using a transparent \"base jumping\" from the origin site of the user. Logs are preserved that way and I tested a quite fluid circulation of the user across the network, keeping its origin identity safe all along the path. The benefit of such architecture is that : we can twick the whole semantics of the platform GUI in some zones differently so sections of the \"global platform\" can come further to users contextual needs. we can segmentate the whole space within smaller zones, fo witch we have a complete front page with segmentated summary. we can spread a huge user base (400.000 foreseen in 2011) on separate satellites, having a small set of users who will be enclined to roam (or will have to) so we keep user table and other very central tables smaller. we can make local adapations in theming and propose several \"worlds\" to our users. These could have been achieved partially with category theming, but not with a full home appearance. We don't use user themes here indeed. It is a very tighen project where we keep full control on design, so there is no theme roaming issue. About the ability of loging in from everywhere (any door ?). I'm thinking about it, because of better user convenience. As the entire platform appears as a set of distinct base URLs, it should be better we can log a user at any door. What I plan is to allow any user THAT HAS ROAMED ONCE to log from that door, so we already know his username and his origin mnethostid. It is easy for us to allow him transparently get a suitable session there and bring him back to the starting platform. We cannot do that with completely \"unknown\" users, so we would redirect them to their origin entry point.",

We added to the project a \"multinet\" auth layer that allows \"login from everywhere\" behaviour (almost MNET internal SSO behaviour). Works nice and we could spread our potentially 1,400,000 accounts across the 40 Moodle grid. Actually security has been addressed and I reinforced the check of origin of the users as counterpart of the networking opening. We essentially \"base jump\" within a trusted moodle network, in which foreign instances might not connect unless the interconnection strongly reviewed. As Nigel said, there is still some weaknesses in reports, specially dealing with foreign stats from other nodes of the network.

          "Text": "Hello, I have a big problem. We had a server running Moodle 1.7+ with database . It was accessed through the local university network and through the Internet by distant users, everything worked quite suitable for us. Recently, we downloaded version 1.7.2+ and copied it to the server. It upgraded the database to 1.7.2+ successfully. However, a huge problem arised. Everything is accessed through local network successfully. However, then some of our users try to open large html pages (in size, with pictures) through the internet, they cannot do that on slow connections (phone modems). More precisely - the page is starting to load, but after some time, before it loads completely, it simply restarts and the load goes again and again. The problem is not with accessing server through global network, since on speedy connections everything works fine. I tried to downgrade to previous version and moved 1.7+ code back again, however, the problem did not disappear. Also warnings arised for some modules (forum, for example) - that they cannot downgrade. What could be causing such problem? We have set up large execution time in php.ini, so what else? Currently our environment is this: Windows 2003 server, Apache 2.2.4, PHP 5.1.4 (came with standard Moodle package 1.7+), MySQL 5.0.24. Everything works just great in local network. What's wrong with the global?",

And I further investigated the code of this function in 1.9.4+, it did not change at all, the algo is the same, so migration will not help much. I will try to use the utilities that you advised, thanks for advice. Maybe there is some parameter in PHP or Apache that blocks the output of such an amount of data? I will try to change the size of the chunk and will see, if that helps.",

          "Text": "Hi guys We just achieved a small but efficient SSO layer in a full open Moodle Network. A \"full open\" Moodle Network is a set of moodle connected together in which multiple hops are allowed. In such a network, a user is always known as its username/origjn_mnethostid information pair. Achieveing this was done by delegating the MNET session jumping to the origin host of the user, when he tries to jump from another node in the network. (Works perfectly, but will need some side effect fix on reports, as Nigel McNie suspected). I finished the design of a new Auth plugin, that allows SSOing any user of the network, this very simple plusing does the following : Capturing (must be set very high in the auth stack) the username/password submission, using login_page_hook loop at start of login/index.php Applying an heuristic over the username syntax to check for a probable origin host. (this works fairly well when a moodle node is mapped adminsitratively to an email domain , and the username is the email address). Building a redirection to the remote login/index.php, with a required URL that points back the local landing page. (the effect is that the user is actually login on his own origin node, but requiring immediately a jump to where he was supposing going first !!) Execute the redirection If the heuristic fails and there is a default node setup, the login process is delegated to that default Moodle. If none of the above works, the auth plugin let go through to try a local login (or other pethods in the stack). The process is completely compatible with a backside LDAP authentication (so we are making it work) and encrypts the login delegation for security, making an SSO ticket encrypted stub with identification data in it (using registered Mnet keys).",

It sounds like you're using username to infer which MNET peer has that user. This almost sounds like a question you'd want to ask each peer in turn - as long as you knew that usernames were unique across your entire set of MNET peers, which is unlikely I guess. This is the reason why Mahara won't let Moodle users necessarily create their accounts on the Mahara side until they've SSOed over - so we know for sure that 'bob' from Moodle 1 == 'bob' in Mahara, while 'bob' in Moodle 2 == 'bob1' in Mahara.",

          "Text": "Hi Nigel, Actually you're right. The Multinode MNET SSO relies on a consistant naming of usernames in all the Network. We have this kind of control in our 35 Moodle nodes for Pairformance/Intel's TAO implementation. We do not allow having similar usernames, or these users will have a special username form that jumps out of our heuristic (and thus try the default, or just try a local login). This would actually NOT BE suitable to a multi-institution network that have no consistant policy on user acocunt creation. Dealing with institutional email address, we could force having a consistant namespace for all our users, and having an exception handling for some very special cases (eg. admin !! or external guests...) The routing is perfect, in both cases !! The heuristic requires depositing a REGEX to apply to usernames. This is a very simple approach, and might be extended on use case requests. say we have a username that is : alain.bolli@ac-libourne.fr (I'm sorry Alain, but the town is bullshit, so no span to fear !!). The regex is : .*@(.*)\\.fr that collects the \"ac-libourne\") Can alos be entered in the auth plugin settings a replacable pattern to use this recollection back : <%%HOSTNAME%%>.pairformance.education.fr wich is that actual naming sheme for all the nodes... and guess Alain comes from ac-libourne.pairformance.education.fr !!",

In this case we break the service. As in our situation, we use a 40 mnetworked Moodle array within a coherent nationwide system, so there are \"intimous\" XML-RPC exchanges between platforms to federate contents. So we need XML-RPC calls to be performed, including with some delay. The resolution of the call is more important than the delay it takes, as long as it can logically be concluded. Cheers.",

This error generally occurs because the message (payload) from the remote server has had something added, usually but a php echo statement. This causes the above error because all content returned must be encrypted and when it's output outside the usual boundaries the message contains both encrypted and non encrypted text. Fixing this issue is the fun (aka awkward) part because you need to find out which line of code causes the issue. The main way I address this is to knock up a dev page which calls the necessary function and outputs its response so I can see what is being returned. Then I comment out or short circuit parts of the code until I narrow down which parts are causing the issue to a few lines. Once I know the lines causing the error it often becomes obvious. any way I hope this provides some clarity if only a little.",

In testing, MNet works for me 100% of the time.... even when I'm demoing it to clients! It's worth noting that I've done all my development and most of my testing on PHP5, and I'd recommend that you use PHP5 if you have the choice. I know that lots of Moodle users are unable to do that, and we certainly don't try to exclude PHP4 users, but PHP5 is the most used and tested configuration, both for MNet and (I think) other parts of Moodle core.",

I tested the roaming function and it didn't do what I thought it would. I re-read the documentation and spotted this line: 'You should see the Network Servers block, and clicking on it you should go to MoodleB with a newly autocreated account. ' So basically my Moodles are doing exactly what it said they would, but I now realise that wasn't what I was hoping for! This is where it gets complicated does the Moodle I've roamed to see that autocreated account as a completely different account? I have people with accounts in several Moodles that currently have to keep logging in (using LDAP ) to each of the different moodles and my thought had been that this network thing would stop that. Is there anyway to attach the auto-created account to the account that the person already had in the second moodle? I'm not sure I've explained that terrribly well. Thanks",

It looks like you were originally able to exchange keys between Moodles, so this really doesn't look like a problem. If your Moodles are running on the same host, can you check that they're using different Moodledata directories (in config.php) 'Payload not encrypted' can often mean that a PHP error has occurred on the host that sent the payload, and an error report was injected into the XML . Check your PHP error log for clues. If one site is on HTTP and the other on HTTPS, things should work as normal. I haven't tested this much, but it ought to work. How do the sites talk to each other? They exchange XML over the normal web service. There's nothing special to enable - if your machines are serving web pages, and PHP has the XML-RPC, CURL and OpenSSL extensions installed, you should be good to go. These are all pretty common - you can check if your Moodles have these available by visiting /admin/environment.php Anything in your error logs Michael?",

          "Text": "Hi all I work at the same school as Mike Harrison (he's my boss ) and i just thought I would add my bit to this and tell you where we are now We made the decision to move from windows/iis to centos/apache as we had successfully got 2 moodle instances to talk on a centos box. I migrated our instance over (we'll call that site A) and make a brand new instance to use as a public VLE (Site B) I still ran into problems with this configuration and found that to fix it I had to take a look at the database table mdl_mnet_host and correct the url for entry id 1 which is your own moodle. We had to do this as we migrated our moodle from one url to another and the entry was wrong. This would also apply to people who install moodle on a test server to play around with then migrate to a production server I suppose. The next problem we had the pulled up the you do not have permissions blah blah error was to do with our wwwroot and https. Even though we had set https only for login the site would stay in https for users after login. We are pretty sure this is because of something our ISA server is doing as we are running in masquerading mode behind a firewall. Even though I created the networking key whilst in https mode we would still get that error. I found that if you change the url manually to http all worked perfectly. Site A users could roam to Site B and I could enrol them from our instance remotely. We decided to cut our losses and change the wwwroot to https and run in secure only mode. I regenerated the key in networking, deleted the partnerships and restablished them. Now everything is all sorted.... for us! We have 2 other schools that need to roam to our public site as we are hosting a Virtual Reading group for our federation of schools. 1 schools moodle seems to connect fine and users can roam to our public VLE but they cannot enrol users remotely. When you try to you get the good old RPC message enrol/mnet/available_courses:ERROR 7:couldn't connect to host The other site the time is skewed so until their peeps sort this I cannot check roaming but we get the same error 7 message when enrolling remotely... I'm hoping it is something to do with the what I described at the top with urls in the database but can't be certain just for info though if you do need to do a find and replace in the database, for example after a url change, try the tool in the admin folder of your moodle. /admin/replace.php works a treat but backup before ;) just in case oh the joys!",

Likewise, you had the problem with the wwwroot in the host table for your local host. Moving wwwroot when using MNET is a tricky business because of these issues. You _certainly_ have to regenerate the SSL keys, and you _probably_ have to look around in the db and fix the wwwroot for the host idenitified by $CFG->mnet_localhost_id. PeterB and I came up with a plan to ditch that particular row out of the host table, but neither of us have had time to implement it, or even file a bug for it I think. Though even if that was fixed, you'd still need to delete the keys when moving wwwroot, which I don't think is mentioned in the documentation when it should be. BTW : the couldn't connect to host message is a http level thing, are you sure that you're trying to connect to the right host/port, that firewalling isn't in the way etc?",

The current setup is as follows: Previous tests were in Moodle 1.9 beta 2 (upgraded today to beta 3 although it states that its actually beta 4?!) Running on a LAMP Setup with: Suse Enterprise Linux inet 2.6.16.46-0.12 PHP 5.1.2 Apache 2.2.3 MySQL 5.0.26 All other moodle environment/server checks are green and state ok (openssl, curl, etc...). Implemented using virtual hosts with different IP addresses on the same network (a10.3.0.61 & b10.3.0.62); with seperate data directories and cookie sessions. MNET was setup using the instructions on moodle docs , and most roles have been setup to allow roaming capability When I'm logged in (as admin) to site:a/b and attempt to go to site:b/a You do not have permission to begin a remote session. on continue I'am led to site:b/a but not logged in. Whenever I click on the host within the enrolment section I get RPC enrol/mnet/available_courses:ERROR 1:Payload not encrypted I've been through the threads in the network forum these errors (and a few more) seem to appear quite a bit. I've worked through most of the suggestions but I'am still encountering errors... It seems that people have got this feature to work so any more tips/solutions would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm working on an upgraded file_manager version, adding an \"capturing URL in the text\" filter. As I'm full networked, the filter will send the captured link information to the filemanager instance of the owner's regular mnethost (the host he his know he is from... using a special patch of Mnet that allows that -> Nigel is aware !! ). Adding the link can be done by triggering a direct URL in the blocks/file_manager implementation, bringing the adequate parameters. Two implementation solutions : 1. Designing a new XML -RPC service and function call attached to blocks/file_manager. Thus called through a mnet client standard invocation. 2. Having a curl direct call to a local jump url targetting the same foreing URL on remote moodle, and giving required params in the wanturl encoded string.",

It will give a response that is easier for the computer to parse, which would be important if something goes wrong with the remote call and you need to debug. However, you should note that Moodle by default doesn't allow MNet calls to blocks. It only searches for XML-RPC calls in the auth/, enrol/, and mod/ directories (plus portfolio/ and repository/ in Moodle 2.0). (See mnet/xmlrpc/ server .php, function mnet_server_dispatch for more information on how it maps XML-RPC methods to PHP calls, as I don't think it's documented anywhere.) There are various ways around it, but there may be issues. Adding a new XML-RPC call for Moodle may be a bit tricky, so from a practical standpoint, it may be easier to use jump.php. (Just remember that you need to send along a few cookies, so that Moodle knows what user you're using.) However, from a philosophical standpoint, it is better to use XML-RPC.",

In the other Moodle, it is missing and the date is crazy(something like december 1962) . When I click to \"create\" a new public key, it fails, I see for just one second a message or error and it disappears as if the site did not exist. Curiously, the installations(1.9.2) made through Fantasticos Script do not \"have\" the public key.  The installation(1.9.3) manually done has it.  They are on the same hosting service. So the extensions are the same and the servers have the same characteristics( I believe). Do you have some advice? I know that most people do not like Fantastico , but I can say that this is the first problem I have with Moodle. I have been using Moodle (installed through Fantastico) for about 7 or 8 months. A second question: is it possible to connect more than 2 moodle by using the simple network procedure, adding more than one host (url)? I thank you in advance for your help! Márcio",

We planned to add cron rotation also as more of a \"backup\" than anything else, but haven't done it yet. I will say this again, to make sure people reading this thread see it- this is an incredibly insecure way to do key rotation. Basically, the problem is that you're asking for the public key without taking any steps to guarantee that the reply is coming from the host you think it is.

The first part get's the information you have in your database regarding a peer: $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $mnet_peer->set_id($hostid); No problem here, right(?) since you are reading data from your own database. The next part get's the current public key of the wwwroot, which you just got from your database, and if they don't match it updates. $currentkey = mnet_get_public_key($mnet_peer->wwwroot); Doesn't the mnet_get_public_key function check the host? I am not familiar with curl so am not clear on what exactly the function is doing, but I see these two lines within that function: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0); So that looks to me like it is verifing.

You're asking curl to make a HTTP request to a host at hostname 'X' - an unencrypted, unsigned request. You have no proof whatsoever that the host at that hostname is the same as the host you used to communicate with, and anyone who is listening in on your connection can send you back a bogus reply claiming to be from that hostname, thus causing you to store the attacker's chosen public key. The curl options are largely irrelevant. It is not an HTTPS connection that is being made between the hosts - it is a HTTP request that is signed and encrypted using openssl, which is slightly different. Currently Moodle ensures security by sending a signed, encrypted messages back and forth using the older keys to make sure that the new key is retrieved securely. If you're having problems with the key rotation, it's likely that you need to upgrade your Moodle installations. What version of Moodle are you running on each end?",

          "Text": "Hi Peter, Nigel... we encountered also the same problem than Michael in our TAO/Pairformance implementation for Intel. The fact is that the key rotation did not run properly in our case on 1.9.3 codebase. There is moreover another case where the \"just when necessary\" key upgrading does not comply the need : when using, as we do, massive use of XML -RPC data transfers between platform, for data exchange servicing. When adding such services, you barely not use the auth hook that could renew those keys. Keys should be renewed essentially throiugh an explicit remote auth action of a remote user. We cannot wait for that event in our case. So we made such an automated renewal solution : We implemented it in a local/mnetcron.php hook to not denature standard code (although we rely on an unevitable patch in mnet/lib.php) : <?php /// check keys and reniew with peers. /// requires : patching /mnet/xmlrpc/ server .php for mnet_keyswap() /// requires : patching /mnet/lib.php for mnet_keyswap() global $MNET; mtrace(\" Cron automatic rotation for MNET keys...\\n\"); if (!isset($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_gap)) set_config('mnet_key_autorenew_gap', 24 * 3); // three days // if autorenewal is enabled and we are mnetworking if (!empty($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew) && $CFG->mnet_dispatcher_mode != 'none'){ include_once $CFG->dirroot.\"/mnet/peer.php\"; include_once $CFG->dirroot.\"/mnet/lib.php\"; // check if key is getting obsolete $havetorenew = 0; // key is getting old : check if it is time to operate if ($MNET->public_key_expires - time() < $CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_gap * HOURSECS){ // this one is needed as temporary global toggle between distinct cron invocations, // but should not be changed through the GUI if (empty($CFG->mnet_autorenew_haveto)){ set_config('mnet_autorenew_haveto', 1); mtrace('Local key is expiring. Need renewing MNET keys...'); } else { if (!empty($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_time)){ $now = getdate(time()); if ($now['hours'] > $CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_time){ $havetorenew = 1; } } else { $havetorenew = 1; } } } // renew if needed $force = optional_param('forcerenew', 0, PARAM_INT); if ($havetorenew || $force){ mtrace(\"Local key will expire very soon. Renew MNET keys now !!...\\n\"); // make a key and exchange it with all known and active peers $mnet_peers = get_records('mnet_host', 'deleted', 0); // reniew local key $MNET->replace_keys(); // send new key using key exchange transportation if ($mnet_peers){ foreach($mnet_peers as $peer){ if (($peer->id == $CFG->mnet_all_hosts_id) || ($peer->id == $CFG->mnet_localhost_id)) continue; $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $mnet_peer->set_wwwroot($peer->wwwroot); // get the sessions for each vmoodle that have same ID Number // we use a force parameter to force fetching the key remotely anyway $currentkey = mnet_get_public_key($mnet_peer->wwwroot, $mnet_peer->application, 1); if ($currentkey){ $mnet_peer->public_key = clean_param($currentkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key = clean_param($currentkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($currentkey); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($currentkey); $mnet_peer->commit(); mtrace('Key renewed for '.$peer->wwwroot.' till '.userdate($mnet_peer->public_key_expires)); } else { mtrace('Failed renewing key with '.$peer->wwwroot); } } } set_config('mnet_autorenew_haveto', 0); } } ?> This relies on a little change in get_public_key() and on the remote system/keyswap call that it implies  : we added a force mode, that allows ofrcing renewal on certain conditions : /** * Accepts a public key from a new remote host and returns the public key for * this host. If 'register all hosts' is turned on, it will bootstrap a record * for the remote host in the mnet_host table (if it's not already there) * * @param  string  $function XML -RPC requires this but we don't... discard! * @param  array   $params        Array of parameters *                                $params[0] is the remote wwwroot *                                $params[1] is the remote public key * @return string                 The XML-RPC response */ function mnet_keyswap($function, $params) { global $CFG, $MNET; $return = array(); $wwwroot        = $params[0]; $pubkey         = $params[1]; $application    = $params[2]; $forcerenew     = $params[3]; if ($forcerenew == 0){ // standard keyswap for first key recording if (!empty($CFG->mnet_register_allhosts)) { $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $keyok = $mnet_peer->bootstrap($wwwroot, $pubkey, $application); if ($keyok) { $mnet_peer->commit(); } } } else { $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); // we can only renew hosts that we know something about. if ($mnet_peer->set_wwwroot($wwwroot)){ $mnet_peer->public_key = clean_param($pubkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($pubkey); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key = clean_param($pubkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($pubkey); $mnet_peer->commit(); } return false; // avoid giving our key to unkown hosts. } return $MNET->public_key; } The precaution was not to let anyone ask for a key renewal, spoofing a registered host. I don't know if this precaution is sufficiant as it is. But it works in an internally secured subnetwork anyway. The above change in renew process needs just passing an extra param in get_public_key (mnet/lib.php) : /** * Get the remote machine's SSL Cert * * @param  string  $uri     The URI of a file on the remote computer, including *                          its http:// or https:// prefix * @return string           A PEM formatted SSL Certificate. */ // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal : adding force function mnet_get_public_key($uri, $application=null, $force=0) { // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal global $CFG, $MNET; // The key may be cached in the mnet_set_public_key function... // check this first // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal // cache location of key must be bypassed when we need an automated renew. if (!$force){ $key = mnet_set_public_key($uri); if ($key != false) { return $key; } } // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal if (empty($application)) { $application = get_record('mnet_application', 'name', 'moodle'); } // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal $rq = xmlrpc_encode_request('system/keyswap', array($CFG->wwwroot, $MNET->public_key, $application->name, $force), array(\"encoding\" => \"utf-8\")); // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal $ch = curl_init($uri . $application->xmlrpc_server_url); ... This resolved all our issues of failure in standard key renewal, including those we would have expected to be working before the change. Cheers.",

This probably means you have encountered a bug in the system I checked the apache logs on Mahara's Linux server (This is my first foray into Linux servers, but I think I managed to get it set up properly) and it's complaining that the SSL Certificate is invalid. I assumed that this was because it's a self signed certificate, so I commented out that check in Mahara's XMLRPC/lib.php and then it threw another error complaining that the certificate's common name (CN) is blank, so does not compare to to URL of the moodle site. I've checked the certificate and it definitely has the address of the site there (doesn't have the http:// at the beginning, but at the moment that doesn't matter, can sort that later). After that, thought 'what the hey' and commented out the CN check just to see what would happen. Mahara then threw an unhandled error, so I put all that code back in play and decided to stop fiddling for a while. Has anyone come across this and know how to get around it? Or is it just a problem with the fact that I have a self signed SSL certificate? -Phill",

I see that 1.8 has an XML -RPC mechanism (which seems more geared toward hooking up moodles), but I'm not sure how to hook it up to a client-side app like contribute. I mostly want to write forum posts in Contribute, and for that, it seems as if Moodle social forums are best thought of (from the standpoint of Contribute) as a kind of blog . What is needed is something like an \"xmlrpc.php\" access point. I know that Contribute is popular with school systems, since it allows them to control access at a higher level and please those who are more used to apps like Word. Neither of these situations really apply to me (I'm a programmer). I want to use it mainly to keep myself organized. Has anyone tried to do this? Steve",

          "Title": "Moodle Networking – some ideas for bulk enrolments on networked courses",
          "Text": "A number of us involved in networking projects meet up at the recent MoodleMootNZ and tossed around some ideas for further improvement of mnet. While there are still a few quirks, the basic networking functionality is now at the point where it just works. But the manual enrolment interface is too basic to scale up, so we discussed some ideas to improve this based on the following points: Need to be able to bulk enrol students on networked courses Need to be able to assign users to more than just the student role within a networked course (e.g. a teacher) Need to be able to automatically assign users to a group within a networked course Need to keep Moodle as the data channel - don’t want local student account creation/course enrolment interfaces to have to talk to multiple moodles Need to allow for increasing amount of data in networked courses to be available in local Moodle (e.g. grades, course activity info in myMoodle listing etc). Taking these into account this is myrecollection of what the group came up. I post it here for others in the NZgroup to add their comments along with anyone in the wider community. Add an option for a user with a new role capability to tag a local course as a “networked course” and link it with a networked course located on a peered Moodle. Initially this would be a manual process, but it could develop into an automated process based on peerID and courseID mapping, plus identifying which course is the “destination” course. Once tagged in this way, any user associated with the local course is automatically associated with the network course, along with their role and group membership as defined in the local course. After tagging, local admin/process would still need to be able to add new users to the local course and have their role+group membership associated with networked course. Unenrolment would also need to be supported. Standard user would login on local Moodle, click on linked course name and go directly to networked course on remote Moodle. Course name would be defined by the name of the remote course. Local user with required role capability (e.g. admin) would be able to view 2 links to a networked course: local version + remote version, but only able to visit remote course if they have an appropriate course- context role. Obviously there will be issues with transferability of roles between Moodles. There would need to either be some agreement between peered Moodles on what roles can be transferred and perhaps some capability for an admin on the remote Moodle to authorise certain roles to be assigned by another site. Or more simply, just have the core Moodle course-context roles supported – i.e. guest, student, non-editing teacher, editing teacher. Would be great to be able to get grade info back to local moodle for local students (as a subset of all students on remote course) so local academic admin can access for official recording. But we ran out of time to discuss this and there may be better ways to do this outside the course framework. OK – is this how the rest of the NZ group remember the meeting and for the wider community, what are the limitations, technical difficulties, security issues or better ideas? David",

The suggested solution seems sensible to us, though we are keen to allow the developers (Catalyst) work out a solution that they consider best - given their knowledge of the infrastructure of Moodle and possible performance considerations. Below I have re-ordered the list in order of priority for development as we see it: Ability to bulk enrol students in networked courses (e.g. through enrolment plugin or csv file upload ). Ability to assign users to different roles in networked courses. Standard roles should be fine - so guest, student, non-editing teacher and editing teacher. Any additional assignment to roles can be managed at the remote course end. Account creation and enrolment of students into networked courses managed by the local Moodle instance (identity provider) without requiring additional processes to manage accounts / enrolment on the remote Moodle (content provider). Ability to turn off the auto greetings email notification for students who are directly enrolled in networked course. Exposure of remote course related data within the local Moodle instance - in particular: user activity, grades, calendar events and possibly MyMoodle listings. Automatic group assignment within networked courses How does this sound to everyone?",

Well from user's perspective (at least for our users at SFSU), they prefer to use \"Import\" feature rather than using the backup/restore feature, simply because we are running 3 moodle instances (for current semester and previous semesters that can back track to 2 years ago) with a seamless login script. It would make great sense (our support team confirmed this) to provide such feature for users to be able to import some course materials from one course (say, Fall 2006 semester, sitting on moodle1 server), to, the course that he/she will be teaching this semester (say, Fall 2008 semester, sitting on moodle3 server). Currently we are thinking of using base64_encode() and decode to implement this, instead of using XML -PRC. So it probably would look like this: remotecourse.php Input : a = hashed value of &action=getimportablecourses&username=[username]&password=[md5 password] Output : Returned an encoded serialized array structure of courses with categories to the output buffer. remoteimport.php Input : a = hashed value of &action=getimportfile&username=[username]&password[md5 password]&courseid=[courseid]&output=[0=binary, 1=file location] Output : Returns either the relative file location (relative to moodledata, e.g., /moodledata/xxx/1025/backups/abc.zip) or the encoded serialized zip file.

If this is the case, I would expect a simple update of the Moodle record to remove the slash will fix your problem. If this is not the case, I have a query I'd like you to run against your mahara database. I'll add that in a subsequent post.",

This might be because you've made a mistake in configuring Mahara's XMLRPC Auth plugin, or it could be a bug. The query: SELECT * FROM auth_instance_config WHERE field = 'wwwroot'; Should return a record for each instance of the XMLRPC Auth plugin that you've configured - probably just one record at this stage. As I mentioned in the previous post, Mahoodle is very picky about this field... it must be character-for-character the same as that in Moodle's mnet_host table. If you get a result, take the instance field from that result and try the following query. Let's imagine your instance was 6: SELECT * FROM auth_instance WHERE id = '6'; If you get a result, that the institution field from the result and try the following query. Let's imagine your institution field was 'Gotham': SELECT * FROM institution WHERE name = 'Gotham'; If you've made it thus far without error, then I'll be surprised that you're receiving your error message. I hope that we can work out which query is failing, and from that starting point I can do some more digging.",

So I copied the key manually from Mahara and pasted in moodle. then I folowed the rest of the tutorial and when I finally clicked the link on moodle to go to Mahara, it said, The requested URL /mahara/htdocs/auth/mnet/land.php was not found on this server .

It's best to stop there and see if you can work out why the keyswap might not have worked. It might be like what Karl has done - you might not have chosen 'Mahara' from the dropdown when adding the new peer. The 1.0 code is actually better than the 0.9 code for SSO, by the way - although the beta is not ready for public use for other reasons",

This probably means you have encountered a bug in the system. I've had this problem at two seperate sites this week and, having just spent about 30mins wading through server error logs, I suddenly realise (embarrassingly ) that the public key for Mahara that Moodle is holding is out of date. Update the key and the problem is solved. *But* I thought that the public key would be updated automatically (i.e. Moodle would obtain a new key from Mahara when it expires).

Can someone give me an overview of what is supposed to happen as I think I know where mine is going wrong, but then again I'm not sure and sinking in a sea of ideas. I have a Windows 2003 server but I'm using Apache . My php didn't come with a sample openssl.cnf I do however have a file called openssl with no extension which looks like it probably can be turned into a sample openssl.cnf. I'm presuming you have to have a 'proper' openssl.cnf rather than a sample one. I can add an environment variable to Windows. However I'm going to assume that Moodle can't generate the certificate - am I supposed to generate the certificate manually, put it somewhere and then hope the system can cope with it? If I do this what happens if I have multiple moodles on one server, each with its own sub domain - can you have more than one certificate on a server? As you can see I have a major flaw in my understanding of public keys and where they come from or go to. If anyone can point me in the right direction as to where to be looking for guidance it would be wonderful. I'm thinking I actually have a php issue rather than a Moodle one, but I don't really know.

However, I've done the same on the server and no key yet. I have a suspicion I'm going to have to reboot it to make the changes to the openssl.cnf and environment variables take effect, but that isn't terribly convenient on a server. I've tried restarting Apache, but that didn't work either. Still hunting. Good luck with your networking. PS I've got the key to generate. for some reason if you include the file extension .cnf on the end of the file name the key does not generate. As soon as you take it off the key generates. In my mind this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but at least I have a key now so progress and I'll worry about understanding it all later!",

I've still got a little bit of experimenting to do tomorrow as a result of Howard's post. I'll report back with the findings. Cheers, Ian.",

So if worry that what your settings were at the time you copied the link might affect what happens when you click the link, don't. Your comment about permissions makes me worry you're mis-interpreting how roles & permissions work in this case. You can give the student, teacher or course-creator roles permission to jump, but since mnet checks for permission to jump in the system context , unless someone has one of those roles assigned at the system level it will have no affect. Assigning any of these three roles to a user at the system level has interesting consequences. I don't recommend it. Copying the link into a Teacher's only course doesn't provide security, only obsecurity. This might be ok with you, but you shouldn't be under the illusion that this will stop students from being able to mnet to your collge moodle. Anyone who is able to copy the link from somewhere, or has the nous to form it themselves will be able to mnet to your college Moodle. Where Nigel suggests using the SSO access control list, I suspect that he means you could do this on your college Moodle.",

The client connecting to me does... but I don't, if you see what I mean. Nor is he likely to tell me , because they are his students. Any restrictions in roaming away from the client site will have to be done on the client site. Peter: Ahhh, understand what your saying about permissions - thanks for that. I didn't realise that the \"Roam to remote Moodle\" permission has to be Allowed site-wide. I did try setting it in different contexts and you're right: the results were interesting . That encourages me to try again this morning. Understood also about special teacher course. We were going to set an enrolment key for this to prevent students from getting in.

Then (IMO) a db change or three is warranted: Currently: app --< host --< host2service >-- service --< service2rpc >-- rpc At present, there is a defined number of services, defined list of rpc's (methods), and a defined relationship between them. In host2service every peer is related to every defined service (3 peers w/ 3 services = 9 rows), with the additional information as to whether we subscribe to that service on the remote host, or publish that service to the remote host. If we allow other mnet peers to tell us what application they are, and services/methods information (and version of that application/service/method), if we don't have that application (version), that service (version), or that method (version) we would then create them. All this would mean recording version information about applications, services and methods, which application services relate to, and changing the host2service table into service_subscribe and service_publish tables. Needless to say, I have no pot of money to be able to do this (AFAIK), but I think it's worthwhile discussing 'how it oughta be'.  Once that's done, people have something they can point at when they're trying to sell it.",

The most practical way I can see around this atm, is to keep service information for each host.

          "Text": "Current moodle 1.8 /1.9 key rotation seems to work like this: * Our moodle creates a keypair, and sets expiry time for (default) 28 days. * 28 Days later, during the first cron run following the expiry of this keypair, generate a new keypair, and archive the old keypair. We keep (default) 3 old key pairs. * If another node encrypts something to us using one of the expired keypairs, reply with ERR_OLD_KEY, and supply the new public key. I presume that this message is returned signed, and it's signed using the old key that other node knows about. Assuming they haven't also rotated their key since we last sent them a message, they'll be able to read the reply, and update their record of our public key before repeating their original request. IMO , this has the following weaknesses: 1. In the time between the old keypair expiring, and the next cron run, there is no valid, current-dated keypair. 2. Sometime between the time that the new key is generated, and 74 days later (default 3 archived keys * default 28 days), a node contacts us using an expired key, and we expect that node to trust the signature of the same (expired) key, to record the new key that it should be trusting. 3. If active communication between nodes is quite rare, it's likely that both nodes will have changed their keypairs since they last communicated, at the very least both sides will need to initiate a message so that the other may respond with ERR_OLD_KEY & specify their new key, before communication and trust across the network is restored. My initial suggestions for unreleased moodles is to: a) Only archive valid-&-unexpired-keys, b) 1/3 of the way through the valid period of the current key, or after we have been using the current key for 1/3 of the currently configured key rotation period (whichever comes first), create a new key and archive the old one.",

It's just noise and added complexity. Same with incremental backoff - just try re-sending the key once a day or something. That level of traffic is low enough as to be meaningless. \"a2) Archive the greater of (# of valid & unexpired keys, or #currently configured archive number (3)), prefering to keep unexpired keys, then newer keys when choosing which ones to throw out.\" Ditch the configured archive number, for the same reason.

Fair enough. re: archive number: remove configurability? sure. Remove the interim provision for keeping expired keys? I don't think is such a good idea. Without this, it makes the transition for moodle 1.9's rather bumpy. Without the old expired keys around for a little while, any time you upgrade one of the nodes in a moodle network to 1.9+patch, it loses contact with all of it's peers on older 1.9s. The last peer on the network will upgrade fine, the first will be a disaster. \"Basically, I feel that the more configurable you make it, the more likely it is to break.\" I agree ... mostly. The more configurable you make it, the greater the opportunity for misconfiguration. I think this is different to the system breaking. If the knobs are there, but there is no moodle interface for them (eg valid key period setting) then this creates a suitable barrier to entry - if you don't know how to play in the database - you shouldn't be playing.",

Moodle already holds a key history for itself, when a keypair expires, it is put in history, and pushes out the oldest of the three currently in there. For a remote host to get our new public key, it needs to trust our old (expired) key. In practice, there isn't anything horrendously wrong with this, as the keys we're using are probabaly strong, and expire at an over-zealous rate, but the theory stinks. An expired key should not be trusted. If you go to your bank's website, and your browser says: \"Expired certificate, otherwise valid.\". Would you punch in your details? What I'm advocating is a longer key expiry time, rotating keys well before they expire, and dropping support for moodles that would trust ancient, long since rotated-out keys. In practice (for default settings) this is little different, but it makes the decision much easier - \"when do I stop trusting other moodles' expired keys?\" After we've had this new practice in place for a while, the answer is easy - 'as soon as they expire'",

As is the case in our Moodle. However, when allowing remote enrolment, only courses with the course enrollable setting toggled to \"yes\" show up on the list of courses offered for enrolment by the remote moodle. As I do not wish users to access courses in which they have not been enrolled internally (i.e. by using an external database) I would prefer to keep the course enrollable setting (in the course) toggled to \"no\". When testing the options in Courses>enrolments>Moodle networking>edit> the options to \"allow all courses\" or \"edit allowed courses and categories\" makes no difference and still only shows courses which have been set to course enrollable.

          "Text": "Hi Eddie - we've found the same thing. What's more, if you switch the networked course to being \"unenrollable\" after you have added students, these courses disappear from the students My Courses block in their home Moodle (item 8 below). We have identified the following issues we believe need to be addressed and are working with Catalyst (NZ Moodle Partner) on resolving and passing the fixes upstream. We are working on this as part of our \"myLearn\" project - more detail in a separate thread - and are using our local bug/work request system to log problems - I haven't checked the Moodle bug tracker lately to see if they are replicated there. Because we have uncovered such a number of significant issues with mnet we have shifted the 2nd phase of our project away from exploring the fully distributed network model to a more detailed testing of hub-based model, but with distributed teaching, support and enrolment. Initial user roaming issues that were patched and went upstream to Moodle 1.8 & 1.9 stable in Feb 2008. My Moodle updated to show networked courses. NMIT/myLearn patched on 1.8.4, WR#52033 resolved but not passed upstream and 1.9 version of TANZ Support site required additional patch. Networked courses don’t show in home Moodle “My Courses” block if student is only enrolled on networked courses. Instead the My Courses block shows local Moodle categories. Work around is to enrol all students on at least 1 local course (e.g. generic programme home or help course). Unresolved WR#52033. Links in networked Moodle emails require redirection to local Moodle for login. Partial patch applied to myLearn 1.8, then lost during upgrade to 1.9. Further work has been identified to fix more email links once partial patch has been re-established. Unresolved WR#52032. Mnet students can’t view their Gradebook entries on networked courses. Unresolved WR#54287. Students enrolled via local Moodle Networking -> Enrolments interface are automatically sent a confirmation email. Have requested this is either turned off or made optional. Unresolved WR#54683. Admin user unable to “login as” a networked user. Unresolved WR#54512. Changing the status of a networked course from “Enrollable” to “Not enrollable” results in networked student who are enrolled on it lose it from their home Moodle “my Courses” and myMoodle listings. Raised as issue in myLearn upgrade to 1.9 WR#53391, but not resolved. Work around is to keep all networked courses as enrollable. Issue not yet raised as a WR – we are testing flat file enrolment process as a simple way of allowing networked sites to do bulk enrolments. We have established a \"Networked admin\" role on the myLearn site and assigned other Moodle admins to this role. The role includes the ability to upload csv files into the myLearn site files area so the myLearn flat file enrolment plug-in can pick up bulk enrolment details there. We may request additional functionality is added to the flat file enrolments process to facilitate students being added to groups within courses. Still exploring the pluses and minus of this approach. Cheers David",

The system is working well bar for one problem and that is all user profiles are set up with the auto-subscribe to forums set to not automatically subscribe every time a user posts a message. However this does not appear to be working on the course site as the option default at the base of all messages is set to subscribe once the message is posted. The students are now getting fed up with having to unsubscribe each time they forget to change the subscription option. Other than each student turning their email off, swapping to digest or putting an incorrect email address into the system to stop all the emails is there something else that can be done or is this a bug that needs reporting?

We must control very easily who and through where a user would be able to roam. A user may not be allowed to roam to all servers and we would like a only sees the servers he is allowed to roam to and not all list. I have accomplished this cloning the mnet_hosts block to a mnet_course_door block that allows an administrative configuration of the server jump tracks you may see in this course. the course is so used as a \"moodlegate\", only giving a mnet_course_door block with some litterature for passing the door, a physical space where enrolled users can find a way up to another server. I like very much this solution (works fairly well with the above patch), so we can design real browsing circuits through our Moodles that are very easily tailored for each user/role. We tested the \"course aware hop gate\" wich works fine. We should add a mechanism I did'nt found yet, to relocalize a user account so he could directly login on a sub-platform. I tried to login with a remotely transfered account, all SSO services enabled, and I could not login directly to the target platform with this account. Maybe I missed something.",

Both installations are on the same server , and they do have separate data areas. On both instances, I've done the following: Turned networking on (Networking->Settings). Added the peer instance (Networking->Peers). Check publish and subscribe for both SSO services. (On the 1.9 install, I see checks to the right of each service. On the 1.8.4 install, I do not.) Enable the Moodle network authentication, with auto-add users set to yes. Set moodle/site:mnetlogintoremote to allow for authenticated users. If I log in to the 1.8.4 instance and try to roam to the 1.9 site, I get \" You do not have permission to begin a remote session. \" If I log in to the 1.9 site and try to roam to the 1.8.4 site, I get \" RPC auth/mnet/user_authorise:ERROR 0:0: \" I've tried as both an admin, and as a 'normal' user.

          "Text": "Problems can occur when trying to set up MNet with some IP address configurations. As an example, let's imagine that http://testmoodle.fake is trying to network with http://moodle.org . If the server at moodle.org resolves the IP address of testmoodle.fake to be 213.16.16.7, but testmoodle.fake is trying to connect to moodle.org from the IP address 20.20.20.20, the attempt will fail. The server at moodle.org will note that the server that claims to be testmoodle.fake is connecting from a different IP address, and will reject the incoming call with a 7017 error. Usually, this is ok, and it worked fine in testing, but it's causing problems for lots of users in the field. In particular, it can be a problem for some clustered Moodle setups, and may cause problems for Moodles running in virtual servers, etc. A fix is planned, which will probably be a configuration option allowing admins to disable strict IP checks in Moodle. In the meantime, you can comment out two lines of code which should (untested) disable the IP check for you. The lines are in: /mnet/xmlrpc/server.php and they're in the function mnet_server_strip_wrappers. In my checkout, lines 135 and 136 need to be commented out. } elseif (isset($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) && $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] != $MNET_REMOTE_CLIENT->ip_address) { exit(mnet_server_fault(7017, 'wrong-ip')); I'd be interested to learn if this resolves networking problems for any users.",

If you have the option, you might want to try 10.0.0.1 or higher as the address for the host. Having said that... Each Moodle instance will have its own keypair. The public keys for your Moodles can be viewed on these pages: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/index.php http://10.0.0.0/moodleB/admin/mnet/index.php You'll note that they're different. Each of these Moodles must fetch and store the public key of the other one. If you visit this page: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/peers.php?step=update&hostid=3 You should be able to view the public key for some remote host. If you only have one remote host configured (MoodleB) you'll probably see the details for that host. If you don't, please go to this page: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/peers.php ..and click on the link for MoodleB. If MoodleA has been able to retrieve and store a public key for MoodleB, it will appear here in the text panel. The expiry date of the key will appear below it. If it has failed even to retrieve this key, you're really in trouble. The text panel will be blank and the expiry date will be noted as sometime in 1969/1970. Keys expire every month or so, and normally when they expire (if you connect to the remote host within a few months after the expiry date) the servers should re-exchange their current up-to-date keys. However, you may see the following message: The public key you are holding for this host is different from the public key it is currently publishing. Underneath, the current up-to-date key that MoodleB is currently publishing will appear. You can copy this text (including the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- parts) and paste it into the text panel. Then click on 'save changes'. If your keys get out of sync for some reason - perhaps you've torn down and re-installed one of your Moodles - this is a good way to re-establish communication between the Moodle instances.",

There's an element of your system that I'm not clear on. You have a number of 'remote' Moodle sites... is it possible for one person to have an account on more than one remote Moodle? If this is so, it is not yet possible to give that user a single account on the Portal Moodle that can be accessed (via SSO) from more than one Remote Moodle. The user will have a new record created on the Portal moodle for each Remote Moodle that acts as a starting point for an SSO session. I'm struggling to make myself clear here, so I hope that makes sense. Best wishes Donal",

For example, Site A mistakenly goes in and makes a student inactive and incapable of logging in. They really should not remove him from the database but they could mark him as a deleted user. If Site B automatically were to delete the user then it would automatically have to re-enroll him when Site A corrects their mistake. However since the user cannot access Site B without access to Site A nothing needs to be done when the student returns. So ultimately I think it gets tricky and I start to wonder if it is worth doing or better to just leave it the way that it is. Peace - Anthony",

Version 1.8 running php version 4.1 will get an XML -RPC error when trying to connect to a version 1.8.2 running php 5 (You do not have permission to begin a remote session.) and the version 1.8.2 with php 5 will get a packet post error when trying to connect to a version 1.8 with php 4.1 (RPC auth/mnet/user_authorise:Payload not encryptedERROR 1:1:Payload not encrypted ). 3. Version 1.8 with php 5 will connect most of the time to another version 1.8 with php 5. 4. Version 1.8.2 with php 5 will connect fine to another version 1.8.2 with php 5. At first we thought the errors were becuase of differences between Moodle versions 1.8 and 1.8.2. This may be true in some cases. We are more inclined to say that the problem may be in the way php 4 and php5 send and create packets with XML -RPC and other access controls. Information within the packages maybe packed and read in diffent ways by the two php versions. With the many problems people are having under different enviroments it may be safe to say these grownig pains will be here for a while and or discriptions of our problem will help solve the network connectin issues.
