          "Text": "Hello, Our teacher questioned the tip's text (the question mark) on Feedback, Settings, below \"Question and submission settings\" on the line \"Allow multiple submissions\". Text is now (Moodle 4.1.x - our: 4.1.14): \"If enabled for anonymous surveys, users can submit feedback an unlimited number of times\". Same is translated from this correctly same to Finnish. The question is: Should this be automatically allowed to answer multiple times when it is \"Anonymous\" - selection above? The tip gives the idea to that way. Should the tip's text be: \"If this is enabled, answering multiple (or unlimited) times is allowed \". Simple as that. And also translations must be changed to similar. Reality in functionality is that this must be selected in any case to \"Yes\" when multiple answers is actually allowed when this is anonymous or not. If there is \"No\", all participants can answer only once (and quest access does not allow doing activities like write to this forum). Next point is the instructions to this: https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Feedback_settings \" Allow multiple submissions Choose here whether or not to allow users to complete the feeback more than once. This is important when using Feedback for anonymous surveys on the front page as it will allow non-logged in users to complete the feedback.\" Should this be even more clear and more understandable (and of course fix the writing error \"feeback\" to \"feedback\" on text)? This leads to think that Activity completion does not work if it is anonymous and allowed answering multiple times. Reality in our Moodle version is that is works in any case. Checked on the course with quest access allowed, feedback is not possible to use. No need to say \"... non-logged ...\". Maybe Google Translator translates this incorrect to mean \"non logged people\" like meaning \"quest access\" because guest cannot complete the feedback or start to answer it (at least what I know and have tested). Or does this mean that if the site front page (not course) is feedback as anonymous then ...  I don't quite understand. Teachers cannot set Feedback on site front page and I see this instructions page targeted more to teachers and less to site admins like me. And if I (or anyone our site admin team) cannot understand the tip or instructions page's message, how many teachers could understand it better (well, someone can but the point to most less technical people)?

We have published approx. 20 courses and every course has an activity feedback. Many of our customers have already given feedback and everything works perfectly. Now I can see that the button “Answer the questions” has disappeared. This means our customer nor teacher can give any feedback. I tried to investigate further and can see that the line is there in HTML but from the backend maybe something is controlling from permissions or roles. See the screenshot where the entry is given in the “Inspector” area but it is disabled. I checked the permissions and I am not sure which permission I need to set so I can see this button. Right now, I can see all permission related to “feedback” is allowed. I read many questions in forum and people asked how to hide this button, so I have exactly the same thing with me and I need to make it visible. This will solve an issue for lot of people. One more note. I have not made any changes in the system nor do we have permission. Our hosting company just updated the version and after that, I am getting this issue.

Note that I have the permissions for students set to complete a feedback , view a feedback and view the analysis page , but still I do not see the button with the manager role in test environment and in production I do not see at all the button. To find out the reason of this issue, I created a testing site here: At test site https://moodle-182520-0.cloudclusters.net/ I can see that if the user is having student role, the button is visible in feedback or I created another role like student and I say “Embedded Software Engineer” in this case, the button on Activity is visible. But if I login as a internalemployee03@gmail.com that has role Manager, I do not see the “Answer the questions” button. But the same behavior is not working in our production . If I export the role that I created in the test environment and replicate the issue, in production, I do not see the button “Answer the questions” using any of the roles. Please help me and tell me what should I do, so I know exactly what is the cause of the button is invisible in the feedback activity. I am interested to share my screen as well if someone want to see the system. I am not getting any help and I really want to know. You can see the issue by using these 3 accounts. https://moodle-182520-0.cloudclusters.net/ internalemployee03@gmail.com internalemployee@gmail.com internalemployee02@gmail.com the password for the above all accounts is below: Test123!!! After login, go to “ Course to Test Feedback ” go to topic 2 and click on course evaluation. See the attached image as well, yellow highlighted means I can see the button, but rest of the roles, I cannot see the button and in production, I cannot see the button at all in any of the role.

But don't worry, I have a solution that will save you a lot of time and help you resolve this in a practical and efficient way. 🌟 The first thing I would recommend is using a plugin I developed called \"Local Copy\" , available on GitHub here . This plugin was created specifically for repetitive tasks like copying activities between courses, without the need to restore the entire course from a backup. I had the same problem and made the plugin. This is the most direct and efficient way to solve your problem, without the complications of formatting CSV files and bulk course restorations. I hope this tip is helpful and that you can complete this task much faster! And if any questions arise along the way, we're here to help! 🤗 Eduardo Kraus Teacher / Developer / Passionate about Moodle / Innovation and new products",

It seems it got activated by itself, at least for me. Because I never ran into this issue before. In my case I didn't have Ghostscript configured, but this plugin needs it. So I simply resolved my problem by deactivating the plugin. You could do the same by going to \"Website Administration\" > Plugins > Look for PDF and simply deactivate it. 2nd thing - your error seems to be cause by the configuration of the mysql server . On the first look it seems that your connection settings are not optimized for moodle. Try to change settings like wait_timeout 60 (adjust higher if neccessary) max_allowed_packet 100m (adjust higher if neccessary) For me it seems, that the my sql server is disconnecting while moodle is trying to insert information. But that's just my first \"wild\" guess. aloha.",

Is there anyway that\nI can keep each historical submission for record, instead of letting them be\noverwritten by later submission?

If the student is submitting a file of some sort, then you could use a database activity. There is probably a preset for this floating around. I'll take a look at my archives. Same thing if they are submitting text. However, if it is text, I would then change my recommendation for you to use the Diary plugin, which I maintain. If they are submitting images or multimedia, again you could use the Diary. Currently, Diary does not include the capability for file uploads, but it is on my TODO list to add that someday soon. I've just had too many life events here lately and have not managed to get to it.",

The first survey ran in October 2022 and I could list participants and review the results.  In December, I upgraded to Moodle  4.1 (20221222) and subsequently migrated the entire site to a new PHP 8.1 server in February.  The second survey opened in May 2023. Everything else in the Moodle seems to be working well....but today I discovered this May feedback activity is acting oddly. I am listed (manual enrollment) as the teacher for the course when reviewing the course listing as Moodle administrator. But when I go to the course after logging in as my teacher username, I am offered tabs to edit or preview the activity questions but there is no analysis tab or list of participants who have / have not completed the survey. When reviewing feedback activities for prior years in courses where I am the teacher, I can also no longer see the results. The only administrative feedback module setting involves allowing completely anonymous feedback; this is set to no, since all Moodle users must log in to get to the feedback activities. I have the sense that I missed a setting somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Moodle: 4.1 (20221222) OS: Linux VPS running PHP 8.1 and Mariadb 10.4.19 ACTUALLY, I did figure this out eventually.  The tabs are gone from the edit page, and now are options in the feedback activity block.  I'm not sure whether there's 4.0+ documentation pointing out this shift in display thinking, but if there is, I missed it. If you read this far, thank you for your time.  Now back to our regularly scheduled chaos...",

I managed to hide it in our previous version (3.9) by commenting out the following code in feedback\\view.php, but it has not worked in the new version $previewimg = $OUTPUT->pix_icon('t/preview', get_string('preview')); $previewlnk = new moodle_url('/mod/feedback/print.php', array('id' => $id)); if ($courseid) { $previewlnk->param('courseid', $courseid); } $preview = html_writer::link($previewlnk, $previewimg); I can see that this is showing as an unresolved issue in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-63015 and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70586 Does anyone have a workaround?

          "Text": "I'm finding that targeting the \"Preview Questions\" button with a CSS rule by using the ID doesn't work in Moodle 4.x because the ID changes every time the page is loaded or refreshed. I wrote and am using the following CSS on two self-hosted Moodle 4.1.1 sites and one Moodle 4.0.5 MoodleCloud site, all using the Boost Theme: /* hide Feedback activity Preview Questions button */ div.feedback_description div.navitem:first-of-type a.btn { display: none; } /* show Feedback activity Preview Questions button in Edit Mode */ body.editing div.feedback_description div.navitem:first-of-type a.btn { display: inline-block; } Both rules are needed. The first rule will hide the \"Preview Questions\" button for students, guests, facilitators, course creators, and parents. However, it also hides the \"Edit Questions\" button for managers and teachers (because the \"Edit Questions\" button is the first button in that div) making it impossible for them to edit the Feedback activity questions. The second rule displays the \"Edit Questions\" button when \"Edit Mode\" is turned on and hides it when \"Edit Mode\" is turned off. Although this means an extra step for managers and teachers, they can at least still edit the Feedback questions. A downside to this method is that it hides the \"Preview Questions\" button for facilitators so they can no longer see what questions are being asked in the Feedback activity. I haven't found a way around this. This method will only work as long as the \"Preview Questions\" button is in the first div with a class of \"navitem\" inside the div with a class of \"feedback_description.\" If the HTML changes, the CSS will need to be updated. I'm using this as a workaround until https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70586 is resolved. It would be much better to be able to handle the display of the \"Preview Questions\" button via role permissions.",

          "Text": "Moodle 3.11.4   I am struggling with making an\nactivity ' hidden but still\naccessible ' in an orphaned section. In my previous Moodle version, I\nhoused my feedback question information in a section that was orphaned so\nthat - in an earlier, available course section - the feedback link took the\nstudent directly to the page after 'answer the questions'. In the 3.11 Moodle\nversion, if I use the topics course format, that doesn't give me the ability to\nsubtract sections and make them available to students, but orphaned. If I use\ncollapsed topics, it gives me more control over adding and subtracting sections\nbut it also adds additional labels that aren't needed for me. If I hide the\nsection or topic, the student sees, 'sorry this activity is currently\nhidden'. I was trying to send\nthe student directly to the feedback activity, without requiring him/her to\nclick on the 'answer the questions' button. In my previous Moodle version, the\nfeedback activity lived in the orphaned section, and the student was only\nprovided with a link to the page following 'answer the questions'. So it seems that my problem is the inability to add a section,\nput accessible content in the section and next subtract the section, so\nthe student never sees it. This version doesn’t offer a + - section option at\nthe end of the page. I only used this for the feedback activity. If orphaned sections are no longer available, is there another way to offer the student a link directly to the feedback activity page?",

Actually it is just one (the same) feedback activity copied to over a 350 courses, where students anonymously grade the teacher from that course. So far I have been doing all of this manually, entering each course separately, extracting the feedback results to Excel and copying them to a separate file with an overall summary. But that's extremely time-consuming. Is there any way to make it automated? Any help will be much appreciated! Can someone maybe point me to the direction on how I can build an SQL query to have a one set of data from a lot of different feedbacks? I have added \"Configurable Reports\" block to my dashboard and I am at the \"Manage reports\" page (moodle/blocks/configurable_reports/managereport.php?courseid=1), but without a clue what to do next.

A couple of thoughts though...1. If your students are having to enter the course to respond to the feedback then their answers really are not anonymous as it is easy to track which student gave which answer through the logs. 2. I tend to put a single feedback on the frontpage and make it accessible to users that are not logged in. Then I make the first question a drop down where they select the course they are giving feedback for. This has two advantages - it is truly anonymous. You can pull your data for all courses at one time through the feedback activity.",

          "Text": "Hi all, I hope this is in the correct area: I was wondering if there are any plugins for the assignments tool that would serve the  purpose of providing annotated proofreading feedback marks to a writing task. I understand there are different systems and symbols for providing feedback. The idea would be to have a \"box\" of stamps/symbols that teachers could click on, then click again anywhere onto the assignment where it is needed. The symbol could be resized/modified in particular ways. In the box, there'd be a legend, similar to the chart below. In a perfect world, these symbols are just jpegs or vector images. Pedagogically, you'd scaffold the meaning of these symbols  as you would any punctuation etc. Does such a thing exist? Thanks for your help! -Toby",

But there is a fundamental problem, how can Moodle differentiate two replies from two persons, if they both entered Moodle without a logging in? I know, it is thinkable that Moodle could differentiate their IP addresses, browser identification, etc. But there are no such implementations in Moodle to my knowledge. The only possibility is to allow multiple replies and _assume_ each reply is from a different person. Which is not accurate, perhaps somebody wants to correct his earlier reply and resubmit. Even if you exclude that, there is a big danger of a \"script kiddie\" ruining your survey. Really, it doesn't need much skill to make a script if no login is required.",

          "Text": "I am a big fan of the Moodle Feedback activity and have used it in a number of small research projects centred around my e-courses - see https://www.uib.no/en/radioweb/nuclear/specialist for references. I use Feedback in anonymous mode. One of the strengths of Feedback over competing modules is the template functionality. I currently run a big new e-course over 30 course weeks. The template functionality allows me to monitor each week with minimal labour for setting up the questions. Excellent! However, my course has a challenge. Each course week contains 3 - 4 quizes that need to be passed with at least 80 %. Then the week is passed in a binary fashion - either passed or not passed. Students have to pass all 30 days. I had trouble implementing this simple algorithm in standard Moodle and implemented a custom SQL query with the \"Configurable Reports\" plugin. However, there could be a much simpler way of settings things up if the \"Feedback\" activity had a grade. I would restrict access to the week's Feedback activity until all Query modules are passed with >= 80 %, then everyone who submitted feedback would get 100 % for the feedback activity. The course total would then be the sum of all feedback activities in the course. Kind regards Martin",

          "Text": "Hello, Our Moodle system had previously had mandatory course evaluations (feedback) the would automatically appear in each course shell that was created. There were the same general questions for all students to answers. Our instructors were required to turn on the course evaluation during the final week of classes, and then they were not able to view the results until two weeks after the course had closed, and even at that time, the results were anonymous. These were the settings that I inherited in my role and they were fully functional until about 3 months ago. Now instructors are not able to view the results at all, unless I give them manager rights. I have gone into the system admin section under users->permissions-> define roles and made sure that the instructor has access to the results, however this has not changed, and instructors still do not have access. I am curious if anyone else has run into this issue and could assist in a resolution? Or if anyone is new to setting up a similar scenario and might have some tips for me in the event that I have to recreate the entire feedback evaluation? Thank you in advance, I appreciate any assistance that can be offered!",

          "Text": "Moodle 3.7.2 We use the Feedback activity in each Moodle course page (3500+) to allow participants to return feedback to a standard set of questions about their course. We add them in by uploading a csv set to restore from a Feedback Template page that only contains the Feedback activity but we need to remove the old instances from every page first before uploading fresh ones for the current year. Is there a way to remove all instances of this plugin in one go? Or is there a way to uninstall it then re-install it afresh? There is no 'Uninstall' option for it within the 'Manage Activities' page and just removing the Feedback folder from the Mods folder causes a site error, presumably because this is a core plugin. I have tried truncating the various mdl_feedback_xxxx tables associated with the plugin but as soon as I start importing fresh instances it repopulates the course pages with the old instances as well, resulting in multiple instances of the Feedback on each page. Is this related to the references in the 'mdl_course_modules' table ('module' column)? Hoping someone can point me in the right direction with this. Many thanks Dominique",

After that you are able to uninstall the Feedback activity. Note: If you uninstall the block either your webserver has write permissions to the moodle directory or you have to delete the folder \"blocks/feedback\" manually. Otherwise the block starts to install itself again. Best regards Andreas",

Their feedback needs to be private from other students. Is there any way I can set this up? Even if there is a plugin that I can download.

I want to run a further feedback but have found that this little trick does not work now as it seems that required questions only prevent movement to the next page if they are not completed when visible.  If the required question is invisible, the user can just pass to the next page without providing an answer, and continue with the questionnaire. I can't make all the questions conditional on the answer to the first as some of the late questions have their own conditional requirements.  Can anyone think of how I might be able to make this work?  I'm running Moodle 3.5.",

However, the text in the charts is displayed as an image and thus loses the ability to wrap or be resized or recolored for easier reading. If the question is long, only the last 49 characters of the question display. I can use the \"Show chart data\" option to view the full question, but then the person reading the report has to look one place for the visual representation of the results and a different place for the full question. Is there any way to return to the old display where the question and bar chart of responses were side-by-side and could be easily styled with custom CSS? Comparison examples below.",

Like others I like to include a screenshot when sending feedback results to management. It's quick and easy and survives the yearly resetting of the feedback activities. Now this is a much more laborious job. Apart from the size and text display issues having to click 'show chart data' for each question makes the job uncessesarily long-winded. Perhaps a 'show / hide all chart data' button would help with that? Cam, your screenshot illustrates that the old display is to the point and functional (displaying the data under each bar) while the new display is flashy but not as functional: The label 'Responses' is actually clickable and hides the responses, leaving an empty grid. It's not easily discoverable and above all, what's the point of this functionalty? The data display by hovering with the mouse pointer over the bars is equally not easily discoverable. That's a user interface design no-no. I could imagine that the new display was designed with online viewing of the analysis in mind but (as other posters have testified) that's not neccesarily what happens and so this represents a regression for a number of users. Along with the necessity to explain to users that the data can be seen by mousing over (something that was present in the old design) I would also like to be able to switch back to the previous version.",

Feedback Tool displays much better on a mobile phone so thats my preference between the two. In terms of pushing a survey into course spaces I've seen the \"map course\" functionality, is that still current? https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Capabilities/mod/feedback:mapcourse Can Feedback Tool ask a branching logic question: i.e \"if they answered \"b\" then also ask an extra question\"? I am assuming not but if there is a way it would be good to know. Can a question be locked, as part of a template, so that course owners can add more questions but not delete core questions? I am assuming not, but again, if there is a way it would be good to know. Questionnaire Tool provides a printable version: could there also be a printable version of the Feedback Tool? (for accessibility purposes, or for spares if students don't have devices with them). (and obviously a printed version isn't compatible with branching logic). This is a whole bigger ask, but could there be a way of aggregating reports so that category managers / people with higher level permissions could download multiple reports / multiple results as combined CSVs? If Moodle could do a little more on the data handling side it would be powerful. Plug-in/integration suggestions welcome (cheap!). Grateful for tips/suggestions on any of the above. Amber",

I don't think this is really feasible through the web interface - we do it using the raw data. There's a complex set of relationships that are intended to obfuscate who the respondent actually is for anonymity, but you can indeed map each response back to the specific user if you need to through linking various tables (we have done this because one project wanted to compare evaluation feedback with course outcomes for each student - so we had to \"unanonymise\" them, combine them with completion and grade book statistics and then reanonymise the whole lot again. But to be honest, since Feedbacks can be used for lots of different things, it is tricky to be able to capture all the data without holding elsewhere a list of course module numbers that refer to the specific feedback activities we deploy centrally as evaluation forms. I was considering forking the feedback activity, to create something specifically called \"evaluation feedback\" so that for people like us who want to know the answers to the same set of questions to measure student experience across the whole institution, nobody else could tinker with them. But to answer some of the OP 's original questions: No, we could not find a way of \"branching\" questions. Yes, it can be locked at deployment time, but no, that means they can't edit it at all. We created a \"course evaluation extra\" feedback for if they wanted to ask additional questions on the basis that responses to these questions would not be extracted to the learning analytics system. But as I say, most of what we do is done a. by using data from the Moodle database rather than pre-built reports within the Feedback module itself, and b. the analysis is done by a back end stats package that we transfer data to.

Are you talking about questionnaire or feedback?  It looks like Questionnaire...which would mean this is in the wrong place.  They are different activities.  They do very similar things. Questionnaire is a third party plug in.  You'd need to download it and install it. Feedback is part of core. To create either, you have to go to the course you want it to appear and add an activity.  Then choose the one you're wanting and build the questions. That said...personality inventories usually have a result (You're a type A personality; you're a kinesthetic learner, etc).  Neither questionnaire or feedback can give students an analysis of their responses, it just gives you information.  If you want the learner to actually get feedback about the results, you might go for a quiz.  I ran a stress inventory for a long time--I turned off teachers' abilities to see the results and set up activity feedback based on score (99--Wow!  You're stressed!  You might talk to someone about working on de-stressing...0--Wow!  You're barely breathing!  That's a really low stress score, ect.).  If it looks at specifc domains, you could have each domain 's questions on a separate quiz and put in a bunch of labels with restrict access to specific number combinations.",

But you could add links in overall feedback at various levels that take them directly to the next piece or in Boost, I think the next activity links might work that way. But what I really meant was if you have five sections about personality (just for kicks, we'll go with helpfulness, agreeableness, openness, extroversion and conscientiousness) and we'll pretend that there are five questions on each topic and five on each means you're super friendly and 1 on each means you are super shy and not outgoing at all...you could set up labels (resource) with restrictions on when they display (only display if all 5 quiz results are 5 points [wow! you must be a really amazingly friendly and helpful person!]; only display if all 5 quizzes are 1 point [you're feeling some social anxiety, let's work on that!], only display if...), which would be really complicated to set up and see (for you) but would give very specific student feedback based on results...Maybe someone is super helpful--helpfulness of 5, but extremely shy--extroversion of 1, where the feedback provides ways to be helpful without triggering the shyness or helpful hints to overcome shyness (or helpfulness, depending on the objective--I frequently tell my husband to stop being helpful--particularly when he thinks he is helping but really isn't).

Students should be able voice criticism or problems that they don't want or aren't ready to talk to by person. The first part of this idea is pretty obvious and easy: I already created a Feedback activity with record user names set to anonymous and a couple of form elements. However, there's a big problem: I don't see a way to respond to their submissions. Which would be fine in many cases fine, but I cannot help someone if they tell me something important and I have no way to reach them. Did I overlook something or are there other ways? A plugin may do the job, but I'd like to do it without annoying the admin :D Kind regards!",

Then select a teacher based on the teachers in the course. I've edited the get_options function on line 288 of the lib.php, Feedback item and have inserted my SQL. The radio button list is generating nicely and writing to the Feedback database correctly. The problem I am experiencing is the 'Show responses' tab is not displaying the answer entered into the Feedback and only displaying the dummy data I loaded into the add question field while building the form. I thought I had bypassed this via the get_options function. Can anyone shine a light on the reason why this is not displaying and why it's referring back to the dummy info stored in the form?

In some documentation i read something like [1] Mai and [2] Rares vegades... which one is the correct one ?? 2) Is there any way to calculate the answers ( ex: calculate average of the feedback of one student, the sum of all questions, average of one question between all the students that have answered that question, average of sum of all feedbacks from all students etc.... 3) Also in the feedback their appear the number just side to side to the answer.. is there any way to hide that number to students and keep the numbers 0,1,2 etc... hide from them ( just the firs question was made with [1]Mai and the second with 1/Mai ??

The problem I think you are going to run into is that I don't believe the Dependence Item of question 2 can be set to accept \"any text\" as valid, so you can't use a catch all like the asterisk when used with the Cloze type quiz question. However, you can test for the Dependence item being blank or an empty short answer, so you might be able to trigger you next question based on that. i.e., if the question beforehand is left blank, you can go to question 2, but if there is some text, it will go to question 3. Basically, just the opposite of what you want.",

When a page break is used and all fields are required it is impossible to navigate (using the previous button) back to the first page without filling in the required fields of the second page. This creates some confusion particularly when using conditional fields on the second page based on field content on the first page, made worse if the user has chose the wrong answer on the first page and cannot understand why the field expected does not appear on the second page. If any of that makes sense? Thanks Ross",

          "Text": "Hi Mary I working with Guest feedback and that's where it became apparent, but it fails with authenticated users in the same way. I came across what may be a second issue with guest access to feedbacks. problem 1 A guest fills in the first page of a feedback and proceeds to a second page. It appears Moodle saves the first page entries to the feedback table linked to the guest account. The guest either cancels the feedback, navigates to another page or closes moodle without saving the feedback. When another guest accesses moodle the previous guests entries are visible to them. Even after closing moodle  and clearing history and cookies. The information seems to be getting stored with the guest account rather than an anonymous feedback. It would seem moodle is treating the guest user as a standard authenticated user by allowing them to continue where they last left the feedback. Problem 2 An extension of the original issue unable to navigate forward or backward through page breaks if there are required fields. When the second guest is presented with the entries of a previous guest who has aborted their multi page feedback where required fields are present on all or some pages. Being unable to navigate forward or back through pages to clear the other guests entries forces them to abort the feedback, possibly rendering all future feedbacks of this instance unlikely unless some bright spark works out what's going on. I have tried this on several feedbacks and the fault is reproducible. Many Thanks  Ross",

That is the most viable option to carry out this survey, create a survey for each subject and then download the data through an SQL query, or other alternative is possible to use within moodle.

I cannot find this info anywhere. There is no info in Logs - Activities as well. 2. I want to give the ability for student to show his name. I wanted to use placeholders in question. Like Option 1) Anonymously, Option 2) as {$a->firstname} {$a->lastname}. Unfortunately placeholders does not work here. 3. I need to send info, that student has completed the feedback form to the one particular e-mail address. Just the info that student John has done this. Now there is an option to send the info to the teachers. But I need it to be sent to another person. I wander what teachers will get if the form is submitted anonymously.

Unless there is a reason to have no ability to set defaults, maybe you can create Moodle Tracker asking to give admins the option to set defaults for this module. * In the meantime, consider downloading the Sharing Cart plug in. Then you can create a 'template' that you'd like to base all of your Feedback modules on and save this template to your sharing cart. Then whenever you need to add a new Feedback module, just turn on the Sharing Cart block, and download the Feedback template into that course. Nice an simple! *",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, first post on this site. I am being driven ABSOLUTELY MAD by this as I'm sure I am missing something obvious but I can't solve this myself! Basically, I am trying to set up our first Feedback module to replace our paper based system. Part of this involves asking if our students have undertaken workshops in 7 different subjects. If they HAVE, then we have 2 questions to ask about that subject. If they HAVEN'T, then we ask about the next subject. So it would look like: Q1. This year, have you undertaken workshops in the subject: PE? Options Yes or No PAGE BREAK If Choose YES: Q1A-Rate My confidence to teach the subject (How you feel about teaching a lesson ) Q1B-Rate My personal subject knowledge (How much do you feel you know and understand) PAGE BREAK Q2. This year, have you undertaken workshops in the subject: Geography? AND IT IS HERE THAT I WOULD WANT THEM TO ARRIVE if they choose No to the original question. However, I can't make it dependent on Q1 answering No as they need to answer this Q no matter what the response. So the 2 pathways that can be taken should be Q1 - YES - Q1A - Q1B - Q2 or Q1 - NO - Q2 The problem I have is when I set this up, if you choose No, it takes me to a blank page every time, as if it is skipping the unwanted Qs 1A & 1B, arriving on the page break as a blank page which must be \"clicked\" past, then continuing as I wish. This becomes monotonous and unwanted when you have 7+ blank pages to navigate. A workaround is adding a response for if they choose No such as \"Please confirm you have chosen No by selecting Next page\" but really I don't need this confirmation. PLEASEEE can anyone one help me with how I get from Q1 - Q2 if No is chosen, without arriving at a blank page each time. I would be forever grateful!",

It poses another problem, that the title to the next question (which is about a different subject and so needs to be on a different page) appears directly below the information given about the previous subject. So quiz creation now looks like: But this results in the output: I would say this is worse than having to pass over a blank page as I think it creates the potential for students to mix up what subject they are giving responses about. What I want to create is the 2 options: Q1 (answer Yes) - NEW PAGE - Q1a - Q1b - NEW PAGE - Q2 or Q1 (answer No) - NEW PAGE - Q2 I'm now pretty sure it is a limitation of the software that this isn't possible. If you have 2 different response required - great. If you don't mind your next question appearing below dependent answers when answer is Yes - great. Click past a blank page - great. But you just cannot get the above 2 pathways to exist as outlined above. I may appear fussy, but it is important that the flow of our feedback mechanisms is not disturbed by these issues.",

My team develops instructors.  They devote an amount of time observing veteran instructors and are then placed into a classroom to facilitate small sections of the training we provide.  Each time they \"co-instruct\" they add sections of a four day training program.  During these times, they have a master facilitator with them that takes notes for coaching after the training and the veteran also serves as a \"safety net\" of sorts in the event the content gets away from the new instructor/facilitator. Development of a new instructor may take up to two years due to scheduling, etc.  The master instructor always spends time prepping with the new instructor and providing daily coaching.  At the end of the 4 day session, the master instructor performs a full debrief with feedback for improvement and positive feedback.  All of this information is then passed on to a master coach that keeps track of an individual instructor's development and hands it off to the next master instructor who will work with the developing instructor.  This continues until that developing instructor is deemed competent to handle their own classroom. I'm looking for a system that will allow for a continuing compilation of both written feedback and likert scale feedback.  One that a master instructor can use to focus on continuing development and that the developing instructor can use for personal development. Is this possible with moodle?  Is there a module that exists that will do this? Thank you in advance for any input you may have. Odie",

You can include activities, like quizzes, chats, forums, lessons, wikis and written assignments.  Forums can include all the instructors, build a sense of community.  If several staff are being trained at the same time, a peer feedback activity can be really helpful (workshop)...but this doesn't mean the instructor doesn't also give feedback.  You can also create manual grade items in the grade book for off-line activities.  The options are pretty extensive...",

It took a couple of years to get it where it was really needed as far as developing the materials required, but I suspect it is still developing as to exactly what is needed, as needs change. The real beauty of using Moodle is in that a not-for-profit that must comply with ever changing government regulation, changes can be made quickly and efficiently. The number of courses that use the Journal and blogs are increasing all the time, the Feedback module is being used increasingly, so I noticed when I last looked. (I'm a 'volunteer' admin, i.e. I talked them into using Moodle originally, so was landed with looking after it. Now they have other people running it, so I pop in every now and again to have a look and ask how its all going.)  It still fulfills its secondary function as an information kiosk for their clientele, as well. More importantly, they still smile at me when I go in... and I am not getting panicky phone calls about it not working, so it must be doing the job.",

Choose the item from the list labelled \"Dependence item\" and write the required value in the textbox labelled \"Dependence value\". The item structure should look like this. Item Q: Do you have a car? A: yes/no Pagebreak Item Q: What colour is your car? (this item depends on item 1 with value = yes) Item Q: Why don't you have a car?

I'm putting these questions in purely for me to get some feedback about what my students know, before the next lesson . I don't want them knowing (at that stage) whether their answer is right or wrong. I just want to be able to see myself. The feedback seems to do the job. The only issue is putting in an image. So, you've said I can accomplish it using a label. So I went and made a label as an activity. 1) Since there's only a single text line for \"label\" in the feedback settings, how do I put in the label I just made? (There's no help for this) 2) The label (which of course is an image) is now cluttering up my page and will only get worse. Is there any way to store all these (image) labels somewhere out of the way?",

The advantage to using feedback for a pretest type of assessment would mostly be dependent on needing a complex Likert scale set of questions that you want to analyze for patterns and export to a spreadsheet. Since this \"export to spreadsheet\" feature is key for most feedback use-cases, and using imagery would get in the way of the simplicity of the current feature set in getting a clean download of the data, you probably won't see a feature request to have image uploads to Feedback added in the future. Emma is correct that you probably do actually want the quiz module. You just need to know where the switch is to turn off the feedback for right/wrong answers, if I'm understanding your previous post correctly. See the review options in the quiz settings page for where to turn off what students will see when they answer questions. One other place to tamp down what displays on the left regarding attempt information is in the actual quiz question itself. If you look at a single question in preview mode (click the spy glass icon next to the question on the edit screen, see pic here ) you will also see display options below that will allow you to turn off the points display altogether. The quiz module is actually a pretty powerful tool for doing pretests, so I think you will like it once you get it set up the way you need it set up. Hope those two key areas to check will help you be able to set up a pretest with images. Regards, Lesli",

I went to Site Admin > Appearance > HTML Settings and removed the tick to strip HTML tags from activity names - I presume you have already done this as you have previously posted that you can make these changes in other activities 2. I went to a test page on my moodle site 3. I add a feedback activity 4. In that activity title I added some span tags with style around the activity name as per the screenshot above It worked, it was tested before writing the solution originally and if that solution wasn't clear enough for you then hopefully these steps are.",

Next, add a pagebreak. Then add the items dependant on the value of the item created before. Choose the item from the list labelled \"Dependence item\" and write the required value in the textbox labelled \"Dependence value\". The item structure should look like this. Item Q: Do you have a car? A: yes/no Pagebreak Item Q: What colour is your car? (this item depends on item 1 with value = yes) Applied to your case, it would look like this: If student answers Yes to the first question on page 1, they are taken to page 2 where they answer the question about \"When and where?\". If student answers No to the first question on page 1, they are taken to page 3, i.e. they do not see the question on page 2. Joseph",

Example: imagine this very simple feed-back to measure degree of satisfaction at the end of a certain course: 1. Question 1: who has been your teacher? The user has to choose between two possibilities: John, Theresa 2. Question 2: How was he/she? The user has to choose between two possibilities: Good Bad. Because of the way the Excel is exported, we will know how many students had John and how many had Theresa. We will also know how many students think their teacher is good and how many think he/she is bad. But we won't know how many students think John is a good teacher. This would be solved if the export to Excel just follows basic table structure like this ANSWERS Question 1 Question 2 student 1 John Good student 2 John Bad student 3 Theresa Good This Excel could just be downloadable from the \"Show responses\" tab. This is just a suggestion. Our teachers usually miss this. Thanks, Gabriel",

One of our tutors could still see a response which I deleted nearly 5 months ago. It was not visible to me as admin when I looked at 'Responses' but when I logged in as her I could see it. I deleted the entries whilst logged in as her, and the data has now disappeared from her view. However, I am at a loss to explain why this old data remained visible, months after I deleted it. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I am aware of one other tutor who had this problem last year - I advised her to overwrite what was there and when I downloaded and deleted her edited entry it was also deleted from her view.

          "Text": "As most people know, the feedback module is one of the few modules that guests can access.  As a result, it can be used for many purposes, such as a quick survey, contact form, etc.  One feature that is a bit difficult is the fact that the results are randomized and the email notifications do not include the submission values.  This makes it difficult for using it as a contact form.  For example, if a guest fills out the form and submits it, the admin gets an email saying the form was completed.  The link in the email sends the admin to the list of submissions, but since the submissions are randomized, it makes it nearly impossible to determine which one was just sent. Before Moodle 2, the Questionnaire module was handy for this because it sent all the form data in the email.  However, this cannot be used anymore with guests.  Joseph's suggestion is to use LimeSurvey, but I find it to be a bit cumbersome and also I don't want many to many systems for my sites. As a result, I created a patch for the Feedback module that will send the results of the feedback in the email.  Only two files were edited: lib.php (patch attached) complete_guest.php (only one line edited - shown below) Edit for complete_guest.php: Line 256, Moodle 2.7.1, replace \n```text\n                feedback_send_email_anonym($cm, $feedback, $course, $userid);  //Original\n```\n With \n```text\n                feedback_send_email_anonym($cm, $feedback, $course, $new_completed_id);  //Edit\n```\n It works well for us, however, I would appreciate any feedback as well as some help with fine tuning it. With the patch, every feedback submitted sends email to the \"teacher\" of the courses.  I would like to add one additional setting in the initial settings of the feedback so the person setting it up can decide whether to have the submissions sent to the teacher in an email or keep the original functionality. Maybe something like Include submission values in email (default no) Once this is in, I can make the appropriate changes in the two files to honor the setting. Any \"feedback\" would be appreciated (no pun intended... well, maybe some pun was intended) Thanks!",

We have added a piece where we track if a user's supervisor has reviewed the feedback. We want the activity to remain incomplete until the user has reviewed their feedback with their supervisor in an offline meeting. The user then manually goes in and flags the activity as reviewed by their supervisor. We are setting the activity's completion status based on the completion of that offline meeting setting. Hope that makes sense... -Rob",

Not the group filtering, as per the current setup, but the group that the student is a member of for the resource which is assigned a grouping . I can adapt the code where there is a group filtered to include it within the export, but I can't get my head around getting the group information out when there is no filtering. I think I've narrowed it down to the feedback_get_completeds_group function in the mod/feedback/lib.php file - or is there a better place to put this in? Any help/advice with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

Is there any way to override this at the system level? I have a couple of strong use cases for guests being able to fill out feedback/questionnaire/surveys. If the concern was cross-site scripting attacks - this could be prevented by disabling all roles to view reports and creating a role solely for viewing questionnaire/feedback/survey reports.

On the related question of (not) allowing anonymous respondents/guests to submit a Questionnaire, see this discussion . Please note that, further to that discussion I have for the moment given up implementing respondents/guests respondents to the Questionnaire plugin. As I see it, the rationale is that Moodle is a CMS primarily aimed at enrolled users (students), hence the restrictions imposed on \"(anonymous) visitors/guests\". Especially writing rights (to the database). If you desperately need persons not enrolled in your Moodle site/courses to submit responses to a survey-like activity, then I suggest using the excellent LimeSurvey open source software.

Originally Used Mostly by African Americans but over the years it has become a more mainstream term; so it is not uncommon any more to hear anyone else (possibly in the professional world too) say it to admit to making a mistake.\" I've never used it myself but I think I will now.

          "Text": "mmm Glenys, why not just a simple \"Sorry\" or \"I'm sorry\"or \"Well, I made a mess of that, sorry.\" <diatribe> \"My bad\" would reflect a cultural inclination to the simplistic and semi-literate standard as being acceptable use of language, much in the same vein as \"never ever\", perhaps. While I am certainly no Grammar Nazi, see this very funny YouTube video clip, YouTube video I do like my English to be almost accurate. I would much prefer the English of Dickens, or Joyce, or Shaw or even the Dreadful Dan Brown to \"my bad\". Equally, I understand that the dynamics of language often drive it in directions the purists would not want to go and after a short time colloquialisms can often become part of the language but not all of them are really beneficial, or edifying. I also accept that many, many more colloquialisms are used in a specific era, for a specific purpose, then dropped by the next generation as being inane, or no longer serving the purpose they did serve. Please look at the wonderful documentary video by Melvin Bragg on \"The Adventure of English\" and you will get a better sense of what I am talking about here. </diatribe> In this short, for me, gripe there are several grammatical errors, a run on sentence and a dangling participle. I am sorry I did not pick up on this discussion earlier, I wasn't really paying attention, you see.",

I have read the forums and see that I am unable to allow a guest to complete a feedback from within the course but have to have a feedback block on the front page . I have worked through all the settings and created a feedback form. But now I am stuck. I have the feedback block up but what should I expect to happen now? All I have is the Feedback block with the ability to display on frontpage etc., should I be seeing something here? How do I get the feedback template to be placed in this block? Is there a way of having this block hidden but still enable guests to give feedback? I have just noticed that is the guest clicks on the very tiny preview icon of a feedback they can obviously preview the feedback form but how can I get their feedback? Sorry if these are basic questions I have worked through the feedback doc's but I must be missing something obvious. Any help would be very much appreciated. Many thanks Sarah x",

I would like to get a global idea of what training people would like and as such need to avoid asking the same question multiple times. The reason I am looking for dependencies is because I don't want to ask every person taking the survey every question but rather tailor the questions to a specific level. Unfortunately the questions have relevance in trainee and level I categories. I have found a basic work around but if forces everyone to be asked a base set of questions then at the end expands on that based on if they are certified at all. I think the option for multiple dependencies would be a nice features in the feedback activity and allow a more tailored or branched set of questions.",

Lesson allows us to create branching activities that individual students can do, but it never shows a student how the rest of the class answered a particular question, or how the class did on the activity as a whole. If we could show this back to students, it could be used to prompt discussion on how students progress through a case study analysis for example. Feedback should technically be capable of this for a non-gradable activity.  By creating a sequence of questions using depend items within them, we *should* technically be able to create a branched activity.  Except that it doesn't quite work (see tracker item https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-40689 ) Lesson suffers a bit from being a little clunky and time consuming to create, however Feedback is relatively quick and easy. So; could Feedback be a viable alternative to Lesson for practice tasks and conversation starters with follow on activities such as Forum and Chat?  Would anyone else consider it for this purpose?",

Andreas resolved my tech difficulty on the tracker item - I had added one too many page breaks (in my enthusiasm!), and broke the activity as a result.  Once that was fixed, the Feedback file worked beautifully. Beyond the tech question though, I guess I'm asking are there any other folks who would consider bending Feedback in this manner a good idea? In my consulting work, I find folks often get frustrated with the clunkiness of Lesson (even though I think its a great tool), but Feedback is a little quicker and easier to setup.  Unlike Lesson, Feedback has an option for us to display responses, anonymised or identified, back to the students.  I think sharing responses after the student has made their own personal choices could be a good tool for more reflective practice.  I also think one of the challenges facing online learners is feeling isolated and unsure of whether they're on the \"right track\" in the activities. I'm currently working on a mock up of a Feedback activity to share here, but it will probably take me another day or two to get it in good shape.  Hopefully, a file can demonstrate what I mean! Thank you again, will post more asap. Lindy",

The documentation is clear in that Guests can only use Feedback successfully on the front page of the Moodle yet, when Guests log in and access a Feedback within a course, by default, Moodle allows the Guest to click on the preview icon, fill out the form and click Continue.   The Guest doesn't necessarily know this is only a preview and that the results will not be saved.  There is no error or warning message and it appears to let the Guest complete the Feedback which is misleading to the Guest and the Teacher administering the site. I have found a way to get around this by modifying the Guest role so they are not able to view Feedbacks but my question is why would a guest even be allowed to access/preview a Feedback in a course if the functionality is disabled here?  What purpose does this serve if they cannot save results?  If there is a use-case for this, It might be useful to implement a warning at the very least so that guests are aware they are only previewing the Feedback and not actually completing the feedback.",

Up to now, the Feedbacks are set for single submission, using: · ‘Required’  ‘Multiple choice (rated) single answer allowed (dropdown list); and · Optional ‘Longer text answers’. This setup works entirely reliably and the exported Excel workbook provides calculated averages for the numerically rated questions – which is what we need. The calculation of averages is based on the ‘requirement’ for each respondent to give a numerically rated value before the Feedback will be accepted when ‘Submit’ is selected. If a ‘required’ answer has been omitted, the individual’s responses are no accepted, and the user is prompted to supply a numerically-rated answer. For every numerically-rated answer, the average is calculated as the sum of each numerical value x the frequency of that value/the total number of people submitting responses to the Feedback. I’ve just introduced a different style of Feedback set to allow ‘Multiple submit’. This means that students can complete one Feedback progressively through an 8-week residential course. When they select ‘Submit’, their answers are recorded and saved. They can then re-enter the Feedback to add new responses and, if they wish, amend earlier responses in the light of course developments. Again, the Feedback employs a mixture of ‘Multiple choice (rated) single answer allowed (dropdown list); and ‘Longer text answers’. · However, it is not practical to set the Multiple choice (rated) questions to ‘Required’. · If that were done, then in, say, week one, all the students would have to give ratings for every week covered by the Feedback in order to ‘Submit’, even though the course had not yet dealt with the topics to which the questions related. Unfortunately, the Feedback calculation of averages does not cope with unreliable human beings! For each numerically-rated question, the average is the sum of each numerical value x the frequency of that value/the total number of people submitting responses to the Feedback. The algorithm does not take account of the number of people answering the question . The two are not necessarily then same, and therefore the automatically-calculated averages are not correct. Our need for this new style of using the Feedback module will increase in importance. So… Is it possible to modify the Feedback module to calculate averages based on the number of respondents to each question, rather than the maximum number of respondents to the Feedback as a whole?",

Then you can map this feedback to all courses you want to be able to complete this feedback. Or you just leave it as it is and it will be available in all courses. If you don't need the possiblility to filter the responses for courses so you can put the feedback block easily on the frontpage. I hope it helps a bit. Best regards Andreas",

I understand that I could group learners into a group for each trainer, but that learner won't have the same trainer for each face to face.

Your students are in their group and the teachers are in their group. But the teachers are not in the students group. If you have separated groups so the teachers can not receive a message from another group than a group where they are assigned to. That's the sense of separated groups. You have put both groups into the one single grouping but that isn't the same. A grouping does not merge groups. It is just a defninition of an amount of groups. You can use groupings to control the visibility of course activities. But separated groups are left separated. In a single sentence: To solve your problem you have to assign the teachers to the students group. That's all . Best regards Andreas",

          "Text": "Hi Andreas, Thank you for your reply and for the example. I also understand that “Access all groups,” the default capability for teachers which is set to allow, means access to all groups in the context they are assigned to. In a course context any user with a teacher capability will have access to all groups in this particular course by default. The Groups FAQ deal with the question of having more than one teacher in a course like in your example. Under “How do I restrict a teacher to view only information about the groups that they are in?” they confirm that all teacher roles in this course will have access to all groups unless the default capability of “Access all groups” is changed. (this is not in the documentation) If I want to restrict access of a teacher to his own group with separate group mode enabled, I need to change “Access all groups” from “Allow” to either “Not set” or “Prevent” in permissions on a course level , not a system level. On an activity level I need to locally assign the role of a non-editing teacher to the teacher in a particular group activity because “the non-editing teacher can only see the groups of which they are a member” (Groups FAQ). If email notification and separate groups are enabled in the Feedback activity of a course with a locally assigned non-editing teacher to the activity of his group, why does this non-editing teacher not receive emails? The non-editing teacher is not in any group, only assigned to the activity of his group. If I change the same Feedback activity to visible groups, the non-editing teacher receives emails.

The least that I can say after many comments in this forum thread is that separate groups with email notifications enabled don’t seem to be consistent within the Moodle activities. The teacher in the same course will receive emails from separate groups in a Forum activity (where he or she is not a member of any group), but not in Feedback activity. This is what I observed and tested in the last days in Moodle 2.2 and 2.4. The good news is that I found a solution. As the teacher is able to receive emails in the Feedback activity when the group mode is set to visible, but the student will only see his or her answers, but not the answers of other groups, I will go with this approach.

The feedback consists of 39 questions, mainly of type \"Multiple choice - single answer allowed (dropdownlist)\". Trying exporting to excel of this Feedback the browser is \"connecting\" almost endless (more than half an hour), but no excel-file is generated. Reducing the number of submitted answers from 400 to 200 leads the export to work after about half a minute loading. The export also works for just one questions with 400 submitted answers (but not with 15 or more questions). Is there a workaround allowing the export for all 400 submitted answers? Or at least a hint making the division of the submitted answers possible (and afterwards export it). We had the 200 submitted answers only by accident. Now there are five Feedbacks left each with (the same) 39 questions and 400 submitted answers. Is it kind of a bug that the export in that case isn´t working - or a limitation by server / database (which i don´t believe, see beneath)? We have user who wish to use this feature in the future, again with that many questions and submitted answers . We are using Moodle 2.3. MS SQL database cluster. Loadbalancer with two machines (handling 20.000 users). Thanks for your replies! kind regards Klaus",

When you create each feedback instance within a course, you may be able to save the questions as a template and reuse the same template once per weekly instance. Using feedback, it is very easy to not share the results with other students. Perhaps it will take you fewer clicks to duplicate each one using the x2 icon in editing mode. Forumesque method. The other way I can think of this at the moment is using ForumNG, there is a study advice option that would allow a per-pupil-per-week comment giving feedback. with only the teacher and that student being able to see it. It does sound also a little like a journal application but not sure what sort of feedback you are seeking each week.",

I want to know if there is a way to modify a template that we already have been using without losing previous answers of feedback. I generate automatically a feedback with 2 questions for each new assignment. For instance, we have 5 assignmets with their respective feedback (imported by template in xml ), and for now on the new assigments I want to add 2 more questions in my template without losing previous results. It's like modifing the template without duplicating the xml because I generate the feedback autocatically. Thanks.",

Last year, I ran this using Feedback, on Moodle 1.1.9 and was able to use the non-respondent section to message those who had not voted, or submitted feedback when otherwise used for whole school data gathering. It seems that the Feeback module just picked up everyone on the site within the non-respondent section.

After creating the Feedback, teachers were not allowed to answer it. I tried to use a custom role assignment, particularly for the \" Complete a feedback \" capability. But it seems I can't choose the role \"teacher\" to add to the list of allowed roles. The documentation page says that this capability is restricted to the default role of a student. Does anyone have a suggestion as how to achieve my desired result: Enable teachers (including me, the feedback creator, probably) the ability to answer it.",

Is this a version upgraded from 1.9? In 1.9 the completion for teachers was forbidden by default. In 2.x this permission is not set. If you have an upgraded version you should go to \"Site administration/Users/Permissions/Define roles\". Go to the role editingteacher and than edit this. Switch to the advanced view. Search the permission \"mod/feedback:complete\" and select \"Not set\". Now you should be able to override this role inside your feedback-instance in your course. I hope it helps Best regards",

The site is focused on patient safety, so I would like to include a safety event reporting tool. The feedback module seems ideal for this task. The user (student) answers a number of questions, then submits the report. Is it possible to set up the feedback module so that any student can complete multiple feedback forms at different times, with each set of responses appearing as a unique record in the database ? So far when using my module in student mode, each completed response after the first seems to delete the previous set of responses from the same user. Thanks in advance, Peter",

Performance info perfdebug Default: No If you turn this on, performance info will be printed in the footer of the standard theme Show origin of languages strings debugstringids Default: No This option is designed to help translators. It shows the language file and string id beside each string that is output. (Changing this setting will only take effect on the next page load.)

          "Text": "We have a centralized student feedback process in our school. I am investigating whether we could shift it into Moodle once we fully synchronise all our students and courses in Moodle (so that we don't need to handle two different systems). I like the feedback module and the feedback block and I have managed to set up a trial on our server . We have Moodle 2.2.2 on out test server but plan to upgrade to 2.3 soon (both the test and the production one). My questions: My dream-solution would be to have a feedback block on the front page that contains all the links of the course-feedback that each student should fill in (as many as the number of courses the student has been registered to). At the moment it seems to me that the course links are only available through the feedback block under the course. My vision is a feedback block that is similar to the \"Course overview\" block that would list all the feedback activities that are still open and have not been answered yet. Has anyone programmed this or something similar already? If No1 is difficult to set up, then a \"can-live-with-it\" option could be to have the feedback links under each course. But how can I \"force\" the feedback block to be visible in all courses automatically while the feedback session is open? (I could only manage to add the feedback block to a course manually one by one so far...) And how do I make sure that the teachers do not modify this specific block (e.g. hiding it) while I would like to allow them to modify other blocks in general? My last question is in connection with viewing the responses. If I set the feedback so that it is not anonymous, then the \"Show responses\" will generate the errors below. Error: mdb->get_record() found more than one record!line 1309 of \\lib\\dml\\moodle_database.php: call to debugging()line 1269 of \\lib\\dml\\moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_ sql ()line 1249 of \\lib\\dml\\moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_select()line 242 of \\mod\\feedback\\show_entries.php: call to moodle_database->get_record() I know that it is because there are more responses of a single student and I have set up the feedback so that each of them would accept 1 answer only for each course. So it is hard to find which student has not answered which course's feedback. However, the analysis and the export works properly, containing all the answers of the various courses Thank you for any help. Éva",

When I mapped the feedback activities to a disjoint set of courses, the link in the course feedback blocks were correct. Steps in detail: Create 2 feedback activities on the front page and leave them both available on all courses (no mapping) >> result: all courses will show only 1 link in the block - the one that links to the 2nd activity Map the 2 activities to courses so that each course is mapped to one of the feedback activities >> result: feedback block will show the correct activity link for each course.

I think it would be nice to implement the filter feature under this tab in a similar way to what we can find now under the analysis tab. I also experienced that if I hide the feedback activity on the front page, its link is still visible in the feedback block. When you click it, you will receive the general error \"Sorry, this activity is currently hidden\".  It might be better not to include hidden activities in the block at all. When I tried to do the mapping of courses, I could not use the CTRL to highlight more than 1 items in the drop-down list - whent I clicked any of the items, that one was selected and I could not select any other item in one go. I tried it with IE8 and Firefox12 (Win XP) and I also tried using the SHIFT key without success. I am still wondering how to integrate the feedback activity so that a student could view them all in a list of tasks to do... I thought that the course overview block might be a good place for this, but I realised that it does not map the \"normal\" feedback activity added directly at the course level even if it has a deadline. The course overview block lists many of the \"to-do\" like tasks (e.g. assignments due, quiz deadline, forum unread posts, lesson closing date) but the feedback activity seems to be missing from this. Do you have any ideas why? I appreciate all your help. Best regards, Éva",

I thought it would be possible to hide the activity link, and access the activity with a custom menu item instead. I've played around with this for several hours, and not succeeded. The problem is when I hide the link, guests cannot access the activity. So I'm stuck with this contact link which doesn't really fit in. You can see it here, on this temporary test site: http://79.125.124.238/ Is there anyway I can bury or hide this link? Another issue is that when I click on either contact link, because this is a feedback activity, a preview icon comes up which is just going to confuse people. Is there anyway to achieve what I want to achieve here? /Jason",

We have granted all users the \"non-editing teacher\" role so they can access the answers list and browse every single answer. The results are not bad but we would like to improve the user experience. Does anybody know of a plugin that could convert the feedback answers into a public list of resources (pages) for instance?

We have a generic feedback survey we want to make available to students participating in any course. By generic I mean the questions are the same for each course, except the first question asks which course the feeback relates to. Reading some of the postings in the forums, it seems to me that creating a metacourse containing the feedback activity is the recommended option, and I have done this. I have linked in child course enrolments. However, once a participant has completed the survey, it seems that they cannot complete the survey for another course. Is there a way around this? I'm also still trying to find where I can reset feedback for a particular enrolled participant. Any suggestions, much appreciated, Thanks Paul",

Can the migration be made without losing the data from saved surveys? Do I have to uninstall the module before migrating, as 2.x has it in its core? Or do I need to uninstall it after migrating? Should I expect any problems with the 2.x Feedback module? Will the old surveys still work or will I need to create them again? Thanks a lot!",

          "Text": "Hi Andreas, Thanks for providing a \"conditional branching/skip logic\" feature in your Feedback module. However, the example you attached (conditionalquestions.xml) does not have a \"logical flow\". Scenario #1 Q1 Do you work at home? Student: Never Q2 Why do you work never at home? Student: \"blah blah blah\" Q3 What Os do you use at home? This is not logical . I would expect that if the student answered \"Never\" to question 1, the Survey would skip question 3. Scenario #2 So I modified question 3 to make it dependent on Q1 \"every day\": What Os do you use at home? (workathome->every day). Here is the new scenario. Q1 Do you work at home? Student: Every day Q2 What Os do you use at home? etc. it works OK until the end Scenario #2b Q1 Do you work at home? Student: Never it takes the student to the end of the Survey. The problem is that the choices \"often, some day, seldom\" should also go to the question about \"which OK so you use\", but they don't. The way to do this is to add new questions, like this: What Os do you use at home? (workathome->often). What Os do you use at home? (workathome->some days). What Os do you use at home? (workathome->seldom). It would be nice if we had a feature to add in the \"depend item\" \"depend value\" field not just one value, but a list of comma-separated values. So, in the example at hand, we would not have to multiply the number of questions, but have all \"depend values\" together in one question. Joseph",

          "Text": "Hi, I've been asked to update our Feedback templates (Moodle 1.9) for consistency and delete old versions created by teaching staff in several departments. Trouble is although I can see the templates in the 'Use a template' menu, the only ones visible from 'Delete' are those created within that course. I'm not even sure some of the original courses are still available (but I'm assuming they must be on the system if the template is still there). As early-adopter staff have moved on since the templates were created I also can't just ask those individuals. Pity templates can't be accessed from the manage activities admin - that would much easier! So question is, do I need to trawl through several hundred courses to find these ' needles' - or can anyone suggest a better way of tracking down and deleting them - and if so what would the steps be? Thanks, Gordon.",

If you have access to the database so you could change the values for the courseid in the table \"feedback_template\". Use a courseid of a course you want. After that you can manage all public feedback-templates in that course. Example- SQL if the courseid would be 10: UPDATE mdl_feedback_template set course = 10 WHERE ispublic = 1; If you have no access to the database so you have to find all templates manually .

At one point is the question: (8)Did you have more than one instructor for this course? a \"Yes\" answer takes the user past a page break to a list of questions about the second instructor, the first of which depends on (8) having a value of \"Yes\"  and ends with \"Submit\" My problem is that if they answer \"No\" I want them to the see the \"Submit\" button but can't seem to get it. I am strictly a user, not a programmer. I think I'm just mixing up a step. Can you help please? Susan",

After some questions, I have one (question #8) which asks: Did you have a second teacher? the choices for an answer are \"Yes\" or \"No\". If \"Yes\" is chosen, the user is taken to another series of questions that depend on question #8 having been answered \"Yes\". When the user finishes answering those questions, they are able to click \"Submit\" and all is fine. If the user answered \"No\" to question #8, they are taken to an information questions that states they are finished and they can click \"Submit\". The problem is here: when they click \"Submit\" the form says they have not answered all required questions. Do you know what is causing this? I hope I have given you enough information. Thank you, Susan",

When I test the attached registration form which includes two optional statements as a student and the student changes his mind for both optional statements from “yes” to “no” before he submits, the “old” answer to the second optional statement is still visible. As multiple submissions was set to “no” for the first attempt, I deleted the first attempt. Now the same test student was able to access the registration form again. This time the test student went for the shortest possible version (no to all options) and didn’t change his mind before submitting the answers. When I open the response of the new submission, the \"old\" answer given to the second optional statement is still there, although I erased his first attempt and the test student never checked the option in his second attempt. There seems to be some data of the SECOND optional statement written to a table in the Moodle database and stored in relation to the user, which neither the user nor admin can overwrite or delete in the Feedback activity module. I would very much appreciate if someone could test the attached registration form and find out what's wrong. With kind regards, Hartmut",

'</td></tr>'; } I added an if statement directly above the echo to echo only if the value was not null. Code is below.... foreach($values as $value) { if($value->value != \"\"){ echo '<tr><td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">-&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">' . str_replace(\"\\n\", '<br />', $value->value) .

One of the critiques when anonymous was first introduced was that by logging it might be possible to determine who submitted which entries. I tried to randomize that but then folks said that you could just put a single user in a group and then sort by groups and see a particular users response and thus defeat anonymity. So then there is no logging of anonymous which means you do not know whether a particular user has completed an entry or not. As a teacher, I can understand wanting to ensure that every student has completed a feedback activity; however, if you compare it to the paper version of a survey there is no way to ensure that every student has in fact completed it. They can always turn one in blank and you would not know who that was. I would have to go back in and check to see if on an anonymous survey the viewing of the feedback is logged (as opposed to actually submitting one). Peace - Anthony",

My problem is when two persons enter at the same time the second get the continue answering string and also cannot start from the beginning, because the form shows up with the previous answers by the first in entering it. I hope this is not weird to understand, but I would like to have the feedback with multiple answers for a user to behave as a feedback to guest user, where nonetheless one guest start to respond, the other get a new instance of the form. I was looking into complete.php, complete_guest.php and view.php but as my php understanding is quite little I couldn't get a clue in what I need to change. Any ideas? TIA",

          "Text": "Feedback is great module. I like and use it much. I have some suggestions / wanted features. I checked the forum and I have not found such a topic. I know Andreas is busy enough anyhow here they are: 1. Please add question type \"grid\" or \"scale\". I mean something like docs.google.com has for forms. In one question there are more rows and columns. In rows are options and in columns are weights. Weights may be open or 1,2,3.. or the Likert scale options: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, Strongly agree ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale ) or Moodle Survey options: Almost never, Seldom, Sometimes, Often, Almost always. Answers are/should be stored in separate fields with names of rows (at least this is how it works in G. docs) 2. In setting-up the feedback (Edit Setting) add option (maybe in the Feedback options section) to Hide the \"Not selected\" No/Yes as a default option for the whole feedback (which will be default setting for the new feedback or will overwrite already set question (with warning)). In other words: additionally to the option provided for each question set the same for the whole feedback already at setting it up. 3. If the question is edited (not a newly created.. I guess you may check if the question is not the last one or question editor was reached by click on edit button) then please add in Edit Question on the bottom the new button \"Save and edit next question\" (next to buttons \"Save changes to question\" \"Save as a new question\" \"Cancel\") (and move to edit next question). 4. Pre-fill the labels field with something like SingleA1, MC2, TextS3, TextL4, Drop5 or similar for single answer, multiple choice, short, long text, drop down list etc. I mean something like: type of question+ number. The reason is that in Excel it would be meaningful to know the type of question (at least for me) without checking answers. It does not matter that user may change labels. I am guessing that most users let them empty anyway. 5. Small thing: in my installation (Moodle 2) in Templates/Use a template the text: \"No templates available yet\" is rendered in two lines. Just one would be enough. This is just a case when there are no templates. I just looked into the source and found that it is because of size of div.fstaticlabel. Maybe I was not clear enough. Do not hesitate to add comments, suggestions.. Thanks Miro",

          "Text": "That is an interesting question, but the Feedback module is, essentially, a survey tool so I am not sure that FERPA regs would even cover it. The Feedback module allows you to create your own surveys, and that would be well and truly policed by any schools, anyone else, well that would be an organizational thing so I doubt FERPA would even apply. As a general rule, one of the core policies of Moodle.org has been to preserve privacy wherever appropriate. The definition of \"appropriate\" applied by Moodle.org, in my view, has more than a touch of hysterical paranoia about it that is unnecessary. In so many areas Students should not even have an expectation of privacy from Teachers or the School, in general. Obviously this is limited by common sense and good taste, elements of our society that have been sadly lacking in recent decades. Unfortunately, the times we live in dictate that teachers are obviously suspect for wanting to work with children and therefore need to be limited by law to the point where they can no longer perform the duties expected of them. Obviously then, when it goes wrong, as it is, Teachers are being blamed for all of society's problems.",

          "Text": "Is there a way to limit access to a feedback activity the same ways that you can with the quiz module (mainly password and IP address)? The quiz module doesn't handle branching, so it's not appropriate for this particular task (a lab practicum with several versions, so different answers for some questions from version to version). It's not even a good data collection tool because you have to assign a right answer for every question. The feedback module makes the perfect simple data collection tool because we can collect the answers using a plain, basic form then export the responses to Excel and use SAS to process the data and assign grades. Unfortunately, this involves several hundred students taking the practicum during several class periods over several days and we want to be sure that they are accessing the activity only during their class period and only from our labs. It's probably not a huge issue because they will be given their test paper in class and must return it before they leave, but sometimes they can be crafty and the lead instructor is very cautious about security. I'd thought that the password protection and IP address limits were a Moodle feature rather than a module feature but discovered otherwise when I started digging around today. I know the feedback activity wasn't really design for this sort of thing but it's really perfect for it except for the lack of security features. Any suggestions? (Other than downloading the activity logs and red-flagging activities outside a student's lab time and/or not from our labs, which I'll do if that's what it takes and the lead instructor is satisfied with it...)",

We managed to recover the data from our backups, however all of the data is in an XML file called \"moodle.xml\". I've scanned through the file and I can see that it has all of the responses and comments, as well as lots of other stuff. The file itself is over 50,000 lines long. I'm not a programmer and have very limited knowledge of PHP and XML . I'm wondering if if is possible to simply import or upload this XML file into Moodle somehow, so it displays the same way that it used to? I tried creating a new course with Feedback and searching for another copy of \"moodle.xml\" so I could just replace that one with my recovered one, but it didn't work.. I'm assuming it's a bit more complex than that. Does Moodle use XML files for all current Feedback modules or are they stored in the db and the XML file I have is merely due to it being a recovered file from a backup?",

Student groups don't share all instructors and may not remember their names; so, they must select each instructor by recognizing his/her picture. They must pick and evaluate only 10 instructors (1 per subject) from a pool of over 50 instructors. Posting all instructor pictures would be a mess, so I thought about putting their names in 10 drop-down menus (1 for each subject), and by selecting a name the person's picture would automatically show up. Once the picture shows, the students can positively recognize each instructor and start individual evaluations. -Once the survey is completed, each student must receive a PDF file (matched to the MOODLE username) via e-mail containing individual scores for the course evaluations (these evaluations are applied in paper, not in MOODLE). An alternative to sending an e-mail with an attached PDF file would be, displaying a table showing the course evaluation results (this table should get the information from an uploaded database ).

It would be nice that every time the user completes a course a pop-up window appears with either a link to a external feedback or more interesting a form within moodle....but moodle does not seem to support this.

If you are satisfied with viewing the information summarized within Moodle, it works great. However, if you want to export the data so that you can analyze it (e.g., in worksheet or CSV format that can be imported into a spreadsheet, data management, or statistical program), the Feedback module is not the way to go. The Feedback module does export the data, sort of, but it's from its own analysis. You can view each student's individual responses, and you can print them, but it's tedious. I'd love to have the ability to export the student data as analyzable data. I could then import it into Excel and/or Access and create easily printable forms to print each student's data on a page, but printing all pages with one command. As it is, I have to view each student's answers and print manually. That's tedious, at best, with a small class. Can't imagine doing it with a medium or large class. liz",

With things like feedback, we recently created a concept of a package that includes both the module and the block. The intention was to make things easier for folks but such novelties do not always get documented. I do try to encourage folks contributing code to provide documentation for it specifically to cover the installation instructions. Since feedback is scheduled to be included in Moodle 2.0 it will be less of an issue. Sorry for the loss of time. Feel free to add to the Moodle documentation of the feedback module. There is a Feedback FAQ with some steps. I am not sure if you managed to come across those at: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Feedback_module_FAQ#Q._How_do_I_install_the_Feedback_module.3F We may be able to make this more prominent. I frequently also encourage the README.txt file too so this discussion will serve as a good example of why I do so. Happy Moodling! Peace - Anthony",

In the \"mod\" folder there is also a \"feedback\" folder and in that several folders and files and most of the files are php files.

Per course uses the mod as an activity but you can only access the reports per courses - which is time consuming for an administrator. We are using 1.8 on MySQL and the block wouldnt work, but we wanted it to appear as an activity in the syllabus rather than a block within the course as the students might consider it very optional rather than part of the course. So here's the step by step of what we did: 1) Install feedback module and create an instance of the Feedback Survey on the HOME page of Moodle.  Create the questions and save. 2) To map the courses - type in something to filter your course selections with.  All our course shortcodes include the term month (_Apr).  This builds a list to select from. 3) Once the survey is complete and the courses have been added - you can add the survey link to the actual courses.    I used the following:   Add resource, Add link to file or website.  The URL used was the direct link to the survey in the HOME course with an added parameter of courseid = Course.id   This ensures that the data is associated with the course. Any course that has this link that is not mapped yet - should display an error.",

          "Text": "I work for a FE College in the UK. Our moodle has around 700 courses on it, and depending on the students on the course, they are asked to complete one of four surveys using Feedback. The problem is that while the results of the feedback are visible within the scope of the course, the survey is a cross-college survey and as such we need the Feedback to be in the scope of the whole Moodle, if that makes sense. (Basically, we need details of every survey collated together on one page.) I have seen that a Feedback can be palced onto the front page of Moodle, but then it does not collect the course the student is taking, or the Teacher of the course, which we also need. Our current solution is to hack out some PHP which queries the feedback tables in the database directly, looking for instances of \"Student Survey 1 - Feb 2009\" or similar, and gathers results, producing a custom-build page of textual results. This page has no graphs and is not something which could easily be ported to other Moodles (id-specific user authentication and such), as well as repeating all the text in the questions, so if the questions change (which they inevitably will) the code neds changing too. Is there the possibility that Feedback can be extended to include surveys in the global scope? Ideally we need more information to be collected which we do not currently store in Moodle (such as which department the course is in, e.g. Hair and Beauty or Automotive) but that's for a different discuaaion thread.

After this you can assign all users which should receive an email to this role on the frontpage or locally on the feedback. Now the wanted users should receive an email. Andreas",

He pointed out that it was a roles permission problem. The lecturers, though, students in the course with the feedback module, were course creators at the system level, hence they would be course creators in every child course - meaning course on the system. I would therefore advise you to check whether or not the teachers are course creators/teachers in a context that would include the immediate context of your course with the feedback module, for eg. are the teachers course creators at the level of the course category or at the system level? If they must be course creators at the level of the course category you may need to move the course with the feedback module to another course category. If the teachers are course creators at the system level you should reconsider the wisdom of this as it gives them course creator access to every course on the moodle system. The roles paradigm though exciting in the possibilities does take time to work through.",

We'd like to accomplish 2 things: If we have a feedback on the front page that is mapped to a course, we don't want the teacher in that course to be able to edit the feedback or view the results. We want to allow department or program administrators to view and edit the feedbacks on the front page, and to see results. We have created a new role Course Evaluation Adminstrators, which is a duplicate of the authenticated user role with permission to view hidden activities and manage feedbacks. We've assigned some users to this role in the front page context , and they can see the feedbacks, edit them, etc. What we'd really like to do is to give these users permission to manage individual feedbacks instead of all of them. I'm thinking that both issues could be handled by assigning and overriding roles in the feedback activity context. However, we don't seem to be able to assign a role in the Activity Module context if the feedback is on the front page. The assign roles page returns '0 Potential Users'. Any ideas for resolving these? Thanks! -Ann",

This is a duplicate of the Authenticated User role, with all of the feedback permissions set to 'allow', as well as moodle/course:viewhiddenactivities. 2. Assigned a user to this role on a feedback activity. When the user logs in and goes to the front page, she does see the grayed-out link in the Main Menu block for the feedback, and can click the link to view the feedback. However, when clicking on any of the tabs (Edit Questions, Templates, etc.), or the Map to Courses button, she gets 'Sorry, this activity is currently hidden'. Is there an additional capability that needs to be set, or maybe a better way to accomplish allowing certain users to manage hidden front-page feedbacks? Thanks! -Ann",

If you hide an activity this setting is saved on the course-context level and not on the module-context level. If you assign roles on the feedback-context it has no effect on this setting. You can try the following procedure: 1) create a new role with legacy role type \"None\". 2) set all capabilities to \"Not set\" 3) set the capability \"viewhiddenactivities\" to \"Allow\" 4) assign your feedback-manager to this role on Frontpage-roles 5) go to the hidden feedback and assign this user to the teacher-role on this feedback The effect is that the user now can see all hidden activities on the frontpage but he/she can not go into these activities except the assigned feedback.

          "Text": "I guess I used the wrong tool for the task but it occurred to me that I could use Feedback to collect data about our students submissions of their final projects but this has become a little nightmare. The idea was simple and I don't know why it shouldn't work. I created a little survey where the students had to introduce (as the answer to different questions) their first name, their last name, the name of their project and the name of the project supervisor. I thought this would save us a lot of time since we would not have to write the title of each student's project in a spreadsheet. The first problem I encountered is the organization of the data. This is my fault because I didn't check how Feedback would output the results into a spreadsheet. I thought that I could export the data into a spreadsheet in the following format: Last Name First Name Project's name Project supervisor Smith Axel How to build a... Peter Brown Seifert Nina Analysis of... Principles of Dana Peterson Peter Brown But Feedback exports the data like this: Last Name Smith Seifert García First Name Axel Nina María .... ---------- Well, that's not the real problem. I thought I would simply cut the columns for the different sections and paste them next to each other to achieve the desired format (as in the table above). I was horrified, however, when I saw that the columns are not ordered! So for instance, I would get: Last Name García Seifert Smith First Name Axel María Nina Project's name Analysis Principles of How to build a.. Project supervisor Peter Brown Peter Brown Dana Peterson So when I paste the different columns next to each other I get things totally mixed up: the Last Name from one person, the First Name from another, the title of the project from a different person, etc. What on earth is going on? I can understand that Feedback will organize the results as a single column instead of rows and columns. But why doesn't each column follow the same order? (where each position in the column for each category or question corresponds to the answer given by the same person) This doesn't make sense. The order of the column for each category seems to be totally random. I have more than 100 entries! Does this mean that I will have to access each answer through 'show responses' and add all the data by hand in a spreadsheet? Please tell me that this is not so. Is there anyway out of this mess?",

But I've apparently lost all the information my students recorded on the feedback. I have at least 77 students that completed the feedback and about 50 questions. Now I have lost the complete questionaire (there's only one question on the module), On the analysis option I see 77 answers for 51 questions. But I don't see any graph or any answer at all. The export to excel option also fails... Is there any way to get the original tables of the questions and answers (before the failure of the module in our platform)? how are those tables called? Any idea? Thanks in advance",

As a result, the slashes show up when you're editing the question, and are saved to the database when you save the question. To recreate the problem: 1. Create a Feedback. 2. Add a question with a quote or apostrophe in it. 3. Save the question. 4. Edit the question. The backslash should appear. 5. Save the question. The backslash is saved to the database.

You will find the function \"feedback_convert_to_win()\". It should look like this: function feedback_convert_to_win($text) { global $CFG; static $textlib; static $newwincharset; static $oldcharset; if(!isset($textlib)) { $textlib = textlib_get_instance(); } ... Put directly below the line \"function feedback_convert_to_win($text) {\" the statement: \"return $text;\" It now should look like this: function feedback_convert_to_win($text) { return $text; global $CFG; static $textlib; static $newwincharset; static $oldcharset; if(!isset($textlib)) { $textlib = textlib_get_instance(); } ...

Have you ever heard anyone do this?  Also, I am worried that maybe I am misunderstanding the potential of feedback.  I intend for a student to fill it out on a one form per course basis.  Is this possible?  Do I need to do something special to make this happen?

The data seem to be there (the number of answers is the same as in the old installation and we've examined the answers and they seem to be the same answers). There is a problem, though. While the answers were given by users in a non-anonymous mode so that we can identify which user gave which answer, when we restore the course in Moodle 1.8.3 (actually also in 1.7, which we used to make the transition smoother) the answers appear as 'anonymous entries'. This is a serious problem because the survey was conducted by one of our graduate students for her Masters thesis and she needs to identify which users answered each question in a particular way. Can anybody help, please? Josep M.",

I would be careful about simply changing the table default. I would think that a better solution would be to make the default value of the anonymous_response field depend on whether the feedback itself is listed as being anonymous or not. If the feedback activity is not anonymous, then assume that all of the responses were not anonymous (during an upgrade). If the feedback activity is anonymous, then the default anonymous_response should be anonymous. Does that make sense? What I would want to avoid is upgrading what was previously an anonymous feedback and having the results appear non-anonymously. I would rather see the case that Josep is experiencing where he has to work and cleaning up the data to make then visible again. Peace - Anthony",

This is the current state: There are some different versions of feedback: for moodle 1.5.3 up to 1.6.x (only available on my site and the developing is stopped) for moodle 1.7.x (available on cvs MOODLE_17_STABLE Branch and the developing is stopped too) for moodle 1.8 (available on cvs MOODLE_18_STABLE Branch) for moodle 1.8 and 1.9 (only available on my site) This is the first version with tabs. Here I'm thinking it could be a better version for the MOODLE_18_STABLE Branch. for moodle 1.9 (available on cvs MOODLE_19_STABLE Branch) for moodle 2 (available on cvs HEAD) Currently it runs on moodle 1.9 and i still have to merge it with the version vor moodle 1.9. My plan is to merge number 4 into number 3. So there would be three versions I have to maintain (3,5 and 6).",

I have a question however - I am running moodle 1.5.x and have set up a test feedback., It does not appear to be linkiing to my Glossary however. This is an important requirement for my application as I need to provide optional help / guidance lookup for my students. Glossary AutoLinking would be my natural choice - however it does not seem to work within Feedback Surveys. Am I doing something wrong or is this a known issue? In either case - does anyone know what I need to do to enable Glossary Autolinking within Feedback? Thanks - QuaySupport",

Example, Moodle 1.8.2 with the last versions of the modules book and feedback. I have a course, and inside a course i have a book installed and filled with content. Now i create a zip-file from this book, load the zip-file in this course in the folder files, choose this zip-file to install from this zip-file a IMS-Content Resource , is everything fine. Now i install in this course a feedback (feedback module). I have the possibility the import an xml -file from another feedback from another course. Here i mean it comes to an collision, because i can not choose the feedback xml-file to import this file in a feedback. I mean is has nothing to do that i have install a IMS-Content Resource, i think the imsmanifest.xml inside the zip-file can be the problem. When i delete the zip-file i created before from the book, the import of the feedback xml-file works without any problem. I hope someone can follow me...!? Andy",

Create a Feedback \"My first Survey\" In Feedback \"My first Survey\", go to Roles / Override roles tab Current context: Activity module:My first Survey / Role to override: non-editing teacher Capability / Core system / Access all groups moodle/site:accessallgroups: Prohibit Save changes. Log in as various students from groups A and B check that each student can only view the responses from other students in his own group: OK Log in as John Doe (non-editing teacher in group A) Go to Feedback \"My first Survey\", go to Show Responses tab -> John Doe can view the responses of ALL students (in his own group A and also in Group B)...

Small questions regarding non-anonymous feedbacks: I do mostly use anonymous Feedbacks, because the entries from the same person are not overwritten. (they have to enter their names instead). I'd really like to use non-anonymous Feedbacks if (as written in the help files) Feedbacks from the same person are not overwritten. Today I got an email from a new entry in one of my anonymous Feedbacks. The person who sent the Feedback was logged in into my Moodle-system. The email showed me as sender the mail address of that person, which makes the Feedback non-anonymous I think. Can you change this behavior, maybe as sender by using the system default mail address?

So, all the 5 choices will be available to the student for all the 5 questions. However, if the student select A3 for Q1, then, he will not be able to select A3 for Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5. (One unique choice for each question.) The reason for this new function is that currently there are other format such as the Multiple-Choice feedback (with either one OR multiple choice) but there isn't any feedback that have function like the one that I say above. If anyone know of such plug-in that works like the above. Please kindly let me know. Thanks",

When I say \"download the latest version v2\", I refer to the latest files available on my test site. Today, for example, this means version dated 11:12 27/05/2007 (hh:mm dd/mm/yyyy). The 'unique answer for each question' question format in Likert scales was introduced in one of the latest versions, so maybe you can't use it because you don't have the very latest version installed on your system. If you try it on my test site, you will see that it does work as described. Please note that I am now working in collaboration with Mike Churchward on this project and we are gradually integrating my changes into the version which is available through CVS and it is also available from the Moodle plugins page at http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=84 . However, it will take us another few days to integrate my latest developments into it, so you'll have to be patient! Joseph",

So \"Stupid\" of me for not update the block but just the activity feedback. Thanks for your patience and your effort in creating such a wonderful feedback module. But there is one wish-list that I would like to see in the next version of Feedback module. A feedback question that have unique answers for each question. Let me explain further.... suppose a feedback has 3 questions - Q1, Q2 and Q3. So, there will be at least 3 answers - A1, A2 and A3 (and so on) If the student select A1 as the answer for Q1, then the student should NOT be allowed to select A1 for Q2 or Q3. Same goes for A2 and A3. (Each answer can only be displayed ONCE in a question AND there should be more answers than question or else there will be questions without answers). Do hope to see such features in the Feedback module and your comments about this. (Can see my other post on Feedback: New Feedback Question Format for details too) Good Luck in creating such feedback question!",

One is to hide the particular feedback as shown in Figure 1, while another is to hide the whole module as shown in Figure 2. (The figures are in a HideFB.zip file attach to this posting). I was wondering if there are any other method(s) to hide the feedback so that only students from the course that I have mapped to will see the feedback. Problem [2] I was wondering if let say a student named John is in class A1, A2 and A3. However, a teacher have created a feedback for just class A1 and A2. So, will the student John have to answer the feedback two times? (It will be good cause the questions might be asking how the individual class teacher's performance in Class A1 and Class A2 but is also bad cause the Feedback module will need to list down individual course-mapping to the student or else the student might think that he / she will need to fill up once for both classes) Thanks in advance.",

I have turn on the activities block which I can see the Feedback module that I have created. Next, I also turn on the feedback block but I cannot add (or remove since I can't add) the feedback. [There is no edit function for me to add or remove feedback in the feedback block] (Is it possible to explain the feedback block management on the issue of mapping course in here?) Issue [2] Just another thing to note is that when the feedback (in the Main Menu) is switch to hidden mode, students who belong to classes that is mapped into the feedback are not able to see the feedback. I was wondering is it that there is some settings needed for the student account OR are there any other settings that is needed. (Probably, you can let me know what is the \"best practice\" for creating the feedback for certain student in the classes in here esp the feedback block ~ feedback activities block. I have read the posting link that you mention earlier but it seems that I still do not understand it. Sorry for any inconvenience caused) Do hope to hear from your comments on the above issues. Thanks.",

One problem that came up was teachers could not view which students submitted even though the data was in the mdl_log table. This was because the cmid (course module id) was not being added. To correct this I changed line 118 of the /mod/feedback/complete.php file from: add_to_log($course->id, \"feedback\", \"submit\", \"view.php?id=$cm->id\", \"$feedback->name\"); to: add_to_log($course->id, \"feedback\", \"submit\", \"view.php?id=$cm->id\", \"$feedback->name\",$cm->id,$userid); This explicitly passes the course module and userid. I was able to use SQL to fill in the cmid since it was being stored in the URL with an UPDATE mdl_log",

There may be some small bugs and/or missing lang-strings. Here the main changes: the installation now uses the install. xml roles are full implemented view complete deletecompleteds mapcourse edititems viewreports createprivatetemplate createpublictemplate deletetemplate now radiobuttons and checkboxes can be aligned horizontally or vertically radiobuttons now have an option \"not selected\", so the user can deselect a previous done selection. there is a new item-type \"numeric\" what can save unsigned numeric values. You can define a range (from - to) the user has to keep. now you can insert pagebreakes a feedback what is switch to the next page is saved temporary. the user can cancel the completion and later continue at the last filled page. (Except the guest-users of course) now you can ex-/import feedbacks into/from a xml-file course-reseting is supported You can download it here: feedback_17.zip Important: this version of feedback-module only runs on moodle 1.7.x or later. It definitly does not run on moodle 1.6.x or earlier. Of course you can import courses from versions before without any problems. Thanks at all for the many good suggestions. Best regards Andreas",

It seems like a student who is a member of the course can take the survey and have the answers saved to the database. It seems like a teacher who is a member of the course can take the survey and have the answers saved to the database. Those two feel straightforward enough. It seems like an administrator can not take the survey at all. This looks consistent with the answer in http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=27556#p250790 , and is logical. It seems like an administrator who has switched to the student role and is a member of the course can take the survey, but the answers are silently dropped instead of inserted into the database. This looks somewhat consistent with the above mentioned answer, but caused a bit of confusion for us and our customer. The last case, with an administrator posing as a student and having the answers thrown away, is it by design or by mistake? If it is by design, would it be possible to include a text somewhere around the submit button telling the administrator/student that the answers will be discarded?

Otherwise, the value gets concatenated at the end and is not aligned. I like the value aligned on the left as it seems cleaner to me. So instead of ... trim($val->answertext) . ' ('.$val->value.'): ..., I am suggesting ... ' ... ('.$val->value.')':. trim($val->answertext) ... I realize it is a minor change but I think it helps. Regardless of the order you choose, I think that feedback_print_analysed_dropdownrated (in the /mod/feedback/item/dropdownrated/lib.php - it appeared that you may have been looking at the /mod/feedback/item/radiorated/lib.php) and feedback_print_dropdownrated functions should display in a similar fashion. Hence to get the (value): answertext type format I suggested above I added the line: echo '('.text_to_html($dropdown_value[0], true, false, false).') '; before the line: echo text_to_html($dropdown_value[1], true, false, false); Ist dieser Reiniger? I hope that helps to clarify why I made the changes I did. Peace - Anthony",
