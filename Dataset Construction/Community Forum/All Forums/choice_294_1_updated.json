          "Text": "I am using the Choice activity to have students sign up for in-class presentations over the course of several days. I can use the Choice function to let them sign up for times and limit how many can sign up for a single day so we spread people out. However, I'd like to have an option for them to then answer a short response with the topic of their presentation so I (and the class) can see what topics will be presented each day. Is there any way to add a second question to the Choice activity, or include a \"comment\" on the choice selected where students could input their topic? Alternatively, are there any question types available in the Feedback or Quiz modules that would accomplish the same function as the Choice? I could build the short answer question into a Feedback activity, but I couldn't find any option for a \"signup\" type question where the number of responses to each choice is limited. I could, of course, use two different modules for the two different questions, but that is awkward and likely to get poor response from students.",

Other clients of ours have used this method. MY fav method is using the \"Feedback\" activity in the same way. There are no messages to worry about and you can include a message after they submit to say something like \"Thank you for accepting our NDA\" I hope this information helps in some way.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone! Trying to implement a guided route\non the educational material for my students using restricted access, I\nrealized that something is missing from Moodle. There is no way to\nrestrict access based on a choice activity. (*see note below) The restrictions that can be imposed on content are based on the following factors: activity completion date grades group grouping profile I strongly believe that adding the extra factor of \"choice\" on\nthe restrictions would help greatly and I believe that it shouldn't be\ntechnically difficult to do so. What do you think? This feature has been mentioned multiple times in earlier discussions: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=226273 (I agree with Mary and I have used this method, but this is different) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221923 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=335529 Thanks in advance! (*) Note: There is a complicated way to do something similar, but not exactly this. By using the group choice plugin and the restriction\nby group, we can partially achieve this, but it requires an extra\nplugin and makes the restriction global for the whole course, not just\nfor the part that is needed. Added to this, in case where groups are\nneeded for other use, this workaround is not suitable.",

As you've said that you are in that scenario, I'm not too sure what the issue is. I don't think the teacher role will have the ability to submit a choice, but you could check in your permissions to see if the choice is allowed for your user under either student or teacher roles: Go to the course in question. Click the cog in the upper-right Choose 'More'. Under the Users tab, click on check permissions and run it against your own username, filtering on the word choice. This will tell you if you can 'record a choice' etc. I hope this helps, Anthony",

          "Text": "Hi MJ The small piece of knowledge that you are missing is that Teachers (or indeed Administrators) do not see activities in the same way as Students. For example a Teacher never gets a Grade when test a Quiz. You said: \" Do I have to make a dummy account and enrol to test everything? I can see resources else I've added to a course -- labels, pages, etc. Can I not preview any activities? \" That is in fcat absolute best practice Although you may be able to \"switch roles\" (if you site is setup to allow this) it still isn't 100% the same as what a Student will see. Resources will look the same to everyone, because you don't \"do\" anything with them - just look at them. So yes, create a test Student (dummy user), and enrol that user in every Course (site wide) - so you know you can always quickly check what a Student sees in any course instantly ! And an even better tip, just open a second browser ( Firefox , Chrome, Safari, whatever) and Login as the test Student there. Then you never need to login and logout to test things. You do your site administration or course building in one browser, and just flick to the other browser to see what the Student sees!  Very quick and easy, and works really well when you are developing content quickly and checking Stu",

I've often set a Quiz to 10 attempts, tested it, and then reduced it down to 1 or 2 attempts as required. As a Teacher (or an Admin), you can go into the Grades of a Quiz, select an attempt, and delete it, thereby enabling the Student to take it again Both these methods work, which you might find quickest or maybe most flexible is up to you !

Then anyone subscribed to that event can get a notification every time a choice has been made. Teachers, non-editing teachers and managers by default will be able to access event monitoring in their Preferences page. For students to be able to subscribe, you would first need to override their permissions for \"Subscribe to event monitor rules tool/monitor:subscribe\" in that particular course.

          "Text": "Hi all, I am trying to set up a system on Moodle 2 where students select a tutor ('Choose a Tutor'), and can then select a topic depending on who they pick ('Choose a Topic'). I understand that this can be achieved by setting the 'Choose a Tutor' as a one-question multiple choice Quiz, with different grades for each tutor, which opens up a particular 'Choose a Topic' choice activity via conditional activities depending on the tutor chosen. However, it is important that the number of students choosing a particular tutor is limited (limits on the numbers choosing different topics is not as important), i.e. only a limited number of students can choose a particular tutor. I don't think this is possible via a multiple choice quiz. So I have created a Choice activity (to limit number of students per tutor) for 'Choose a Tutor', but I now cannot open a particular 'Choose a Topic' Choice activity based on the selection, since there are no Grades assigned to Choice activities. What I have managed so far is to have all the tutors' 'Choose a Topic' choice activities appearing, and when one of them is answered, the rest disappear. But this is not exactly as it would be ideally. Does anyone know if there is a way for Choices to be graded based on a choice, or to assign conditions based on a particular choice? Or, alternatively, if there is a way to limit the number of responses on a multiple choice question in a Quiz? Or perhaps there is a completely different way of approaching this scenario. Thanks a lot, Mark Farrugia",

Currently, completion tracking does not distinguish between choices made. Such a change outlined above would also potentially require ability for a user to change their selection from \"stop\" to \"continue\" option. Dan, do you think such a change is practical in the wider Choice module, or should we look at a local customisation? Can you estimate the amount of work required to make such changes? Others here, do you have an alternative method (preferably that's not using the quiz module, since it's rather a clunky solution to the problem) for acting as a \"gatekeeper\" on a user's progress in the course?",

          "Text": "Hi Nathan, I did not attend the Moot, as I'm in south Alabama in the US, but I have used Choice in a similar manner in class. It is just a matter of having the Choice set up ahead of time with all the questions you want to poll. The students (audience) make their choice and the teacher displays his/her view of the correct Moodle course page showing the responses and refreshes the page as needed to show the response totals. You can pretty much do the same thing with the Feedback and Questionnaire activities but it would be a little more awkward if you use too many questions. There is also a Poll block that could be used, but being a block would not show on screen quite as well. Two other activities that could be used are the Realtime Quiz and the newer version of it, Active Quiz. My students really enjoyed it when I used them. The only downside to all of these, is that to keep things moving along, the teacher needs to create all the questions ahead of time, which depending on the setting, may not always be convenient. If you cover material that you don't have questions already created for, it will really hamper the flow of the class to try and make them on the fly. The only thing I can think of that would allow for fairly convenient creation of questions and voting, on the fly, would be to use the Hot Question activity. Using it, both students and teachers can post questions and vote, live in class, or at any time like the others. The teacher can start a new round of questions with the click of a button and still keep previous rounds for review/discussion. Full disclosure...I just took over maintaining Hot Question as it had not been updated past a version for Moodle 2.1. I kept it updated for my own classes to use, until just recently, because my students and I liked the fact that it allowed for their input to create the questions and have them voted on. I just released versions for Moodle 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9. I expect to release a 3.0 version later today.",

Re-enrolling them brings the vote back (so clearly it's still in the database ), but we don't want those users to have access to the course any more. Ideal situation for us is that users can be unenrolled, but their voting history is preserved. Is this possible with Choice? (I notice that when we use the Feedback module, we get the behaviour we want, but we find Choice suits our needs better). Cheers, Lucien.",

Normally, role restricting could be done at the activity-level in the permissions.

I agree, despite the fact that guests don't have access to making the choice, I only want authenticated users to see this activity at all.",

This will protect you later in the course when you want to add more groups. Make sure that in the Common Module Settings in the choice edit page, you chose \"separate groups\", and the Grouping \"Separate Section Groups\".  When students in the different sections, they will see the choices that only their section members have selected and not the other section's members choices.  You as an instructor can filter them by group as the attached picture shows the drop down window in the upper left corner under separate groups. If any of the assumptions are incorrect, then let us know.",

I am trying to create a Choice for each of about 80 students, with 16 options for each Choice. I'm a hobbyist programmer, so I can write scripts to generate code for each student Choice. But how can I pass this data to the server ? I thought perhaps I could pass it by URL , something like /moodle/course/modedit.php?add=choice&type=&course=1849&section=0&name=StudentName&text=Desc&option[0]= ... etc but \"add=choice\" brings up the Choice editor interface. Is there another variable I can pass to just create the Choice directly?",

I can create section with instructions for the user to read, but then I want to ask the user a question whether they understood the instructions (Yes, No). My challenge is when I add an activity, it shows up on the Activity Block on the right, but it makes more sense to have the question showing up right within the section or underneath it. When you are in Edit Mode, you can see the Activity under the Topic Section, but in View Mode, you cannot. This is not intuitive for the user, nor for the author of the course. Any ideas?

The choice is opened at a predefined date and time. Lots of students start to select their choice at the same moment. Often the limits are not used correct  and more than the allowed number of students can select an option. My assumption is that the availabilty of an option is checked when the form is opened by a student but not again if s/he is saving the selected option.  Can anybody tell me if this assumption is correct? If this is correct we can solve this problem only if a second check is made if the student has selected then option and stores data, with a message 'thanks we've stored your choice' or 'sorry in between an other student has selected the option and the limit is 'full, please select an other option.'

          "Text": "We are an online institute and offer classes over internet and moodle 2.5 is our prime educational resource for communication with the students. Courses are free and we want the students to record their own attendance (e.g. 1. whether they attended live, 2. have they listened to recording 3. do they need recording, or 4. are they on leave etc) on moodle. So for example, if a course class meets two days a week and the term lasts for 10 weeks, then the students have to mark their attendance status for 20 classes gradually updating it after every class or every week. What we need to do is to make 20 multiple choice questions for 20 classes, giving them four options as stated above and we will keep this questionnaire open till the end of the term so students can access it any time and mark their attendance status and also be able to update their status for any class, once they have listened to the recording, for example. The results of whole class should not be visible to students but only to the teacher. Now I am unsure which activity would work best that allows re-submission and also shows their earlier responses to the students so they may be able to update it. Quiz module seems complicated for this because of grading etc. Questionnaire once submitted cannot be edited, I guess? The students would answer only two questions each week and can leave the remaining questions unanswered and so on and will complete the attendance record by the end of the term. I was wondering if choice module can have more than one questions or do I need to create multiple choice activities for each question? That would be too many activities (20) on course home page? or would it be possible to move those to a sub-page/folder within the course page. Any other activity can serve this purpose in a better way? Thank you",

          "Text": "Mrs Omer, Choice will not work well for this unless you want 20 different choices on your page as each choice is only one question. There is no grading involved with choice and it can be set up for students to go back in and change their answers.  The downside of having twenty different choices is that in order to check on students progress, you will have to go into 20 different places and keep track of what you saw. Actually the quiz could work quite well for this as you can give unlimited number of attempts on the quiz. Give the quiz a minimum number of points even just 1 point and make a multiple choice question for each item that needs to be tracked.  One the settings page for the quiz be sure to make the question order \"As shown on the edit screen\" so that things don't get moved around. You will probably also want to turn the shuffle with questions to \"No\" as well.  This will keep all the questions are in the same place so tracking student progress/attendance would be much easier. There is a \"description\" question which is not a question but allows you to add text to the quiz page for directions, categories, etc. These could be week 1, week 2, or other helpful descriptions between groups of questions.  Questions can be edited and then saved as new to save time in adding very similar questions.  The quiz looks complicated but once you get started, it's not really so hard. Here's the link to a video on setting up a quiz. I hope that helps. Paula",

The function is meant to start a choice by pressing a button and closing it by pressing the button again. The intension for implementing this function is to add more dynamics to the choices so that a preconfigured locked choice can be started just when needed. Can you give me some information about where I can find the coding part for the functions displayed in the editing mode (if I didn't express clear enough which functions I am talking about, please see the attachment)? If you are interested in the little background story, read the following - if not, just skip this passage: I recently changed the perspective concerning moodle from student to teacher as I am writing on my final essay about live feedback-systems and this is why I need a little help for orientation in the code. I want to realize a multiple choice concept test during the lecture based on the already very useful activity choice. As it is not possible to predict when the concept test can be run and stopped and if the teacher is familiar with the functionality of moodle, I need a very simple function for the teacher to use. I am looking forward to your responses. Thank you in advance! Aljoscha",

The only way to get my poor student to be able to change their response seems to be to set \"Allow updating of responses\" to yes - but this allows everyone to change their minds!

They can of course use the Navigation block (if it's there) or the navigation trail, or the main course link at the bottom of the page (in some themes). Alternatively the teacher could add a hyperlink to the instructions/description section; BUT I think it would be great if there was a return arrow option just underneath the responses similar or the same as in the last page of a Book resource: This could be a useful feature in all activities ; especially as the Navigation block may have been hidden on some pages it could always be optional. or even configurable a bit like buttons in Lesson , or the \"Page/site sfter submit\" option in feedback. A simple addition like this to activities could go a long way to helping users navigate their way around Moodle more easily. Any thoughts? Has this been requested before? Any plans? Thanks as ever, Jim",

If I change roles to view the page as a \"student\", so that the voting displays anonymously, my CHOICE activity requires me to vote as the \"student\" before seeing the results...thereby skewing the actual voting by 1 vote! So....my question is: How, as the teacher, can I display the final voting results to my class for discussion....without also displaying the names of each student publicly? PS - I realize I could log in as one of the students in my classroom....but is there any other way?  Surely there must be! Thanks!",

In both cases, when I look at the Choice activity as a teacher, I can see a bar graph with the response count but without the names. The names appear only if I click on \"View responses\". These workarounds are not perfect if one uses Moodle as an alternative to clickers in that with (1) students may be influenced by the choices of classmates who vote before them (visible on their mobile devices) and with (2) it may be cumbersome to set up the right time to end the activity, especially if multiple activities are used in succession. Ideally, one would want the teacher to be able to see the graph even when the students cannot. If, however, the teacher asks the students to vote before the class and only wants to display the results in class, (2) seems fine. Best regards, Sergio Mazzarelli",

You might try using the feedback module for that if all you need is the information. It is available in 2 and above as part of the core, in 1.9 or lower, you would need the plugin installed.  In the Moodle version 2.1 that we have, it is possible to have the feedback module list an analysis page after submission if you want the users to see the analysis so far.

This was stopping the backup/export from working, although it never reported a problem. After physically emptying the log table and doing the backup again the import worked and the page works.

I want to automate this completely, so I want to associate each question and option with an area of grammar so that when the students' responses are tabulated in the database , that I can then generate reports from. For an individual student I would like a report that shows the grammar areas that were passed and those that were failed. For a whole class I  would like to see the general trends with percentage breakdowns. Once I have this in place, a future development would be to then link the failed areas from the assessment to a customized set of online lessons and activities to address an individual student's weak areas. So is this level of customization easily do-able in Moodle? I'm  trying to decide now whether to try to use Moodle to make this, or to build it myself from scratch. Thanks for any advice...!",

I'd prefer it used it's own new capability instead of relying on the choice/delete capability. you will need to be careful with the limits and groups code to make sure it works with that. I'd also like to see the option to allow a teacher to make those selections even if the show unanswered column isn't shown. at the moment - a teacher can make a choice for a student if they have the \"login as\" capability, but that takes a lot more clicking around and is a much bigger capability, so I can see how adding this could be useful for some people! I don't have any \"standard tests\" documented, but it's something I should do at some point - it would be good to put some unit tests in place too! when you make your patch, it would be good if you could add it to a tracker issue in the Moodle Tracker (and link to the bug here!) To help facilitate getting it into Core, it would be really useful if you created a patch for 2.0 as well! thanks!",

I hope this makes sence, kind of live voting, preferences 1-3 out of a large number. Cheeers Andrew",

I've been asked to find a way to allow students to select up to five from several (135) available projects. Each project can allow only five students to select it. Once all selections have been made the teacher will export the selections and use an algorithm someone else has provided to allocate one project to each student from their choices. So far I've worked out that I can restrict the number of students choosing a project using a Choice activity, but not allow more than one selection per choice. The Questionnaire/Feedback tool has the opposite problem; students can select up to 5 but the number of project selections can't be limited. Does anyone know of a way to do this? I'm open to third-party tools but would prefer to avoid patches to core code. Any help would be much appreciated.",

It allowed a group of students to choose an exam date from several available (projects in your case) with each date having a set limit for the number of students. It even had a waiting queue feature, if I recall. It ensured that a student selected only a single date. So, in your case, you could have set up 5 identical instances for students to select their projects. I don't think that module is supported anymore but I haven't looked at it for quite a while.

Having seen it here first, I used it for my original primary school website as the children (and some of the staff!) prefered it to navigating menus. The custom menu option for Moodle 2 is a really useful tool to create menus without needing to go into the theme files themselves as you needed to do in Moodle1.9. It can be difficult to style, but if you find a theme you like as a starting point and explore how the menu is styled there, and then look at a few others, you can eventually find your way around it. The other thing with the Moodle2 custom menu is once you do get some experience playing round with the Moodle Themes , you can look at overriding the renderer to do all sorts of things with it. Maybe one step at a time, but keep on going - the moodle learning curve gets you there and with the support of the 2 Marys and others on these forums, everything is achievable!!! Rich",

We tried a few other booking modules such as 'bookings' and 'Scheduler', and found Choice to be the closest to what we want. I want to add two more functions to this module. One to be when student submit a choice, he/she will be redirected to a confirmation page. The other one is the system send out a confirmation email to the student automatically after he/she submits a choice. I think the first one should be reasonably easy to do, and the second idea is harder to implement. Anyway my knowledge of php is close to zero, and couldn't do both.

I'd run the test with three test accounts which were enrolled in the course as students. I logged in as Student A, participated in the test and chose answer one. Then I logged in as Student B participated in the test and chose answer one aswell, but unenrolled from the course immediatly thereafter. Then I logged in as Student C, participated in the test and chose answer one. After that, I logged in as a Trainer of the course, checked the results and saw, that 3 votings had been done. But when I checked the detailed list of the votes, I saw only two participants (Student A und Student B) who had chosen answer one. I logged in as Student B and enrolled myself again in the course.

Probably not quite what you had in mind, but it all helps to focus our colleagiues minds on the value of teh system, best Paul",

You could also run a Choice activity to tally up the results, if the settings allow the student to allow the choice to be updated then you can also see if the debating in the forum changed anyone's mind.

A Choice activity allows a Student to make a single choice from a range of options. (This is like voting for something). However, the Teacher can setup a Choice activity so that a Student can change their mind, and change their selection . So the Student can transfer their vote to a different option. Perhaps this is what is meant by 'single transferable vote' ?",

Currently there is an extra plugin to do this in 1.9 called \"activity locking\" but it is not standard. You can also do it manually by giving the student a password to another activity- say, a lesson - in the feedback to a previous actitivy (like a quiz to gauge their knowledge) and then they can only access the next activity once they have a certain grade.",

          "Text": "Hello Thank you for your reply. I have not checked out your answer in detail yet since I am a  total stranger to Moodle and am not a software professional. (I apologise for asking same question in more than one forum. I did not see a separate forum for strangers who are still considering use of Moodle. When I asked in Quiz forum I was directed to Lesson forum. When I checked the documentation, I realized that Moodle is too large. So I decided to ask same query in more than one forum which I thought may be related to my query). I am in need of a \"proven\" open source software just for diagnostic purposes in my one man not for profit show to help poor children, who for no fault of theirs want to take drastic measures just because they failed in Math exam etc.... Based on your replies, I feel that I can use Moodle. My fear is that if Moodle is too big (may be easy to use to uplink questions and set conditionality), is it easy to get professional IT help to troubleshoot? If I can only use Moodle Certified persons, they may not be affordable. I wish to use college students nearly free of charge as a part of their projects: they not only help in a good cause but also learn in the process. Thinking through linked questions and even attempting to do what I am dreaming to do is 90% of the efforts. Some more retired Math teachers are also trying to help. Thank you all again for your posts. Regards Rama www.edicagnostictuitions.com",

Sounds like a great program.  If you have the server space, you should be able to use moodle.  Having college students learn Moodle to help you out shouldn't be a problem, if they are tech savy, they will pick it up pretty quickly.  Those with a fewer skills will pick it up with some help.  The forums and documentation are here on this site.  Many of us would be happy to add our advice if you need it.

I would appreciate one more option to the drop down menu: \"Show results to teacher after <date>.\" This would allow me to use the Choice option as a research consent option (which the Moodle documentation promotes but is not actually feasible) as I would not know who consented until after grades were submitted (i.e., I would pick a date for the above statement that was approximately 30 days after grades are submitted). At this time I must rely on paper and pencil forms for consent by students which I seal and open only after I have submitted my grades. It is important that students do not feel pressured to participate in research not opt out because they think I will grade them differently. So, my point is although the Moodle documentation says we can use Choice to obtain research consent, we can't because it doesn't meet university ethic's board requirements. Thanks, Carmen",

First. . . in CHOICE, most of the buttons in the html editor in choice worked in 1.82. We upgraded to 1.86 and all of a sudden certain protocol tags like background-color (i.e. highlight several words) are stripped out during the page generation. There are certain activity types (and blocks too) which have view.php files in them that call print_box which calls format_text which calls clean_text (with certain format types, like HTML), which did not do very much in 1.82. Now it seems that the \"clean\" works better in 1.86, so much so that the background-color protocol disappears when the dynamic page gets to the browser. The \"hack\" was to edit moodle/lib/weblib.php ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS and to add in the protocols I want to still appear in Choice. This is NOT a bug! Bad HTML protocol tags and code can wreak havoc on things like style sheets, so be careful to make sure you are using good HTML code when you allow more protocols. In Moodle there seems to be a fuzzy line between what is text and what is HTML. That is a good thing usually. The fuzzy line sort of lurched a bit toward text only by stripping out some more protocols. However. . . I think the list of protocols allowed, and stripped in \"text\" type windows should be documented!",

I have another class coming in in 25 minutes and I'm hoping someone may be around that can help. 1. I have my choices set for one. The students make their selection. There are 16 selections to view, but there are no students listed. All of the radio \"dots\" show \"full\". I don't have anyone showing in the results so there is no one to select, so I can't clear the \"full\" statement. In short, my students made their selections, something in the system registered them as responding, but they don't show up anywhere. I can't clear the responses to have them try again. 2. I really, really need to get them to make these choices. I need to be able to see who chose what. And I need to clear the choices so I can get rid of the \"full\". 3. I'm running 1.8. There are 16 choices, set to display vertically. Limit choice is enabled. The number \"1\" is entered as the limit. I'm set to show results to students after they answer. I'm also set to publish results. I'm set to no groups, and visible is set to show. Students are logging in via PC running XP (I can't imagine that makes a difference but too much info is better than too little I guess). If you have any ideas at all, send them along please no matter what time you see this. If I can't fix it before the next class, I'll work on it over the weekend and try again next week. UPDATE: I can't see the person who made the selection, but just for grins I had a student try and, guess what, they have the names for each person for each choice. I tried to change my mode to student, and I still couldn't see any names. I came out and back as teacher, still 16 responses but nothing showing when I click on view responses. STILL HELP!!!!!",

Were you somehow also assigned the role of Student? For example, did you want to participate in the choice yourself, and think that the right way to do it would be to assign yourself the role of Student in the Choice context ? If so, that would explain the problem, since Student sets mod/choice:readresponses to Prevent, which would supersede the value of the corresponding capability in the Teacher role. I'm attaching a small php file called rolesdebug.php. Ask your administrator to put it in the Moodle root directory. Then login as teacher and point your browser at the file (e.g., http://yoursite/rolesdebug.php). It will give you a screen full of information that will show you what roles your userid has been assigned throughout the system. Paste (or attach) the report into this forum. In general rolesdebug.php will give you a report for the user you're logged in as.",

First, I patched the patch to update it with the various corrections that have been made in CVS for the lib.php and view.php files. It is possible that I may have messed something up but I don't think so. I've attached a zip file containing my patches which you can check/use as you wish. I was hoping that if I had separate groups, then it would use the limit number as the limit per group. I use metacourses for teachers who teach various sections of the same course (for example, Algebra 1-Section 01, Algebra 1-Section 2). I create a metacourse called Algebra 1-TeacherName with the section courses as children. Then I create a group for each child course and put in the group the participants that correspond to each section. I would like to be able to use a choice with separate groups to allow one student from each section to sign up for a topic. The patch did not seem to allow that behavior and I did not like that it seemed to log out the user if someone else had already picked an option. Currently, I have instructed teachers to create a single choice for each section but this is not ideal. If a feature request does not exist, I would be happy to create one if there is interest in further developing the use of groups with the choice activity. With improvements with groups in 1.8 and 1.9 it seems like an opportune time to make such a request. Peace.",

Peace - Anthony -- from MDL-7429 : I have given some thought to how to handle groups or at least how I would like to see them implemented/revised to work in choice activities . The behavior would remain the same for no groups - any member of the course can select an item with the limit being enforced for that one choice. For visible groups, I would like one choice created for each group (similar to wikis, forums, etc.). I believe that this consistency is important. Within the choice for that group the limits are enforced. Hence, one student per group being able to sign up for a given topic. Some code may need to be re-worked to view the results of other groups. If the results of the choice are published (i.e. visible to students), then the members of other groups should be able to see the those results. For separate groups, I would like one choice created for each group. Within the choice for that group the limits are enforced. A student who is not in the group would not be able to view the results of other groups. --",

Most students respond, but several do not Teacher wants to manually assign presentation topics to those that did not respond. Any thoughts?",

I would like to suggest a very simple enhancement to the Choice activity that would allow us to implement what I call blind choice . Here is an example of blind choice in a brick and mortar classroom: Assignments are placed in blank (unlabeled) folders. Each student is asked to choose a folder. Note that students are offered a choice, but from among alternatives about which they have no information until they open the folder. Typically, the folder will contain an assignment. Choice currently has two fields for each alternative: Option Limit In a blind choice, the options would be meaningless values like A, B, and C or 1, 2, and 3, and we would need a third field that is hidden until results are published (i.e., until after the Choice is closed): Option Limit Actual choice The Actual choice corresponds to the assignment in the unlabeled folder. Typically, it will identify an assignment. For example, if students are studying American history, the Actual choice might be the name of a president, such as Washington, Lincoln, or Roosevelt about whom students are to write an essay. Or, it might be the name of a file in a folder resource (the file contains the assignment). Teacher could use blind choice with limits to effectively randomize assignments (currently, only Exercise randomizes assignments -- a very nice feature!).",

The nice thing about blind choice is that it's fair and it's foolproof. Once a student makes his choice, he is locked into the actual choice. The choice is recorded in Moodle. There's no way to change it. No one can claim that the game rigged in favor of students who were somehow able to discover the actual choices, or who could get to the computer lab before others, etc. Re: student interaction. The use of a Choice to distribute visible assignments is already a well-known Moodle pattern. It involves student interaction. Blind choice would therefore be nothing new to students. The teacher sets up the blind choice and the student interaction completes it. When the choice closes, the results are published and the assignment can begin. The whole process consumes almost no energy. There is no foolproof way to implement blind choice with the current Choice activity. Can you think of one? Remember the rules: it must be a 100% Moodle solution it must be fair it must be foolproof.",

Also - I don't think this is completely a \"100% Moodle solution\" -in the Bricks & Mortar model mentioned as a result of the \"blind choice\" event recieve thier project documentation.. thinking about my \"ultimate\" way of solving this, I have a couple of ideas..... 1st Idea - Using an Activity Locking model that when selecting a particular option with a choice, - a group of Activities related to the choice made become available to that student. (one of the things I'd like to do with the choice module is have an option for teachers to automatically assign any remaining students to a random choice if they have not already selected one. - you could do this on creation of the choice if needed.) 2nd Idea - Using Group self-selection, - allow students to select which group within the course they want to be part of, - which you could then use to seperate the users within the course, and target specific content to them... (I like the activity locking model better....) neither of these would add an extra field to the choice to allow the \"blind\" option..... That said - if you still wanted to involve student interaction in the creation of the randomness(even though they would be able to select the same choice as their friend, so it wouldn't be completely random) and you don't mind running a custom Hack on your moodle install, it would be quick and easy to add an extra field to the choice to suit your needs!

          "Text": "To eliminate student interaction, you could modify every activity (for example, Workshop and the various flavors of Assignment) to be like Exercise, allowing students to receive a random task upon first entering the activity. But this would be poor software design because it would replicate functionality that can be easily factored out into an separate randomization activity, i.e., blind choice.* Blind choice can combined with virtually any other activity to provide an element of randomization. The screenshot below shows the structure of a typical composite activity. The student makes a blind choice. After the choice closes, the actual choice is revealed. In this example, actual choices are filenames. The student locates the named file in the folder and reads his assignment details The student performs the task and submits it. Note that the files in the folder are visible, and any student who wants to can discover the assignment details BEFORE making the choice. But there is no way for a student use this knowledge to gain an unfair advantage over his classmates. If the choice were not blind, the teacher would have to hide the folder until the choice closed. *You would actually end up with less code because you could eliminate the random task feature from Exercise.",

I'm reluctantly posting this. - it is not a \"clean\" patch, although we are running this in a production environment. - it is likely that small patches applied in 1.5.3 aren't present in these files. To use these files, follow these instructions take a copy of the files in your moodle install located here: moodle\\mod\\choice save these files to disk for later in case you want to replace the changed files. replace this choice directory with the files in the attached zip file. you will need to manually rename a field in your database - find the mdl_choice table and rename the field 'release' to showresults - use this if you are using the command line: ALTER TABLE mdl_choice CHANGE `release` showresults tinyint(2) unsigned not null default '0'; you must make sure you have deleted the old release field (don't copy it, make sure you rename it) or it will likely cause problems with backup/restore. If you use this patch, and later on upgrade to 1.6 you will possibly receive an error from the choice upgrade where it trys to rename the database field from release to showresults. - this error can be ignored. thanks, Dan",

This could be accommodated for by modifying the choice module to store\na \"history\" instead of storing 1 result for each user. - we could then\nuse the roles in Moodle 1.7 to allow particular user to participate in\nthe choice. I don't think this is a \"simple\" hack - it would require some\ndevelopment time by a Moodle developer. - if this is something you\nwanted to implement and weren't able to do the development but were\nable to fund some development, you could talk to the guys at Moodle.com\nor talk to some of the Moodle Partners and they may be able to put\nsomething together for you. thanks!",

          "Text": "With MySQL 5.0 the word 'release' was added to the list of reserved words. This causes an error when attempting to insert records into the mdl_choice table. More information can be found by reading Bug #3768. I have suggested that the column be renamed; however, if someone needs a more immediate fix they can modify the SQL statement and place the word in single quotes and it will work. This could be done by modifying the /lib/datalib.php insert_record function to check for the word 'release' as a column name and then place it within single quotes - after, /// Execute a dummy query to get an empty recordset if (!$rs = $db->Execute('SELECT * FROM '. $CFG->prefix . $table .' WHERE '. $primarykey  .' = \\'-1\\'')) { return false; } My vote would be simply to rename the field and keep the tables SQL compliant. Peace - Anthony",

          "Title": "Display format + use to schedule HS parent conferences",
          "Text": "Suggestion: a repeat of the SAVE button between every few choices so there is always one visible if a list scrolls off the screen. Possibly at each choice? Or, once a radio button is clicked, move focus to a SAVE button or dialog box. That way a user won't leave thinking the button click alone had accomplished everything. Agree: earlier suggestion of displaying choices in multiple rows and columns instead of just one of either. Kudos for the Choice module. It worked brilliantly to schedule high school parent conferences. Using the choice module, a parent could look to see what times were available to see me (their kid's teacher) and book an open time. It updated instantly to close that choice to the next parent online. They could change their time, or cancel. Automatically. And I could Excel my schedule. Brilliant. It was simple - I set up one choice for each time slot (with a limit of 1) plus a cancel choice (high limit). One button every 10 minutes of the visiting hours. I chose the horizontal display, although it scrolled far right off the screen, because I wanted their first view of the screen to show the all important SAVE button, which they may have otherwise never seen at the bottom of a vertical scroll.  That's why above I supported the idea of a grid display of the buttons. I have until Spring conference to figure any such code changes if I want to learn to dabble in PHP. But if someone more familiar with the module gets to it first, so much the better.",

What I am doing is clicking the \"<>\" button in the WYSIWYG editor and then pasting in a few simple lines, like so: <script language=\"javascript\"> progCheck1(); </script> That function is, of course, defined in my Javascript code that is referenced in the HTML header.  I've had great success using Javascript in other modules, such as Resource and Assignment, but for some reason it's not working in Choice.  When the Choice is viewed, all one sees is the text: progCheck1(); So basically it seems the <script> tags are being stripped or filtered out.  Anyone know anything about this or have any insight into what I need to modify to remedy this?

I'm using Moodle version 1.5.3. If the patches were not in the download , then no, I haven't applied them. Again, this module was working perfectly, but then hit this problem today. I'm using MySQL 3.23.55. I've considered upgrading to Moodle 1.6 beta, but am unclear how far along that version actually is. It's got some features I've heard discusses, like integration with osCommerce, that I'd be very interested in. However, for now, I'm just curious why and where the choice module went bad. Thanks!

Is there a way I can turn this defualt feedback off?, because it would seem a bit \"out of order\" to say students are right or wrong based on their opinions of the teacher! thanks in advance for your help",

Also, I would like to have the choice appear on all Assignments that that Teacher has assigned, but not on the Course page. How do I do this? ( Btw , would another module be better for this? Which one of \"Survey\", \"Quiz\", or \"Questionnaire\" would be appropriate? They all sound like the same thing....it's so confusing...) Thanks, The Tester.",

Personally, I want to use it for signing up for exams but I need some new features added before I can do it; for example, controlling which students are allowed to sign up.

Groups could be used as a temporary hack but not as a general solution since students that sign up for exam can already be in different groups (unless it is possible to have students in multiple groups). Another problem with using groups is that students can see who is in a group AFAIK , and for privacy reasons that is a big no-no in terms of exam signup. Very specific example can be signing up for a makeup exam. According to our rules only students who actually wrote the first exam or provided doctor's excuse for their absence are allowed into makeup exam. I need to be able to select from the list of all students those who are allowed (or, conversly, not allowed) to sign up. Yes, this is like creating a group but specifically related to this one activity. A bonus would be to be able to read the list from a text file -- I am talking about courses with 400-600 students each. Choice export already includes the id number in the output and that or moodle userid could be used as matching criterion. Adding a summary option that I asked about in the other post is fairly simple but necessary for big courses. Waiting for moodle to load a few hundred avatars just to see the signup results is trying. Similarly, being able to specify an exam code for the export function is important for processing the signup lists further (like room assignments and making exam access lists).",

Yes, students can chose not to take an exam. A detailed scenerio of a specific course follows. We have a few courses with different variations of this. Circa 550* students choose one of the 3 exam dates in January. Each date allows 200 students due to room capacity. They can sign on, change dates, or sign off until early January. This I have realized in Choice as it is now. Those who fail this exam can choose to sign up for a makeup exam in April, but only those who actually written and failed in January or provided doctor's excuse on timely basis (15-20% do not show up). To realize this part I need to be able to tell Choice who is legible to vote. *) Besides students actually registered for this course this semester, students who failed or did not write the exam in previous semesters are legible to sign up.",

If I understand correctly, the limit setting for each option allows me to cap how many people sign up for each date. I need that. I need also to be able to block certain students from signing up, and that is clearly not supported. Is something coming up in the enhanced module preannounced in summer? I thought to make an exclusion list using the interface like assigning students to groups. However, this would require modifying the database , so ain't so trivial. I wonder whether in the interim I could whack it using groups. I'd have to be able to block one group from participating. Another alternative is for me to clone the choice into a new module. This would free me from worrying about backwards compatibility. The catch is that I need it before Xmas.",

Create a Choice in the 1st week of your course, then do a full backup of your course and save it seperately just in case you break something! then create a backup file with only the data you want - eg don't backup the user data and only include the choice module. - open a new copy of the moodle.xml file created inside the backup zip file. now follow the instructions in the attached file to this post - I couldn't get moodle to display the XML tags properly, so put these in a seperate file! after making the changes given in the attached file., restore the file - I would suggest to a new course first to make sure you didn't break anything! and then if that works restore it to your own course \"adding data to it\" - (you will end up with 2 choices in the first section, but you can just delete one of them!)

Here's my problem - to allow \"unlimited\" choices within the choice module I need to create a new table. - it will store all the possible \"answers\" a choice can have. I have 2 options for naming this new new table: I can rename the old \"choice_answer\" table to \"choice_responses\" (like the quiz mod) and then use a new table called \"choice_answer\" that stores the possible \"answers\" a choice can have. Or: I can create a new table called \"choice_questions\" which stores all the possible \"answers\" a choice can have, but then use the convention \"question\" to refer to the possible \"answers\" - This is the way the file I have provided here is implemented, (still inconsistent, as some areas of the code refer to \"answer\" and others refer to \"question\") - I'm not too sure this is the best option.... The code I've provided here doesn't yet display large numbers of choices very well on the screen, and it doesn't include the \"limit\" feature that I want to implement soon.... - to install it, copy the files to the mod\\choice dir, and then go to the admin page of your site. What do others think? Dan",

People generally don't like 'betraying' others that they know, even if it's only a game, which takes away from the rationality needed for the PD to work. I'm sure you are aware that there are several websites allowing you to play the Prisoner's Dilemma (and the iterated version) against computer opponents. Anyway, my constructive comment is: Each game is played by 3 students. Two 'prisoners' and a third 'jailer' who applies the rules of the game and gives out the rewards. The 'prisoners' therefore can use any of the communication tools in Moodle, or even plain email, to contact the 'jailer' once they have made their decision and she in turn can send back the results. The students can then switch places, each taking their turn at being a jailer.",

If you have heard of IRV (Instant Run-Off Voting) - or STV (Single Transferable Vote) - that is what I am talking about. The simple idea is as follows (there are a few improvements on it - to make it work more ideally - which I can explain later). When casting a ballot - the person does not simply indicate a single choice - but ranks order the avaialbe choices. (THey don't have to rank them all - only the ones they like). So lets imagine there are 10 possible choices. The individual likes 5 of them and dislikes 5. Of the five they like - they rank order them in order of preference - highest to lowest (from 1 to 5). When the ballots are counted - the choice with the highest preference for the voter that will cause a \"winning\" choice is where the ballot is applied. So - imagine you are trying to create a representative body (or a smaller set of options approved) - you use what is techically called the STV form of preferential voting. Imagine of the ten choices - five of them will be chosen.",

This would require the teacher to set a limit for each event, i e number of seats, so that when the limit is reached, the next student need to select another event. While this requirement could be solved also in other modules (appointment or attendance probably), I tried to hack a little in the choice module. Since I am brand new to this, I am not sure of the procedure to follow, but I post my attempt here for anyone to test it. Be aware that I added some fields in the MySQL choice table, but I did not add code for other DB. To use the new \"limit\" feature you need to set a limit for the choices. You may also want to turn on the \"Allow update\" parameter to allow students to change their choice (within the limits of course..). I included the choice english language file in the zip, should of course be moved to the lang/en folder. And, consider it a beta... Roger",

Maybe your requirement would be more natural to include in a module already dealing with time appointments, such as the appointment module? Not sure of the development status of the appointment module, but I guess it would be possible to use most of my added code here (plus some important parts of the basic code!) and merge it into the appointment module. The effect in the appointment module might then be to allow teachers to set up an appointment time and then allow students to book themselves into those appointments. Number of students to be allowed per appointment would be a limit figure set by the teacher that in your case would be set to one. Maybe there are already development plans for the appointment module that more or less cover this requirement? Roger",

This will make all the SQL statements visible on the page. 3) Add lines like: print_object($variable); in the code to get dumps of objects, arrays or plain variables, so you can track what data is going where.",

Something like adding the choice to display the names when you choose to show the column of not responded choices. Thanks, Carlo",

          "Text": "I teach at Linden Hall School, a private girls' boarding school with around 120 students.  We are looking for a better way to allow students to register for weekend activities , without being able to register their friends or remove others from the list to make room for themselves.  We typically have 20 to 25 activity choices on a given weekend. I have been playing around with using the quiz module for this, where we'd create a \"quiz\" each week that consisted of a single question with the ability to select several answer choices (each event they want to participate in) or a \"quiz\" where each event has a \"yes I want to attend this\" or \"No thank you\" response.  Then the student's name and their \"quiz\" results would be sent to the Residential Director who could create the list of those actually attending. The things that I think are missing though is a time-stamp so activities can be filled on a first-come-first-served basis with overflow going on a waiting list, or a way to set a limit to the number that can sign up for a particular event.  It would also be wonderful if we could have the Residential Director get a list of who selected which choices, in time order, but that's probably asking a bit much from a quiz module. Thomas Robb suggested that I take a look at the choice module, but the messages I've seen indicate that choices are limited to six options, which rather puts a crimp on how we can do the sign-ups when we run 20 to 25 activities each weekend.  We could seperate out in batches of 6 activities, but I'd rather just have a field of check boxes that the students can click on the activities they want to sign up for. Now, I haven't tried playing around with choice yet to make it fit, but can I get the outputs sorted by choice and time-stamp order?  That is, everyone who selected \"Grocery Trip, Fri, 3:15-4:15\" in the order that they submitted their request so that we can just fill up the vans and the rest are put on a waiting list when the van capacity is full? Also, is it possible to select more than one choice per question?  Sorry, I know I should probably try playing around with this myself, but I haven't had the time to get to it yet, and if these aren't possible, I'll keep trying to play with the quiz module.",

However, it looks like my usage will be a bit difference than most of your other examples. I run a website for a large, worldwide historical re-creation group called the Society for Creative Anachronism (\"SCA\") which researches and recreates the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I will be using Moodle to allow various people in the SCA to offer classes on subjects they have researched.  As such, I don't have a pre-set, 100% reliable teacher base. Consequently, I'd love to be able to have the students rate the teachers after the class re: skill, knowledge, responsiveness, etc. so that I can weed out the not so good ones. Is there any function for something like this? Or any chance of one in a future version? Regardless, this looks like an awesome program and I'm thrilled to have found it! Thanks!",
