          "Text": "I have studied more than twenty courses across four different Swedish universities and higher education institutions. Despite the differences between them, they all share the same weaknesses in how Moodle is structured and presented. As a student with ADHD, I often experience that perception and navigation in Moodle become barriers in themselves. To better understand my difficulties, I have also used ChatGPT to analyze how my own perception interacts with the learning platform. This showed me that the problems are not purely personal – they are systemic. Key Challenges Important details disappear in complex file structures. Key documents are sometimes reused but remain hidden in folders named after earlier modules. Unclear file names (e.g. “document1.pdf”) and inconsistent naming of resources. Long and complex course pages where crucial information gets lost. No standardized course template – every teacher organizes Moodle differently. As a result, I sometimes spend entire working days just trying to orient myself in the file structures, or contacting teachers for help. This takes away focus from learning and wastes valuable teacher time. What is Needed What we are really asking for is standardization : Clear coding and labeling of documents/resources Each file should include a code and a full “path” in the course structure (e.g. Course Geography1 → Module 1a → Assignment 2 → document2.doc ). Adopt a standardized course template across the institution Same predictable layout for every course (intro, resources, assignments, forum). Consistent naming conventions and metadata . Built-in support for time orientation A function that clearly shows how many hours/days remain until assignments are due. Why It Matters Without such standards, Moodle courses do not meet current European accessibility legislation (the Web Accessibility Directive, soon strengthened by the European Accessibility Act). For students with ADHD, this lack of structure creates unnecessary cognitive barriers. Standardizing Moodle use according to clear accessibility principles would not only help students with ADHD – it would support all learners by creating clarity, predictability, and compliance with legal requirements.",

In my experience this is not about a few individual teachers – it is a systemic problem that I have encountered at several higher education institutions where I have studied. Interestingly, I have not had the same difficulties when courses were delivered in Canvas. We should also not downplay the fact that many teachers simply do not have the time to learn the platform, do not receive sufficient training, and are often unaware that their choices in structuring Moodle can make learning virtually impossible for students with impaired working memory or selective attention. At present, students are forced to keep entire folder structures in their head to locate relevant documents. This is made worse when teachers are careless with file names, or even use different names for the same document. That is why I am suggesting a document ID system – for example added as a suffix in the filename – so that each resource can always be identified, regardless of naming. The part you found interesting – the visual “Time left bar” – is inspired by the gaming world. It could show the due date as a live countdown in days and hours until submission. Such a feature could add a useful layer of gamification, but most importantly it would provide clear temporal orientation for all students, not only those with ADHD.",

Most existing studies focus on outcomes (e.g., screen time, distraction, difficulties with self-regulation) rather than on the subjective perception and user experience of digital platforms. As a result: Knowledge gaps remain – we lack robust frameworks and systematic studies addressing ADHD-specific interactions with digital systems. Adaptations are missing – digital accessibility standards (like WCAG) focus mainly on visual, auditory, or motor impairments, while ADHD-related needs are overlooked. Responsibility shifts to the individual – instead of platforms offering built-in adaptations, people with ADHD often have to “cut and paste” together their own strategies, tools, and methods to make digital systems usable.",

Canvas have put a great deal of effort into this area, but I am confident that it is possible to produce courses with accessibility issues with that as well. A visual indication of time left for things is a good idea and also technically not especially hard to implement.

A long tagging system for file names is problematic as it will break a lot of teaching use cases and can be confusing for screen reader users.

I don’t fully agree with the previous comment that these issues are purely instructional. Depending on how the question is framed, they are also system problems. The way the platform is designed either increases or reduces the chances of mistakes, and that has a direct impact on students. Take file naming as an example: tagging systems sound useful in theory, but in practice they are inconsistent, confusing for screen readers, and too dependent on teachers’ technical skills. A strict, purpose-driven naming convention — built into the system — would create predictability and reduce errors. And this, in my view, is just the first step in a broader, step-by-step change where each course component is clearly framed to support even those instructors who are less interested in digital structure. From here, we face a choice: either maximize flexibility and accept higher risk of inconsistency, or reduce complexity through enforced conventions and guided workflows. From a student perspective, the latter is far preferable: it should be hard to do things wrong, not simply possible to do everything right.",

The way the platform is structured determines whether it increases or reduces our cognitive load and the chance of errors. My central point is simple: We need a shift in design philosophy from \"maximize flexibility\" to \"reduce complexity through enforced, guided workflows.\" ​ The Flaw of Flexibility and the Engineering Mindset ​The current system's focus on maximum flexibility, which often feels like an \"engineer's mindset,\" treats usability as secondary . It creates an environment where, while it's technically possible to set everything up perfectly, the complexity means it’s all too easy to do things wrong. This leads to \"configuration overload\" and wildly inconsistent course experiences, which is a massive, unnecessary burden on students. Our focus should be on knowledge transfer , not on mastering complicated software. ​ The Necessity of Enforced Standards ​We need the system to incorporate governance and guardrails . Essential elements like a system-enforced naming convention for files would eliminate inconsistency, instantly improve predictability, and ensure better accessibility for tools like screen readers. Institutions must prioritize a standardized, recognizable course structure to ensure a minimal learning curve . The choice is ultimately between flexibility (high risk/inconsistency) and enforced conventions (low risk/high predictability). From the student perspective, the latter is vastly superior because the system should make it hard to do things wrong. ​ Predictability as an Equity Requirement ​This need for predictability goes deeper than general usability; it's a critical issue of inclusion . A teacher can work a lifetime and still not fully grasp the specific perceptual needs of students, particularly those with neurodevelopmental differences , such as an ADHD brain . For these students, the platform's inconsistency—a disorganized folder or a confusing label—is not a minor annoyance; it's a significant, energy-draining cognitive barrier . This means that a minimal learning curve and reliable consistency are not a luxury; they are an absolute necessity for equitable access. ​",

Still, I can’t see how teachers realistically would have the time to learn and apply Moodle-specific training courses. Most of them already struggle to balance teaching with their own research and administrative duties. In that context , expecting them to master course templates and structural conventions feels unrealistic. This is why I am leaning towards creating external structures outside Moodle – based on downloaded materials – where students with ADHD (and others) can organize content in a way that reduces the cognitive burden. From the student perspective, this often feels like the only practical solution. That said, I also wonder whether I am missing something: do schools and universities not already apply standardized course templates on the teacher side? As a student, I only see the “front end” of Moodle, and it is often chaotic. I would genuinely like to understand if the lack of structure is because templates do not exist at all, or because they are optional and inconsistently applied. In general, I am positively inclined toward open source and flexible features, but in this case my main aim is simply to figure out the cause-and-effect relationship behind the current course design practices. Without knowing why courses look the way they do, it is hard to know whether the solution lies in better system defaults, stronger governance, or external tools.",

I have worked with a few that all have employed some type of \"Instructional Designer\" that was in charge of aiding the teacher, setting up a template course, and working with the teacher to input their content. I've been lucky to be in these environments. I know there are are schools where it's only the teacher working on their own course content and unless the administration had a unified system in place to have the LMS administrator copy a course template over for them to work out of, then yes you are correct that teachers are essentially 'on their own' especially without adequate training. In my current environment, when a teacher clicks the \"Course Request\", I create their blank course and then I import a \"Template\" (which is a course that just houses all the consistent visual setup of activities ). The \"Course Template plugin allows other users to copy that course template with out needing me to do it for them, so that plugin is very helpful.",

For example in the Forurms setting form (link to Moodle demo site) , in the  'Common module settings' section, if you change the value of 'Group mode' then the ' Grouping ' setting underneath appears and disappears. For screen readers, we seem not to do anything special for that. For example one could imagine that being marked with aria-live=\"polite\", but that example probably illustrates why we don't do that: the other thing that changes is the next thing in tab-order, so what happens should make sense to users of assistive technology. But, what about in other cases, is there a case for making it clear to screen-reader users that changing one setting is having some impact on the rest of the form?

'Form control Grouping now hidden' Just using aria-live: polite on the actual controls being revealed wouldn't make sense as it would just read out the labels and values - like you turn that on and it suddenly says 'Grouping', what's that about. (It's actually not too terrible in this case, but imagine it when multiple controls are being hidden and it will read the full text of all of them.) The same approach could be used for 'disabledIf'. It is possible to achieve this using aria-live, hidden (screenreader only) text, javascript to write the sentence when needed, and some new language strings. But it doesn't seem the sort of thing that accessibility advice normally recommends, so I wouldn't implement this without getting more opinions... --sam",

Right now the icon for the SCORM package would read 'SCORM package'. The challenge with this is that they would be decorative on the course page, but they would be not decorative on the page where you select the activity type you want to add to the course. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this?",

My screenshot does indeed come from the Moodle QA testing site (https://qa.moodledemo.net/) . I am particularly sensitive to accessibility , even though I do not personally have any serious visual impairments. However, I am slightly color blind, like a small but not insignificant percentage of the population. To my knowledge, this cannot be effectively corrected with glasses or other means, and it can lead to certain frustrations if the colors on a web page are poorly chosen. I have also helped an older person—very curious and intelligent—who suffered from mild macular degeneration. That experience made me realize just how inaccessible websites actually are. By the way, I would strongly recommend working with people who have mild visual impairments when developing your layouts and other formatting. I imagine that developers are generally young people without visual impairments, who have no real idea of what this actually entails. I don't mean to be too direct, but it seems to me that what is referred to as \"accessibility\" is, in reality, more focused on making Moodle look sleek and modern—an approach that, unfortunately, does not necessarily address the needs of people with visual impairments.",

I’ve cloned my Moodle site to a different server that supports mp3 files, maintaining the same versions of Moodle, PHP, and the database. I also performed a search and replace to update the URLs. Most elements are functioning well; however, during my review of the recordings, I noticed that while some audio files play correctly, others do not. The affected files show an error message: “Hmmm… can’t reach this page. It looks like the webpage at mydomain/recording might be having issues or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.” If there is a way to resolve this discrepancy, I’d greatly appreciate any advice.

          "Text": "Okay, Venelous, my point (of course 😀) was to illustrate that students are always leaving Moodle to learn.  With modern computers and technology, you cannot prevent students from downloading things, including videos. To answer your questions about video, I host my videos on Vimeo.  It's not free, but I find it very affordable ($20/USD per month), it has great features, and it always works.  It supports all the common features, and includes \"chapters.\" Below, I am providing two examples of how to link to a video on Vimeo.  The first method is to use a hyperlink to the video, the second method is to embed the video.  I use both methods, depending on what I am seeking.  This particular video is what I require students to watch to learn how to use my Moodle. (Make sure to try the chapters icon in the video's control area.) As a side benefit of hosting videos not on my Moodle, I can easily provide students with a link (such as in an email, saying, \"You need to watch this video!\"), and they do not need to be logged into Moodle. Yes, I allow students to download my videos.  My philosophy is that since I cannot prevent students from copying them, I might as well make it easy to download.  Then students might watch my videos instead of some other instructor's videos, an instructor that tries not to allow downloading.  (I want students to spend time in my course, not others. 😓) Vimeo does have some privacy settings that can make downloading \"harder.\"  There is a switch to not allow downloading.  You can make a video viewable from only certain domains. You can even password protect each video (How' that for making things harder for students... that they would have to have passwords for both Moodle and videos!) Incidentally, most of my course content is not in Moodle, either.  Most content is on my website.  Yes, some people would not want to do this, but this is my style.  It provides much more flexibility, ease, and power in managing content. I gave a presentation at a Moodlemoot explaining my methods.

If you know this would be very helpful and I think this would make some people save some money and know more about technologies, how to implement useful code, know more about moodle possibilities and capabilities and etc.",

I assume your goal is for a student to play the video, right? So what I do when I want to copy a video, I go to the video and play it. However, before playing it, I start my screen recorder software. Then I can leave my computer, do something else, and return to stop my screen recorder. It's easy to crop the beginning and end, as needed. I also add burned-in captions. Ultimately, I end up with a copy of the video that I can watch whenever I choose. Since I am the only one using this copy, I don't feel that I am at risk of violating any copyright rules.",

This is not so with Vimeo (and perhaps other platforms). So you still have to choose: 1) do you use a paid service, or 2) do you use YouTube? No matter what you choose or try to do, students can still copy (and share if they wish) videos. This is not a Moodle problem; it's the way technology works.  The only way that I know of that can prevent students from copying course materials, documents, and videos is to have them physically come to a classroom, take away their smartphones and other recording devices, and then display things to them only in this classroom. I am unsure if I mentioned that if you upload your videos to Moodle, your Moodle backup size might increase tremendously. Can your server handle this? (Mine can't unless I pay more for hosting space.)",

          "Text": "I realise this answer is old now, but you can refine it a bit. For example, if you only wanted to prevent right clicks on <video> elements. This goes in the same Site administration > Appearance > Additional HTML. > Within HEAD as the previous solution. \n```text\n<script>\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n   document.querySelectorAll(`video`).forEach( ele => ele.addEventListener('contextmenu', (e) => e.preventDefault() ) );\n});\n</script>\n```\n This code waits for the the web page structure ( The DOM ) to load, then grabs all <video> elements on the page and adds an event listener for them preventing the context menu from appearing, but only on that element. The context menu continues to appear elsewhere, enabling useful stuff like copy paste and context menu spell checkers to continue working everywhere else. The querySelectorAll() method is super useful here because you can make some very complex selections. Youtube embeds for example, are in an <iframe> element, but so is H5P and I want the context menu there.  However you can grab just Youtube iFrames with a wild card selector on the <iframes> src attribute. \n```text\n<script>\nwindow.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n   document.querySelectorAll(`video, iframe[src*=\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/\n\"]`).forEach( ele => ele.addEventListener('contextmenu', evt => evt.preventDefault() ) );\n});\n</script>\n```\n Youtube actually overrides the context menu with its own, so good luck blocking that from within Moodle; best solution I had was to put an invisible <div> over it and block right clicking on that element instead.",

          "Text": "Hi Accessibility People! Could you vote for my Course Index issue on the tracker please? I recently revisited an earlier post I had made and realised I needed to give a clearer explanation. Essentially, when navigating through the accordion menu in the lefthand Course Index, the current state of a collapsed or expanded item is not read out to the screen reader user. Instead the next action they might wish to take is read out. So for example, if a Course Index item is collapsed, \"expand\" is read by the screen reader. This can be confusing for the user as can lead them to think the item is expanded when it is collapsed. We think it would be better if the current state of an accordion item is read out first and then the action of expand or collapse is read out if they go to activate it. Also, when the user expands an item with the space bar, you hear \"space\" and not \"expanded\" and when the user repeats the action you hear \"space\" again and not \"collapsed\". Many thanks for your support. Hope it is ok to post this here. I am new to this forum! Kerry",

          "Text": "Moodle 4.3 We are in the process of upgraded from 3.11 to 4.3. In many of our courses, we use the Text and Media resources (formerly called Labels) to add addition text. This is done to provide better structure to the course content without the need of adding new sections / activities . These blocks of text are part of an existing section/topic and doesn't warrant their own heading. Since upgrading to 4.3, we find that these Text and Media resources now require a Title, otherwise the first line of text appears in the course navigation. This makes absolutely no sense and clearly wasn't thought through properly from a usability perspective. There should be either an option to \"exclude\" these from the course navigation individually, or, if the Title is blank, exclude these from the course navigation by default. We now have the 'joyful' task of updating almost 900 instances of the Text and Media resources activity. We use a mixture of the Collapsible Topics, Flexible Sections, Tiles and Topics course formats. Is there a fix for this?",

A title and text: The text shows, but not the title. No title, but text: The text shows, as in #1. A title but no text: Nothing shows, but the resource appears to take some default screen space. I wonder if it would be better to have the \"text and Media\" resource mimic the behavior of a Quiz (for example.) The title is required for a quiz, and it shows on the page (and in the course index.) However, the description doesn't show unless you check \"Display description on course page.\" I was surprised that the \"text and media\" resource title does not show.  But as I think about it, perhaps this resource should only be used to display text without any title. As a suggestion, I would like the \"Text and Media\" resource to contain a title and text, and two buttons, one for \"Display description on course page\" and another for \"Display Title on course page.\"  Then, we would have the most flexibility with this resource.  When using \"Display Title on course page,\" this could be used to add \"headings\" in both the course page and course index. Any thoughts?",

I chose instead of the radio buttons the option which presents a drop-down or combo box that the person can use to choose the answers. This alleviates the HTML and makes the feedback form look a lot better. I'm not 100% OK with this, however, this is going to be my  workaround until the code for the radio button showing up is solved. I hope someone can look into this as for me.

Example 1: Create 0 or 1 activity on your course and go to gradebook setting. Sticky footer hides information under \"More\". Of course you can get around this by zooming out, but still it is not very practical. Example 2: Add 1-2 participants on your course and go to Grader report. Same thing happens: sticky footer hides \"more\" options. I posted this here if someone can have a thorough look at the sticky footer issue, maybe there is a same root cause to most of these? I can also make a tracker if it is a better option.",

The most recent is a notification box that comes up after I grade a students assignment, covering up what I am looking at - causing me to wait 5 seconds before it disappears.   This notification is new, and it can't be moved no mater what I do to the window size etc....how do we make it stop. I attached a picture to this submission showing the light blue box covering the spot I always look at as soon as I submit a student's grade.  I know you might be saying \"it is just 5 seconds, just wait\"....but I move very quickly in Moodle and it does interrupt my workflow...not to mention it is incredibly annoying.

First, I ask you to put on your user hat....keep an open mind.   Breathe.  My feedback is meant to help the application improve and it is not a personal assault on anyone making changes to Moodle. Second, I never stated that it was stopping me from completing my tasks, I'm not sure where you got that from but maybe I should just clarify.   I stated that I am a heavy user of Moodle, and so any changes, I notice. In this case, when I submit a students grades, I am on to the next student (whose name appears at the top), comparing with my spreadsheet, and opening their project to grade.   It is all very efficient and have done it for  5 years. Now, my issue is that the dialog box informing me that it is saving the state (which personally I don't care about - I don't need to know this - but clearly the developer believes that I care) is blocking the student name for approximately 5 seconds which delays me selecting them in my spreadsheet and opening their project to grade.  It slows me down (5 second pause) but doesn't stop me. Like I said in my email, you could say \"suck it up princess, it is just 5 seconds\" - agree, but it is very annoying.   I have overseen 300 software developers in my previous life an I know what the developers say under their breath when the users complain...I get it...someone is calling your baby ugly. My point is, what if I added a 5 second delay to everything that you do on your desktop (e.g. 5 second delay launching every application) - you would get annoyed pretty quickly.   Doesn't stop you, but annoys you. That is my point Brett - and my plea to make it stop. As for your other queries: Regarding navigating to the next student, I have already navigated to the next student, I just can't see their name for 5 seconds!   Which makes me pause for 5 seconds. I do feel clicking save is necessary - I teach IT and computer programming - this is a no-brainer, I just don't need the developer telling me with a banner across the screen that they are saving....I don't care. Again, I have no issue with manually selecting Save, love it in fact.   I don't need automatic save though Moodle in general and Moodle Quiz is VERY good at automatic saves as my students have found out during exams. OK, well, that's it...do what you want with my feedback - hopefully it is useful. Regards, Warren",

On your last points, the fact we save manually in the gradebook and grading interface is pretty unusual among LMS.  Most other major LMS I have experience with you enter the value/make the change etc and it's saved in background immediately.  Changing this behaviour would resolve a lot of weird edge cases that can result in data loss in the gradebook/assignment submissions page/grader interface.  But Moodle has worked with this explicit save model for a long time so it's important to understand a broad views of users here The banner is there for accessibility reasons, as an explicit confirmation, and many user really need this reassurance.  But as you pointed out, the positioning could be considered for improvement.  In the protypes of the new designs are moving elements around in the headset so it may be a non issue but it will be important to consider what data is obscured.",

The CSS selector I've used could well be too generic, getting unintended toasts, so you can be more specific. To just get the assignment grader page, for example, \n```text\n#page-mod-assign-grader .toast-wrapper { top: 200px; }\n```\n `display: none;` would completely turn off the toast, but Im unsure if there are any that are actually needed, so use with caution. If you don't have access to the custom CSS, a plugin for your browsers can inject custom CSS into a page, for example https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/customcss-injector/ for firefox .

The student knows that there is a dropdown for past, current and future courses, because he made himself the change (the default value is \"all\", isn't it?). Afterwards, did he understand what was involved behind it, probably not... Of course, for people who spend all day in Moodle, the problem is solved in 2 seconds. But if my IT support colleagues, who don't use Moodle every day, get stuck for several minutes without being able to solve the problem, it's probably that something could be improved. Fortunately, this type of feedback concerns a very small minority of our students (I haven't looked in our database , but probably also because very few users change the preference for past, current and future courses...). Anyway, for students who don't need advanced use on Moodle (reading messages, answering quizzes, uploading files... in short, not more advanced use than what social networks offer ), I think they should not need any instructions or support to use Moodle (except of course students who are not comfortable with computers). The software should fit to its users, not the other way around. But I could be wrong about that. Another point that makes me think there's a problem, and as indicated in the issue, the information given to people using a screen reader is more precise than the information displayed to people not using a screen reader. The wording announced to users changes according to the value used in the menu. E.g. “Show 12 items per page” or “Show all items per page”. But perhaps even for screen reader users, this wording could be improved and made even more precise. About our environment, we're using Moodle 4.4 and the Boost theme.

          "Text": "Hi there Moodlers, We recently had to disable the Accessibility Block ( https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Accessibility_Block ) on our version of Moodle 3.9 as it posed a major security risk. Having looked more closely, it appears that it is no longer supported, but we weren't aware. And there is no Moodle 4.1 version - we are upgrading to Moodle 4.1 in the next few months. In terms of a replacement, I have seen talk of the Brickfield Accessibility Review block, but that is for teachers, not students. I would usually encourage students to use the many tools within their web browsers to change font size, contrast etc. But we have a particuarly difficult Degree Apprenticeship course that has very strict criteria for students when they are engaged with the VLE. So is there a replacement for the old Accessibility Block? What are others doing? Many thanks in advance for your help. Catherine",

          "Text": "There are obviously various sides to this challenge: First of all, faculty or instructional designers / education content writers should adopt UDL (Universal Design for Learning) good practices when designing their content in any LMS. Fortunately, there are a lot of resources to help with that. Then, existing content can be checked and improved using tools such as the Brickfield Accessibility suite. Following that, it's up to the participants to work with this content and use whatever aiding technology they need. Keep in mind that most current laptops have pretty good tools on board to help with accessibility issues, that are quite a lot better than what the TTS / Accessibility block had to offer. And finally, there are specialty integrations available, such as ReadSpeaker, which can be added to provide online and state-of-the-art text-to-speech solutions in multiple languages. From my personal experience, I can recommend this tool (comes at a price, though), because it not only offers text-to-speech for all course content, but also provides a user-friendly document viewer/reader for all text formats in your course (PDF, MS Office, Open Office, ...).",

The main challenge is with the third-party external ATBar, which is not being maintained at all by its authors, at some point has lost all of its docs, and doesn't have an up-to-date SSL. If someone has funding, and would like to cover the updating of this plugin, we would be happy to engage with you on this. We are planning on sharing a new plugin which will provide guidance to users with their font size, font colour, and other display options, depending on their browser. We will update this forum discussion once it's available. As Joost rightly pointed out, there are many good tools now in both devices and browsers to help with accessibility issues!",

However, The accessibility audits also evaluate Moodle's text editors (Tiny MCE and Atto) against WCAG Level AA to ensure their accessibility. Moodle's text editors also provide authors with the means to create accessible content. For example: Ability to designate headings in the text content Ability to create accessible links and images Provide the means to attach captions to uploaded media content Accessibility checker tool for the authored content Moodle also has a built-in accessibility toolkit that organisations can use to help them create accessible course content As Marcus said, Moodle HQ has no control over the accessibility of third-party plugins. So, it will be up to the institutions installing the plugins to evaluate their accessibility. Hope this helps.",

It appears that for Books, The Book title is an H1 heading with an H2 class (image below), and the Chapter title is an H3 heading. This appears to be consistent with a Page Name also, but there are not Chapter titles. So the confusion that I have with working with Instructors is when should they be starting with an H3 or H4 heading? With the Book it appears to be H4 because the Chapter title is an H3 and in a Page it would be an H3. A little confusing based on the TinyMCE heading availability, as it provides an H3 heading in a Book but not an H2 or H1 heading for a Page. Is it safe to recommend starting with an H4 (Book Chapter content) and H3 (Page content) based on how HQ might resolve this accessibility issue? Appreciated Justin",

          "Text": "Hi there, In Moodle 4.4 (with nice activity/resource new icons, it must be said ), when activity completion has the Receive a passing grade setting, the text-box remains as “To Do” if the grade is a not passing grade. So, students wouldn’t know what the actual activity status is until they click on the dropdown menu or until they go into the activity itself. I think, then, if activity completion status is not shown at a glance but a click instead, let’s make that click on the activity itself to check what is missing, but at course level add a simple way to show it… maybe with a coded check-box ;) Yes, I was wondering if it is possible to combine the M<3.11 check- box at course level, and the explicit text-box completion conditions inside the activity. The check-box code is the same as in the Activity completion report for teachers. If it is clear for teachers, why it wouldn’t be clear for students? All this reminds me the now closed Moodle Tracker MDL-71856 - Support pre-311 method of showing activity completion checkboxes within topics , where it sais: « This \"Improvement Request\" is to support both methods » understood as make the new text-box and the old check-box options at course level keeping the new explicit conditions text-box inside the activity. And yes, I am aware of the accessibility importance and I am agree with it, that is why the suggestion is make it as an option. What do you think? I add a couple of images to show both scenarios. ¡Saludos! PS. The Activity completion report for teachers is a very useful tool that can filter by group, by activity/resource or, by section and could be ordered alphabetically or by order in course.",

Keeping just manager as her role, stops all emails at once, thus she doesn't know who has submitted the quizzes yet. Keeping both manager and non-editing teacher as her role spams her inbox with email from all groups. Looks like, her being a manager makes her teacher of all groups, which triggers the spam . She is an elderly person, and i don't want to burden her by teaching something new as a work around, but rather a new custom made role might solve this problem. Please help me go about it.

          "Text": "Good evening, We have a moodle 3.9 with several online activities . Normally each of them has 3 open questions where they are answered with free text. When it comes to corrections, it becomes very tedious since you have to go to each response item per student, and when the popup for said response opens you have to click on rate to be able to enter a score/feedback and save. This multiplied by 3 questions for each student and 150 students is a horrible number of clicks. We would need to continue with the online questionnaire format since we have implemented a staggered entry that allows the system not to collapse. The alternative of uploading a file instead of an online assignment has been tried but it causes more problems than the one we use since there are problems with the students due to the format of the file and the possible closure of the activity before they upload it. With the online activity, it is sent automatically when the time is up even if the students do not click on the send button. The problem at this moment is basically the teacher's task to correctand how to make it more bearable in some way by maintaining this type of activity but reducing the number of clicks to correct. Any ideas? Greetings.",

If you thought that Groups could also be created at this stage, I don't think so. \"Groups\" in Moodle are very powerful, so I am one who likes that \"Groups\" are handled separately. But maybe this is just me. I like how Al adds students to his courses.  You might want to consider this if you are manually enrolling students yourself. But I don't do it this way.  I let students self-enroll.  Ahead of time, I set up groups and then give students an enrollment key that immediately puts them into their proper group.  However, I still check to ensure their \"self\" and \"group\" enrollments worked correctly.",

So for example if somebody wants to make say a custom cert activity available only for users who finished a test activity first it is pretty simple. In such case you can work with activity settings here, because we have all activities in the same course. In our case however the course availabilty should be subject to activities not in the same course. In the best case the whole target course is not visible if the pre-conditions are not met. Maybe it is easier to hide activities via settings  again. But under \"restrict access\" in the course settings I can only find criteria from the same course. Maybe it is possible to go a totally different way with the enrolment method \"cohort sync\". So my idea would be to let students enter a cohort / global group automatically triggered by an event such as \"completion of course xy\" . The members of the  cohort / global group become member of the target course and view it. Can you help me to achieve this ? Thanks a lot ! Best, Benedikt",

Users (including myself) are experiencing an error when logging on to our Moodle for the first time each day or after an undetermined period of absence. Even if you have your password saved in Chrome, the first login attempt is unsuccessful and then a 2nd attempt will get you in. If you log off and back on again, it doesn't happen - it just seems to be the first new session. We're running Moodle 3.9.17+ and I think it may have started when we upgraded to this version about a month ago. Not a big deal, but more of a frustration, as some users do not try a 2nd time to log in and just get in touch straight away to say they're locked out when they're not. Or new users say that their set password doesn't work. Is there a fix for this on this version? Thanks!",

Also, in previous versions, if\nstealth activities are enabled, editing users could set the Make available/Make unavailable options\nonly if the activity is hidden first as it should. You cannot stealth an\nactivity that is shown in the course. And, anyway, even if stealth\nactivities are not enabled, “… it is stillpossible to make activities available but not shown on the course page. ” So, the one click Hide/Show\noption is enough, I think.

The caption is in the correct place, according to one of the style guides that I have used (I can't remember if this is APA). So, I would say this is technically correct. However, this table caption is not identified with the tag. And perhaps it should be for accessibility (screen readers). But I think a screen readers would still read \"Table 1...\". Yes, TinyMCE table properties can be used to \"Show Caption\". When I do this, the caption is at the bottom. Hmmm, a problem. Do I follow my writing guide and put the table's caption at the top, not using the tag, or do I let TinyMCE insert a tag, and then add my text to it? Another problem that I think I am noticing using TinyMCE's Table Caption is that I cannot center the caption, which it should be. So, I think I would prefer my manual method until TinyMCE's tag, and its actual text, can be moved to the top and centered. It seems to me that being technically correct for most overrides being technically correct for folks using a screen reader. I hope my thoughts are on target. Also, my style guide says that picture captions should be below the picture. Shirley suggests perhaps a \"standard\" position for all captions, which seems to not be in sync with my writing guide. Of course, I can manually add a caption below a figure that would not use the tag.",

We often embed H5P content into the course page and that is usually better at full width, but for lots of text content, the narrower width arguably is better. I've had a go at adding a user control such as in the Adaptable theme to my fork of the Learnr theme.

If a file is available for students it should definetly be downloadable but that is more an educational design issue than anything. The HQ team is currently looking at the activity cards and I can raise this given its timely. If nothing else we can ommit the fractional parts of the display (i.e. 102 KB rather than 102.1 KB) as it adds no value.",

Of course, I know the \"show size\" function. The advantage of a threshold is that, depending on the context or needs of the school, the settings are always correct, without the lecturers having to adjust individual display options of the files, which is time-consuming. As in this example, the \"102.1 KB\" information is not relevant and therefore unnecessary. Basically, I think Moodle 4.x is a big leap forward in terms of UI/UX.

Therefore, my question is: Wouldn't it make sense for us administrators to have the possibility to predefine which activities should / should not have \"activity completion\" by default? Here are some examples of the desired activity presets: Forum activity: must be answered at least once. Text activity: must be accessed. Test activity: must be completed at least once. Folder activity: no activity completion is needed. Link activity: no activity completion is needed. Once the preset is defined for every single activity type, it will facilitate the use of the preconfigured activities for teachers and all stakeholders.

Although we were able to make some changes on our end, we do not have access to the complete code, limiting our capabilities. Here are the main issues that we believe are important to address: Information is lost on certain pages (especially the Dashboard ) when stylesheets are disabled. Tables within courses cannot be linearized (e.g., participants). It would be necessary to add a role=\"presentation\" attribute in the HTML code. Empty and unnecessary 'h' tags have been overlooked in several places. There is no notification to alert users when a new page or tab is opened (e.g., when accessing a course file). We appreciate your understanding and support in resolving these accessibility concerns. Best regards,",

          "Title": "Accessibilty Statements (Plugins)",
          "Text": "We had an interesting conversation in the office recently about Accessibility Statements and Moodle. We drafted back in 2019 an accessibility statement ( https://www.strath.ac.uk/accessibility/myplace/ ) for or Moodle instance, but we've been re-visiting this as we're doing a bit push on accessibility particularly for content. One of the threads that came up was how do we actually go about creating and maintaining something like the document above, especially when we're using an extensible platform such as Moodle? Yes Moodle has made assertions about it's compliance ( https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/accessibility ) but that's not quite the same as this statement about \"our instance\", and the issues that may arise from decisions/selections about look and feel, plugins etc. We've thought about maintaining just one big document all the time, but this is bit unwieldy and seems an awfully manual approach to this. As we were kicking this around, we thought, \"what if there was a convention for plugin developers to report what known accessibilities issues there were in a given plugin?\". Initially we thought \"ooh we could describe that programmatically\"...but that's quite a barrier and overhead, and as we looked around we came to the existing convention of the \"upgrade.txt\" file in Moodle. So we're proposing the following idea: Every plugin should disclose an \"accessibility.md\" file with the following format: \n```text\n    # Accessibility statement for {friendly plugin name}({frankenstylename})\n\n\n\n\n## Non-accessible content\n\n\n\n\n### Issues with content\n\n\n* The navigational drop-down menus in the website header are not accessible using only a keyboard. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1.\n\n\n\n\n### Issues with images, video and audio\n\n\n* Some of the alt tags for our images are missing or not appropriate. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1.\n\n\n* Some of the pages using the legacy design include images with embedded text. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.5.\n```\n The top level heading (#) introduces the plugin in a standard format that is both human and computer readable The 2nd level heading (##) denotes high-level descriptions, I was anticipating basically \"free text\" and there being some \"well defined\" sections such as the \"Non-accessible content\" one. Level 3 headings (###) represent related failures groups. Finally bullets under level 3 headings represent individual failures / issues. Ideally each of the bullets would be \"standardised\" clauses! With this convention in place it then becomes feasible to write an aggregator / generator / Moodle page that can take all of the accessibility.md files and collate them in to 1 document, following these rules: All bullets that are identical are collapsed into a single statement, with a clause that indicates which plugins it affects, with each plugin name linking to that plugin's accessibility.md file All bullets under the same L3 heading are collated into a single L3 Heading. Resulting in a combined mark down document: \n```text\n    # Accessibility Statement for {site}\n    \n\n\n\n\n## Non-accessible Content\n    \n\n\n### Issues with content\n    \n\n\n* The navigational drop-down menus in the website header are not accessible using only a keyboard. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1. (Affects [block_welcome_staff](https://site/blocks/welcome_staff/accessibility.md))\n\n\n\n\n\n    ### Issues with images, video and audio\n\n\n\n    * Some of the alt tags for our images are missing or not appropriate. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1. (Affects [block_welcome_staff](https://site/blocks/welcome_staff/accessibility.md), [block_mycoolblock](https://site/blocks/mycoolblock/accessibility.md))\n\n\n\n    * Some of the pages using the legacy design include images with embedded text. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.5. (Affects [block_welcome_staff](https://site/blocks/welcome_staff/accessibility.md))\n```\n This MD document can then be fairly easily converted into HTML, or it can be version controlled. The links to plugin accessibility.md files could point to a Moodle page that renders them as HTML for end-users, so that the information is always up to date with the version of the plugins that *you* have on your server . Our reason for going down a file /  markdown route is that it doesn't prescribe the ways that a plugin could be failing to meet accessibility, but where there is a \"standard\" form they could be aggregated, and as a file in the plugin it allows the plugin maintainer to amend easily as things get fixed. Also by going to an aggregated intermediary MD format, it allows individual sites to take the \"generated\" version and tailor it reasonably simply to add any pre-/post-amble they'd like or take out any generated items they may have fixed locally or are not relevant, but 80% of the work is automatically done.",

I'd count all of the items you show in your example as bugs, and so they should really have associated bug reports within the plugins issues tracker - a public issues tracker is a requirement for plugins db approval so all published plugins should have an issues tracker. Is there a way we could standardise the issue reporting somehow? - eg in github we could use tags to flag items that are accessibility related or is there some other way we could rely on the repositories issues tracker to produce a list of the accessibility issues that might also meet your needs?",

This approach allows that \"human readable\" information to be \"local\" to the system, rather than something that has to be hand-collated. This also allows for a statement to be included in the plugins relating to the accessibility issues that won't be fixed, but are disclosed as such. I think also with the issue tracker itself, a lot of the content is relating to acticulating the problem in terms of it's cause and effect, and then a discussion on how it should / will be \"fixed\", where this information isn't particular concerned about that, but more recognising an issue in a easily comprehendable way, and cross referenced against the \"standard clause\" statements that almost exist. We internally maintain about 79 plugins that make our \"Moodle\" into our VLE, so completely do understand the development and maintenance tracking aspect of this overhead, but it's not an issue that we feel is solely addressed via an Issue tracker. The other aspect that as a text file in the plugin the list of issues being disclosed could itself also be auto-generated from a plugin's issue tracker and then be commited, so I wasn't really looking at a proscriptive of creating the accessibility.md actefact itself.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodle Community, I'm experiencing an issue with the implementation of competencies in a Moodle course I've created. I've followed the usual steps for associating a competency with a course and a specific activity, but despite this, the system does not recognize the competency as achieved when the activity is completed. Here's what I've done so far: I created a course and enabled activity completion in the course settings. I created a competency framework, including a specific competency (A1-1) that I want to link to my course. I correctly linked the A1-1 competency to my course via the course settings. I created a 'Label' activity, and in the settings for this, I stipulated that upon completion of the activity, the A1-1 competency would be achieved. I also created a dummy user (\"demo\") and enrolled them in the course. When I log in as this user and complete the 'Label' activity, the course is indeed marked as 100% complete, but the A1-1 competency is not recognized as achieved. I've double-checked the course settings, activity settings, user enrollment, and competency configuration for the user. Everything appears to be in order.",

          "Title": "Header Hierarchy in Moodle Resources",
          "Text": "Hi All, I’m trying to make sense of the Heading Structure used in Moodle 4.0 when creating accessible Moodle books . Currently, it looks like the Activity Name (Syllabus and Course Overview) is a Heading 1 (H1). However, the Chapter Name (Instructors’ Information) is a Heading 3 (H3), which means heading 2 is skipped. In Moodle 3.11, because the Course Name is included as an H1, all other components fit together (Course Name = H1, Activity Name = H2, Chapter Name = H3). Because Moodle 4.0 removes the Course name, there is the issue of skipping heading levels. When I print the book, the Heading structure is intact (Activity Name = H1, Description = H2, Table of Contents = H2, Chapter Name is H3 ). Similarly, the Heading Structure in the Moodle Page shows the Activity Name (Syllabus and Course Overview) as a H1: In the Content area, I can designate my headings using the default “Heading (large)”, “Heading (medium)”, “Heading (small)”. Which are predefined in order of: H3, H4, H5 HTML view: This is an issue because H2 is still being skipped. I know I can manually open the html view in the Content area of the Moodle Page and update the Instructors’ Information to be H2 but I think Moodle should be doing that by default if the Book title is supposed to be a level 1 heading. Is Moodle 4.0 skipping heading 2 for a reason or was this simply overlooked? Thanks, -Lance",

Chris had been working on his new LearnR theme to replace Fordsome (for Moodle 4), but I have seen Chris say he likes the Boost Union theme (as I recall).  Also, Gareth has his \"Adaptable\" theme.  In my case, I prefer using the standard theme and modifying it with CSS and settings.",

However, if you log in as a student in this course, you do not see the little icon. Right? Also, in some courses, student see the right side icon, can click on it, and the the right side blocks show.

That's when we really noticed this - befor we too had both Upcoming events and Timeline. We think that Upcoming events is great in the Block drawer in courses. On the Dashboard the information in Timeline is better, but since it doesn't show events created in the Calendar it's really not good enough. And since we do think passed due dates should show on the dashboard is important (as long as the student can still submit) , we're kind of stuck with both Upcoming events and Timeline.

You can explore and install other course formats if you're not happy with the default ones ( https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=19 ). 2. You can use the 'description' feature in the resource/activity settings along with 'display description on course page' setting to make a description of the resource/activity appear on the homepage.",

It will get very crowded and confusing soon. Moodle is known for the \"Scroll of Death\" effect, and putting all the content directly on the course page will more or less directly lead to such an effect. From my experience, it makes sense to spent some time thinking about how you want to present the content to your users and how to deal with organizing all the content, as you will probably will have too much content for too less space. And if you're thinking about accessibility (the second topic of this forum), it absolutly makes no sense to put all the content on the course page. Users expect Moodle to work and act in a certain way, which is listing all activities and content on the (front) course page, providing all the details after following a link. Modifying this expected behavior is a sure way to unsettle your users.",

          "Title": "Accessibility change suggestions",
          "Text": "Hi, while working on a project, we discovered a few areas where accessibility could be improved: 1. File picker not accessible for users with voice input The file picker API has an accessibility issue. When choosing a file to upload , the label reads “Attachment” however the input that it describes reads “Choose File” This makes it difficult for users who use their voice to interact with websites. Therefore, the label and input text should read the same. 2. Filename in File Picker not accessible for screen readers The displayed name of the file that a user has picked for upload, is not accessible for screen readers. A consequence of this is that users who rely on screen readers cannot verify that they have picked the correct file. Therefore, I suggest that you add an element that allows screen readers to read the file name. 3. Filtering enrolled users is not intuitive When filtering on users for instance, the function is not intuitive to use. To improve accessibility, “First name” and “Surname” should as a minimum be semantic headers. To improve this further, renaming the labels to “Sort on First name” and “Sort on Surname” would also be appreciated. 4. Search input is inaccessible to screen readers When the message icon is clicked, a search input appears. This input does not have a label, which makes it inaccessible for screen readers, therefore such a label should be added. The helping text “Search people and messages” is also placed below the input, and is not linked to the input, meaning that screen reader users will discover the input too late and get confused. 5. No search result count for messages makes the site inaccessible When searching for users and messages, the number of found users is not displayed. This means that screen reader users have difficulties with getting an overview of the search. The count should be displayed and have the attribute role=”status” . 6. “New activity or resource” form is inaccessible to screen readers The highlighted icons under “Select files” do not have labels or attributes that enable screen readers to read what the buttons do. Add this to make the site more accessible.",

Is it still slow at times when there are few users logged in (e.g. very late at night).. However I suspect the number of users is not the problem. Take a look at this document https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Performance_FAQ Using the default Boost theme is a good place to start as it means your setup is close to what other people will be testing. Can you try moving from one page to another while looking at the browser console to confirm there are no javascript issues. See here https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console",

AFAICS they can appear side-by-side. I mean the icon is a left aligned image, no text saying what tool that is, rather the title the teacher gives to that activity appearing there.

We have created a custom course dropdown field to\nassign courses to different categories. We need to use that to enable learners\nto filter the courses listed in the Course Overview block on their dashboard and to enable category filtering on the My Courses page as well.\nSome learners might be added to 12 categories or more, with . So, we have ticked the  “Custom field” filter on the Course Overview\nblock’s settings. It looks like this also applies the changes to the My\nLearning page listing. The issue is with the display being broken – Here’s what\nI’ve found on both desktop and mobile: Desktop: On\nboth the card and list views the dropdown is not complete for users who have\nmany course categories. The items in the dropdown start from half-way down, no\nway of scrolling in it. In the example below, there should be 8 more items above the \"Public financial management...\" row in the filter, as the background code indicates as well. Mobile: Same issue of expanded\ndropdown list not starting with the first list option. So only the last few options\nare visible and selectable. Once the dropdown is tapped on to be expanded, only the last few\ncharacters of the longer titles are visible. See screenshot: I don't think it's something that we can fix via custom CSS ourselves. Any help would be appreciated as having a filterable my courses / course overview is very important for us. Thanks",

The MP4 file and VTT file both work in VLC, but when I upload them to Moodle; either the video plays with no subtitles, or the subtitles play with no vision. I followed all the directions that are in Moodle help. I tried numerous times, but have not got them working except partially on one attempt. (see below) I managed one upload where the vision and the subtitles worked, but the sound wouldn't play. I worked around this by making an MP3 version of the video sound in VLC and uploading it separately. I then added the MP3 to the video as a separate file and set it to automatically start with the video. The sync between the vision and the sound is slightly out, but it is the best I have been able to manage. Any suggestions on what might be wrong?",

This is simply a Cascading Style Sheet ( CSS ) layout property. You can also show/hide video, image, etc. using the HTML <details> tag. The following code uses the position:sticky property and the <details> tag, in order to stick and show/hide a video at the top of a quiz: \n```text\n<script src=\"https://\najax\n.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(\"div.que.description:eq(\n1\n)\").css({\n        \"position\": \"sticky\",\n        \"top\": \"49px\",\n        \"z-index\": \"10\",\n        \"background-color\": \"#f8f9fa\",\n        \"border\": \"1px solid #cad0d7\"\n    });\n    $(\"div.que.description:eq(\n1\n) .info\").hide();\n    $(\"div.que.description:eq(\n1\n) .formulation\").css({\n        \"background-color\": \"#f8f9fa\",\n        \"padding\": \"10px 0 0 0\",\n        \"margin\": \"0px\",\n    });\n    $(\"div.que.description:eq(\n1\n) .formulation .qtext\").css({\n        \"margin\": \"0px\",\n    });\n});\n</script>\n\n<details>\n    <summary style=\"color: #66f;\">\n        Show/hide video\n    </summary>\n    <div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa;\">\n        <video \nwidth=\"500\"\n controls=\"true\">\n            <source src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\nn2yvLChS92U\n\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\nn2yvLChS92U\n\n        </video>\n    </div>\n</details>\n```\n The Description question containing the above code is attached below in Moodle XML format. The code is placed in the HTML of a Description question, and the question is placed second in the quiz, after another Description question with normal content (it doesn't have to, it could be placed first or in any other position). Since the code counts items from 0, the index of the first Description question is 0 and that of the second, where the code is placed, is 1 as highlighted in the code above: The video is a YouTube video and only the YouTube video number needs to be specified as highlighted in the code above. The width of the video does not need to be specified if its default dimension is suitable. To have a video smaller or larger than the default dimension, just add width=\"xxx\" as highlighted in the code, where xxx is the width of the video in pixels. The height can also be specified, but if not, it will adjust automatically. The code works on desktop computers, Android phones, and probably most other devices.",

It's a very repetitive (boring) task, but something I think could be automated easily by someone with the knowledge and skill. It strikes me that someone who knew what they were doing could quite easily create a new item under \"Add an activity or resource\" maybe called \"Course Contents\" which does this automatically.

I'm no expert on Moodle, so it's highly likely I've missed something or misunderstood! I'm trying to make finding and accessing course content quick, easy and obvious. As standard, the Topic title is listed with just the titles of any Lessons in that Topic. This example has only one Lesson ; However, a lesson has multiple pages, which cannot be seen or accessed without opening the lesson, then either scrolling through it or using the \"Jump to\" drop down. This makes it awkward to find and access lesson pages. The student doesn't even know what the lesson pages are titled until they use the Jump to drop down. With the Contents page I have created, students can see on the first page of the course what is in each page of each lesson, and can go directly to that page to read it's content. This is impoprtant to us, as when someone is e.g. unsure how to make a child protection referral, they can find and go straight to the page titled \"How to make a child protection referral\" and see exactly what to do, rather than having to hunt through the lessons for the page they need.",

In your first graphic, you show a topic, \"What is Abuse,\" and then you apparently have around 20 lessons about this one topic (from what I can see). Perhaps each of these \"lessons\" is an activity contained within this topic. Because you might have many lessons for a topic, you are finding it helpful to begin a topic with an index to the lessons, and you want each index item to be a hyperlink to that lesson . (However, I assume the student could scroll down to the lesson and pick it.) For the way you have created your course, I can see some value to an index (or what you have called a \"course contents listing \" (perhaps more appropriately called a \"topic contents listing\"). In my WK04 graphic, this topic represents one chapter in the textbook. A chapter can contain 5 to 15 sections , but I don't see a need to list all these sections in Moodle since they are in the textbook. Instead, I provide a Course Calendar that shows what students should read each week.  The Course Calendar shows that most chapter sections are to be read and therefore, shows \"exceptions.\"",

If I've got this right, you are largely using Moodle to organise your student's access to existing third party resources. However, we are largely using Moodle to deliver original lesson/training materials which we have created within Moodle. We use the access/completion/hide settings available in Moodle to ensure students work through the whole course sequentially - it's not possible to skip a lesson or a quiz. However, once the course is completed, the \"Course Content Listing\" allows them to use the course as a reference document, just as your students can use their textbooks. Need to think about the name too - your suggestion is good, but a bit too comprehenesive, as this isn't intended to link to most of the possible activites/resources that can be placed in a topic (e.g. assignment/quiz/ download /etc). It's just for direct access to the actual educational content, which in our case is lessons.",

          "Text": "Hi Elizabeth, many thanks for your question. With the Brickfield Starter checks, the only way to stop it showing up in the report is to remove the “open in new window” option. We will update our starter language string appropriately in the next update. To provide some background, there are very few valid reasons for forcing a user into a new window and there are many reasons why you should not do so. I love one quote from the Nielsen Norman Group , or NN Group, an industry recognised World Leader in Research-Based User Experience, \"Opening up new browser windows is like a vacuum cleaner sales person who starts a visit by emptying an ashtray on the customer's carpet. \" Here are some reasons why you should not force links to open in new windows For everyone, bouncing people into another window is a surprise and not a good one (like a box of chocolates). This will further create problems for users with low sight or cognitive disabilities who may not see that a new tab has opened. Opening a new window or tab resets the back button in that window. Users with screen readers cannot go back to the page they came from. This breaks the navigation experience for that user. Whenever someone clicks a link they should be able to go back. The back button is a heavily used feature in browsers. If the person is using a terminal - they force one window only generally, so putting a link into a new window literally means they cannot navigate between windows/tabs and will either lose the existing site or not access the new link. Navigating multiple windows/tabs is a pretty horrible experience and can cause a lot of confusion on mobile devices - especially phones - this is not an experience you want to force on your users The core, starter version flags these issues for your action. With our Premium product , we have helpers that offer different ways to handle opening links in new windows. In short - let the user decide if they want to open a link in a new window or not - and perhaps add “(external site)” as text so they can tell if it’s external.",

          "Text": "I don't know that I'd call them issues but I think there is a need for a more flat way to navigate around. I'll record a video more fully explaining but in k12 and maybe corporate training, the navigation must be direct and guide or keep the user on track. The course homepage provides context and instruction on what needs to be completed (or should anyways). From there the student jumps into the content. We can keep them in the content with activity navigation or they can pop back to course homepage to see what needs to be completed next. The course index distracts from this process and guidance. At least, this is our initial thought. Once a user is done in a course they can exit to my courses or the dashboard for more upcoming due dates. As for blocks, we felt it might be best to try and keep access to those on the page and provide a bigger area to place blocks. That led to header and footer block panels. This puts all learning content and course navigation in plain view. We think this lowers the stress of having too much on the screen and helps guide the user into a path to access learning materials. If a user is guided, they don't feel confused or scared that they are not on the right location. They can feel this way if there are too many ways to end up at the same spot. Our new theme allows site admins to focus the learner on a path to access course content in a way that feels guided. Some longtime Moodle users might feel as though something is amiss because you are familiar and have formed pathways on how you access things in the site. New users do not have this. The LearnR theme provides a focused path that is more simple and easier to understand and doesn't allow shortcuts which new users find confusing.",

This has been a source of complaints for years with the front page tools like the Combo box. The NavDrawer was actually easier to use than the index is. The one really nice thing about it that it scrolls in synch with the topics scrolling. The real issue behind this is: it is hard for the student to get exactly where they need to be to do the work they need, either the activity they are currently working on or the very next thing they have to do.

We agree and think the actual course page can suffice as the main navigation because it actually provides the information students need to know which activity or topic they need to be in and working on. 2) As I mentioned also elsewhere I have worked with the RemUI theme for several years and it has this block drawer on the right. It is a source of support issues because Teachers will put important blocks there that students never see. I can confirm some users never ever knew there was a course drawer and when it disappeared they had no clue how to bring it back.  Kids simply didn't click on anything unless told by a teacher to do so if it was a link located outside of the normal activity area. 3) White space is wasted space unless it is actively clarifying navigation and content. We have no idea what user screens or monitors or visual needs may be. Narrow screens make for longer courses and more scrolling. Going from narrow to wide in an activity drove me nuts.  I couldn't predict which activity would display which way and certain ones I thought should have been full screen were not. 4) I will add another one we have discussed in the forums: removal of the Back to Top ability in the Topics format. This is closely related to the course index issue: the only way to get back to the top as a Student (since you don't have a secondary nav like Teachers do) is to scroll - is it easier to scroll the main topics view or easier to click into the course index and scroll there? Either way is too much work. This is on our list to bring back in the LearnR theme. I absolutely love the new topics course format.  I love the Dashboard and My Courses split.  I love the icons and other aspects of the pages.  The Primary and Secondary menus are amazing and so much more organized.  The more I use Moodle 4 without any drawers, the more I love the way it feels to use the tool.  It's predictable.  It's clean.  It makes sense with how I must navigate from course to course and activity to activity.  We won't get deep level input from our users until next year when we launch Moodle 4 in the fall.  Until then, I will be updating some Professional development training sites to Moodle 4 soon.  There is a lot to love about Moodle 4.",

The course I am building right now has six chapters, each having four to six sub-chapters. The sub-chapters in turn have three to four sections . The sections are where the resources and activities appear. I got the structure under control with the excellent https://moodle.org/plugins/format_multitopic plug-in. Here is the navigation menu as displayed in https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_rebel (1. Programming is a chapter, 1.1 Hello World! is a sub-chapter, 1.1a, 1.1b,.. are sections): The multitopic format brings a two-level \"tabbed\" (horizontal) navigation which I use most of the time. Still the left-side navigation is an enhancement, and not obstrusive since it is to be opened as closed as needed - at least in Rebel. Agree with the new title \"Redesigned Themes for Usability in Moodle 4.0\". We need Chris' theme factory!",

          "Text": "I ask the question, \"How does the student know what to complete in the course?\" That answer is not universal but the most obvious place to do so in Moodle is the course homepage whether by a forum announcement, a due date, context from the section a teacher has highlighted, completion data, or a mix of these. So, it would make sense that they go back to the course page for information on what needs to be done after completing an activity. I look at this navigation pathway like a football quarterback moving his team down the field. They execute a play(activity) and come back to the huddle for the next play and the next play until we score a touchdown and complete the course. The course index cannot call plays. It is like the head coach with the playbook. The playbook/course index is useful for the quarterback but not the players because the players are executing what's being called on the field. They do not know what will be next and they aren't particularly interested in just randomly running plays in their freetime. I do see the benefit of the course index for the teacher but I worry our students might not find it useful. Now I could be entirely wrong in this opinion. We won't know for sure until later this year. We might still include it if we see friction in moving about a course. To be fair, some courses might be incredibly long or layered. Maybe the course index is needed because it provides a simple list of everything in the topic/section for the user. However, a better course format could fix this. For instance, once you enter into an activity in a course you might expect to see a list of the section activities to the right of the page much like a table of contents. That list can contain the completion checkboxes and help guide the user through the topic/section. However, all of this distracts the user from executing the play and getting back to the huddle. I would consider this jumping from activity to activity like a \"hurry up offense\" at the end of the game. There is a reason teams don't run a hurry up offense without going to the huddle. The activity navigation could be a less obvious way to move about in a planned hurry up offense and is less distracting than my table of contents suggestion. I love the concept of the course index but it is too far removed from the individual activity and section with a bird's eye view of the entire course. I would propose the course index ONLY appear when working on an activity and be limited to only the items in the same topic. Generally, teachers move through a topic at a time. This might be useful and not overwhelming with everything in the course presented at once. It helps provide a slightly bigger view from where the student is in the course. I am in an activity but also here are the rest of the materials in that same general context. Now, to be honest I am not sure if it should be in the drawer or visible to the left of the content on the activity page. At full width, this is possible and might work. I guess I am saying there are lots of ways to navigate within a course that must be considered. Do I know best? Absolutely no. That's why the theme gives the flexibility to consider these scenarios and plan it out accordingly for your learners. I like the course index for me but I am unsure about student use at this time. My daughter instinctively used it but a case could be made that I was sitting next to her directing use. Internally, we are still working on our rostering plugin and once that is done we will be asking teachers to take a look and might present a few different looks with and without the course index to see which they prefer. We'd do this with students too. Our initial thinking is to strip this down to the bare minimum so that we can \"simplify\" the tool for staff who might say Moodle is complicated. A simple pathway like the huddle/quarterback does demystify how you get around inside a course in Moodle. It makes that part simple and easy to understand.",

          "Text": "I agree with all the Chris and Don says above, but also I do have my doubts along with Visvanath about the course topics being sufficient itself. I have been thinking about a good way to overcome all this and I think that having a sticky secondary nav bar for the student role could solve some of theses issues. A sticky student secondary nav always has a \"Course\" link to the main topic: the solves the Back to Top issue and also means you can finally remove the remnant of the breadcrumb from the new Activity page. Add Sections to the secondary nav: this is how the NavDrawer worked - the problem with that wasn't the section list per se, it was the way the it looks and works. Having a section list on the top pull down menu follows a menu convention we have had since the days of DOS (and before). Put both a Grades and a Progress item on the sticky menu and have them be controlled by the existing course level settings to Show grades / Enable completion tracking. A main progress report of completions is far more used than all the other \"Activity reports\". The little icons on the Course index and the Course topics indicators are good as were the old style checkboxes, but they are no substitute for a good report for Students which we have never really had. Most importantly, a dd a Menu item to go to the most recently used and/or completed activities . This can be done in the Recently accessed block on the Dashboard , but it should be in the course itself on the secondary nav, not in block hidden away in its drawer but somewhere always accessible, like a sticky secondary nav. After all, we know where users last were in each course in the mdl_block_recentlyaccesseditems table and we know what they have completed already too. And we know all the due dates of activities too. And if the Teacher has highlighted a section, put that in the menu too. What you want is a menu with a few options on it showing the key navigational points in the course. So - - Last thing I worked on not yet complete - Other last thing I worked on if still not complete - Last thing I completed - Item(s) with due date(s) real soon - Teacher highlighted section Put these in the course. Having them the dashboard is good. But in a course students need to navigate locally without leaving the course to use the Dashboard to go back in to the same course. And with the new Block drawer, as I mentioned is the case for RemUI users already, you can have no confidence at all the students will see or use blocks that may do such service. I think putting them on a stick secondary nav is the way to go. Students should not have to scroll to get to an activity they are working on or to the last activity you completion (presuming you will be doing the next one in order, which may or may not be true, but we can't read minds quite yet.) This idea is already a part of the functionality of some of the Dashboard blocks, but it should be in the course and the secondary nav is the place for that. The primary / secondary navs are one of the best features of 4.0 - I heartily applaud moving away from the NavDrawer - and they should really be used more. But they also need to be made more customisable by admins and teachers too who can make adjustments to the menus depending on how they and their organization use courses.",

We're using the assignment activity to have users upload documents and then have an assessor view the document and mark it.  In the course, the student can see whether they have yet to do an activity (it will be marked \"to do\") and whether they have completed an activity (so it's been marked).  It will show \"done\".  But is there anyway to show \"submitted\"? This is particularly relevant if they're using the app, so they can't access plugins like Completion Progress. Thanks for anyone's thoughts on this.",

To hide all the analysis information from the course page, one has to add the Accessibility Review block and use the view/hide button? Is there any way for the teacher to set specific warnings to be ignored? I do think the teachers would like to have the continous monitoring as an option, and most of them would prefer to mainly check the accessibility now and then.

          "Text": "Hi Karen, It was hard to find anything specific to TIles. But Moodle is WCAG compliant https://moodle.com/news/moodle-wcag-2-1-aa-accessibility-compliance/ Whilst I'm a novice user I tried out Jaws and NVDA, and after found I was able to navigate successfully. However, the modal windows could cause issues for those using screen magnifiers, or making it difficult to adjust the screen layout for those who might find it cognitively distracting, eg neurodiverse students. One thing I discovered is that a student can choose to turn off the animated navigation ie modal window in Tiles layout and Moodle becomes a traditional website with the whole page changing with each link clicked and minus the modal windows. This makes it more flexible for diverse learner needs. We are promoting this to students along with other hacks for inclusive Moodle use. If you happen to find any specific information please drop a reply here. Cheers, Justin",

Currently you can restrict access according to profile field criteria and the tile / resource / activity is still shown as greyed out. This leaves a cluttered looking page. Example My use case is for parents to manage access to resources for their children. (I don't create child accounts) Named certificates, quiz, results etc are duplicated in each instance according to how many children they have. If they have one child (as defined in their custom profile field) I want the Child 1 tile / resource / activity to display If they have two children (as defined in their custom profile field) I also want the Child 2 tile / resource / activity to display However, if they only have 1 Child, then I don't want the Child 2 tile / resource / activity to display. Or, if Child 2 has only been entered to take part in an activity, I don't want the Child 1 option to display. So is it possible to hide a tile / resource / activity by profile field or hide if restricted. Thank you",

I need help with reducing the size of my file-heavy Moodle courses, and at the same time simplifying the movement of course, with pdf files, to different Moodle instances.  None of the Moodle instances are in the Moodle Cloud . I assume that I would use the standard Moodle folders, but I am not sure of the process.  I manage the PD Moodle instance myself on the Bluehost site, so I can get to the filesystem through Cpanel. 1) How should I add files to the courses so that they are in external repositories that can be archives and reinstalled with standard Moodle processes in another Moodle instance? 2) What commands would I use to archive these external files so that they can be delivered with the mbz file? 3) What process would be involved to upload the mbz file in a different Moodle instance, and then make visible the folder containing the files associated with the mbz files?

So, I cannot add annotations etc and give this back to the student. When attempting to grade, an alert message pops up with: Cannot open the PDF. The file may be corrupt, or in an unsupported format. I have checked the ghostscript path on moodle and server - all looks fine /usr/bin/gs The proper file upload types have been selected.

          "Text": "In my university students can get \"reasonable accommodation\" e.g. for neurodiversity. One of the measures is to give them additional time on all activities where anything needs to be completed. On the quiz activity there is a way to deal with this and I e.g. put every participant who gets 50% additional time into a group \"half extra\" and that works fine. I would like this group override feature generalized so it can be applied to any activity that has any deadlines in it. The trickiest case I can think of right now is in the workshop activity where an override for the submission of a student A would need to cascade to an automatic override for any students B who is the evaluator for A. Ideally, that override for B would only be for those evaluations that have themselves been overridden not for the evaluation of submissions from a student C that does not have an override for their submission.",

Worst of all, the only reason for this change was \"The new page footer button is taking the spot where the back to top link is rendered now.\" Well, put it somewhere else then.

          "Text": "Hi, I would like to being able to edit the email-template on account\ncreation within moodle or through a plugin when I create users via bulk\ncsv upload . My use case also includes an automatic pdf creation with an enrolling certificate with the name of the new user. Currently I create new users for the new semester in 2 steps. I\nupload the names, email-adress etc to moodle via csv in the first step,\nin the second step I create pdfs for each student with his name in it\nand then send the respective pdf to each student via let's say\nthunderbird. This is time consuming, especially as after finishing this\nprocess I often receive additional student names and then have to go\nthrough all the process again. I'm aware that there's the string setnew_password_and_mail that can\nbe adapted within moodle to my own needs and which is then used in https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/lib/moodlelib.php but problem here is that it's not possible to include pdf creation and attatching to the email that is being sent out. If I manually add a single user within the moodle admin sites then\nthe normal standard mail should be sent as eg. in this moment I'm adding\na new teacher and not a student. (Teachers don't get the pdf). So my question is: Is this something you see a use case in moodle?\nWould this go into the moodle core or into a plugin? Would it be\nnecessary to adapt the core code so that a plugin can attach in this\npart of the code? I'm willing to make a pull request on github for this feature but first wanted to discuss this before starting to work in it. I asked this question already on the tracker ( MDL-74152 ) and it was suggested to open a discussion here for this topic. What do you think about my suggestion? Greetings",

Does anyone have any idea why it would behave this way when you're logged in as an admin. Moodle is running on an ec2 instance, and we've provided enough resources on the instance. And this issue wasn't always here. It just randomly started. Is there something specific about the admin account that would slow things down? I do get it has more functionality than the other accounts but doesn't make sense still. Is it a network/firewall thing? Is the admin account trying to connect to something that the firewall doesn't like? It's really hard to say what the issue is.",

User logs in gmail, then They use oauth2 to log into moodle, (so far so good). User enters a course that either embeds or links to an external web site that supports google authentication. When they click the google login, they have to type in their google username and password.  This is not Not the case if they go straight there by browser. At least that is my understanding as it is explained to me.  Can anyone shed some light on why this would be the case and is there any way to make it work?",

          "Text": "Hello, I've embeded some YouTube videos in a Moodle course, and for accessibility reasons I have been asked to provide a transcript of the videos so that those who can't view/listen to the video can read the transcript. If you view a video directly on YouTube.com, you can turn on closed captions and a transcript on the page. I've even been able to extract a subtitles file from it. However, I don't know how to get a nicely formatted transcript that is easy to read on its own. The only method I can think of right now is to painstakingly copy and paste raw text from the subtitles file into my course page, but that's impractical especially for longer videos. Can anyone suggest ways to more easily obtain a well-formatted and directly readable transcript from videos, including YouTube videos? Thanks!!🙏",

For simple filtering though, it adds a lot more clicking to achieve a result. Our most common use for a filter on the participants page is to identify students in the course. This was achieved with two clicks in 3.8 by selecting the filter drop down and then choosing 'Student'. In 3.9 this requires five clicks to achieve - Select the data filter field, select the 'Roles' data type, select the Roles input field, select Student, select Apply filters. It would be good to be able to set defaults for this filter so that a commonly used search was quickly available to users. For our site this would be Role/Students so a teacher wanting to just see the students in their course would only have to select Apply Filters. If they want any other search then they would go through the process as normal. I haven't been able to find any settings for this in Site Administration. Should I be able to set site defaults? Does this seem like a reasonable request?",

It is about the trade-off between more \"power\" and \"simpler.\" Moodle \"activities\" (e.g., quiz, forum) are very powerful and flexible. Along with this flexibility, there are many items that can be adjusted. What has been requested are \"templates\" that could be configured that capture your most favorite settings, and then can be applied as needed. So, we see the same thing with the Participants Filter. We now have a lot of power and flexibility, but it takes a little more to get everything set. It would be nice to have \"templates\" where one should set up their most favorite filtering criteria. I would like to see both. But until we have templates, I still favor having more features so that I can get to what I want to have.",

We'ld like to grant access to the same activity to all our groups but not at the same time. We don't want to hide the activity because this will hide it in the gradebook as well. But with many groups the information becomes pretty long. For the administrator this may be handy to get a quick overview: But also for him it might be better to only see these information when needed. Otherwise he has to scroll far down. But the student don't needs this information. It's enough for him when he sees that it's not greyed out anymore and the task block tells him he has to do the quizz now. The information for the student - on top - seems confusing because he only gets a selection of the requirements which totally hide the system behind the restriction: Maybe with a additional button like this: Or - as stated before - just with mouseover or click on the grey Restricted field. (In this case we have to inform out students about this new functionality). Best regards, Simon",

          "Text": "Hi all again, with the power of Google (which substituted PHP and CSS skills) I came up with a first solution. First I tried to solve it only with custom CSS because it could be implemented in a site easier than hacking some of the php files. I was able to get get a field that will be truncated if there are more than 3 rows and turn into a scrollable field. I used code from Handling Short And Long Content In CSS - Ahmad Shadeed (ishadeed.com) . But then the list items started to overlap and a scrollbar is less pretty than a spoiler (or even mouse over). But I realy like the <details> tag. I thought it will be much easier than hacking a CSS spoiler class. So I tackled the availability_info.mustace and added a <details> block there. Of course this first got attached to any restriction message. To apply it only when there (possibly many) restrictions I altered the renderer.php as well to check for a list element in the info text. This is the result: What files I edited: lib\\templates\\availability_info.mustache course\\renderer.php What did not work: adding a <details> block with ::before CSS because only plain text can be added checking if an class contains a list element (<ul>) because the :has() statement from CSS4 is not implemented in browsers yet creating and editing the availability_info.mustache in the boost theme folder editing the course\\format\\renderer.php Untried ideas: writing a CSS spoiler class and counting the rows of the box and toggle the visibility state of the element depending on its length (this way I we might don't have to touch the renderer.php) creating a child theme from boost and hopefully use a local availability_info.mustache Possible improvements deeper in the system: having a checkbox in the activity \"Restrict access\" area to toggle the usage of the <details> block manually instead of using it on all lists (no matter how long) Making the \"Click for details.\" text responsive to other language settings. This solution has not be checked if it will work in the mobile app as well. Best regards, Simon",

          "Text": "Hi all, I upgraded my Moodle site to https. Everything went smoothly as I followed the official documentation. Just one little bug that I could not understand: When using the admin account. After entering the username and the password and clicking on \"Connexion\". It downloads the logo instead of logging in and going to the dashboard , at first. When i click again to connect, I have a message idicating that i'm already connected and \"please disconnect if you want to login with another account\". When I cancel, it redirects me (FINALLY!) to the dashboard. So I assume the connexion request goes through but with some issues. When using other users (students accounts for example), the connexion goes through but give me a page with an error message \"error/moodle/invaliduserid\". Anyone had this same type of issue? Any idea on how to fix it? Here's my Moodle environement: Version: 3.10.1 Theme : Adaptable PHP Version: 7.3.27 DataBase ( MariaDB , MySQL , etc.) et version : My SQL 8.0.23",

They can be further customised on your site, as well. Please see the documentation on Language for the details. Any\ncontent you add to a Moodle site will be in whatever language the content is written or made with. Moodle does not translate or otherwise change the language of content you add.\nMoodle's language packs only change the wording for the standard\nnavigation and other included features.

This site is a support site about Moodle, which has communities in several languages. The forums on this site dedicated to certain languages are simply forums created for users to speak with one another in a particular language.

In fact, there is no guest access but authentication is always required. In the platform there are several courses with different methods of enrollment and some of these courses (regardless of the method of enrollment) should not be \"visible\" to external users, but only to internal ones. While those who authenticate manually (external) should only be able to see a defined set of courses. The web publication would then provide accessible courses, divided as follows: 1) Only to internal users 2) Internal and external users 3) External only A simple solution would be to use two different platforms, but it would become challenging to manage the content...",

I know logistically how to do this - in our passed activity feedback put the image and link to the \"next\" activity, in the \"failed activity feedback\" put the try again and in both put the \"return to course\" button. My question is if there is a way to automate the URL 's so that if we move the course or make a new version of the course we won't be required to go in an change each individual link. Example - instead of using the exact url for the next activity www.mysite.com/activity47 There is a way to access the url for the \"next activity\" from a moodle shortcode - so no matter where that activity goes - the \"next activity URL\" will go to the next activity in the course. Any ideas there?",

Also, multiple select is missing in this case . It would be so helpful to be able to select multiple activities that need to be moved together to a new place in the course. If I now create three new activities (belonging together, about the same subject, e.g. a document, an exercise and a quiz) they all appear at the bottom.

Not all students are at the same point in a course. Some students not grasping a specific something asks me via a forum for extra info, I develop a new activity (for example for student self assessment) based on their questions, and it is pertaining a topic smack bang in the middle of those 166 already present.

You would need to add a link to that course or add some kind of information about it. to create an H5P resource and add it to all the courses. This would need some time in the beginning, but it looks nicer and every update that you make in the original H5P activity will revert to all the places where the H5P activity is added.

One of the key things we want to share from a 'master' is an html form. I will continue to investigate though. Many thanks for your thoughts.",

Sometimes we need to switch the order in which topics within a section are taught, and then we need to move around several activities pertaining to the same subject/topic (e.g. a document + an exercise + a quiz) - I cannot select multiple activities within a section to set them all together to \"invisible\" / \"visible. I need to do this one by one .... - I cannot select multiple filters when grading an assignment. I want to be able to see the submissions for multiple (but not all) groups. And groupings do not appear in the drop down list to filter the submitted assignments - I cannot select multiple filters when dealing with the participants list. I want a list of all students that do not yet belong to a group AND have the status active. It simply is not possible to filter out that list. - I cannot select multiple groups or roles or activities in the reporting function of Moodle. And my list goes on ... If I had a penny for every time a multiple select would have saved me time in managing my courses, I would be rich ... It would improve usability so much if multiple select were possible in all cases (and more) mentioned above.",

We inform our students on quiz Intro screen - skip the “submit answers” screen - users thought they had completed the quiz and left Things I want to do - if anyone have any ideas on these please share! -- change the “next page” button to an arrow icon - change the font style for “submit attempt” to draw attention to that action - this is a general rant that I think the next big step will be for moodle to allow educators to simplify the UI more easily as all of the options are amazing and allow for the wonderful robust platforms but can be confusing for students and overwhelming for educators.",

Due to the fact that this activity must be available in three languages (The Confederation of Switzerland gurantees 4 languages whereof 3 are regularly spoken), the field for the question is too short. Only 255 are allowded. When I must mark the start and the end of each languages I need 29 digits already. For three languages I lose 87 digits. The remaining 168 digits are faraway from sufficient since I would need space for 3 questions (one in each language). Recommendation: Please replace the too short \"line\" for the question with a \"text field\". Furthermore I would appreciate it, when I could design the text of the question also (bold, character, underline,...). Thank you very much. With faithfully, Stephan",

I'm not sure if anyone has any experience they want to share for user onboarding and especially in language learning situations.  This will be a blended experience so we do have teachers to guide students (but not 24 hours a day and on demand) so we are trying to get as close as possible to a cross language - self explained tutorial system to sit at the top of our dashboard. I am imagining an \"iframe\" or some kind of interactive HTML box where a user can click their flag and then the tutorial will start in that language.  Anyone have any ideas ?

The Course Section page for this unit of work is going to be very, very long. To assist students I have created labels separating each week's work. The labels will assist students finding the start of each new topic when scrolling down quickly - simply but effective. I would prefer to add a set of buttons at the top of the Course Section which will navigate to the labels I have created throughout the Course Section. At the moment my tests have proved that I can link to the Lesson but unfortunately it opens the Lesson rather than staying on the Course Section page. I would prefer to navigate (like a HTML bookmark) to the label. The label appears to have an id - can I use this id? I tried inserting a bookmark id in the HTML label code but this strategy did not seem to work - well at least I could not seem to make it work properly. We are using the latest version of Moodle, and I am just a teacher/creator - so I have limited access and knowledge of what happens outside this role. Hope someone knows how to solve my navigation problem or give me alternate ideas.",

This is in the meantime an Accesibility regulation in Germany and I can't seem to find a fast way to make this happen automatically. The content \"Link zum Google\" is linked and it only shows it's one when I go with the mouse over it.

Some of this might depend upon your theme, but in general, Moodle shows all topics on one web page (with the Boost theme.) So topics do not have their own (HTML) anchors. They are already all showing. So the user is expected to simply scroll down to whichever topic they want to view. You might notice that if you click on a link within a topic, such as a quiz, that in Moodle's breadcrumbs you see the topic, but it is not a hyperlink. This is because clicking on the Course's hyperlink gets you to all topics. Having said this, maybe someone else will know about some other solution.",

As soon as I move the section up or down, everything gets completely garbled as all the section links are renumbered from \"....#section-1\" to \"....#section-2\". All links to these section now are misleading now as they do not point to the original sections any more. I have a large number of topics, all collected in a single course. From other courses, I would like to persistently link to section od this 'summary' course. This is no normal teaching stuff, but a research project. It really makes sense in our context to have all sections in one course. Theses sections then are arranged in individual collections of sections inside another course or section, so that a part or all of the sessions can be rearranged inside other courses. As soon as a new section is placed in the summary course and moved to the correct position, all links to sections now link to other sections in the summary course. Is there a way to make these links persistent? Thanks in advance for an answer. Ulrich Hauser-Ehninger",

          "Title": "Improve usability on notifications preferences",
          "Text": "Hi all! I've created an issue to work on having a better notifications preferences interface. IMO the current interface is difficult to understand and also it has too much switches. That's why I opened the issue MDL-67508 . I will try to explain here the improvement again. Notification center Right now we have some notifications plug-ins, including: Web, Mobile, e-mail, Jabber (that IMO, can be removed from core), and 3rd party. The web plugin implies \"receiving\" the notifications in the bell drawer and also the notifications tab on the Moodle App. With my improvement we could remove the web plugin and make a greater hierarchy to enable disable notification per type. This is, if I enable \"Assignment submission\" notification I can then configure if I want to receive it by e-mail or mobile (or 3rd party). But it will also imply to always receive it on t he notification drawer on mobile and web. If I disable it then no notification of this category is receive it. This converts the notification drawer into a notification history / center. So all notifications are received there and then on other places. But you have all the notifications in one place at least. Disable by plugin Enable/disable by plug-in. If enabled, you can configure notification by notification of the plugin, if disabled the user will know that they would not receive any notification via this plugin (ie. e-mail). Remove Online/Offline Right now, If I'm not wrong, the system calculates that the user is online or offline like in the \"Online users block\". So it checks if an action is done in the last 5 minutes (admin can configure time). Having those settings the user has too many switches and it's difficult to understand. If the user goes away and don't close the session, the notifications send on the next 5 minutes can be lost if the user only receive them when Offline. I suggest to remove that or, at least have a 3 state option On/Offline only/Off. But I think it's better On/Off and that's it. With this improvement: Issues about lost notifications can be reduced. All notifications are in one place. It's easier to change and understand what's going on. Mobile will display the notifications even if disabled on Mobile. (also the name of the plug-in has an issue). This is a mock-up on how it could look like. Facebook works that way, this is the screenshot of an example of one notification category called Events. The \"Allow Notifications on Facebook\" is that greater hierarchy I was talking of, if disabled, nothing bellow is shown. I want to know what do you think and get your vote/comments on the issue. Thank you for your time!!",

Thank you very much. And, I don't really want to comment in detail on your proposal (though from a quick look, there is lots to like about it). I just want to make sure you are aware of one important requirement (well, important for the Open University) that it would be good if you did not break. At the OU, we have a custom message plugin, which sends messages through the University's custom messaging system. This ultimately sends an email to the student, but it also puts a copy of the message on the student's portal page, and support staff can check that. The point is to eliminate the excuse 'you never told me that' from students. We can prove that we sent them a message, and they had a chance to see it. So, for 'important' messages, we want to ensure that they are sent through that plugin, and that they can't be turned off. But we also don't want students to be able to select that plugin for any other messages. That is why, in addition to the individual user's perference page, where they can set their persona preferences, there is also an admin settings page at Admin -> Messaging -> Notification settings. (Yes, this UI also sucks, in part because it has to match the UI of the user preferences page, but at least only admins suffer because of this one.) So, anyway, whatever solution you finally come up with, please consider this requirement. I think that becuase the two pages are related, it is natural to consider them together.",

          "Text": "Hi Rick, Most of our students are enrolled in more than one course. The desire to divert users to a customised start page is motivated by at least two main factors: 1. the lack of flexibility of the Dashboard / Site Home The more I think about it, the more surprised I am that it's currently not possible to land on a standard course page as a front page. This is the first page users encounter - especially new users - so it should be able to be customised extensively so it's welcoming, informative and a useful jumping off point to the content they need. Standard course pages provide just this capability - in contrast to the Dashboard or Site Home. For example, for the Dashboard and Site Home, without resorting to extra css or adapting code... a. some blocks can only be set to the right column and there is no built-in support for setting  columns or font size; not all blocks can be set to the centre area b. blocks available on the Dashboard or Site Home are not universally available on other pages; if they are, they can't always be placed in the centre area (; so for a block showing enrolled pages for a long term user, this ends up being a block that runs down the right margin past any existing centre content) c. if we want a list of enrolled pages that is condensed to just the links and in a small font, this is only available in user's menu > profile > course details The equivalent to this user menu list on the Site Home or Dashboard is the Course Overview. This uses space by displaying info we don't need: in the old Course Overview this was tiles; in the newer version, using the List option, this is category and completion level. 2. the variety of our user groups Our site is used as both a LMS and a staff intranet. Feedback from our users included the complaint that it wasn't clear once they'd logged in where to go to access the info they needed, and that there was info shown that wasn't relevant to them. For new users, this problem is worsened by unfamiliarity with the interface. Options available in the Dashboard or Site Home don't allow easy customising of content for these user groups: t ailoring access to individual items of content is possible by role in Site Home and Dashboard. So to use this option we'd need to create a role for each user group that would only be used on either of these two pages, and then assign each new user to one of these roles in the system context . We have around 75 user groups for 2020, not accounting for students who are in second or third years of study. Users can belong to more than one group at a time. Also, some of our students are enrolled in courses that last only a few days. So they don't have as much opportunity to get used to finding what they need. These students can be pretty much any age. Thanks, Andrew",

There are some types of sites where you want to have a single, central place for users to land, a place over which you have a lot of control. Right now, the only object that could do this is a course. In business sites, having a single course into which all users are enrolled which serves as a general 'hub\" or \"commons\" like course for all users is pretty common. I've built any number of sites like that, and the usual solution to this is to have a link on the real front page that users click to go to the hub course. Being able to automatically redirect would be very useful in such cases. (I usually add one of the auto-enrol plugins to help with this.) +1 and voted up. Randy",

This seems inconsistent with the way everything else in the course is done. Why can't the teacher delete individual announcements, whenever the teacher wants to do so? Maybe the teacher realizes, the next day, that an announcement was made in error. Why must you delete the entire thing, to delete one message? According to the Moodle, Announcements can be restored by setting the number of announcement to non-zero. In my experience: this does not seem to work. Why is the maximum number of Announcements set to ten? Is this way to convey, possible critical, information, prominent enough? I suspect a lot of people will just ignore the Announcement sections . If you have an announcement like: \"The site will be going down in 20 minutes.\" Shouldn't that be more like a billboard across the top the course, instead of some dropdown list?",

I desperately need to get this issue functionality working, as staff are unable to play videos in clinical areas with audio narratives on them.  Closed Captioning / Subtitles would fix the problem.

It has been fascinating: so many plugins and stuff to add to my production site. However, due to the peculiar nature of my installation (where I am hopeful of setting up multiple course categories that would have similar courses), I am finding it very stressful to be \"manually\" re-creating the sub-categories tree structure for every new category that I am setting up (before I use the upload courses with the template_courses feature to copy the associated courses) and it is not funny at all, when the no of categories in question is already easily numbering over 250. So, I stumbled upon a solution that apparently worked in a previous version of moodle, but it is not working in moodle 3.83+ (uploadcoursecategory-compat-moodle3.x.zip by Piers Harding that is supposed to be compatible with Moodle 3.x). When I try to upload this file (Upload_Categories.txt), it gives this error (the screenshot below): So, can someone pls help me to check out this plugin and make the necessary corrections to get it working with moodle 3.83+.

Teachers dont know where the Turn Editing Button is and the Action Menu has too many options. Asked this question by every new user and on multiple occasions. 2. Teachers want to be able to drag Resources and Activities into a Folder. (In other words, they would like a subpage, only the subpage plugin does not work.) I am asked this question on a weekly basis!! 3. Teachers want to be able to add Sections to Courses running in Single Section per page mode. An example of this is the Grid Format. I have noted that the new Multi-topic format accomplishes this and is very good, but so many of my teachers enjoy the look of the Grid Format, it will be difficult changing them to a format that looks entirely different.",

I know as a teacher you can access gradebook from the course admin block. However it seems to be lengthy to navigate there... Also I know students can access their grades from the upper right corner of the User menu, but again it is \"far\" from the course.

Then over time, some bulk tools were added internally for those without such external SIS systems (like small schools, not-for-profits, organizations, businesses.) Standard competency sets are large and have always been large. So, it is has been a bit of a mystery why this was not a base requirement of the feature set from the start for competencies to have tools for managing large numbers of items in the UI. The LMS is the logical place to do this, too.",

Here's the scenario. I have a catalog of courses that each be taken standalone at-will. We'll call them A,B, C, ... Z. I'll be creating a certification course that requires completing A, C, D, N, and X. Then there will another certification course that uses A, C, F, P, and X. In the system being used now, I can create the cert course by doing a \"copy by reference,\" whereby the standalone course are \"copied\" into the cert course (sort of like each required standalone course becomes a lesson in the new course). The learner enrolls in the cert course and is automatically presented all the courses required. In addition, if the learner takes one of the standalone courses that's used in a cert course, and then later enrolls in the cert course, it automatically shows credit received for the standalone course(s) already completed. I track the cert course only, meaning I don't want to have to figure out if learners have taken the individual courses that comprise the cert course. Is this possible in Moodle? If so, what is this feature called (what do I look up to read up on it)?",

One possibility for all students at one time, set the quiz to Open at some future date, then remove the Open date when you are ready for the students to take the quiz. Another for all students at one time, use a quiz password and don't give it out until time to take the quiz. One possibility that will work for one student at a time. Set the Group mode for the quiz to separate groups, then add each student as you want them to be able to take the test. You can also add a Restriction requiring students to be in a certain group and then add each student as you want them to be able to take the test. There are other restrictions that could also be used.",

          "Text": "Ik gebruikte bij het maken van vragen in Moodle de scriptags met CDATA om zelfgemaakte grafieken in te voegen bij het aanmaken van vragen . In de vraag werd dan aan de hand van de de door Moodle gegeneerde variabelen bv automatisch het bijbehorende grafiekje gemaakt. Dat gaat allemaal prima maar ja ik moest iedere keer heel veel code in scripttags zetten bij de vraag. Dat is niet handig en natuurlijk ook niet gewenst. Maar ja om de js code te testen wel handig. De code om grafieken te tekenen is nu verder uitgebreid en zou het mogelijk moeten maken on studenten meer interactief te laten oefenen. De grafieken worden met svg gemaakt en dat werkt allemaal prima. Na heel veel lezen en ik bedoel echt heel veel lezen in de niet heel veel van didaktiek gespeende documentatie ben ik gekomen tot het volgende: Ik kan nu AMD modules maken. Ik heb mij door NodeJS,nvm,npm,grunt en noem het maar op heengeworsteld en kan nu src files builden minifyen etc. En nu komt het. Ik wil een vraag in moodle toevoegen en in plaats van de JS code in de vraag onder script tags te zetten de amd modules gebruiken. En toen stond ik weer bij het volgende probleem. Hoe doe ik dat? Weer maar heel veel lezen maar het blijft wazig en ik kom er niet uit. Ik zie dat er heel veel met php kan worden geinitialiseerd maar ook hier weer heel onduidelijk alom. Je moet dan bijvoorbeeld require gebruiken noemt het maar op maar waar(en voornamelijk waarom) dat moet staat er dan weer niet bij Dit alles hoefde ik niet te doen toen ik met de script tags werkte. Een ander voorbeeld dat ik kon maken was een kleine applicatie voor een frequentieregelaar. De browserpagina met script tags werkt prima maar hoe nu met AMD en Moodle. Ik krijg er hoofdpijn van. Er zijn adviezen die zeggen lees de manual, nou dat heb ik gedaan maar ik mis schijnbaar iets en weet niet wat dat is. Ik baal als een stekker want dit schiet niet op. leerlingen zouden lekker aan de knopjes moeten kunnen draaien zoals ik dat ook kan in mijn browser kan zonder Moodle. Ze zien bijvoorbeeld gelijk wat het effect is op de koppeltoerenkromme van de motor. De vraag is dus heel concreet. Hoe kan ik bij het aanmaken van quizvragen of gewone paginas in plaats met scripttags AMD modules laden? In hoeverre heb ik bij deze werkwijze met AMD de systeem(beheerder) van school nodig in Moodle?. Opm. Ik heb lokaal een eigen moodle omgeving draaien dus kan wel alles uitproberen. Ik hoop dat iemand mij kan en wil helpen dit op te lossen. vr gr.  Guppie",

But what I meant is, if I am going to upload an assignment that was finished a different day than the submission date...can that be accomplished? For instance, I have an assignment, where I must load a certificate of completion of an instructor led training taken outside the organisation. (My moodle website is not published to the internet.) Therefore, I may be taking and finishing that course possibly prior the date it will be marked as completed in my moodle site, if I upload the certificate a few days later after I return from my outside training. I am looking for ways to have that submission marked in the system as completed the day I took the training (it can be a few days earlier), not the day I submit the certificate in the assignment. Thanks in advance J.G.",

For instance, lets say my students may be taking an instructor led CPR training this week, in an outside classroom and they are awarded the certificate of completion today.. but, they can only load the certificate of completion on my moodle website when back tomorrow. The assignment, will mark the submission date as Tomorrow, when technically, they completed training today. Perhaps a pluggin can do this? Thank you very much, and I am sorry for the hassles.",

Clearly, how it should work is: When you get to the warning time, then the pop-up appears at present. And, if you click Extend session before it fully expires, then that also works like it does now. However (and this is the new bit) if you actually get to the time when the session expires, then the contents of the dialogue should automatically change to say that your session has expired. That could give two options, 'Log in again', or, if you have unsaved data on the current page (which, since we have form-change-checker, we can know with some convidence) there should be a 'Close dialogue' button, so you can copy-and-paste any data you want to save before you log in.

There are also many types of activities they need to complete. It would be helpful if the names of students locked in place on the left when scrolling across the activities, and if the scroll bar at the bottom was set so that you didn't have to go all the way to the bottom of the page to scroll to the right. The problem I have is trying to track who is actually doing what without printing the report on an Excel spreadsheet.  Many times I've had to count down the lines to determine where the student is on the report, and then go to the bottom of the report to scroll across to see what they still need to complete.  When I reach the far right I then have to count down the rows to assure I've got the right person. It's somewhat easier if I pull out a small number of student, for example last name beginning with \"A\", but if the name begins with \"S\" it becomes a lot harder as there are so many of them.

The pdf feedpack plugin for assign does generated a compressed or reduced resolution image that is substantially smaller than the original. To do see this set up assignment where students upload a full scale image and enable pdf feedback under the feedback options in the setting. The image converter needs to be set by the admin and ghostscript installed for it to work correctly. When the teacher grades the assignment an image is generated for the teacher to see and to mark with annotations. The image is reduced from the original resolution. You can right click the image and select 'View background image' to download the png image. I uploaded a 4M jpeg image file and downloaded a 825K png file. The ghostscript options in edit pdf plugin could be changed to give a better result. Unfortunately, the file converter is difficult for most admins to set up or they do not do it for various reasons, but it actually performs some very useful functions.",

This can be done in the form of a drop-down list or enter values in the form field manually. Now this task is not the main thing for me. Currently, I see 3 ways to solve this task. 1) At the moment, my main task is to find the optimal solution for inserting the image processing function through ImageMagick, which works only through the file entry and exit procedure. Otherwise, you can restart the server ’s central processor, which may slow down the kernel moodle. In order not to overload the server’s CPU during mass processing of photo files, which may lead to a slowdown in the moodle core performance. I don’t want to make changes to the moodle kernel code either. Otherwise, every time after updating the kernel of the system, me will have to make additional code changes every time. 2) At the time of the formation of the pdf document when creating a temporary png file from the original downloaded photo file - at this moment can add the ImageMagick function to optimize the photo according to the parameters set in advance. In the work of this procedure there will be no mass load on the central processor of the server until the teacher opens the desired original file through the \"grade\" tool. 3) The next version of the tool is related to photo optimization. Need to create a new script separate from moodlethat will work only in a specific moodeldata directory and process the newly created graphics extension files in it. Now the main thing is to decide on the right decision on choosing the optimal path.",

For example, if you want a student to upload a pdf file, the student's pdf file might be 10MB in size, whereas if one were to compress it, it would be only 15KB. A dramatic difference. Same thing for videos, audio, even PowerPoints and Word files. I do like Daniels's suggestion to have a built-in link to some kind of File Converter.  This is an interesting approach. It may be a little difficult to expect Moodle to have build-in filesize optimizers for all of these various formats. Maybe someday. But until that day, the best thing that I have found is to try to explain to students how to reduce the size of media. For example, in my \"Introduce Yourself\" forum, I tell students that they can upload pictures, but to try to keep their pictures to 400x400 pixels. Do they listen? (Ans: No. I have yet to show them the easiest universal way to do this.)",

A new repository plugin might also be made that would of compressed versions the users Private files. Actually I think there must already be (or one time were) ways of doing the with existing repository plugins (Flickr, Picasso, Gdocs etc.).  For example users can upload a file to G Drive, manipulate it with Docs tools, and then use plugin integration to insert the content in any activity.

The content on the quiz is basic university based information.  The way is currently works is they are a guest in the class. they take the quiz and their role is changed to student. As a guest they do not have access to the course material, it just holds them in the participant list. and adds to class to their class list.

I need to know to what extent Moodle is usable in Arabic. I saw that 72% of Moodle has been translated into an Arabic language pack, but what does this mean? How much of Moodle will a user be unable to use because of that remaining 28% that is not available? Also, on language packs, will a separate deployment be required for every language pack? Or will users be able to simply select their language and see a different language version of the deployment? Are language packs available in Moodle Cloud ?",

Moodle has many features, most of which you won't use. And most features have obscure error messages. 72% of all strings translates can easily be 99.9% of strings anyone ever sees translated. If you hit an un-translated string that is really important for your Moodle site, you can immediately fix it in your own site using Language customisation - so you won't be stuck waiting for someone else to translate it. And, translating Moodle is a colaborative effort, so as well as fixing the translations yourself, you can contribute them back to the main project at https://lang.moodle.org/ . Regarding how this is all configured, and how it looks to users, the best thing is to get a test site, and experiment for yourself. You can start experimenting at the demo site https://qa.moodledemo.net/ which seems to have lots of languages installed. You can also read the docs at Language settings .",

The gradebook (having several rows and headings before the grades) is much more complex than the activity completion report (which has only 1 row/heading before the checkboxes). I was able to get somewhat there but it all depends on how your gradebook is structured. So.... I'd suggest opening an Improvement Suggestion tracker ( https://tracker.moodle.org/ ) so the professionals can weigh in with their thoughts.",

          "Text": "Garth, I hear you. However, the problem might be that since the nature of this resource (i.e, the grade book \"spreadsheet\") one could ask is it better to scroll left, or down?  If we flip the grade item titles 90 degrees, and the title is long, then I would have to scroll down to see all the students.  So I am not sure which is better. It is interesting that some years ago, Blackboard (or maybe it was D2L) had a decent solution.  Each grade book item had both a regular name and a \" short name .\"  In the grade book, the short name was used.  (From what I can tell, the current Canvas method is a bit strange because the width of each column has a lot of dead space, maybe 35%-45%. See below.) So, this idea of each activity having both a short name and regular name might be an approach to fixing the grade book display problem.  However, one more \"field\" of information would need to be entered, or an auto-abbreviation method employed.  I sense that this concept would take some serious thinking about the best way to implement it.  Of course, there would probably need to be another setting for the grade book \"Display short name (Y)?\" A possible quick fix might be a grade book setting that says \"Rotate titles 90 degrees (N)?\"",

Students and Teachers should not be able to message each other (or be discoverable to each other), but communication between all other levels should be possible. This may seem a little strange but we have many students who are children and so the 'student' in Moodle is actually the parent, so we need to ensure the parents communicate with the relevant Head of Studies, rather than directly with the teacher. We have had messaging turned off since implementation as I suspect the permissions don't currently allow for this setup but if anyone can suggest a way I can achieve this it would be much appreciated.

          "Text": "I guess this is the place to find helpful usability people who might like a challenge. It seems that, for a significant minority of users, it is not obvious how to do step 2 of the following: They already have 20 questions in the question bank. They want to create a quiz that give 10 different questions picked at random for each student. (Here is the latest request for help in the forum: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=395272 , but we get this question every so often.) I am not going to explain how it should work here, because some of you usability folks might not know yet, and you can try it for yourself, and see if you can work at the UI. (If you want to know, you can look it up in the docs on the 'Building quiz' page). If you do want to try it, then the easiest way conduct a usability test yourself is: Go to https://qa.moodledemo.net/course/view.php?id=2 . Log in as teacher. Turn editing on. Add a quiz (you only need to type a name. You can ignore the rest of the form). Then you are ready to try to perform the actual task: you want the quiz to ask each student 5 questions at random from the 'Default for QE' category that already exists in the question bank and contains 10 questions. As I already said, from the sequence of questions people ask in the Quiz forum when they can't work out how to do this, I know there is a usability problem here (although once you know how to do it, the interface is quite easy to use, flexible and efficient.) I have never been able to think of a good way to change the UI to make things better, so I thought I woudl ask here, and hope that someone could think of some good ideas. Thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Tim, It seems the 'Add' functionality is quite well hidden, as it doesn't really appear in a position on the page where it's actually making sense. When reading LTR direction, one would expect to have the button / menu on the left or center bit of the page. All in all, if there are no questions associated with the quiz, the prompt to start adding or creating questions should be more visible. Maybe an overhaul of the add questions process is in place. Now, there's an Edit quiz button that only displays when there are no questions in the quiz. IMHO that's one click too many, to get to the question management bit of the quiz. Then, when arriving there, it's not clear where to click to start adding questions. Renaming the 'Edit quiz' button to 'Manage quiz questions' would make sense, as does adding a more user oriented and bigger 'Add question' button. I'm not a UX engineer, but I agree with you that working with quiz and question bank would benefit substantially from improvement.",

So I don't think it's primarily a usability issue on the level of \"make the add-question-button bigger\" but instead a bigger usability challenge of the whole quiz creation workflow. Isn't it the same lack of understanding that also results in issues of redundantly imported questions sets and resulting unwanted duplicates within the same course? I know, this doesn't make it any easier, but I think a usability discussion of how to make this kind of multi-stage quiz creation workflows (e.g. import/create questions, create quiz, select and shuffle automated questions, solve quiz, grade quiz, etc.) visible in a comprehensive overview within Moodle would be highly appreciated!",

          "Text": "My experience comes from working with the other three \"big\" LMSs (BCD.) Moodle is the only LMS that provides this centralized \"quiz question database \" perspective. So I think that Benjamin is thinking correctly, that perhaps to effectively use a \" database \" of questions one has to think a little differently. In the other LMSs, it is more common to create quiz questions from within a course. BB did (I am unsure about Ultra) provide \"pools,\" but they were a bit awkwardly implemented. In none of these other LMSs could you change (improve) a question in a central location and have it immediately be correct in every course using it! So, not everyone understands this. Even my \"Business Analytics\" department chair doesn't understand that Moodle's question database is conceptually quite different than C's quiz engine. Tim, the problem that we might be facing is that Moodle allows questions to be created in either the database or at the quiz level. If one is doing this from a quiz, it is hard to think about how to add 20 questions to a quiz, and then have only 10 of them randomly show. In fact, I don't know how to do this, which is why I tell folks to add the 20 questions to the database first, and then in the quiz pick 10 of these randomly. This could be one source of confusion. Some instructors just want to quickly go into a quiz and do everything. Learning how to add questions to the question bank takes time. Additionally, question categories have to be properly used.",

In terms of the particular issue I want to talk about here. Can I just make it clear that if you want to suggest something that has a chance of being implemented in the near future, it needs to be a small incremental change that just makes the current UI a bit better.

Hugo, I believe that what you are saying is that you change the \"Edit quiz\" button to \"Manage questions.\" This is one screen where perhaps some simple changes can be made. The message \"No questions have been added yet\" is correct. However, clicking on \"Edit quiz\" does more. It not only allows one to edit or manage questions, it also allows one to set up \"overall quiz points,\" it provides a way to page-break questions with headings, change points for each question, and shuffle questions. So, maybe \"Edit quiz\" is better than \"Manage questions.\"  I kind of like \"Edit quiz,\" and like that this exact same wording is what appears on the \"gear\" icon dropdown. Maybe a better button wording should be \"Edit quiz and manage questions.\" But this becomes a long button. Instead of the current wording \"No questions have been added yet,\" maybe this can be improved.  For example: \"By clicking on the Edit quiz button below, you will be able to manage questions (create new, add from the question bank, pick questions randomly from the question bank, remove, and order), change their points, shuffle questions, and add pagination and section headings.  For more information, see the \" Moodle Docs for this page.  Although you can create new questions in Edit quiz mode, a better-recommended approach is to first add questions in the question bank, which provides better question organization, and then add them to your quiz. When on the \"Edit Quiz\" page, use the \"gear\" icon to quickly get to the question bank. \" There seems to be space for a long paragraph like this one, and in my Boost theme, it shows in a \"red\" box. Well, you get the idea.  This paragraph needs some wordsmithing.  Sometimes people don't see the \"Moodle Docs for this page\" link at the bottom, so maybe having redundant links to the Moodle Docs in the above paragraph would be helpful.  Also, a link to some videos, in this paragraph, could be helpful since creating quizzes is a bit technical. For reference, I will include a screenshot of this quiz containing a few questions.  One point of confusion could be that \"Total of points\" shows 2.00, yet Maximum grade shows 10.  I don't know if this is a source of confusion.  I think what this is really showing that the questions, as created, were established to be 1 point each.  There are two questions, each worth 1 point, which totals to 2 points.  However, this \"2 points\" will be converted to a scale of 0 to 10 for this grade book item.\"  In other words \"Maximum grade\" really means \"Maximum grade book item grade.\"",

From 3.9 onwards (May 2020), the intention is to have a separate 'copy course' functionality. When you copy a course through the import functionality, you can set an end date or completion date on the old course, have it accessible for reference only.

Does anyone have any suggestions, has this progressed further since 2015? here is Casey original post Hello All, I love Moodle and I do love the badge function. However, our training department does training that need to be repeated every 2 years. For example the CPR and First Aid class is held every week of the year. Students are required to take this course every 2 years. I thought the best solution was to award a badge that expires after two years. It works great but there is no functionality to send out periodic emails when the badge gets close to expiring. Is there a way to do this? If i had to develop this myself where would be the best place to start?",

At the point of completion this issues a badge that expires after a period of time (5 Minutes) and access to the re-accreditation quiz then became available. The student test account can then do the re-accreditation . Results The same badge cannot be issued twice even if it has expired (expiry is not reset) Issued badges, even if expired, are perpetual The initial e-learning is still available but re completing this does not reissue a badge. I cannot see a logical process that would look at badge expiry to issue subsequent badges Resetting activity completion (don't know how to do this) on the original activity would probably (best scenario) revoke the original badge and there would be no record of them completing it in the first place(worst scenario it breaks the system) is there anyway of testing this? re-accreditation quiz can be setup to issue a new badge on completion. this would need a slightly different title (Data Protection 2 year refresher) However, from the points above we would need a new quiz (and badge) for each refresher (2 year, 4year, 6year....) We would then need to restrict access to the quiz once it has been completed or ideally make it disappear so that only the relevant re-accreditation quiz is available.",

I managed to execute this query but for the current stat of Moodle, which means for example in query 1, if I run the query right now to retrieve the data between January and February 2018 it will be different if I run the same query but at that time, because a lot of activities will be deleted Below are the queries Thank you ===================================================================== Query 1: total number of activities per course per activity (SELECT c.fullname AS \"Course fullname\", c.idnumber AS \"Course idnumber\", (SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME like '____forum') AS ThisType, to_timestamp(act.timemodified) as DateModified, act.name AS Title FROM prefix_forum AS act INNER JOIN prefix_course AS c ON act.course=c.id) UNION (SELECT c.fullname AS \"Course fullname\", c.idnumber AS \"Course idnumber\", (SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME like '____assignment') AS ThisType, to_timestamp(act.timemodified) as DateModified, act.name AS Title FROM prefix_assign AS act INNER JOIN prefix_course AS c ON act.course=c.id) UNION Query 2: total number of resources per course SELECT f.contextid, c.idnumber AS \"Course idnumber\", c.fullname AS \"Course fullname\", f.filesize/1024 AS \"filesize in KB\", f.filename AS \"filename\", f.mimetype AS \"filetype\", to_timestamp(f.timecreated) AS \"timecreated\", to_timestamp(f.timemodified) AS \"timemodified\" FROM prefix_files f INNER JOIN prefix_context ctx ON f.contextid=ctx.id INNER JOIN prefix_course_modules cm ON ctx.instanceid=cm.id INNER JOIN prefix_course c ON cm.course=c.id WHERE (f.component='mod_folder' OR f.component='mod_resource') AND f.filesize>0",

          "Text": "As Ruck says this was an intentional change, and I posted about it in the Quiz forum before making it, to see if there was a strong objection and there wasn't, although there was some debate about the extra click required. I have mixed feeling about this, and also the change which means that the preview now opens in a new tab rather than a pop-up window. The extra click is a down-side, but there there positives. One thing that used to be wrong with the old UI was that if you used the standard short-cut to open the preview in a new tab in the background (CTRL + click) then that did not work. Instead, the only option was to right-click and choose 'Open in new tab' - so that is two clicks per question. With the new UI, you can just keep CTRL held down, and choose preview from each menu - also two clicks per question, but less fiddly, because they are all clicks wiht the left mouse button. So, my own experience is that for \"reviewing lots of questions\" - which I do quite a lot when I have to find an example question that is suitable for testing the code I am working on, is that the new UI is slightly better. I also like the fact that the menu makes the UI less cryptic, and means that we can afford to add a few extra options there (like Export as XML ).",

On the other hand, maybe, keeping the Edit menu as is but giving the user/admin the avility to set som default actions shown like old schools Moodle could be an option. Even, it could came with some action icons shown as default, emulating the old school UI but also, as said, giving the user the avility to hide them through some sort of quiz management section.

Rick's suggestion for \"Statistics\" is very very interesting, but I believe would take a big overhaul because the stats would need to be question focused instead of quiz like it is at this stage.

          "Text": "We are upgrading from 3.4 to 3.6, and at first glance we liked the group messaging functionality. But a fter testing it, we have discovered several issues. This is what we have found, please correct us if we have got it wrong: There is no default setting to allow group messaging on course (or system) level The course manager/teacher has to activate the ability for each group in the course. This has to be done for all groups in the course one-by-one. There is no way to change this setting in \"bulk\" after the groups are created It is not selectable for all groups when auto-creating groups Groups cannot be searched and added, the way single users can, in the contacts list. This might lead to: All groups that you are a member of and that have been set to allow group messaging are always visible in the IM, and this might become a very long list. When one of your groups are missing in the IM, because that group has not been allowed to group message, it will be confusing to the user. Users will try to search for the missing group (see 5 above) When a teacher needs to create additional groups, it's easy to forget to give those the group messaging ability. This will cause stress and confusion, when some students complain that they cannot find their group in the IM. Suggestions: A site-wide course default setting to set allow/disallow Group messaging when creating a course: Allow group messaging [Yes/No] A course default setting under the Course Settings: Allow group messaging [Yes/No] The setting for each group remains as it is, but is pre-set according to the choices in 1-2 above When bulk creating groups this should be an option, pre-set according to the choices in 1-2 above The setting should be indicated in the groups overview with a checkbox The setting should be able to be changed in bulk in the groups overview, by using the checkboxes and select all",

I feel like there should be some way to represent a student sending a private message from a course, otherwise a teacher of a number of classes with many students may not know where (or even who) it's from. I suppose i could create one big group for everyone and set up messaging but then it would all be public - what i need is for that whole course group to be \"private\" between members and teacher role. We have a scenario where we have advisor roles covering many courses with hundreds of students, currently using dialogue, but really messenging should be able to do the job - had hoped it would with this update in 3.6 but it's not quite there yet.",

The footer that was added in the \"Befoe BODY is closed additionalhtmlfooter\" box on the \"Additional HTML\" screen covers up part of the window and blocks access to some of the contents. I have tried multiple things using both HTML and CSS to get the footer to drop down below the content, but with no luck. Our site uses Snap for the site theme but allows instructors to choose Boost for their course theme. Current workaround is to use \"Ctrl - \" to shrink the content size until the footer moves out of the way. However, this makes the text very small.",

          "Text": "I have tried to raise this as a Moodle Tracker issue but I get the stern message: Dear Moodler, before creating a new issue you need to demonstrate that you have searched among the existing issues to see if it's already been filed. Please find a similar issue from among the open issues and either start watching it or vote for it. Well, I have searched and it ain't there so I'll have to ask the community. Moodle Tracker wouldn't allow me to post this message. We have a custom grade book for our customer which allows them to click through from the grade to the assignment in mod/assign to allow them to grade or update grade details in mod/assign more easily. This worked in Moodle 3.5. We are currently testing an upgrade to Moodle 3.7.2+ When the user clicks through we get the error \"No student selected\" in the top panel of mod/assign and the assignment is not showing. I see the new built-in gradebook does not allow this click through action, The web service request for ListParticipants now contains the attribute sortable:true The affected method is in: mod/assign/locallib.php \n```text\nif ($tablesort) {\n// Resort the user list according to the grading table sort and filter settings.\n$sortedfiltereduserids = $this->get_grading_userid_list(true, '');\n```\n This method attempts to retrieve the data from the cache but if the user hasn't been in mod/assign and is viewing the gradebook the session variable will not have been populated. \n```text\nprotected function \nget_grading_userid_list\n($cached = false, $useridlistid = '') {\n if ($cached) { \n   if (empty($useridlistid)) { \n     $useridlistid = $this->get_useridlist_key_id(); \n   } \n   $useridlistkey = $this->get_useridlist_key($useridlistid); \n   if (empty($SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey])) { \n     $SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey] = $this->\nget_grading_userid_list\n(false, '');\n    } \n    return $SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey]; \n  } \n\n  $filter = get_user_preferences('assign_filter', ''); \n  $table = new assign_grading_table($this, 0, $filter, 0, false); \n  $useridlist = $table->get_column_data('userid');\n  return $useridlist; \n}\n```\n This is a nasty recursive function but again if the user hasn't been in mod assign before it might not have all the information to retrieve the user list. Since this could be called via a web service would 2 sets of results be returned? First with data, second without because it's recursive? In order to workaround this and short circuit this we have set $tablesort = false; in list_participants() in locallib.php to make it work like Moodle 3.5 at the moment.",

When logged as the course creator and open the new course that was created, no gear icon was displayed. The site administrator icon, when clicked, only \"manage course and categories\" is available. When clicked and browse to the courses that created, the course name is displayed on right panel with only the delete (trash bin) icon is there. No edit (gear icon) or hide (eye icon) is available. When I logged in as administrator, select the course, and go to the couse administration > enrolled users. The participant screen shows there in the roles column that the user is enrolled as course creator. I can edit that role setting and add teacher (editingteacher) and save it. Only after i did that, the the user will be able to edit the course setting, the gear icon appears, able to set editmode and other setting options. But doesn't it supposed the course creator will automatically enrolled as teacher in the course he created? Doesn't it supposed the course creator is able to edit the setting of the courses that he created? for your info, the setting in user policies \"Creator's role in new lesson \" was not changed from the default which is Teacher(editingteacher).",

I'm using Moodle 3.7 (I think) and would expect if Moodle's smart enough to warn me, I could allow me to renew the token via a pop-up window or something so I won't lose my work.

Currently my organisation is using Wordpress as our sales site with Edwiser Bridge synchronising students and courses. All our courses are free and the clients we provide our courses to need their staff to gain instant access pretty much so this sync works well. What we dont have is the ability to provide a client portal for each client for them to view their staff completion status, check the courses that their staff are registered into and effectively self-manage their staff progress. It doesnt look like Edwiser comes with a 'client' portal (although it does include a 'user-account' page for students which is a start) so i'm wondering if anyone else uses wordpress and moodle, are there other plugins that could do this? If not, any suggestions on how i can possibly use moodle for this. Set up a nominated user in moodle who would have access only to staff in their organisation? I believe moodle has a parent profile. If it works the way I'm expecting, I could manually pair each staff user with the 'parent' employer but that would be a manual process and I'm trying to push for self-service solutions wherever possible since i'm the only staff member handling online learning.",

          "Text": "Hi, I wanted to bring up Moodle's ability to let users search for courses. It seems like this would have been discussed but a forum search here was not turning up relevant results for me. Anyhow, my institution has been using a custom course block plugin that just lists all of a users courses, separated by category. I really like the new course dashboard block in Moodle 3.6+ and want to transition away from the custom course block in the future. But, I have a couple of usability questions: 1) For \"regular\" users like students and teachers, it seems like a search filter in the block would be a no brainer addition. Yes, they can sort by future/current/past, and star or hide courses, which is great. But often a teacher might just want to quickly jump to a specific course that doesn't happen to be displayed in their current view.. Is there a way to suggest/vote for this feature in core? 2) For admin users, the custom course block has a global course search. I hid the block on my dashboard and find myself missing this functionality. The quickest way I've found is to go to Site Admin->Courses->Manage Courses and Categories, where there is Course Search field. I tried adding this page to my Admin Bookmarks but it doesn't seem to be possible. Surely there is a quicker, built-in way to get to course search? Or should I look for another plugin.",

It doesn't have the power of Moodle in many areas, but it does make content creation easy using a lot of on screen Ajax calls when editing. When given the choice between Moodle and StileApp, many teachers are choosing StileApp. It would be worth Moodle HQ taking a look at it in terms of UX design as it is a competitor.",

They are almost always too light, since even #777 does not pass the minimum contrast required (example and nice discussion here: https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/ ). In general, the semantic use of color as the ONLY mechanism to convey information is a basic accessibility error to be avoided. Here's the official statement: \"Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\" from the W3C document: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color . You will notice that some places in Moodle that used to have only grey-out colors to indicate hidden or other items (eg the dimmed style class), have been updated in recent versions so that they have additional text indicators to show status in addition to color; for instance, course activity items that are hidden or stealth hidden from students now do this, which is an important improvement and good practice to model.

The following SCSS selects a number of items from the course management panel and makes them bold. It can be inserted on the raw css field in the fordson Theme's color settings. \n```text\n.teacherdashboard a.list-group-item {\n\n\n  &[href*=\"/user/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/enrol/instances.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/group/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/course/edit.php?\"]\n\n\n  {\n\n\n    font-weight: bold;\n\n\n  }\n\n\n}\n```\n A similar code would hide items. In this example the options view live logs and view course activity report . \n```text\n.teacherdashboard a.list-group-item {\n\n\n  &[href*=\"/report/loglive/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/report/outline/index.php?\"]\n\n\n  {\n\n\n    display: none;\n\n\n  }\n\n\n}\n```\n When selecting links to disable, just right-click the link in the panel and select copy link location. Then strip the course id and domain name from the front and back. E.g. https://yoursite.edu/report/loglive/index.php?id=54 becomes /report/loglive/index.php? Hope this helps.",

I don't know if each item on the page has an associated permission .  This would also require you to create new system roles for the teachers or people you don't want to see certain items because you have to actually remove that permission for the role.  This could mean you have teacher A and teacher B roles.

After reviewing the various places where the strings are used, it seems that some places e.g. forum and glossary have the area where you can add files labelled as 'Attachment' and other places e.g. assignment and database activity don't. Thus I agree that it's better to use the word 'files' than 'attachments'. I also chatted with Mary about the strings and we came up with further small improvements to the wordings as follows: \n```text\nMaximum file size: {$a->size}, maximum number of files: {$a->attachments}\n\nMaximum file size: {$a->size}, maximum number of files: {$a->attachments}, maximum total size: {$a->areasize}\n```\n I have added the strings to the English fixes (en_fix) language pack, though if anyone has any ideas for further improvements, please let me know so I can edit them.",

          "Text": "In my own observations, many topics that are posted get read, but it seems to me that the major cause of not getting a reply is that the question or suggestion is confusing or too obscure. Many volunteers participate in Moodle.org (like myself) and if I see a post that is a bit off-base, sometimes I will ignore it because I don't have the time to help the poster be more specific. I only have so much time in a day. In your case with this post of yours, you can see that both Tim and Daniel have provided responses. Having said this, there are many \"feature requests\" in Moodle Tracker that are great ideas, but might take time to implement. In my own case, I have probably posted several dozen feature requests (let's say 36) and probably 12 have been implemented. My last feature request to get implemented took 8 years, but it then happened in Moodle 3.7. Moodle's track record, for me, has been significantly better than the other LMSs (BB, D2L, C) that I have used. Piggybacking on what Tim said, I would agree, I sometimes start here in Moodle.org with a post, kind of like fishing and testing the waters, then I will post in Tracker. If something looks like a bug, I post in Tracker and follow-up here in these forums. In Tracker, if something about my idea is out of place, Tracker has the ability to \"close\" an item. I believe that posts here in these forums last a very long time.",

I know the Topics tabs are there for that reason, but I feel a user should not be so constrained - they should be able to group things into different hierarchical levels if that is their desire. And folders/sections should be able to sit anywhere on any page. The process should be: Create a folder (a flexible section closed) Drag labels, resources and activities into the folder Go into the folder, and repeat the last two steps if necessary.. This will put an end to the scroll of death. In many ways the flexible sections format simply needs to be upgraded to look like a folder, with better drag and drop enabled especially if the section/folder is closed. just some thoughts..",

We have over 200 teachers and I think about 20 of them have asked about it. Particularly teachers who have placed a large number of links on their page. They dont want to create a new Section, they simply want to be able to group their resources in something similar to a Folder . And they dont like the look of the Flexible Sections format at present - it also isn't compatible with Sharing Cart. If Moodle doesnt want to change the Folder resource - as in keep it only for Files that's okay. But perhaps creating a Collection resource which can be used to contain any group of Resources or Activities. I think it would be a very simple addition to core functionality. The Collection could either open on the page dynamically or go to its own page. If users could drag their Resources and Activities into the Collection, that would great. It could also be a very easy way to move multiple resources around the page. When I have time, I might create a Moodle Tracker for this.",

See the image in this section of the docs , which shows the file system repo in the section called, in that example, Faculty (File system) . D o you mean you wish to be able to search for and upload/link files already on your server? The file system repo allows you to put files into that directory and be visible to all users who have permission in Moodle - kind of like a virtual drive . I suspect you’re maybe wanting something a bit different, possibly akin to the Dropbox or Google drive functionality. There is a WebDAV repo, which may work for you.

This system seems to work.  Some students will pay very close attention to everything that I make available to them, looking for an error.  Bonus points add up, and they can accumulate to be worth around 2% of their overall grade, sometimes enough to pop them into the next grade category.

We have lots of information only courses/pages open to all users on our system. If we enrol all users onto these courses then they appear in the course overview block and they can then 'star' or remove from the course overview, but then the mycourses list in the drawer is very long, too long (20-30). So we thought we would just open the information courses as guest access to everyone. But then users can't 'star' these courses. Or am I missing something? Basically I want the mycourses in the nav-drawer to have their enrolled on core courses (about 5) and then users can favourite guest access information pages. The course overview block the user can edit themselves so it's as much of a problem. Has anyone found a good way to use all these things together without long lists in anyone place? thanks, Simon",

For example, when students do comprehension questions, if they have tools that allow them to highlight the keywords or important sentences, it would be much easier to complete their tasks. I want to add plugin right into Moodle, as not everyone would know how to install the text-highlighting extension from Internet browser (Chrome, Firefox , Opera...).

The last years we have been using the Essentials theme, a decision mostly based on not being satisfied with the moodle native theme's navigation. Now we want to look into Boost again, since it would be easier with a native theme and one that moodle.org is investing it's creativity in. This version has a lot of great improvements in the dashboard , which has become very configurable and easy to use! Very nice! But then comes My Courses in the navigation menu, and that hasn't changed at all. It can, as far as I can find in the settings, still not be inactivated/hidden or set as folded as default. It shows a list of courses based on mostly irrelevant information, sorted in strange orders. Maybe it should show \"starred\" courses, or courses with relevant date information (active courses)? We will try to close it with CSS , or completely hide it since it will be mostly irrelevant to people with many courses. Or have I missed something, is there a setting to do this? Suggested additional settings for My Courses: Show My Courses in navigation menu (default admin setting, could also be options for the user) - Not at all - Folded - Unfolded Content of My Courses in navigation menu (default admin setting, could also be options for the user) - All - Active courses (based on course start/end date) - Starred - Starred and active - Starred or active Sort order of My Courses in navigation menu (default admin setting, could also be options for the user) - Start date ascending - Start date descending - End date ascending - End date descending (Plus the old alternatives, but with ascending/descending option added)",

I had exactly similar requirement few days back and below is the solution I had used (although it requires changes in core but that was the compliance need of the client ) You will have to use jquery and will have to focus on click event (on finish review link). If you want to bring images also then you can focus on \"onload\" event. For PDF generation, I had used JsPDF tool (there are others too). Note :- You will have to change the page refresh time in both the events (if page will get refreshed in between then you will get only half of the PDF, if you want to download right away then it will not be required).

In this case they are being accessed under licence, so Moodle is acting as a hosting platform. Mary, yes, bulk drag and drop seems to be better than creating file objects, but I still have to go back into them and edit the settings. Each video has a specific title and the video transcript has to go in the description. Also, I have to answer whether the video should be presented on the page, or as a link, for every video. I've also noticed that the order they appear on the page is not necessarily the same as the order they appear in my File Explorer list. So, yes, it is a little quicker, but working procedurally through the course step by step still seems to be the most sensible way forward at the moment. When I downloaded the videos in Python I also copied the title, description and filename into an Excel spreadsheet. What I was aiming for was to bulk upload using the Excel sheet.

I have been finding that the word \"stream\" might have some different meanings.  In the old days, one had a choice to either \"download\" or \"stream\" videos.  Streaming meant that software would download a little, then play, then download a little more in the background, then play.  Today, with faster servers and Internet speeds, I never know if my videos are being streamed or not.  Somehow, browsers seem to just figure these things out.  This is a rather long paragraph that I have to end with \"I don't know.\" What I do know is that if you upload videos into your Moodle, backups will grow in size.  I am one who prefers to separate videos, and other content, from my Moodle, especially for this \"backup growth\" issue. A while ago, I did experiment with Kaltura.  I actually liked it.  However, I learned that it got to be very expensive very quickly, so I aborted.",

I don't think both are correct. Reading the entry for \"Proper noun\" in Wikipedia I have understood that proper nouns are distinguished from common nouns using a capitalised first letter. In the case of  single-word names, this is quite easy and most english people agree and more or less use the rule. For multiword proper names though, there are some doubts (only first letter of first word or first letters of all words). The problem starts when people that give a name, use it for so long that they come to think it is now part of the language i.e. common. But for a newcomer these words look strange or jargon. To be fair we need to be objective and have in mind as many users as possible. Power or long time users would have no problem either way. Most users would sooner or later discover the rule if it is applied uniformly. New users would very easily be instructed that names of things in Moodle have a first letter (or first letter of every word) capitalised. And that would help them a lot. My point of view is that of a translator so I can assert that it would be a tremendous help in many doubious strings in every language. p.s. I am not sure if I explained everything right.

Add a new \"Exceptional New Grades\" block. Add a new Exceptional New Grades block. Add a new Exceptional new grades block. Add a new exceptional new grades block. In other words, why is \"The Activity results...\" using a capital \"A\"? And why is \"Add a new activity...\" using a small \"a\"? (from the forum's description)",

Until last year this did not happen. if two files were uploaded by the student, for example one pdf file and the other an image file, the system ignored the non pdf one and displayed the pdf content correctly. This is a critical issue. For example an assignment may require a report (pdf or doc type) and also an image or software code file. Until the last version the report was displayed correctly. Now the only way to read the report is to download it to the local computer and than opening it. This is a time consuming task and there is no way annotate the document if you don't have the correct software. Is there a solution to this issue, or will this be corrected in next version?",

But in moodle I must replace all \"fa\" entries with \"fal\" for the light style of Font Awesome. Is there something planned in future, for use these different styles? At the moment our productive moodle 3.2.5 is running with LineAwesome support, but the thing is, that in 3.3 the FontAwesome are in moodle integrated. After the update from 3.2.5 to 3.3 the icons (overwritten by Line Awesome) are not displayed correct (needs some css ). I need to decide which way we're going right now. The best approach would be to take what the moodle core has, but we want the light style. When you desire I can upload some screens, so you can see how it looks like! Thanks for any tips and help!

This stuff really needs to be pluggable as-is, to enable use of any version of FA (4, 5 or newer, free or pro) just by unpacking the FA download into the right place. Otherwise it's way too hard to use Pro, which is a pain for users and rude to the developers of FA itself. Personally I'd like to see this (and bootstrap & other similar stuff) completely outside of themes - a plugin to install, which a theme can depend on if desired.",

Sometimes teachers are using the assignment activity to grade something that was not submitted into Moodle, like lectures or experiments for example, in order to use a marking guide or a rubric and I guess then they order their data/papers in alphabetical order according to names.

I don't know of any way to change the order of that list unless you dig through the code and find where that list is sorted and change it. Even if you go to User policies and change the Alternative full name format to just show only the, firstname, the names in the  list of students are still in lastname alphabetical order. As an alternative, supposedly if your language pack defines name display, you should be able to just put, language, in the Alternative full name format setting, and get what you need. Before I retired, the order of that list always seemed to frustrate me, too. What I did to get around it's annoying behavior, was install the Grade Me block, and add it on the front page of the site, with it set to display throughout the entire site. When any users logged in, if they were graders anywhere, and there was something for them to grade, it would be listed and they could be grading in just two clicks. When they saved the graded submission, the updated Grade Me block would be right there and they could go directly to the next person that needed grading. Since ONLY students with submissions needing to be graded are listed in Grade Me, they did not have to \"play\" with the filter setting for that list.",

We can skip the first and last pages (but would like not to) on printing, but we get the teacher's picture on the printout and no student name, making it unusable.  If we try a group, you get the student names, but they are across the site name and barely readable.

In my 10 years of using Moodle, I have never wanted to do this.  There have been times when an administrator has asked me about a student's overall grade, and I simply print the grade book User Report to a PDF file.  This works, but it does include some \"garbage\" at the top, but not a problem. Your request does take on a similarity to people who as for printed versions of a Moodle quiz. One response is \"we are an electronic product, and not a printed product\" meaning Moodle.  If you want paper, go back to paper systems.  However, there is always room for improvement. For the Grader Report, one can export the grade book, bring the exported data into a spreadsheet product, and make it as pretty as they want.  But there is no \"export\" feature for the User report.  There have been a few times where I want to play around with a user's grade book view, and I have been successful copy/pasting the User report into Excel.  Yep, some clean up required. Well, might we just need a method to \"Export\" the User Report?  I don't know, I am just thinking out loud.  I do appreciate that you raised the question.",

As a tech director I can certainly export to excel and  print (although that is alot of work for 100+ students.)  That is not however the way I want all my staff to do it, as they can't all do that. It just seems it should be a cleaner product straight out of Moodle.  In previous versions (1.9) it certainly was.  I have a great staff member working on CSS to try and fix it! Brian",

If he views all courses in his calendar, he only sees group events of groups he is in. Does anyone know why this difference in visibility exists? It seems arbitrary. This is the code that shows all group events to teachers if they are viewing only one course: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/4bd4b46070b3906e5b1fd3126b524b9fc2ba2271/calendar/lib.php#L2084-L2090 This is the commit that introduced it: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/7fd5786e6f24db2a6c702062705e33bef514bbac#diff-3762eee05a549dc356ad7f041fdf86f2 And this is the Tracker Issue for it: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28557 To a teacher this can be very confusing. If he has events for all courses displayed and creates a new group event (and isn't himself in that group) the new event won't show up for him. He needs to know that he first has to select the course that that group belongs to in order to see the event he just created. Do you agree that this is not very intuitive? Would it be better to just show all group events for each course to teachers when they view all courses? What would speak against this?",

One is called Module 1 and the other Module 2. I already set up the certificate to show only on passing, but now I want Module 2 to only be available when passing module 1. It seems that this is only possible if the SCORM packages are in the same course. But I have them in separate courses. How should I do this?",

While on the screen If the user click save changes no new tag will be added. Instead, one should hit enter, and the save changes. This might me confusing and at worst might prevent users from using - at least they'll need guidance. Since this is a new feature - at least at the question level - I wonder if couldn't be a better approach. Assuming of course this is might lead to bad UX. Thanks in advance, Hugo",

We have made some improvements to the question bank tagging in 3.5 such as the ability to add question tags at a course level or to filter questions by tags. We have used the same form element that is used in all places in Moodle to tag things. This in itself was a good decision as that makes the tagging fields consistent in the entire system. However, there are some UX issues (like what you discussed) with the tagging element (more correct to say with the auto-complete element) in Moodle form library. I encourage you to file this in our tracker at https://tracker.moodle.org/ . The good thing is once we improve the auto-complete element, everywhere in Moodle that uses that element will also be improved.",

However, we set up course to default to a weekly format with 16 sections. Previously, faculty could easily change to a topics format with even zero sections, if that worked better for their class needs. Now, going from 16 weeks to zero topics is a HUGE pain. Even going from 16 weeks to a more standard five topics is a big pain. This strikes me as a big issue and a bug. I see the reasoning for taking the number of topics/sections out of the course admin area ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-57769 ). However, I don't think that the current remedy is suitable. I know there are a number of trackers addressing this issue. However, I did not see an open issue to address the difficulty in adjusting the number of sections down. Granted, having to few sections is worse than having too many. However, too many sections are ugly and possibly confusing to students. Should I create a new tracker, or is there one I can vote up?",

I suppose, if you needed an email to go out, you could try restoring most of the forum posts from the backup and then recreating the first of each forum so that it's then emailed to your students.

I have a series of tabs in different languages in the main course page, but currently the Youtube video is not one click away: users have to click on 2 o 3 different pages to get access to it. I'd like users to click the tab and see the video straight away. Can anyone help with this? Thank you, Ely",

When using the OneTopic format, I have found that some very useful functions are hidden at the bottom of the page by the label 'Tab edition utilities'. It is not at all obvious what this means, so tutors do not think to click on it. Even less clear, when you open it, the function for moving resources between tabs is called 'asynchronous edit actions', which you have to enable or disable. Can the language used for these  labels be more natural and intuitive, so that the functions are obvious? E.g. 'Move or duplicate items' instead of 'tab edition utilities' and 'Move activities and resources between tabs' instead of 'asynchronous edit actions'? It would also be really useful to be able to move multiple items at once between tabs.",

Do you mean each lecture group, traditional class with all students, is divided into tutorial groups, 33 tutorial groups, each with a different Tutor? Then at the end of each semester, the entire lecture group is expected to complete a single Master Class assignment? Assessment? In this case, I suspect that the use of Meta courses might be more appropriate. The structure you would end up with would be something like 33 child courses connecting to 33 Tutorial Meta courses and ONE Master Class Meta course.  The Meta courses can be edited and changed to suit your need and only the enrollments in the Child courses will change. Of course, if 1 Tutor has more than 1 tutorial group, then you can reduce the number of Tutorial meta courses you need accordingly. This is not the only solution, but as I interpret your situation it should work.",

This is not a really clear cut issue. A WYSIWYG editor can carry a much larger footprint than is desirable in Moodle, so the markdown editors are used instead. Agreed, a WYSIWYG editor would be more helpful but performance, I suspect, would take a big hit. Another issue is that there was a lot of discussion about which editor should be used around the time that v2.0 was released. Two main ideas were pursued, one was adapt TinyMCE or develop Moodle's own. Both happened. A number of very clever people were able to replace TextArea with TinyMCE in v1.8 or v1.9, and, shared it. Worked well, too. From memory, it became a core plugin, so that became the obvious candidate for v2.0 (I might have the timing wrong, but this is how I recall it.)  A little later, Atto appeared as the Moodle developed markdown editor to eventually replace TinyMCE. The idea, I understand, was that a core Atto was developed and released and other devs would be encouraged to create Atto plugins for Users to download and install themselves. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be happening quickly enough so we are stuck with a seriously underdeveloped Atto or a soon to be dropped TinyMCE. The issues are a lot more complex than this, I suggest, and like all precis, this is about as accurate as a child's hand drawn portrait, (i.e. its almost recognizable as a drawing ). Hopefully, I have touched on a couple of issues that give some clearer clearer picture for you.",

This is the \"Insert or edit image\" button. It comes up with the upload dialogue, which has a really poor visual impact for newbies, the actual upload button \"Browse Repositories\" is just not clear enough I suggest. Should have a name like \"Select image\" or similar. 2) The limitations of the Atto editor are becoming the stuff of dreams, really bad dreams.... but the changes to tables are even worse. You have to format the table as best you can when you add it to the page then enter the HTML editing screen and make whatever changes you want, or it may be possible to create a standard table in a text editor and copy and paste that into your document when you want one. Unfortunately, HTML Tidy might have something to say about it, but give it a try. The alternative is to use TinyMCE as your preferred editor, I do. viel Glück.",

Maybe someone can help me out with the following issue: The calendar block in our study portal is shown on the course overview page, as well as in each course. We use global events and course events. Unlike the global events, course events are only shown as soon as they are available for the student. As some of our global events are identical to course events, we want to avoid a double-displaying of the same event, as it does not look very nice. Therefore we would like the calendar on the course overview page only to display global events and the calendar within each course only to show course events, by default. Is there any way to do put that as a default setting without any manual action from the student himself? If anybody could help me with that, I would be very grateful.",

The desired behavior would be that, the moodle only sends reminder e-mails who are not passed the test already (not checked the 2nd box).

I thought this might have had to do with our theme, and our developer noticed that Moodle 3.2 seems to think there are 3 columns of content instead of 2 in a few places- we noticed this on our quizzes where the question blocks were nicely centered but squished everything. He had to take a look a write a line of CSS to override that. (I posted about this in the quiz activity section last week). Additionally, I noticed that same phenomenon this morning on the Advanced Forum (I was in the processing of removing it any way in favor of the default Moodle forum activity) that had the same formatting issue. I've also noticed this with the media player plugins that ship with 3.2. It will center the mp3 player on the page which is unimportant in some instances (i.e. a quiz, pages with audio files on them) but rather strange in others. For example, if I create a resource for an mp3 file on a course page, but also embed the same file in the resource description and have it displayed on the course page, it is super way off to the right. We are currently using the Poodll filter for media files which works absolutely fine, but I was seeing what the default ones were like and it's slightly problematic. I converted our theme to Boost but then it wasn't rendering the file links in the player- I have to go and re-embed them I think (but there's a lot of that to do!).",

          "Text": "Thanks all for your help and comments. The information from our IT helpdesk is as follows: 'The theme in use presently is UCL's own in-house version which is a combination of the \"Clean\" (see: https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Standard_themes ) and \"Essential\" themes. It is not possible to change the theme. But, even if you could, it does not change the appearance of the rubric in the Moodle assignment. Hence, I'm afraid that the suggestion that I made below is only possible solution to your problem even though it isn't ideal. There is currently a Digital Education and Disability Services team looking into accessibility and Moodle more generally and I have passed on your dissatisfaction with the display of rubrics in Moodle assignments to them. However, if a change to the layout is possible, it's unlikely to happen before next academic year. If there are any other accessibility/display issues with Moodle that you would like to see addressed please log them via Remedyforce with the Summary title, \"Accessibility and Moodle\" and we will pass them on to the team. ... I don't think that the theme is affecting the way the rubric is displayed as such. It is just how the Moodle assignment has been designed to display it. However, if you open a student submission using the Grade button you may notice a \"Zoom in/out of Region\" icon/button with 4 outward pointing arrows (see screenshot attached). If you click on that icon your rubric will open in a pop-up window and although you can't enlarge it, you can use the scroll bars much more easily to get a much better view of your multiple row and column rubric.' To be honest, I don't really understand why it's not possible to enlarge the rubric. It seems like a very basic thing that makes a lot of difference to usability . The rubric is a great system for marking, but having to scroll backwards and forwards each line is frustrating and makes marking a bit of a chore.",

I added the following CSS as a customisation to the Essential theme to get around this problem. \n```text\n/* Grading for rubrics  - make the KDSC marking rubric table wide for tutors to use */\n.path-mod-assign .fullwidth[data-region=\"grade-panel\"] [data-region=\"grade\"] { max-width:none;}\n```\n Unfortunately if you don't have administration rights, you cannot edit the customisation, but you could always ask the administrators to add it in. If that doesn't work, and you are feeling brave, you could try opening your browser developer window (Firefox link) , and adding the line in the \"{ } Style Editor\" tab (in Firefox ). This overrides the default theme setting, and works while you have the developer window open. Presumably it is just as irritating for students when reviewing their marks, so the following CSS fixes the issue for them. \n```text\n/* Make the grade rubric wide for students to see it better */\n.gradingform_rubric: width: 1300px;\n```",

I came across the same issues when trying to improve the Assignment page usability in general https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=349021 In real world examples i've been exploring the rubric text are often very difficult to read, and having to scroll horizontally is pretty common for students and teachers, even at full width users with a large screens. Currently the rubric is using an html table for layout. Unfortunately this means the arbitrary amount of text, combined with the arbitrary number of horizontal boxes of arbitrary width and height, can very quickly lead to poor usability of the rubric in any theme. The table layout is also not great for accessibility - but that's a whole different forum post... Currently experimenting with displaying vertically. which seems to work better, but very much work in progress. I'll try post some ideas for making rubric less terrible in the Assignment module usability refinements thread when i get a chance. Thanks again Stuart",

My problem is many teachers reported the course disappear suddenly in the middle of semester. Actually, my teachers always misunderstand the new overview and also the calculation of course end date for Weekly Format in Moodle 3.3. Their course have lack of weeks and so the course end date become before the real \"end date\". We do many document and promotion to talk about this but really really not work! My suggestion is Moodle can improve to let this option be a Default course setting. I prefer to set default as False and teacher must actively tick it to enable the function.

          "Text": "Many of our users are confused when Moodle returns to the default question upon next login, after they changed their language via the language dropdown-menu in the navbar. I think it would help to clear things up and improve accessibility if a link to language preferences was added to the language menu. Also, this would make it similar to the message and notification menus, which also feature direct links to message and notification preferences in Boost. Another improvement would be to include another string in the preferred language menu to make it clear to users that this changes the default language upon next login, since it is counter-intuitive that you can change your preferred language there and nothing happens. Or maybe it would be even better to get rid of the  \"preferred language\" setting altogether, and just make the language-dropdown menu change the preferred language as well as the language for the current page? That might be the most straightforward solution...",

If no matches, then in the Default language. For this to happen, the Auto-detect Language setting needs to be on. After the user has logged on, the profile is checked and the preferred language is named there, which is supposed to force a change the language used. If the language setting of a course is different then the client will show that language. Well, that is what I get from this Languages forum discussion , and Koen and Sevérin both know a lot more about this than I ever will.. So it seems there is more than just one setting that needs to be changed.",

Version, theme, and so on will often have an impact onhow you can retrieve information about your courses. In the most simple case, you may be able to generate such a report from the database if you install the adhoc report plugin from the OU. If this is not possible and you have phpMyAdmin or some other query tool to search your database, then you will need to build a query using that tool. The database has changed significantly since the last time I have done anything like this so I don't know which tables you might need to define connections for building such queries. Someone in the Developer's forums should be able to provide more information.",

The file itself is it an entire course file or just a single page of text, text and images, text, images and multimedia files? If it is just a text file, unzip it, then upload it or copy and paste. If it is text and images, or text, images and multimedia, can't help you there. Unless you want to, in your course, create a page, add an image and/or multimedia files, back it up and then download it. Change the download file type to zip and unzip it. Use this file as a shell, changing the xml code as required. Zip it up and change the file type to mbz, then restore.  (This used to be simple but since v2.0, it is not as easy as it used to be but the security restrictions should be able to be gotten around, look for the patterns for file linking.) If it is an entire course, and it has all the Moodle required xml files, in place, change the file type to mbz and upload it as a restore. There is probably an easier way of doing this, but I don't know it, based on the little information provided.",

The calendar block is a plugin, and as such is likely to be placed either side of the course page, this is why you might find it an annoyance to only get the block on the left or the right and not in the centre.",

I have been asked to raise this by a tutor at our university. The quiz in question was set to 1 attempt only. A couple of students needed to be given the chance to reattempt the quiz, We know that you can set a user override for a student, for example, giving them 2 attempts. You can also delete a student's attempt within the quiz results screen so that they can then have another go. However, is it possible to simply change the status of the submitted quiz to unsubmitted so that the student can continue working on their attempt? If not, I don't know if it would be possible for something like this to be added in some future iteration of Moodle? Or, are there very good reasons why this is not a good idea? Any answers on this, even if this is just to explain the rationale for not allowing a tutor to change a students submitted quiz from submitted to unsubmitted, would be really helpful and I can then go back to the tutor with what can be done or a reason for why this is not possible.

Now, as for changing the file, I am very new to all of this and I assumed this file would be located in my server with the rest of my Moodle files.  I went there and went into the themes and the templates, as you said but I could not locate anything related to the Fordson theme in my server.  I know I have it set up because my course is now using it. I did find the file you were referring to in the main boost theme and even found the line you said to remove, but since you said this was the way to do it in the Fordson theme, I didn't want to remove it from the boost theme on my server until I checked to make sure I was in the correct place and doing the correct thing.. LOL I also went into development in the Moodle site itself and found the line you referred to, but I do not see how to edit/remove anything in there.  Sorry for being so novice at this. Learning as I go. Also, could you tell me where to get assistance with a couple of things in the Fordson theme?  When I use the theme that creates an upper image and a main background image, the main background image gets embedded behind the upper image and I have a dog with no head on my lower background..

If you then reload the page, you get redirected to the login page. Users shouldn't see this \"servicenotavailable\" error if the problem is that they're not logged in. This occurs on Moodle 3.4.1 (Build: 20180115) running on CentOS 7.4.1708 with Apache 2.4.6, MariaDB 5.5.56 and PHP 7.2.2 when accessing it with Google Chrome 63.0.3239.132. I have already tested and debugged this and found out the reason for the error: In this case it is AJAX calls being performed while the user is not logged in. The user is not logged in because his last session timed out. Normally when he opens a Moodle page he would get redirected to the login page. However, what happens here is: Chrome opens the Moodle page when being launched because that page was open when Chrome was last closed. But it doesn't refresh the page by sending a new HTTP request which would redirect the user to the login page. Instead it displays the page as if the user was logged in which leads to the AJAX calls failing. How do I prevent this from happening? Just using  another browser or changing some browser settings won't work for us as we don't have control over that. I also don't want to \"hack\" Moodle's core code as that would make it harder to maintain. Any help appreciated, Thanks",

A constructive approach to solving your issues would be the best course of action to take. As far as I understand it, your main issues are with the new My Overview block that has replaced the old block Course Overview as core. This block can still be installed and used instead of the one you're somewhat unhappy with, if you're a systems administrator for your Moodle. If you're not the systems administrator, you could point the person in charge of this to the correct plugin, so he/she can install and enable it. There's just one caution: at some stage (in a little over 2 years), the legacy Course Overview block will cease to function, with the release of Moodle 3.7. I strongly hope that you will have gotten used to the new and improved My Overview block by then and that you can see some of the positives of this new redesigned block: - a timeline for detailed information on what's expected when - sorting courses according to Current, Future and Completed - more detailed course completion details - ...",

In regular Moodle course formats like Weeks or Topics, everything is loaded upon entering the course, which may cause problems if there are a lot of huge files to process (image, audio, video). If there's a timeout because of the sheer volume of data to be loaded, you may need to have a look at how the media files are incorporated in your courses. Embedded external media works better than having the complete files as part of your courses.",

E.g. no database (so mostly no $CFG), no moodledata, no caches. So, it has to be implemented with the simples possible code, and be completely self-contained. The way to customise this with minimal code code changes is: Make a function that renders your own error page. A place like local/customerrors/lib.php might be a neat place to put that. Find the place in  where Moodle renders its version of the page (the early_error_content static method in boostrap_renderer in setup.lib.php). Change that function to call your function instead. That is, right at the start add: \n```text\n// Customisation of core code starts.\nrequire_once($CFG->\ndirroot\n . '/local/customerrors/lib.php');\nreturn my_early_error_content($message, $moreinfourl, $link, $backtrace, $debuginfo);\n// Customisation of core code end.\n```\n Now I think about this, we could have an option, set in config.php, like $CFG->custom_early_error_page, to avoid the need for core code changes.",

          "Text": "We are exploring some big changes to our Fordson theme directly related to usability .  Most noticeable is the changes to navigation. Our next release will have the following usability improvements: All Moodle navigation and course navigation is located in the top navbar. Activity Module menu is still located in the gear in the upper right of the module page as it makes sense to have the module menu within the module you are wanting to edit. My Course drop down displays list of enrolled courses in the top navbar. New \"This Course\" drop down menu displays what was previously in the Nav Drawer.  This is all that is needed to hop around the weeks and topics of a course. New icon buttons in top navbar: Course Management, Course Dashboard for students, Site Administration, and Easy Enrollment Course Codes (if you use the Easy Enrollment plugin). Course Management and Course Dashboard for students will now open in a new modal pop up from anywhere within the course. Turn Edit on is always visible.  Clicking button will return the user to the exact spot on the page they were at previously.  No more scroll to top, click edit, scroll back down. No more nav drawer.  All menu items are accessed via the top navbar either in a drop down or the modal pop ups. Blocks remain where they are and when editing is turned on the Add a Block box is right there where you need to add blocks and not hidden somewhere on the other side of the page. The page layout is two columns content and blocks. The course title is now a link that will take you back to the course homepage.  Sometimes breadcrumbs get messy or people don't use them.  They are lost trying to get back to the course homepage. This Course drop down also contains the following quicklinks: Course Homepage, badges, competencies, and calendar for the course. Button icons in the top navbar have tooltips so that you know what they do without someone having to tell you. We think consolidating all the navigation in one area is a huge usability improvement.  We are excited to share the improvements but would like some feedback for more enhancements.

As a teacher when viewing the assignment mod moodle displays this table : This all seems to take up a lot of screen height, uses a table for layout, and is not optimised for accessibility. For a teacher the tabular data is: the number of participants in the assignment the number who have submitted work to the assignment the number of submissions that need grading the due date of the assignment the time remaining Could we possibly display this information in a more accessible and user friendly way? From an information perspective there is a lot of data redundancy here which can be improved on, from a usability perspective the information could be optimised, and this seems a completely inappropriate use of tables in terms of accessibility. Breaking it down : The due date is currently buried, but is perhaps the most important data for both students and teachers. Participants and submissions can be a single information point. Actions the user needs to take now, such as grading that needs to be done, should be obvious. Implementation concept : This is just a quick ux design mock up an idea on improving the assignment activity in the Snap theme , so all comment are most welcome. Does this give the same information in a better format? Feedback very much appreciated. Cheers Stuart Lamour",

Can we apply a similar logic for students and display this data in a less cluttered way? Extracting the same headline information we display for teachers leads to due date, submitted and status as the first elements. Details about the student's submission could possibly be separated from Submission Status and Feedback into a their own section. Feedback information is currently split between the 2 sections - Submission Status and Feedback. Moving all the information related to feedback into the Feedback section feels like a an obvious approach. Perhaps the most important elements of feedback for a student are the grade and a teacher's comments, so displaying this above any rubric/grading criteria might make more make sense? For the next stage I'll do user testing to make sure these changes to the page information architecture are helpful for real students, but in the meantime would welcome any comments.

          "Text": "Hi Stuart, Thanks for sharing your mockups to the community for comments. I like what you are working on here. I have a few suggestions. I'd suggest that once a teacher has returned feedback to a student, that it should be displayed in the most prominent way. An issue with the current design is that students have to do a lot of scrolling once work has been returned to find feedback. Once work has been returned I think the feedback should be the most important thing. I like how in your mockups student submissions are displayed. This is a features that Blackboard has that Moodle currently does not. It could do a few things for instructors and students. First of all, it would be a benefit for students to see their work as soon as they upload . It could help reduce the \"I submitted the wrong file\" excuse. There would also be a secondary advantage to showing a converted PDF to the students. For those of us that are using Google Drive integration to create PDFs in Moodle 3.3 or higher, faculty have noticed that they have to wait for PDFs to be created on demand, slowing down their grading workflow. If the PDF was created when students submitted, it would save the instructors a few seconds times the number of students they are gradeing. I'm curious what you are doing with these mockups. Are you opening a tracker, and offering to create a patch for Clean and Boost, or are you developing this on the theme level for your SNAP theme and future Moodlerooms Themes?",

The best hosting I would recommend is a Moodle partner in your own language and, if possible, in your own country. 300 simultaneous quizzes might be very hardware-intensive (expensive), but less so if the questions are shown one at a time and the quizzes are slightly spread in a few minutes period. Will the students use a gigantic computer lab? Will they use their own home computers? Do you have an example quizz to illustrate how many large images are there? Making many exams in Moodle is a frequent situation in UNAM. I would suggest you to visit the UNAM Moodle admins and developers free site .",

In brief, it seems that the check-boxes students use to mark assignments as completed are not used to evaluate whether or not an assignment should be removed from the Course Overview in Timeline view. The only way we can seem to get this working is to enable a submit button, which then requires a submission type (online text and/or file) to be enabled for the button to become visible.  This is more than we want to have the students do to inform us that they have completed the assignment. Perhaps there is a setting, or combination of settings, that exists that would enable this to happen, but we’ve not figured out the correct combination. Again, we want a student to check an assignment as complete, and the result should be that the assignment is removed from Course Overview in Timeline view on the student's dashboard. Any ideas? Thanks, Kim",

Unfortunately, the admin setting that allowed for this has been removed around Moodle 3.x for reasons I never understood, but sadly, requiring ever more clicks for the same actions has been a constant development for the Moodle interface. Now we are using Moodle 3.3.1 and Boost theme, and the only icon that is still shown next to the edit drop-down menu is the group mode icon: I find this rather inexplicable, as group mode is not a setting that is frequently changed. To make matters worse, I regularly encounter teachers that mistakenly changed the group mode of activities without even noticing, probably because their mouse click missed the \"edit\" dropdown menu by a bit... For this reason, Id like to deactivate these group mode icons - is there a way to do this without changing core Boost theme files manually?",

The requirement is that a learner can enter the assessment which holds 37 questions, complete 10 (for example) come out of the assessment and go back in to that same attempt to finish it off and submit a grade.

This from the help: \"This setting hides the \"Start new attempt\" checkbox and prevents review mode.

As someone with an interest in graphic design and how it relates to UX, I would like to gather some opinions about how activities are currently represented on the course page and how they might be improved to provide a more visually consistent and intuitive experience. The current set of icons have been around for a while and feature a variety of shapes, colours and level of detail. Third-party activity modules introduce even more visual variance to the course page. Personally speaking I would like to see Moodle adopt some of the design principles expressed in many modern apps by enhancing uniformity regarding the shape (and perhaps the colour) of activity module icons. It might also be worthwhile to provide a set of standards (or guidelines) to the developers of third-party modules regarding how to best represent their activity on the Moodle course page. Below is an image from a popular social networking app. The uniform shape and size of the avatars creates a balanced look, and the lines dividing each contact dissolves on the left side of the screen to prevent the content from appearing too compartmentalised. Could a similar design enhance the appearance of the course page?  What about completion tracking? Are there ways to improve how completion status is reflected on the page? Any additional thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

For example, critical warnings should not be dismissible by touching the background. In that case it is okay to raise attention to the message this way, as it cannot be closed as easily. Also, if a modal is a form, it would be too easy to close it accidentally by touching the background.

Moodle 2.7 Upgrade documentation ( https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Cron ) shows the below information: Cron in Moodle 2.7+ Cron has received a major update and now has support for both scheduled and adhoc tasks - MDL-25499 . The benefits of these changes are: The schedule for every task can be configured by the admin. See Scheduled tasks Tasks can run in parallel Cron processes use locking to prevent the same task running at the same time by different processes A result of this is that cron can be run much more often, which means (for example) forum posts can be sent out sooner. Admins can keep cron running at the same schedule as before, but it is strongly recommended that they increase the frequency of running cron to at least once per minute. But I don't know if the cron.php can be run in different servers since it can be run in pararell, or it just can run in parallel in the same node since it is recommended to run it every minute. Thanks in advance, Ángel",

          "Text": "Good evening! I've just upgraded to 3.3 from 3.1 and I've noticed that the eye (course item visibility) toggle is no longer inlined along with each item's title, but hidden under a dropdown menu, which means an extra click is needed to get to it. I always start the year by importing last year's course and hiding the activities I don't want my students to see right away, so I use that toggle a lot and it was nice to have it next to the activity. Is it possible to move some of these actions back out so that they are more accessible? I've tried both the Boost and Clean themes but both behave the same. Any alternate way to change the visibility of a lot of activities without lots of clicking around would actually help. Thank you!",

I think the whole direction that the Moodle interface has been heading for is questionable, requiring more clicks for the same actions with every version, and hiding essential actions in ever more obscure menus. The two worst examples of this are the elimination of the possibility of displaying edit icons instead of the edit dropdown menu (an additional click for EVERY action!) and hiding the turn edit mode on button in a dropdown menu (another additional click...), but I will post about those separately.",

We had a great response, with over 300 participants in just under a week, completing the activity. I just also wanted to provide a brief summary of some next steps with the feedback you’ve provided: The UX team at Moodle HQ (mainly Barbara and I) have, and will continue, to go through the feedback that we received from the card sorting activity. Part of going through the feedback will be to gain insight into usage patterns to help identify current gaps and pain points in course administration. We will summarise the trends into a report which will then be used to inform future experience design work associated with course administration in Moodle. Please note that this is an ongoing project and we don’t have fixed timelines for this as yet as we are still in the early research, data collection and discovery phase. Thanks again to all Moodle community members who participated and shared the invitation to participate in the research activity. We really appreciate your continued support of our open source project. I look forward to working with everyone again and getting your valuable input for any future research activities .",

So we have two Moodle systems operating side-by-side on the server. We will eventually retire the old one, but for now, we need to keep it alive. Previously the old Moodle was running from the Default Website which reads from wwwroot . The new Moodle was running from another website that read directly from the new Moodle app folder. I wanted to swap them around and put the new Moodle in the same \"seat\" (with the same parameters) as the old site so that it was under the official URL , but also because the old Moodle was working properly. I also fixed some permissions issues in the Moodle app directory. Once I did these things, the 500 error when logging in improperly went away, and the 500 errors that happened elsewhere were giving us specific error info.",

          "Title": "Activity Completion Tracking",
          "Text": "Hello, I'm posting this under usability as that's where it is a problem for me - but forum admin might decide it sits better elsewhere. I have courses with groups of students undertaking separate activities - lets call it differentiated learning. I'm preparing for upgrade to version 3.3 and want to fine-tune activity completion so that the course notifications are more accurate. Currently it works as follows - when students view a resource, take a quiz or whatever the completion box is ticked and it is tracked on the activity completion report. Unfortunately, the activity report doesn't take account of whether a student is permitted to access a resource - it just lists everything that has a completion option, even if the student isn't able to complete (for example because they don't belong to the only group with access). Once we move to 3.3 I'm anticipating this might go catastrophically wrong, with students panicking as Moodle tells them they've only completed 1/3 of the course activities, but they can't see anything that they haven't done. What I think SHOULD happen is that when the activity report displays, it is individualised for each student. If as a result of activity restrictions a student has no access to an activity, the report should have a gap (instead of a tickbox that will never be ticked) - and that the completion notifications and tracking should likewise only consider the activities available to that student, regardless of what else might have completion tracking switched on in the course. Can anyone enlighten me about whether this issue has been addressed in the 3.3 version of Moodle - or if there is a workaround? If there isn't a solution I'll raise a bug report as this will impact really badly on student perception of the new Moodle progress notifications if it hasn't been thought through. It's bad enough as staff wanting to check progress and having to constantly refer back to see why students haven't completed tracked activities, it'll be far worse if students are being told they haven't done something they don't have access to.

The problem is that the plugin that do exist do not seem to work (for me) and cannot be modified after registration which means all the user already in courses are not added to the cohort. And if one has to change it cannot be done. Right now it is all manual , a new user registers, I add them to the right cohort(s) which is synced to the course. If they change cohort I have to do it manually. The problem with this is that I am never aware of when a new users registers or makes a change . So I end up with half users in cohorts the others half floating around which makes them invisible to the ones supervising the grades of their groups. What I want : User registers and chooses cohort from dropdown menu on profile, automatically added to cohort which then adds to course/group. If user changes cohort (from dropdown menu on profile) they are then deleted from the old one and added to the new one. Simple . To take care of the grade loss all users are in a general cohort. Everyone is in that one to make sure all info is kept in case they are deleted from another cohort. Is there anyone who as a way to do this? Is it something that can be done ?",

          "Text": "I have had much trouble in the past attempting to implement system messages such as when a student needs to reset their password or confirm their new accounts. The fact is only by setting the Server > Support contact > Support email to an email address having the @yoursitesbaseurl.com for its suffix, will it work. And this email address doesn't even have to be a real one. It simply needs to have the exact same address after the \"@\" as your website's url. In my experience, setting this to anything else totally disables the Moodle system from sending system messages to students. Furthermore, what if, after you manage to get it working, you want to monitor every email sent by your system? Where is the Moodle setting for this? How can Moodle send your system admin a copy of every email sent by the system? Shockingly, there isn't a Moodle setting for it. You have to hack one into it. Here is how: In your config.php, add this line after \n```text\n$CFG->bccmails='somename@someaddress.com';\n```\n If you need a second CC, add this: \n```text\n$CFG->bccmails2='someothername@someotheraddress.com';\n```\n Also, you must edit a part of the Moodle base code. In the lib/moodlelib.php of your base server directory, locate this line: \n```text\n if ($mail->Send()) {\n```\n Then add the follow just ABOVE the \"if ($mail->Send()) {\" \n```text\nif (!empty($CFG->bccmails)){\n\n\n   $mail->AddBCC($CFG->bccmails);\n\n\n    }\n\n\nif (!empty($CFG->bccmails2)){\n\n\n    $mail->AddBCC($CFG->bccmails2);\n\n\n    }\n```\n This will give you ability to add two unique CC addresses to send all system emails to. if you want a third, you can see how the code differs. Simply duplicate the code again and change the \"bccmails2\" to a subsequent number. I hope this hopes someone. I know there are SMTP setting options built into Moodle. Unfortunately for me, I have NEVER gotten any of that to work. Only the above settings work for my system.",

Enough quibbling, down to specifics. We are using the default 3.2 theme (Boost?) and working on making everything compatible with the Mobile app. In 2.8 (at least in the theme we used), click on the quiz and get the quiz admin menu.  Select Results->Grades, Responses, or Statistics or other quiz related function are accessible with no problem with the ability to bounce back and forth with ease all basically in the same area. In 3.2, click on the quiz, then click on the gear, then click on your function.  The problem comes in if you select Results-> Grades to see how the latest group did or completion status, then if you want to see the students' responses or check for commonly missed questions, since the gear or any selection menu is not available (first image below), you must click back to the quiz then click on the gear to change function.  You must do this for each change as the gear only appears, and the menu is only available, on the first quiz page (second image below).  In the first case below, clicking on Grades or Results does nothing useful by just taking you to the current page. Image 1 Image 2 Overall, I like the Boost theme, though I may try others due to this large PITA.  Is this a bug or intended operation?  If intended, why and please fix!  In any case, how can I get the all contextual menu operations on every page? In a similar vein, I have also noticed on the Admin menu that when items are selected some of the bread crumbs have links and others do not.  This too is bothersome as to go up a level you must go up two or more levels then come back down.  Based on the below, in order to let's say add a cohort, I must go to the main admin menu, then select Users, then select Cohorts in the Permissions section instead of just clicking on Users. Yes, I could make bookmarks, but in a short time the number of bookmarks would become unmanageable and useless. Any suggestions would be helpful.  Theme modification, other than adding/removing blocks, is not currently in my wheelhouse and I do not have access to the php files anyway.

We utilized the bootstrap collapse feature to show and hide a panel just above the main content of the page.  We placed a link there that toggles the new Course Management Panel. When the link is clicked it toggles the display of the menu which is broken down into the following groupings for Course Admin Links:  Badges, Question Bank, Course Settings, and User Links.  We believe these groupings will help teachers discover and access the links they need quickly and efficiently.

Download Fordson: https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_fordson Download Easy Enrollment: https://github.com/dbnschools/moodle-enrol_easy The two plugins are designed to work in harmony.  We do not have any documentation on how to use Easy enrollment with other themes as you need to hack the homepage to display the Enrollment form and our intent is to have them made into a plugin set. Directions: Install Fordson version 1.4.4 Install Easy Enrollment.  On the settings page be sure to turn OFF QR Code if you do not have SSL on your server .  QR Reader requires SSL. Go to Plugins > Enrollment > Manage and turn on the Easy Enrollment plugin This will display the Easy enrollment form on the Site Home for Fordson. Go to your courses and add Easy Enrollment as one of the course enrollment methods.  You can also just add a new course and make sure easy enrollment is activated. On your Course page you should see \"Enrollment Codes\" button in the upper right area of the page for any course which has the easy enrollment method enabled. Copy an enrollment code and try having a student use it from the Site homepage enrollment form.  Once the code is entered into the form click the enroll button and you should be instantly taken to a course and enrolled as a student. Teachers can now give out these codes to students and they can \"easily\" enroll in the courses. We included the ability to set dates for enrollments so that a teacher can turn off the ability for more students to enroll if desired.  It is all on the enrollment codes  page inside the course.",

My only suggestion here would be: 1) Add a separate column for Reports. Basically just flatten out the whole Reports tree. The more important reports I think are completion related, Activity and Course, as opposed to the course logs, and those are not there.  A flat report columns solves that. 2) Move Badges under Questions or vice versa to one column. Those both have a small and fixed number of options and it will save a lot of real estate and make room for the Reports one. Really nice work on Fordson. Love the direction you are taking it.",

It would appear you were ahead of the times with thinking of organizing the course links and a new dashboard page for course setup. In an ideal world if I had the coding skills to do so I would make these links and a few other items into a separate \"Tab\" on the coursepage which would be essentially what I have with other pertinent information for the teacher to track assignments and grading stuff.   This separation of management and learning materials makes sense.  The fact that the links are organized and visible all at once is also a win for teachers. This dream of separating the learning materials into one tab and management on another is why I switched up the layout of Fordson in the most recent versions.  I suspect at some point I might get the time to work on it and I wanted the theme to be ready with a design that might lend itself to utilizing tabs or a tab like structure.  In the meantime, I got some of the initial work done in developing the Course Management toggle.  And maybe this is as far as it needs to go at this point so that things can remain simple.",

Could this be done using a customized block that would be added to each course? Could this be done by customizing the \"My\" page so that, instead of showing a long list of individual course, it would show a program container/section, under which individual courses would be shown under it? Some users have used meta-courses to create \"program home pages\" and then enrol other courses into them, but that only adds another site to a user's \"My\" page and doesn't really help them know where to go. I'm interested to know what others are doing to address the issue.  Thanks.",

When someone clicks a program tag, they would then see a page listing all the courses with that same tag set. Also, many of the activities are getting tag capability in Moodle 3.3.

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I couldn't find a topic that seemed to be directly about navigation, so I have created this new one. I basically just wanted to share a blog post I recently added on how less is more. I know we say it all the time, but do we really mean it, and do we fight for it when it comes to the crunch. It is so easy to say ok to many suggestions and keep adding features and handy links etc. but what is the compromise to usability ? I've done a mockup (which I actually created a while ago) that hopefully challenges what really needs to be on the course landing page, based on the less is more principle (also known as interference effects in psychology). I've inserted the first page, but do have a quick look at the rationale on the blog. This is very rough, but happy to hear thoughts about this mockup which also incorporates some pretty standard web navigation techniques used these days. Click here to go to the blog post. Thanks, Tara P.S. If anyone could somehow get 'Open in a new window' to be the default mode when creating a link in Moodle, I would be FOREVER grateful!",

Your second point is too general for me to understand what action might be taken and I am not familiar with the term PACR. With reference to your last point, the source code to Moodle is made available freely under the GPL license and you can install and run it on your own machines without any financial cost and without any advertising component. Could you indicate which clause of the GPL you are concerned is being breached. It is possible to pay a very modest fee to remove the advertising from the MoodleCloud service. I am not aware of the EU restricting the ability to use advertising as a way of supporting a web based service and would be interested to know what you are referring to.",

We are using using Moodle 3.0 and the Essential theme. We use the site for customer training. All trainings are eLearning\nmodules I will try to be succinct but want to provide all relative information. We “push” students into Moodle from a proprietary application,\ncreating a Moodle user record automatically and logging them in and onto the Moodle\nlanding page. Our customers subscribe to specific products and we only\nwant them to see or enroll in courses related to products they subscribe to. I\nuse course categories aligned with products to store courses relative to that\nproduct Since I know what products they own when they log into the proprietary\napplication I can push that data along with their user info into Moodle and using\nscripting and the cohort auto sync plugin I have the student’s auto enrolled in\nonly the courses I want them to be enrolled in. What I want to do now and have had challenges in building is\na method to display the categories and or courses the user sees.  I can get the courses to display in the My\ncourses block but it can be a long list I don’t want them scrolling through\npossibly dozens of courses. Making the Dashboard page the home page doesn’t really\nwork either. What I would like to do is show the student a list or icon set of\nonly those categories that have courses they have enrollments in, they can then\ndrill down into the category and start the course. I realize there may have been other ways to accomplish what we have so far but there were strict business needs that drove the design. I would appreciate any suggestions or pointers if anyone has\ntried something like this or alternative methods. Thanks",

          "Text": "Hi all, We've been looking at the new myoverview block with interest - we really like the concept of the timeline of activities that has been introduced. We've looked into our database at our institution to pull out some statistics on course enrolment and course information and can foresee two usability issues with this new component: Users with many enrolments will struggle to find their courses and have no way to search, order or hide courses from display in the block Presently, when viewing your enrolled courses within the 'Courses' view, a user is able to see six enrolments per page and these are categorised by 'In progress', 'Future', 'Past'. For users with a large number of enrolments, navigation is incredibly manual - we suggest introducing filtering, searching and the ability to hide or mute a course from view Courses names are not always displayed well within the block and is especially problematic for long course names. We've found that the longest course name in our database is 210 characters in length. As the myoverview block displays the course fullname, the 210 character course is often cut-off or causes a lot of wasted space within the block: As such, we've lodged two tracker items: MDL-58579 - Allow searching / filtering of courses in myoverview MDL-58585 - Long course names are not display correct on myoverview block I am posting here to see whether there is any support in the community for these enhancements?

Sure you can use a CSV file but better be sure you have all your commas in order. We have long dreamed of having a simpler way of getting kids into courses where they do not have to browse or search 100's of courses.  Bigger sites create headaches for younger kids. We are in the process of developing a new enrollment plugin which mimics the functionality of Google Classroom and Edmodo.  It is almost 100% functional now but we are testing still.  It uses 6 digit codes that are entered on the homepage of Moodle and instantly enrolls the user into a corresponding course or group within the course.  It also functions independent of other enrollment plugins so you can utilize manual or even self enrollment if you desire.  This plugin ignores those enrollment keys and uses it's self generated codes. We believe this will greatly simplify getting kids from the homepage to the learning content. To take this one step further... we can even enroll students with a QR Code!!!!!! Video coming shortly as we just got this functionality working.",

I'd suggest that in most cases no more than 5 years are needed in that list. Currently it seems that changing the default years involves changing the 'code' in .../moodle/calendar/type/gregorian/classes/structure.php, lines 81 to 97. Are there cases where such a large range of years is needed? Is there an easy way to change the default years, for those who can't access the code on their server ?

In the Admin pages, we can add a date field to the user profile. In that case the min and max years can be selected from a list (drawn from the default min_year and max_year).

          "Text": "Hi, Does anyone else think it would be great to be able to easily add an activity to a Moodle resource page? If you copy and paste the links from any section into a page they work and look like activities , although they are just hyperlinks to activities in a topic or orphaned section. I realise this is the same as manually creating links to activities elsewhere. This might look like this, i.e. it looks like a topic section but it is a page with activity links on it: I believe allowing \"add activity or resource\" on a resource page would be a powerful way of allowing activities to be nested or tucked away into pages and would be a simple but valuable improvement to Moodle that would improve usability further. So a page would look like this mock up (note: Add activity link): We (i.e. our tutors) really liked Sam Marshall's (OU) subpage plugin ( see here ) , however this is a non-standard additional feature that is being phased out and therefore one we are having to stop using and won't be able to make use of in the future. This allows subpages with activities to be created, although these are separate to standard resource pages. I would welcome any thoughts, ideas, alternatives or pointers to anything that may already exist and comments on the feasibility of this suggestion. All the best & Happy Moodling, Jim",

          "Text": "I've thought of this problem a little differently: how to have inside section navigation .  The scroll of death occurs at the section level. My current version of this is simply using Bootstrap tabs, as above.  You then have 1) section to section navigation down the course menu and 2) inside sections navigation via the Bootstrap tabs, there are downsides to this. But it is the quickest and simplest I can come up with at the moment. Jim, this may not work with your staff if they have lots of 'activities'.  How I cope with this is I put only one forum per course (generally) and the tasks are set up where I say \"Week 3 post: reflection\" in the tab, and they just go to the forum and do the post. If I need to point to a tab I say \"go to Major assignment > Teach\".  There are ways to get inter tab navigation, but I have not had time to sort this. Notes: Ideally I'd like sections down the side, and subsections navigation along the top .  This is not a complex solution, just requiring coding (which takes $$) one reference \"specifiy which sections are inside a section\" notes here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=341983 and here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=316278 The solution will be for a plugin or a format. (I'm not sure if core Moodle is interested in this issue, at least I have seen no evidence of this) There are complex solutions with accordions etc, but most of them are not responsive and don't meet my needs. (ie Simple inside section navigation) (insert here the various formats: xxx      none of them really work well, but I am open to push back on this view) I don't like Moodle pages .  Once you click on a page, you loose all the navigation except the breadcrumbs.  There are subpage options that you have found.  The click to go somewhere, then click to come back is such an old school navigation. Snap has some of this built in but is now 2 versions behind on the plugin database John, orphaned categories, yes, but so complex and wearying!! My 2c -Derek",

          "Text": "Hi Lisa - This question really doesn't have anything to do with usability . This was probably a better question for the \"General help\" discussion. In any case, Moodle 1.9 has been out of support since July 2012 . It will be difficult getting help with it any more. Looking at the file and line you have mentioned in the code repository , there is no \"iscomplete()\" function call. I searched that entire file and could not find an occurrence of that call anywhere. I also did a search of the entire 1.9 codebase and could not find any occurrence of the \"iscomplete\" function. My guess is that you have made customizations in your code. And somehow you have lost some of those customizations. If you have another site with the same code at that line number, and it is working, then it must still have the customizations you need. Looking at the attachment you provided, the file has definitely been customized. It looks like it has the old \"Activity locking\" hack added to it (probably this - https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Development:Activity_Locking#Table_of_Versions ). The function that hack provided has been part of Moodle since some version in Moodle 2. It would be best if you upgraded to a the latest (3.2). Hope this helps.",

Is there any possibility that it can find partial matches? ex) When searching for users to enrol, if I search for \"moodle\" then I should be able to find \"moodle\" in the result. But in case I search for \"odle\" then also I should be able to find \"moodle\". Some faculty staff members inquired me on the topic above. They want to make partial matches possible. If you have any idea to make it possible, could you please tell me the way? Best regards,",

I thought the best solution was to award a badge that expires after two years. It works great but there is no functionality to send out periodic emails when the badge gets close to expiring. Is there a way to do this? If i had to develop this myself where would be the best place to start? Thank in advance, Casey",

That way the students are clear on the fact that the certification is limited in time, but they do keep the badge on their \"wall of honor\".

          "Text": "We installed 3.1 before our Fall quarter. I feel that 3.1 is a good system and it has many wonderful updates. I have noticed a pattern of email, phone and in-person questions and comments about the new Gradebook (we had 2.7 before) and the new Assignment Grading tool. I am not sure who or how to share these comments besides in here. If there is a better place, please let me know. Gradebook 1) The Weight collumn doesn't have a total. Our faculty are confused that they don't see 100% at the bottom of the Weights column. It is making them question the weighting calculations. 2) when you weight, if you don't type in a value that equals 100%...the sysem will change the numbers to make it 100%. It would be nice if a message appeared or an error saying that their values don't equal 100 so they only need to change one or two weights. Now they would need to change most or all since Moodle changed them to make it 100. Assignment Grading Tool I like this tool, but I am seeing some issues that faculty are not liking... Issues / Comments more clicking sometimes when in the tool, the next arrow link will not work, freeze requiring the instructor to get out and back into the assignment each grade requires a save button click and the next button. The tool is a little slow and take time. 1) The View all submission button takes them to a page that will not allow instructors to enter grades. Instructors want to be able to enter a \"quick\" point value on this page. The other option is to go to the Grades > Single view and \"override\" all to type in the grades, but the \"override\" freaks them out. I hope this information is helpful.

It\nwould be very useful if the question type icon would be displayed, too. This would facilitate finding certain questions especially when\nmanual grading is used for many questions and different question types\n(essay, file upload , short answer, numerical ,...). Usecase: We use this when grading summative examinations where we don't want students to loose points for typos or grammatical errors in short answer questions. We also use it for calculated, simple calculated and numerical questions where a wrong decimal separator (comma for english language or point for german language) leads to zero points - although the student gave the right answer. Feature request: There is a feature request regarding this on Moodle Tracker : MDL-53814 Vote, comment, conribute: If you feel this is a helpful feature please vote. If you have further suggestions or an even better solution how to facilitate finding the right question, please comment. And of course it would be greate if someone could come up with a code solution!",

There are question types (e.g. qtype_kprime) where students have to select options as in multiple choice questions. Even if teachers try hard to create unequivocal and unambiguous options, they sometimes only realize after the exam that an option specified as wrong in certain cases might be correct. To be able to give points to those students who selected this option, manual grading is needed.",

Wouldn't it be more appropriate to have a social media category including, for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn et al?  These are portals that are actually used by the majority of course participants nowadays. Yes, I know it's possible to put them in by hand, but I really think they should be available by default.  It would at least look a bit more up to date than ICQ, AIM and Yahoo.  I also can't imagine this would be hard or costly to implement.

The easiest to do, using current Moodle capability, is to just add an HTML link to the next activity, into each grade band of the Overall Feedback. 2. If you have the Generico filter installed, you can add a button similar to the Gradient Toggle, with HTML link to the next activity, also in each grade band of the Overall Feedback.

The maintainer does have a version for 2.7 on his github, but he has not released it or done any further development. Having said that, I do have the version for 2.7 running on Moodle 3.1.1+. It has a bunch (6) of missing language strings noticeable only when you check permissions, but otherwise does seem to work okay for admin, teachers, managers, and students. I usually fix those kinds of problems for myself, but haven't bothered to for this plugin, yet. I have one copy of the block installed on my Moodle front page , and have it configured to show on Any page, of my site. This makes it always available for everyone. Everyone can add or remove bookmarks, only for themselves, and the bookmarks they see are ones only they added.",

I installed version 2.5 and it works quite nice, though the icons disappear when you hover with the mouse over a bookmark (in Windows Edge web-browser). I saw v.2.7 in the GIT hub, but I cannot find a way to download all files as a ZIP. How do I download the latest GIT version of the User_Bookmarks plug-in for standard installation in Moodle? Furthermore I found another kind of Bookmark plug-in in Moodle repository: Bookmarks (within book chapter) for Moodle v.2.8. I installed this too, but the installation crashed on a nasty error, which blocked all my Admin navigation possibilities. This plug-in needed an accessibility-subfolder (with certain files?) in the block-folder. I guess this is an obsolete function. So eventually, I found a way to deinstall and delete all traces of this plug-in. Friendly regards, Rolf Moodle 3.0 on WIMP",

As for the 2.7 github download, when you first go to the Source control URL , up and over to the right should be a button labeled, Clone or download. When you click it,  select download ZIP. When you extract everything in the Zip file, drill in until you see the folder named, user_bookmarks. It is that folder and it's contents that you need to replace the the version you already installed.

However I found a couple of questions didn't have enough info to really point me to where I should go. e.g. the one I remember best was the question on the calendar didn't say which course's calendar was to be changed. I guess it reflects reality when I couldn't find what I thought was the right place and just gave up and pick the closest thing I'd found, but it might also be skewing the results if that wasn't the intended effect (meaning the question becomes invalid).",

          "Text": "One of the aspects of Moodle that has been frustrating in my support of faculty is the inconsistent behavior of the software's response to interaction. In some instances, you have to click \"Save\" in order for changes to take, in others, you don't. For example, in the gradebook, when you select assignments in order to move them into a category, you need only to choose the category you want to move them to in the \"Choose...\" list and it responds automatically with no \"Save\" or similar action required to initiate the action. Same goes for manual grades in the gradebook. You can click into the grid of students and change grades, but no \"Save\" is needed. Yet with other tasks related to course or assignment editing, a Save trigger is required. Make up your mind one way or the other. Otherwise we have to explain that certain procedures have an exception in the steps compared to other processes. Feature-related: If there was a way to do front-end editing for content text that would save us TONS of time instead of having to click through Edit links. If Labels had an option to prevent anyone but course designers to edit them, that would save a TON of time undoing the edits instructors make in places where they shouldn't be editing. Some faculty use a discussion forum for 1-to-1 private interaction with students. However, it setting these up takes a lot of time to manually edit the group names to match student names. Seems like there should be a better solution for this kind of interaction either in naming groups by student name or creating a new Forum type for this special need. Forums need to be graded with rubrics like submission assignments. This is a high priority for us.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodle Community, Me and my partner are College Students majoring BS-Information Technology at Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology in the Philippines. We are doing an Undergrad Study on a Usability Analysis of our school's Online Learning Environment, MOLE which uses moodle as it's core and the Essentials theme . MOLE was created to be the primary e-learning tool for our university website however it is underused due to it's being intimidating, confusing and inefficient (we did a preliminary survey for this) for most students and teachers which is why they prefer using Edmodo or Google Classroom. As such, with our usability study, we wish to shed light on its lapses. Target for our study are both Teachers and Students as new MOLE users I am a complete novice to moodle, I am not familiar with it's functionalities nor with it's features. So I thought it would be a good idea to ask for help from you guys. Especially those who are familiar with usability tests and/or have done some themselves, as well as being experienced in using the Essentials Theme. We would like to ask for help in creating the tasks that would be make this Usability Test successful, as well as all and any reference materials you guys could redirect me to research on. The current goal of our study are as follows. To gain insight on MOLE and/or Moodle features. To conduct a usability test and identify areas that lead to user intimidation, complication and confusion To establish and recommend a list of changes for the improvement of the current usability of the MOLE. Now we have been reading the moodle usability documentation page, as well as the reference links there, along with other journals I found in google scholar and proquest. Though from our readings we have more unecessary questions than we would care to admit (ex. is moodle a LMS or LCMS or an online leaning environment?) so your feedback would be most helpful in directing us to the right tract. Also I have watched and read about the development of moodle 3.2. Their discussions regarding the design direction they should take moodle on have also been good reference materials. So, when this Usability study is finished, we plan on posting it here. Hopefully it will be an asset to the moodle community. I will be posting an .rar file containing screenshots of MOLE for those interested. Here is also our unviersity website. https://www.msuiit.edu.ph/",

          "Text": "Hello, Just a thought and maybe one that isn't worth that much attention, but I was wondering whether anyone else saw a possible benefit (assuming it's possible) to being able to log in as a generic group or grouping member. I am using groups and groupings and have had occasions where students weren't able to log in as I thought they would. I try to be careful to log in as one of the students in each group or grouping to see what they can see, but I obviously have missed things. Besides, I need to log out and in again each time. Changing my role to student doesn't show me which groupings are set. Having said that, the information provided for the teacher view is getting better all the time, with the lines added for activities saying which group or grouping you need to be a member of in order to see them. The ability to hide activities so only particular group/ings can see them is really useful, too. Also, this way also leads to featuritis, I suppose. Also, today's class went pretty will with everything working the way I expected it to. I had students sign up for particular groups which then made URLs for three links I wanted to jigsaw to appear to only the students I wanted it to. It went without a hitch this time, but that wasn't the case for another class I tried to set up. I think I overdid it with limitations set to particular groupings and to particular time frames. Which reminds me that the settings regarding availability wouldn't be easy to simulate logging in as. Hmmm. Just wondering. Probably I'm just missing something obvious, which would be good to know.

A few years ago, users could choose a \"Screenreader\" option in their User Profile but I don't see that option any more.  Is there anything that can be done to make a Moodle quiz (Multiple Choice, Matching, Short Answer) fully accessible to users who are blind and using VoiceOver?  I tried to access it in the Moodle App but it appears that the Quiz is not currently viewable and I can't find a setting for making the quiz viewable in the app. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

So again, I'd be asking on what basis an \"expert\" would be raising such concerns and what the suggested alternative is.

HTML has been around for around 25 years, the numbers after it (e.g. HTML5) basically indicate standards the version complies with. Although people had been using components of HTML5 for a few years prior, between HTML4 and the new standard HTML5 being recommended by W3C was a 15 year gap. The standards for HTML5 where only finalised in 2014 so whenever the next version will be standardised is anyone's guess but I'd wager on it being years rather than months. A Google search will bring up plenty of hits stating HTML5 is the future; not many (if any) will say you're wrong to use it. To reiterate, Moodle is basically irrelevant to your issue. What you develop in Captivate is platform agnostic, to not publish a cross-platform learning object (which is where your reference to HTML5 comes in) from Captivate at this time based on doubts re \"the longevity of HTML5\" is illogical IMHO . If , and that is a ridiculous \"if\", HTML5 died tomorrow, simply open the project in Captivate and republish to another option; there's plenty of them (see here for example). I really would love to hear what alternatives this expert is putting forward, as I said in the original reply I'm not endorsing Captivate (it's just one tool of many) but I don't see what the issue with HTML5 could possibly be.

He doesn't trust Adobe to support itself and while I agree that they love to change very small things and not make things backward compatible, it's not exactly the same as the HTML code it creates not being able to run on the internet. I also use Storyline among other visual HTML authoring programs but that's just another thing for him to disagree with. I'm going to try again once more to convince them not to throw away something easy and very good looking because it might die in the next 25 years... believe it or not I almost put \"expert\" in quotations! His experience is more of web programming, and Moodle and Captivate are new concepts for him. He knows a lot and is doing this mostly out of concern for the investment but I suppose I will have to do a module, time it, and calculate the cost vs the longevity of the language. At least if they see that it will break even after 3 years or so, they won't be so hesitant to make the investment. I can foresee the next argument being HTML6 will force us to do it all over again. Anyway thanks for the advice.",

We have a new instructional designer here who refuses to use Captivate which is down to being conversant with Storyline rather than thinking of the end user (\"Storyline is easier to use\"; this to me does not negate the fact it still doesn't do responsive at this time therefore has a negative impact on the end user IMHO) .

          "Text": "It's definitely been an issue brought up by our faculty. The 3.1.1 fix for the panels was helpful, but, part of the issue is with the auto-pdf generator. Moodle complements our face-to-face/on-site program, and many of the faculty prefer to do writing annotations on paper. We are a language program so many of the levels only do short amounts (e.g. a paragraph is quite long for some low-levels) and the ability here is simply not as necessary (or as fast) as doing it by hand. I prefer the electronic method either way, but, I'm not teaching the courses so I defer to their preferences. We also have many assignment submissions with Poodll, also making the auto-pdf generator unnecessary. Each time you move through a submission, you have to accept the warning message that a file is corrupt or missing when there simply is no document file in the first place. As a student who has taken many online courses in Moodle as a graduate student, I completely understand that the majority of asynchronous coursework will be document based, but even when turning in links to something like a Google Doc, or a website, the auto-pdf viewer pane is just completely out of place. The dynamic editing/collaboration ability through Google Docs is far better than just a one way annotation. I wonder if there would be a way for developers to turn that pain into a web-browser (the way Doctopus and Goobric work) to really put everything in once place if the submission was in fact a link. It has potential for sure, but there is some design work that needs to be done .",

So I wouldn't want to use a sledge hammer to crack a nut as it were.  But equally wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel. Any thoughts on time taken to implement LTI would be welcome but in my experience these things are never as simple as they might seem in theory due to their generic nature. I was thinking more of having a link from the non Moodle LMS and automating the logon and opening of the relevant course.  As the Moodle instance will only have this task (the running of single activity SCORMs from this one non Moodle LMS) we do not have to be concerned by other types of processing, types of resource, and/or other requirements.",

As the moodle user base is huge, we may consider people have diffrent opinions and likes and is better if we could provide choices for people. I think one of the major problems with Moodle development nowadays is that \"fear\" of adding new settings. We already have more than a thousand, a few more cannot be a real problem. Of course Moodle is open-sourceand everyone can make the needed chances to adapt to his/her own way, but I think a good software is made of good defaults and when it cannot have only one way, it provides options.

The new recycle bin functionality adds 5 new settings. 2 are clearly sensible: how long to keep things in the recycle bin before deleting the old data so that cannot be restored any more. Certainly one size does not fit all here. 2 are borderline: to let you turn off the functionality. I actually wonder if this is necessary. It is clearly a good feature, so why would you want to turn it off? (Answer, because it uses backup and restore, so that might make deleting a course much slower.) 1 is (in my opinion) clearly a pointless thing to let admins change, as I explained above. It is not about 'dumbing down'. It is about not wasting peoples time with things they don't need to be bothered with. Where possible, developers should get things right (or good enough) once and for all, rather than giving up and leaving it up to admins. It is not just admins. If you have different settings, then you have to start testing with all possible values of the settings. That is only worthwhile if the different values of the setting are really useful.",

I kept the setting as the recycle bin had been used extensively at the university of Kent (see https://github.com/unikent/moodle-local_recyclebin/ ). I did a lot of refactoring of the code and did remove one of the settings they added, but was not 100% certain about the auto-hide feature. As a developer it is hard to say with 100% certainty that you are doing the right thing from a teachers' perspective. That being said, after using the recycle bin feature more and more I have found myself being irritated by the link not being displayed - but that is as a developer, not a teacher. I am not opposed to removing the setting completely. We do not offer this setting for other links, so maybe teachers would not expect such functionality to exist? Though, is this a good enough reason not to introduce it? I created MDL-53699 and chucked up some code that does this. If we decide to remove it all we need to do is peer review and push that for integration. Cheers!",

Most developers recognize that the end user is likely to be closely related to Neanderthal, so tend to over control things. Most admins I know believe that users want to just break things, so want as much control as they can get, to prevent stuff from happening. Whilst I do know users who should never have been allowed out of the creche, the majority are hard working, conscientious, and almost completely ignorant of what tools they use. They only use the bits they know, and rarely seek to reach beyond their comfort zone. They become banshees when something goes wrong, wearing admins down with their incessant bleatings about how they have deleted something and want it back as it is irreplaceable. They rarely acknowledge my question of \"If it was so important, why delete it?\", usually with a sniff and a look that tells me I am treading on dangerous ground.

So is the recycle bin available to Students as well as course editors? (I am assuming that the recycle bin referred to by Tim is different than this one in the Docs.) So does it need to appear and disappear depending on current mode or current state? Why can it not just be there, available through a menu item, whether empty or not? I know you can hide the recycle bin icon in either MacOS X or in Windows, but keep the functionality. You can also remove the functionality altogether, but why would anyone want to?

In my view the time that a recycle bin is most important is after students have submitted work. It might be handy at many other times but it tends to get very exciting if you delete an activity with students work in it. I believe we are talking about only one recycle bin. There is a scenario where an admin would hidden from everyone except admin to encourage them to be careful and then when they do delete something accidentally they can demonstrate their awesomeness by doing a voilà I have rescued you from your carelessness trick. To be more generous, keeping the recycle bin feature hidden could discourage people from depending on it and then finding that the delete cycle had removed content from it.",

Although this would seem to be a partial solution, I was hoping that, by preventing or prohibiting users from viewing a block on the block's Permissions page, Moodle would automatically hide or display the block, depending on whether a user was enrolled on a course as a 'Student' or 'Teacher' respectively.  Is this something that Moodle can't do?",

On the front page you don't really have people enrolled as teachers or students which makes this not-so-straight-forward as you've found out yourself. I resolved this as follows: Create a cohort called 'teachersandadminsonly' Using 'Bulk User Actions', add anyone who is enrolled as a teacher in any course to that 'teachersandadminsonly' cohort Create a new user role at system level, also called called 'teachersandadminsonly' Using the 'Cohort role synchronization' plugin, sync the 'teachersandadminsonly' cohort with the 'teachersandadminsonly' role On the html block, only allow the teachersandadminsonly user role to view the plugin. Every few months, repeat step 2 in case there are any new teachers in any of the courses. Catherine",

Having plenty of experience using the delete and hide/show actions, I can easily see someone quickly selecting the Delete action for an outcome or grade item when they wanted to only hide it or vice versa.

The gist of it is, why on earth?!!! can we not enable popups for e.g. pdfs, docx, images etc in anything other than main topics pages? The second whinge if you like, it really would be ideal if we could change file behavior from withing a file manager. Migrating from a 10+ year old platform, which although has a really diabolically ugly GUI, actually does all of the aforementioned pretty competently. Have had a look at plugins for enabling web-viewing of pdfs and word within the browser, as far as I can tell there are only a couple, which are reliant on third-party cloud hosting of files. Word is less important (and guess licensing issues apply), but pdf's are nearly universally viewable on most browsers regardless of platform (win, android, mapple, etc)...why is this such a problem for developers to address? At present, it looks as though you need a separate 'topic' for each subject where you want to enable pdf popups or on a separate browser tab. Thus instead of a course structure where you have say..main subject/theme/topic/subtopic (with pdfs, quizzes, external links, media etc), you end up with 100+ Topic/( activities , quizzes, documents, media etc). This structure may well work for 'week to week' course structures, but is far from ideal when you want the whole course accessible and navigable for students. Any ideas? Is it just me or do others find this laughable? How hard can it be to implement pop-up functionality of items within a folder/subfolder? Otherwise am really impressed with the platform...have used Blackboard and It's Learning way back when in undergrad and grad school (10+ years ago). Just not looking forward to having to restructuring the course into one 50+ topic long mess just to enable pop-ups. Doing this for a friend/client who doesn't want to deal with pages/atto editor...and with a lot of mathematical symbols, copying from word, can understand why. Copy/paste is not an option for maritime navigation course with associated charts etc! Would take months... Any plugins or suggestions very welcome! Just need students to be able to view pdfs in pop-ups, and have quizzes linked or in same secton.  Of course caveat being...around 5-7 'chapters', with 3-10 subtopics. 50+ topics with no organization seems pretty messy. Thanks appreciate feedback.",

A shame as it seems this is pretty much one of the few limitations which prevents moodle from eclipsing aforementioned altogether.  The rest of the platform is really solid, and well thought out. But this (idiotic!) oversight is really holding it back... Essentially it limits moodle to short courses organized week-by-week, or where there just isn't that much content to be distributed. Am well aware it's free! and kudos to developers! Not all of us have access to institutional MS and Adobe licences tho.....!! Would be nice if the developer community could fix this...",

Be that as it may, I think I get your point, poorly expressed maybe, but I hear you saying Moodle is flat ( sections and no subsections), you just want to upload PDF's (none of the interaction Moodle is capable of) Have you looked at The Moodle Book resource?

Without having to offer two complete course versions - one for iDevices & one for Windows, what are you doing to get around this. I don't like the zero privacy cloud servers like Puffin or Proton nor do I want to rely on a YouTube account. I do understand some day down the road HTML5 might be a solution but I need something now.

I installed Videoeasy which I could not get to function so, uninstalled it. That seemed to have killed inline playing with Flowplayer. Instead of playing the flv when the page is opened as it used to do, now there's only a link appearing on the page and clicking it starts a download to the desktop and playing in the default player on the desktop. Not saying it's an issue with Videoeasy but it definitely affected the native Flowplayer which doesn't work at all now.

Before for example I had question with 3 choices with 1 to 3 correct answers. Student had to answer every choices for + or - sign if thinks that that choice is right or wrong. F.e.: What are colors of Finnish flag (correct answer is blue & white): a) blue    + b) green   - c) white    + So if maximum points are 1 then each gives 0,33. If there is no - sign in 2nd answer then student only get 0,66 points. If I have understood right I cannot do like this with Moodle... Now I don't get it how I could manage this with Moodle that choice without answer is not a same than wrong answer... Do you get my idea of this? Or do I have to change totally way of doing this? Idea of this is that student cannot get full points by choosing all choices but at the same time choosing wrong answer and get minus points would be little bit difficult to do at this schedule -> that affects a lot total points of exam. Is there a possibility to create sub-questions like my example before and in each choice student have to chooce yes or no?",

Forum threads filtered by date or user. Sidebars inestead of blocks. Jquery effects Etc...

Add custom pages is easy but adding these pages to the custom menu could be messy. Adaptable has several menus to add these pages. Add any content in the course page without blocks is really difficult due the moodle layout. We need to use the regions to add this content using blocks. And normally there are no regions in the course page. We are working to add some regions in this page. Sidebars instead of blocks? I think is better the opposite. In Adaptable you can add information in the frontpage without sidebars, using a configurable grid layout. And all the modern Moodle Themes could allow the use of the default JQuery elements. If you want to add external elements then you can modify the theme easily. The rest of requests ar more complex and needs  specific development.",

          "Text": "The short answer is no and the longer is that there is not a lot of benefit to doing it anyway. (I know its not your idea but bear with me). The web is stateless, it will only ever record when something is requested. If a person goes on holiday, or falls asleep after opening a page with that page it will never record when they \"finished\" with the page. Then there is the question of what value it would provide even if you could report on this information. Imagine you have a 20 page document and one person moved through the pages three hours, gradually moving through the pages. Then another person moved through the pages in 30 minutes at an intermittent pace. Perhaps one person was watching TV and idly clicking on each new page without looking at it, might be the one person or it might be the other. You would not know anything useful. The good news is that Moodle has the best quiz engine in existence and you could use that to find out if the students have actually learned what you hoped. I don't mean to be negative, plenty of other people have asked similar questions. This issues around this have been expressed better than I have on these forums previously but I can't seem to find any links at the moment. Ahh I have just found this one https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=198764 And at the end is this link https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversions.php?plugin=mod_attendanceregister",

I am one of the Moderators on the Themes forum, and I am currently working on a theme I made and have managed to manipulate the calendar quite well so far.  With this in mind I would like to help you solve your Course Events problem. Is there any chance you could post a screenshot of the view of the events you are trying to hide. I suspect that there could be a good chance you can do this using CSS which just makes the course 'event'  hidden from view. On the other hand this might be a good opportunity to have an inbuilt setting so teachers could switch ON/OFF the events in certain courses. In which case this needs to be suggested in Moodle Tracker . Cheers Mary",

For example: you can use one book and put your URLS into the book pages by embedding them in the text editor instead of adding them as URLs. You can also embed your Vimeo video in the text editor of the pages of a book. How important is it to have downloadable files? Would it be possible to add the content of the files to a page in a Book? Or if not, then you can upload the file as a link into the text editor. (Next week on the Learn Moodle course we look at books and you may already have watched the video - if not - it is below. You can link to files and URLs and videos in a Book so all the content of your exercise is included in one place, the Book.",

Many of my students are not successful in my courses because of not being able to take quizzes by the due date. Even though every quiz is open for a week, many are unable to complete it within the timeframe. The only way to get get them into the quiz is to configure an exception for them to have access to the quiz/site after the deadline which is too difficult for me to manage among the 7 courses-250 students I teach every semester. It would be wonderful if MOODLE would contain a feature to set an amount of points to automatically subtract past the closing dates for quizzes. For example: Subtract 5 points for each day past the quiz closing date or grace period. etc... This would greatly enhance the success in my courses!

Thanks for sharing. -Jon",

The only real effect will be to annoy students, who will probably start doing thing like opening the next slide, then switching to Facebook for 5 mins, or making a cup of coffee before clicking next, which will not help them concentrate. (It also implies that the learning is made up of 'slides', which is a bit limited.) Anyway, you don't make these rules, you just have to enforce them. Or be seen to enforce them enough to satisfy the regulators. (If you are forced to implement silly rules, it seems perfectly reasonable to do the minimum required to meet them ) So, all that aside, can you do this in Moodle? You can do almost anything if you write custom PHP code. Moodle is designed to be both an out-of-the-box LMS, but also a platform that is a good basis for customising if you want. However, you do have to learn the best ways to customise it. It might be worth asking a Moodle Partner, or other Moodle consultant, to come and give your developers some training on the specifics of Moodle development, and then also go through your list of requirements and discuss the best Moodle 'hooks', or plugin types, to implement them. Or, the developer docs start here: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/ In terms of the content, do you know about the SCORM standard? If you develop your content as SCORM, then you can use it in any LMS, not just Moodle (if you decided to change again in future) SCORM content is basically just HTML + JavaScript , so it is easy to create, and you can certainly do things like arbitrary time-limits. For testing, the Moodle Quiz is very flexible. For example, you can give different time limits to different groups of students .",

This would highlight which items have changed be another teacher or instructional designer working on the course. A list of deleted items somewhere could also be a useful part of the picture. Labels like \"New\", \"Updated\", \"Deleted\" is what I envision to the right of each item as a general rule. Looking to emulate some of the benefits of track changes in other platforms (Google Docs, etc.), this could help streamline the communication flow for the collaborative course design process. I am not a developer, so this would end up falling to others if the interest was there. Cheers!",

However, it is fundamentally a visual task, so it is never going to be accessible to a blind user. So, we have to ask what we mean by these question types being accessible. They are in many ways as accessible as possible. For example, they do not require the use o a mouse, or touch-screen. They can all be done using only keyboard. That is one ADA requirement. There is a known problem with drag-and-drop into text. The labels are not as good as the could probably be, so it is not as easy to complete these questions while using a screen reader as perhaps it could be. However, Moodle's existing Cloze question type suffers the same problem, and I have never been able to work out a good solution. Suggestions welcome.",

There is actually a forum dedicated to usability and accessiblity if you would like me to move this thread there? I don't know which email you used for emailing Moodle, but I'm not sure how we would find out which sites require authentication (but I'm not the statistics person anyway!) However, I would suspect most of them do - because without authentication, Moodle is simply another website. If you view Moodle courses without being logged in (authenticated) then that is all you can do - view them, read the information, etc. As Moodle is a VLE/LMS, it requires people to have accounts to be able to access activities , participate and handle sensitive materials. (As you can see from our Mission, Moodle is 'open in every way but can be private'.) There is a lot of work going on regarding accessibility so feel free to ask more and explore the documentation (example: Accessibility) and forums more.",

While I'm aware that a lot of this comes down to sites being run by universities and that as a result of this they aren't going to make teaching material free when they are simultaneously charging students, and also restrictions on copyright across countries. Background: I'm writing an essay on “The prospect of a paperless, global information environment arriving is about as likely as that of the paperless office – thank goodness!” Do you agree? Discuss the technical and social considerations and constraints on both the feasibility and desirability of such a scenario. Present evidence both for and against this assertion, and argue your own point of view. - I hope this helps shed some light",

Hosting our server does have its limitations in the number of users who can login at once, right around 60 seems to be our limit.  One other thing I really ask that the students who are going to use BBB get a headset microphone combination, otherwise the instructor is constantly playing traffic cop muting and unmutting students due to feedback. We have looked at Adobe Connect, it is nice, and decided it was just too costly. As for Bluejeans, I never heard of it until your posting.  So I cannot offer any guidance there.",

          "Text": "Hello all - I have a faculty member who is having troubles editing Calculated Simple question types.  He indicates that when trying to edit any aspect of existing question, the variable limits are reset to 1 and 10, rendering the calculated answers incorrect because they don't match the originals.  This feels like a bug to me, but perhaps there's some aspect of the question type design that makes it a necessity?  I thought before filing a bug report I'd see if anyone here had seen similar behavior. To ensure I haven't misconstrued something, here's his original report to me: The bug present in this version of moodle is easily reproducible. It appears to be an error specific to the Calculated Simple type under the “Create a new question…” option in the Question Bank section of a course. When any question of this type is made you must set limits for the variables the question will use. The default setting for these variables is 1 to 10. If you modify these variables to fit your question and save, the question appears to work just fine with the variables you have set; however, if you go back and try to modify ANY characteristic of a question of this type ( name of question, a typo in the question text, the tolerance of answer that it is willing to accept, etc.), these variables revert back to the defaults of 1 to 10. This then renders the calculated answers incorrect, as they do not match the set put forward by the original calculations. I assume this is an error in either how the variables are stored, or how they are indexed to the particular question. Thanks much for any guidance you may have!  We're running Moodle 2.8.7+ Brian",

Does the first save get priority, or the last save, or does it crash? (It hasn't happened to me yet, but it could.)",

I suppose my question is, what are the consequences if I were to use \"Course Completion\" to unlock different badges even if the whole course was not complete at that point?  I could have a badge at 50% of points, one at 75%, etc, that students work obtain progressively.  This seems, intuitively, like a bad idea because the student will not have completed the course and be done with it yet. My work around has been to tie the badge to an activity the student gets access to based on point total then can self complete, something as simple as a previously hidden Label.  This is okay but seems a little clunky.  I could end up with a whole bunch of Labels to stash somewhere in the course. Any thoughts? Josh",

This would be improved if a system wide template course could be used to populate every new course. For example it might have content describing the plagiarism policy and links to the reading list.  This could be done by code that caused the template course to be backed up and restored into each new course. This might be something like for hand created courses in the edit.php file you would add ... $bc = new\nbackup_controller(backup::TYPE_1COURSE, $templatecourseid, backup::FORMAT_MOODLE, backup::INTERACTIVE_NO,\nbackup::MODE_IMPORT, $USER->id); Then execution code and $rc = new\nrestore_controller($backupid, $course->id, bla bla bla What do you think?",

I think most of us would be familiar with the idea of templates, long before we get ti know Moodle, so how difficult is it to extend that idea into our Moodle courses? EDIT: Then I find this in the Docs and after a quick scan see, that Admins are going to have to teach their course creators how to do that, then provide them with the agreed template. In an environment where such standardization is a demand of the workplace, it will work nicely, but where it is not, or where the people who are leaders and are not Moodlers, they are just not going to demand it. They wouldn't even understand the efficacy of such a solution, just looks complicated and for more than a few Admins, I suspect the same would apply. I work in an environment where \"diversity\" is \"encouraged\"... sort of... well- not really, it is actually \"anything new is dangerous\". For the Teachers... oh a Maths Moodle is not the same as a Humanities Moodle... they have different priorities and what worksd ... blah blah... into a round of endless blabbering descending into inaction and meaningless drivel. Or am I being too cynical?",

With other ways of creating content, e.g. by hand or with authentication such as LDAP you only get the course settings (e.g. the format such as Topic or Date).  I suspect there are more courses created with those technologies than by CSV. With LDAP the course is created when the first person enrolled on the course logged in, zero teaching of course creators and so rather attractive to admins. You don't get template content when creating by hand either. I think it would be very easy for Admins to overdo the use of templates and there are only so many commonalities between subjects. Some examples that spring to my mind is having a link to a reading list and details of course re-take policies and contact details of course tutors. This would be blanks requiring completion once the course is created. It's easy to imagine some tutors forgetting to do it and ending up with text such as \"Course Tutor Details go here\" or similar, but you could do a database scan to nudge on these. \" Or am I being too cynical? \" Possibly, or you might be an experienced realist?",

They don't copy it, but vary it sufficiently to make it distinct. Didn't someone else say that there are no new ideas, just variations on old ones? The one thing about anything computerish is that someone has an idea, implements it, then everyone else copies it. Not necessarily because they need that functionality, but because someone thinks it might be a good idea in their own tool set. Doesn't matter if client's think it useful, but as it is included in xyz app, then it should be in my abc app too. So there is a trap there. See the posts here ... a rather sad indictment of how the real world works, I suggest. Adapt good ideas to suit your need, not because they are good ideas. EDIT.... Thinking about this a few more seconds, I seem to recall reading a book on ...erm... Javascript or Java , maybe a programming book, I think it was, oh... years ago, that made a similar kind of point about scripting projects....mmmm.

I've created a visual mockup illustrating the before and after. My first example hopes to improve the cognitive load a user may experience when turning the global editing settings on. At the moment so many tools and options appear that the interface actually slightly readjusts. This may seem small, but the user must re-evaluate what they are seeing. I'm proposing a \"tools when you need them\" approach utilising the commonly used little cog icon to access settings. Anyway, see what you think, and feel free to read more about the reasons behind this suggestion on this blog post .",

          "Text": "\" The feedback thus far has been that it's too complicated\" You are not alone in this. Moodle is rarely criticized for its lack of features but it is criticized for being complex, particularly for administration. I can assure you that even academic and tech-savvy types can find it complex. To it's credit Moodle has gradually become easier to use over the last few years. For example the shorter forms, the use of drag and drop file uploads and the awesome improvements in creating quizzes are huge leaps in usability . At Moodle HQ they have divided work into Front end and back end which should help focus on usability. I know I have not offered any specific tips but I hope it puts your question into perspective. It would be useful if you post descriptions of specific gripes/complexities here as the more people point these things out the (slightly) more likely they are to be addressed. One of my admin issues is that I would like to be able to create a new user \"on the fly\" within a course rather than go to the whole admin interface bit.  My other issue is incomprehensible question types which I have been working on addressing for a long time.",

They also have a chance to see what might make sense to them in light of their curriculum that they would not have thought of otherwise. Just some thoughts. I know it can be overwhelming, it was when I first started as well, but the possibilities kept me moving as I wanted to do a good job for my students.  I know I am more of a pioneer when it comes to technology, but because I learned to do more, so did the other teachers as they watched me teach and heard from their students what we were doing.  You might want to make some of your pioneers who are good with helping  mentors to the ones who are overwhelmed.",

However , I want to create courses that can be duplicated and customised further by individual teachers.  My traditional technique for doing this won't work as the graphics will all link to the original resource. Would anyone have a good suggestion how I can link graphics to resources 'dynamically'? This would mean resources - even SCORM elements - could have a really nice visual clue with a large graphic.

If there is only one Add an activity or resource at the top right, and I am working on adding activities in the weeks say, 4 through 11, I would have to constantly be scrolling back to the top of the page to add the next item. While it would look cleaner during edit mode, I think the convenience of the present layout is more important and saves me time and aggravation. Besides, only the teacher/admin is the one who sees it. Regards, AL",

The problem is put simply: using the upcoming events block (or possibly also calendar block) to show linked, scheduled events from courses. This could possibly be achieved through providing a link in a 'global event', but frontpage users would have to first open the event to find the link, and that is undesirable for usability . For course-subscribers this is already achieved on the frontpage after login: Now what I would like to achieve is that this is visible to ALL site viewers, regardless of login. This would serve as a means for them to be taken to the enrollment page to login and if necessary pay to participate in the course. Thoughts for future development would include thumbnails of the course files. Is there already a plugin that does any of this? Best Regards, Visti Larsen.",

I've completely wrecked our sandbox a few times trying this and that. I also think I don't always have the terminology right when searching for solutions. So I thought I'd reach out and explain in layman's terms what I'm looking for. A bit of background of how we are using Moodle: We're a non-profit/charity delivering services to persons with disabilities. The bulk of our training is various internal medications related training, this is delivered to roughly 1000 people; and compliance training delivered to roughly 1600 people. After care workers have completed medications related training, the training remains relevant for 1 or 2 years, after which they will either do \"refresher\" training every 1 - 2 years OR they will redo the training course again. The compliance training is the same. This needs to reflect as a separate event of some kind. We need to have a track record of when they've completed the same training over. Currently our two biggest issues: - Objective : When a student has been enrolled they get an email sent to them telling them this. A link to the course would be great. - Issue : We don't want any kind of self-enrolment so the solutions out there don't seem to support the admin doing all the tasks. - Current workaround: Don't have one. Currently sending a manual email notification. - Objective: Our internal courses are valid for 1 or 2 years. - Issue: I don't seem to find a solution to make their yearly training to expire somehow in an efficient way. I hope I've explained my situation well enough, however I'm sure you can see it's not the usual way of using Moodle. Any suggestions are welcome. Cheers Steven",

          "Text": "Summary: Which video format should I use in Moodle activities (e.g. html5) and what software (e.g. VideoStudio Pro X8) do users recommend to record these videos to ensure good usability across devices and operating systems, particularly basic iPhone users. Full: I am looking for a reasonably priced video solution and approach that is compatible with as many mobile and desktop users as possible (and also on the Moodle App, if possible). I'd like to avoid any poor UX approaches such as users having to install plug-ins, browsers, enabling features, etc. So, I'd like to know (1) what software to buy/ download and use and (2) what format to export. My research so far has led me to use VideoStudio Pro X8 and export to html5 as a best solution. My sense (unconfirmed) is that html5 typically uses neither javascript nor flash so will basically work on anything but has less functionality than most SCORM packages. So that is not a great answer, but a sufficient one. Sounds like there may exist SCORM approaches that don't use flash, and the best answer I have to this so far was this previous post ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=152379 )  but these seem a bit too technical or unverified.  VisualStudio can screen record, has good reviews, and is affordable. We're not doing a whole lot on that end so it seems more than enough for my needs. Thanks! Tom",

          "Text": "Hallo, In my Moodle online learning environment, I have split up the courses into several chapters and chapters into several lessons and assignments. For convenience of the students, I give an estimation of how much time he/she has to invest in working through a lesson or completing an assignment. Now I want to calculate subtotals of estimated time necessary for all lessons/assignments in a chapter, and totals of cumulated time needed for all chapters in a course. Is there a way in Moodle to do this automatically? Can I use a number-field (integer, decimal, time) and paste this in a text sentence? In which module can I implement such a number-field? How do I let Moodle add up several fields? Where can I display the sum of number-fields? Can this be done Moodle-wide or only in certain modules? Thanking you in advance for your answer, I remain, Rges www.cper.org",

          "Text": "I don't have any \"high level\" principles to offer other than \"don't over think it\", what I have been looking at are things at the other end of the scale, improvements we could practically hope to make: Navigation I recently tried making some user guides for students to show them how to get around (poor navigation being a long standing complaint). Whilst doing this at site level was easy enough it unraveled once I got down into a course because at course level its pretty well \"any old made up\" depending on the presence and position of blocks. We have been trying to address this in our theme ( which you can now see in the Moodle.Org plugins database ). As 2.8 now does users profile links are under their username Like other contributed themes we have a \"my courses\" drop down list We added a \"This Course\" drop down in the navigation which only appears in a course and shows links for the course you are in. This replicates the \" activities \" block on Moodle and adds a couple of other links We plan to move more items into these three areas such as \"blogs\" \"posts\" under the users dropdown list, and other elements within the current course. We have also disabled some blocks: Calendar (we have navigation links into this) Recent Updates (replaced that with CUL Activity Stream which scrolls within the block instead of spewing down the page) Upcoming Events (replaced that with CUL Upcoming Events which looks nicer and scrolls within the block instead of spewing down the page) We also want to disable both the \"navigation\" and \"administration\" blocks for students, once we have moved remaining useful items into the theme navigation: The \"navigation\" block is terrible, having everything essentially means you have nothing, no one wants to use it. We notice a lot of students just dock it to get the clutter out of the way. Why would someone in \"Course A\" want an ever expanding sprawl down the page that allows them to dig into \"course B\" down to the level of a single PDF and open that PDF from another course when it is quicker, easier and frankly saner to go into that other course and find it? Rival Processes for File Upload The file picker is an ongoing problem for us as we use repositories, but many staff use the \"rival\" process of drag and drop into the course page, a particular problem with video as drag n drop adds the video file into the course whereas using one of our repositories sends it via Kaltura which transcodes it allowing video to play on any device. One option would be to drag files into a block (allowing use of repositories) and drag files back from there. Another would be upon dragging into a course to ask which repository it should go into. Inconsistent Assignment Settings We value the flexibility offered by mod/assign and almost every feature is used by someone soemewhere, the downside is again we have \"any old made up\" in many courses. A simple example is some staff set \"require submit button\" and some don't which confuses students. I know another University ripped out lots of features from assignment settings to get consistency but as I said, we don't want to limit what staff can do. I do not subscribe to the idea you should reduce Moodle functionality to the lowest common denominator. That said some kid of wizard / workflow would go a long way so that instead of throwing staff straight into the morass of assignment settings there could be a two step process allowing the selection of \"templates\" which pre-populated certain presets and allowed staff to enter only minimal information. One of the options there could be \"no template, I want to start from scratch\". Activity Chooser The distinction between \"activity\" and \"resource\" no longer cuts it for us as we have a growing list of items in the list, often closely related but ad different ends of the list. Big Blue Button being a good illustration. The BBB session (online lecture) is an activity which appears near the top. The \"recordings\" are a resource type which also needs to be embedded if you want to give students access to recorded sessions. They are pretty well at opposite ends of the activity chooser at the moment. The other issue with the activity chooser as it stands is that staff only tend to use what they know and ignore what they dont, in part because it is disorganised. A better approach ( IMO ) would be to organise by type / function rather than the rather abstract notion of activity or resource. For example add headings for \"Video\" which could include things like BBB, Lecture Capture, Kaltura (or similar) Another heading for \"Content\" which could include pages, labels etc (we are working on another plugin to render labels using Bootstrap elements like Modal, Toggle and would like to expand that to add accordian, tabs etc) I guess with everyone having different setups it would be an idea to make this configurable to a point so admins could move things around different headings if they needed to. I know that could be a lot of work but one of the benefits would be that when staff go to add \"video\" or \"content\" they see relevant options available to them at the time they are editing their course, they know by the heading that it relates to what they are trying to do at the time and thus maybe more inclined to look at things they have not used previously. Hope that is of some use and doesn't upset anybody",

I DO prefer the navigation block for this reason: once you click to open a \"folder\" (or a level), you can leave it open or click again to collapse, you can go away with your mouse and the information is there. also, it's contents are mostly generated on ajax calls, what makes it lighter than most drop-down menus we see that preloads all content. same things apply to administration block.

There are a few changes I would like to explore to make grading easier.  I plan to assemble a fix-list to send to the University when they upgrade and maybe others might appreciate my finds. 1) minimize (remove?) the e-mail column as default.  I wonder if it has any value since it is not even a useable link. 2) Change the grade column from percentage to a fixed width or set it to a thinner column. 3) reformat the Last Modified column to numerical dates instead of spelled out words which take up a lot of space. The list goes on. I am not asking how to do these things, I am just asking for someone to tell me where to go.",

We've seen that Restore course link is added in this section, and we think it could be nice to add \"Add a new course\" link the same way \"Add a category\" is. Also we think that \" Upload courses\" and \"Upload users\" (CSV feature) have to change their text. We have many users failing to restore course through this links, because they are uploading mbz files instead of csv. We recommend to change the text by Upload bulk users/courses or something similar, in order to reduce this errors. Otherwise, We also recommend to review all the restore vs import texts. When you try to restore a new course, the first section ask you to import a backup file... and there are many things like this. Import is always aiming to import activities while restore is used to restore backups. But the user is not alsways thinking about restoring a backup, many times the user is thinking abou importing a course they downloaded for free from another website... What do you think about that?

For example, one part of my site will allow students to set goals.  In order to do this, they must set an overall goal, then determine how to reach this goal.  They will then set up numerous sub-goals (with even more under these - as many goals, sub-goals, and levels of goals as necessary) to help them reach their main overall goal. Is it possible to set this up in a way in which they could come back periodically and review the goals they previously set?  They will need to check off completed goals, review and update future goals, make notes about previously achieved goals, etc.  This will not require a time frame in which to work, nor exams, grading, or many other things associated with normal coursework/ Moodle. This is just one of a number of things of this nature that I can see as being beneficial to my students, so this would be a great feature to have for my site. If you need any more information, please feel free to ask.  I'm typing this at 11:30 at night, so I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out vital information.  Thanks for any help that you may be able to offer!

          "Text": "An accessibility report on one of our sites raised the issue that it had a number of nested fieldsets (for example, when creating a new event, the start date time control is in a fieldset inside the general fieldset). While this is valid HTML, it is not handled well by screen readers (from my research and testing with NVDA). Now the date and date time mform selector is not very accessible (there is no accessible structural connection between the label and the form entry fields) and I was wondering what the approach should be to fix this. My first thought is to make the label the legend for the fieldset, but as screen readers don't handle it well, it's not a great improvement. Another thought is to make it labelled by multiple controls, but again that isn't handled well by screen readers. The question becomes, should we work towards valid uses (and wait for screen readers to catch up - I'm not sure how well they can do this) or work towards something that screen readers can support now (and I'm not sure what this is yet)?",

I am using v2.6 at work, but have v2.8 downloaded at home. I have tried the Accessibility buttons, but they just knock out any existing background colours. I have also tried the plugins on various Browsers. I'd like to make it easy for staff to use, but the only solution I can find is to tweak the HTML editor and use tables. I am not the Admin-guy, but I think we have the Clean Theme, it uses dark grey lettering with off-white background. I did come across the Topic:Colour plugin, which I installed at home, but if you create a resource like a book or page, the background colour is not transferred. It reverts to white. In a ideal world, I'd like the same colour to run through all the resources in one particular course (ie Maths for Beginners) and then a different colour for another course (ie Intermediate Maths), so the students have visual clues to their location - like arriving in a new town, you can work out where you are from just looking around, if that makes sense!",

          "Text": "To clarify my question, a bit: Given all this talk about 'Personalised Learning', is it possible for students to change the background colour, to something that makes the text more accessible for them? Specifically, I am thinking about dyslexic learners, where it has been identified that pale blue, or cream paper works best for them. I have tried the Accessibility Buttons on Moodle, and the Plugins on various Browsers, but the results are not quite right. They tends to knock out all existing background colours - which means the disadvantaged user is still missing out. It's a bit like wearing sunglasses, the sky might be less bright, but it is still blue. Of course, such students could be supplied with transparent overlaps for their monitors. But somehow, this solution seems a bit primitive and pre-digital. And it wouldn't work so well, if they then moved devices, eg from wide-screen PC to hand-held iPad. Although our Moodle theme has been designed to comply with all the DDA and Equal Opps stuff, it still relies on the assumption that 'one-size-fits-all', and anyone who is slightly different, be they dyslexic, a reluctant reader or 'just a luddite' is probably going to find the whole experience of Moodling, a little bit unpleasant. I will have a go at creating 'clones' or multiple themes, for different people. But again, this solution takes the agency away from the user and implies in a traditional-teacher-voice, \"I know what best\". In a BYOD world, how far can Moodle accommodate different expectations?

What you propose sounds like a good idea, but the problem is that there are not that many people in these forums who do that much coding. Many do not know anything about coding, or are not interested in it. Most, I suspect, are like me, have little or no idea about PHP, but know something about coding, and will tinker with their Moodles, and other PHP apps they use, but there are very few full time developers. Those who are, are usually too busy to help with such a project. The tinkerers knowledge ranges from little to lots, and can usually give good advice on how to do some things, but they do not trust their own project development skills, and often with good reasons. Perhaps your best bet would be to continue your design work and start the basic structural work yourself. As you learn more, and start to learn what questions you need to ask, there are plenty of people here, and elsewhere, who could help with specific advice, even if not the actual coding, in the Developers Forum. There are also other forums where tutorials and further support for PHP- MySQL / PostGres app developers can be found, I am sure. You might want to start with the Zend forums. Good luck and I hope it works for you...",

When I clicked the next button after spending a very long time typing text and completing the task on the page I was left with only some debug info on the screen. This was a v2.6.1 so no autosave and I lost everything I had typed. Not good !!!! This is hack will let you run a quiz with very long tasks while maintaining a short session time out. While the quiz attempt pages are open it keeps the users session alive - forever. Once the quiz has ended the session will timeout as normal. This is for quiz mod v2.8.1 but easy to get working on older versions. Copy the attached files to mod/quiz, flush your cache and the go to : Site administration -> Activity\nmodules -> Quiz -> quiz | keepalive To activate session keep alive tick the box and save. You will see a security warning at the top of your quiz. Also a good idea to make sure autosave is turned on. The keep-alive is set for 4 mins so even the shortest 5min session timeout should not timeout. If anyone shows interest I may add a select box so the user can set the ping time. Longer is better.",

If there was a way to streamline this process I think people would love it.  Possible solutions include: 1. A keyboard shortcut to toggle editing. Clicking the keyboard shortcut would turn editing on and return you to the section you were currently viewing upon page load. 2. A separate button in each section to toggle editing. This button would perform the same function as the keyboard shortcut. 3. A floating edit button. ( I'm personally not a fan of this option, for various reasons ). 4. Options 1 & 2. I'm aware that a course can be configured to show only the current section, however most instructors I've talked to prefer showing the entire course on a single page. Does anyone else think this is a good idea?",

Usability guidelines like Olli's making are good, but some of the problems listed here are systemic and guidelines won't necessarily help e.g. the tendency for too many preferences to be added. The article reminded me of a point Tim raised in his thoughtful blog post last week about the views of geeks and the complexity of e.g. the update quiz interface. At the time, I agreed that the fact that teachers were keen on keeping all of the preferences showed that they were valuable. Now, I'm not so sure and I think it may be an artefact of the open source process which leads to lots of minor settings being added, which overwhelms the UI. I'm particularly aware that discussing whether to change things mostly happens on these forums and that we are all, by definition, the power users and therefore not the best people to be judging things. I think what's needed is some formalised way of testing new interfaces with novice users. I'd be happy to get the opinions of my colleagues and students (the ones who are a bit technophobic) if there was some way of feeding that information back in a standardised and useful way.",

There has been I think some greater focus on providing user testbeds, but as I think you are noting, tester selection is far from random or broadbased..... On the otherhand, there have been quite a few comments about making the GUI extensible and adjustable from inside moodle so that the quiz ui, for example, can be easily customized with the features sought by Tom, Dick, or Harry.

          "Text": "At the Open University we do periodic user testing (by employing some of our real students to test). However, we generally concentrate on our own new features rather than Moodle core. By the nature of user testing, it is not at all a reliable method for drawing firm conclusions 'is this usable' or 'does this suck'. This is true of virtually all user testing. The reason is that user testing takes an extremely small sample of people, who are self-selected and may not be entirely representative (i.e. we don't offer that much pay, so you have to be either really in need of money, or really motivated to help us improve) and puts them in an unrealistic situation, etc. However, you can learn valuable individual points from the individual users involved. Also, ours should be not-that-unrepresentative because our students are generally adults from a wide age range etc. (As compared to studies using students in a 'traditional' university where they're all young adults.) When I see videos of user testing I am always shocked. Here are two recent fun examples: 1. Student who couldn't find the 'save' button on a form because it's off the bottom of the screen (yes, he knew how to use scrollbars... he just didn't think to). As a lesson learnt from this, we are placing a solid background colour on all forms in our theme (instead of the current thin border). My hope is that, because this clear chunk of background colour extends right to the bottom of the visible display, it will make clear that there is more form afterward. I don't know if this will actually work or not Hope so... 2. Student who couldn't figure out how to create a page in our wiki. He clicked the help button next to 'Help with creating pages', and appeared to be reading the popup help, but did not get as far as the heading midway down the help screen 'Steps to create a wiki page' or the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbered list below it. The lesson learnt from this basically that not only do people usually not read online help, but even when they think they're reading online help, they might not be. Basically we need to make sure that all necessary information is available on the main screen, while keeping it extremely short (or people won't read that either). In this case we are adding a 'Create new wiki page' button at the bottom of the wiki screen. Obviously our students are not at all stupid (they are studying at university level). So the third thing to learn, from these examples and others, is that end users, without being stupid, are incredibly bad at using computer software. I mean that in the literal sense of incredible - as in, they are so bad that we as developers and expert users actually can't believe it. And it's not just some people who are bad at using computer software - as I said, these usability tests involve very small samples, but I don't remember seeing a usability test report with a single person who didn't have huge trouble using at least one relatively straightforward part of the software (e.g. scrolling, or reading help). One other thing I wanted to say about user testing is that any suggestions that test users make directly will almost certainly be unhelpful. They don't know how to use the software - why should we expect them to design it for us? But that's not a problem - the valuable information they provide is basically what they do (and what they say about why they couldn't figure it out). From that point it's up to designers to come up with feasible ideas that might improve the situation. And finally, I think user testing can be helpful but it's slow and expensive and should probably be the last resort. There are lots of cases where you can already see (without involving users) that something really sucks; there's no point paying people to tell you that. Fix it first, then do user testing... But in our case, user testing also provided a justification to schedule the development work to make these improvements. --sam PS As with everything I say, these are all my own opinions and not my employers'",

          "Text": "Thanks, Matt for opening this discussion. I think your thought that bad design it is an artifact of open source, is interesting. I would be inclined to think so, too. But then, how do strong designs like Firefox or Gnome appear? The answer it seems, is that open source does not exclude great design. There simply has to be a strong vision about which user goals of which users we are to serve. On one hand, Moodle started from broad user goals - on the other, those needs are not explicitly stated anywhere in enough detail to drive design. In Cooper's terms, we are riding a tiger: users dictate what we do, since we lack a strong enough vision ourselves. But strangely, Moodle is somewhat successful. In Cooper's terms: the wonder is not that the bear dances well, but that it dances at all. Joel Spolsky also had his say about this . Both the arts of requirements engineering and of user centered design promote the idea that we do not do great design by asking users what they need, but by really understanding their actual goals and being capable of translating those needs into designs. Users only know what they need when they see it done. In practice this means that the two jobs need to be separate. Programmers used to do their own testing before it was discovered that it requires a different skill set and it is more productive to save the programmers' time for development and architectural design. similarly designing user interaction is whole another ball game, it makes sense to really stop and think about the division of work. This is in no way contradicts making open source software. Then, when new feature requirements come up that we did not think of, we need to see if we understand that usage need already or if we need to research the context of the goals the feature requirement reflects. When we understand what the users are actually doind, we can a) decide if the user groups really important to us really need this feature b) decide how to integrate this feature in a way that is just prominent enough, relative to its importance - an appropriate balance such that it does not distract existing users. This way, we don't end up just piling features on top of each other in single screens, making users tell the software whether they need those features or not. Since we know the goals of our users, we can make those decisions for the users and let them concentrate on what they really want to do. When we don't have real data, we end up feeling that it is best that users decide for themselves, which is not what they paid for. Which, of course, is nothing, so we end up in a \"collaborative\" design process where the user makes design decisions for us, when using the product, degrading the user experience. The user interface tries to serve everybody equally, and with same kind of interaction for all kinds of users. One size fits all fits nobody well. I am only just learning myself how to really study and model those needs in a way appropriate for open source. I just recommended Cooper's The Inmates Are Running the Asylum to Tim last week, since it discusses the question, starting from the roots of the issue, profoundly, still being a relatively short and an entertaining read. I warmly recommend it to anyone taking part in this discussion. (I am not sure but the example above about division of work might have been from that book.)

I'm a believer in the artisan-developer model (although it's not for everyone) rather than the production-line-developer model. In other words I think some programmers are also good at interface design - and if the same person does both, you can do a more efficient job. Interface design is a pretty core part of development, so programmers are quite likely to have this skill. My personal opinion is that all programmers should have it. The same applies, but to a lesser extent, to other required aspects: graphic design (not so many programmers are good at that) and editing, i.e. writing quality English text (ditto). I don't think all programmers 'should' be good at graphic design or English, but it's certainly convenient if they are. This is not the same situation as the division between programming and testing. Unlike all of the above, programming and testing are actually contradictory to each other - even if you have good testing skills as well as good programming skills, if you wrote something, that automatically makes you less good at testing it. On the other hand I absolutely agree about the 'feature requests vs requirements' issue - nobody should develop what people say they want. Think about it and figure it out first. In Moodle, though, IMO a lot of feature requests do correspond to the underlying requirement - the biggest problem is that Moodle is used (a) by thousands of institutions around the world, (b) from primary schools to universities [and private training too], (c) from organisations who wouldn't know a PHP file if it sat on them, to those with large development teams. These different users are pretty much bound to have lots of different requirements. --sam",

          "Text": "Hi, Going back to the referenced article, which I mostly agree with, there's this statement: Many hackers assume that whatever Microsoft or Apple do is good design, when this is frequently not the case . In imitating the designs of these companies, volunteer projects repeat their mistakes, and ensure that they can never have a better design than the proprietary alternatives. I'm assuming that by \"good design\" the author means easy to use. I'd disagree that copying commonly used UI elements and layouts is bad design in any case. I think good UI design is more to do with making it intuitive for the majority of users. If everyone puts the NEXT button at the bottom right of the page, then that's where everyone looks for it regardless of whether it's better to put it at the top right. Another case that supports this argument is the qwerty keyboard layout, originally invented to slow typists down to stop the keys from jamming on old mechanical typewriters. Subsequent attempts to replace qwerty with more ergonomic, efficient designs have, so far, been unsuccessful. Personally, I look at Amazon, Yahoo! and Google for UI design because I know that they put a lot of research and resources into it. From reading the discussion here I think the main problem that we're trying to express was given a name I heard many years ago - \"creeping featurism\", where software gets new features added ad infinitum until it bloats and then we end up with the 10-90 scenario, where users use 10% of the features 90% of the time.",

Users only know what they need when they see it done.\" I would tend to agree with this. An example is the confusion (at least at my institution) generated by overlapping goals that are addressed both in the assignment interface and in the gradebook. I have seen instructors use moodle for quite some time before they realize that they *can* enter grades in the assignment interface. I find it reasonable to assume that the gradebook gets more and more complex because it attempts to address an increasing number of grading tasks. I always wondered if I would like it better to preserve a stricter separation between the giving of scores/comments (handled by assignment interface) and the calculating of grades (some aggregate of the collected scores handled by the gradebook itself). I am sure a number of people would say \"just put it all in one interface; I don't want to have to go two different places to grade, edit grades, and give feedback.\" I would also suspect that the whole issue is further complicated by the fact that instructors using a traditional grading workflow (face-to-face classroom) might proceed a little differently than by people doing a totally online class. It seems to me that if you studied a sample of \"average\" instructors, you might be able to identify some commonalities in the workflow and use these to inform your design. atw",

          "Text": "As long as there are sufficient people doing actual user research and getting the actual knowledge about users to do the design, and to do the usability testing, it is fine by me if we get really skillful jack-of-all-trades programmers to design the UI. My experience is though that the skill sets do not usually happen in the same person. I am not good at creating a good software architecture. Then again, a crucial property for a UI designer is to be able to sympathize with the users. When you have to go as deep into the intricacies of the constraints presented by the environment you program has to work in, typically you don't have much energy left to sympatize the needs of the users. For one, I could not, when I was also implementing my designs, not nearly as much as I would really have needed to. And that is exactly what you need to be capable of doing, day in and day out. But in a sense I agree: it is often stated that teams need to be multidisciplinary. I have no experience of the ins and outs of this so I can't tell. But at least the designers also have to understand the constraints the developers are facing, and be capable of discussing them, balancing the pros and cons. What I was looking for when I said we need people really devoted to the interaction design, I might have been reaching out for something mentioned in this presentation : The three core attributes. The three questions [critical to any successful UI design team]: Vision \"Can everyone on the team describe the experience of using your design five years [from] now?\" Feedback \" In the last six weeks, have you spent more than two hours watching someone use yours or a comptetitor's design?\" Culture \"In the last six weeks, have you rewarded a team member for creating a major design failure?\" - throw parties for a team member who has seriously effed up, to provide situations to talk about why this failure was such a good learning opportunity about our client. \" Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement\" That's the team I want to work on.

I wouldn't want to work for Phillip Morris or Exxon Mobile either. Success without soul is a choice for many. As a designer though, it seems that soul-lessness is anti-thetical to the artistic roots of design.

I'm a user and end-user trainer as well as an ordinary teacher and Moodler so I tend to see this at the sharp end (especially when someone can't find a feature). I'm not too sure that Open Source is automatically poorly designed but it has the propensity to be because it is often made by developers with a vision and not users with a need. I've posted elsewhere in Moodle forums about the need for consistent language usage, definitions and controls and this is improving in Moodle. (Having said that I've spent the last two days getting colleagues to see how to use less obvious features in Microsoft Word ). The sheer versatility and complexity of Moodle can operate against it because, as has been noted here, it's trying to work in every possible educational situation. I'm not sure there's a simple solution but at least if everyone is aware then there can be some common design elements. For my own part I tend to get my students/users deeply involved in Moodle by using surveys and forums to see how they view the experience and how I can tweek it to make it better. Every response is replied to and the courses adjusted accordingly. I also try, within my limitations, to contribute to Moodle testing, commenting on forums etc. Perhaps that's the solution - keep thinking, using and talking. Thanks for the discussion.

Reading all the comments above has been really enlightening and I feel like I've learned a huge amount. I think it's clear that although there are many good points made about how Moodle there is some need for polishing of the UI to counter some of the tendency towards the creeping featurism (or feeping creaturism) that Matt pointed to. I suggest something similar to the Ubuntu 100 papercuts project . A specifically usability based bugathon style event that would first identify the dozens of little annoyances, rank them in order of annoyingess and then iron them out. I think it'd be a great way to make 2.0 the slickest Moodle yet. Longer term, many of the suggestions in the later version of the article might be adopted as part of the Moodle development process, like: \"Promote small-scale user testing techniques that are practical for volunteers. Develop and promote screen capture, video recording, and other software that makes tests easier to run. Encourage developers to trust user test results more than user opinions . And write design guidelines that give advice on the common small problems that user tests won’t catch.\" (my emphasis - this should avoid issues such as Sam raised) or \"Projects could have a lead human interface designer, who fields everyone else’s suggestions, and works with the programmers in deciding what is implementable. And more detailed design specifications and guidelines could help prevent programmer-specific foibles.\" +1 for Olli as Moodle's UI guru",

I for one don't mind chasing down a rabbit hole, but there better had be some protien at the end of that hunt, for the most part I have found only old skeletal remains.

          "Text": "The problem with most usability testing, in my experience, stems from the way the testing situates a user in a moment in time and doesn't account for increasing skill over time (as a user gains experience with an application). We tend to find a representative user - especially one who is not \"tainted\" by prior experience - and we expose her to the application for the first time, and then she struggles with it (of course). I once had the good fortune to participate in a software-development project in which I served on a user-testing focus group. The group met initially to tell the developers what we wanted the application to do. The very skillful project manager said at the time, \"Don't be surprised if your specs change over time. You think you know what you want, but you don't actually know what you want, and this is normal.\" He was absolutely right! The focus group met every two weeks and reviewed the development of the software, and we learned over time how it worked and how we wanted it to work (both are moving targets, with the danger of \"mission creep,\" as others have noted). If Moodle uses anything like the latter process, I would think it's much more useful than isolated usability testing, which tends to provide rather obvious insights that have less application for the actual user, whose skills evolve over time.

Good to read things from a time were 2.0 was still on horizon =) In fact, 2.0 was a major improvement on usability and everything else. After that, droping all old themes and the adoption of Bootstrap Framework for the new Clean and More standard themes on 2.7 was another important milestone for Moodle. The next big improvement we will have will be on 2.9 (maybe 3.0), mostly for programmers and designers, as Moodle is updating it's Javascript \"libraries and framework\" as discussed on https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=268190 and https://docs.moodle.org/dev/JS_Framework_Specification and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47036 Of course it is more on technical/practical side than the more theoretic/philosofical/methodological talk we are having in old posts, but I think an update would fit here =) Also, as noted by Matt Gibson back on 2009: \"A specifically usability based bugathon style event that would first\nidentify the dozens of little annoyances, rank them in order of\nannoyingess and then iron them out.\" We have a lot of issues on tracker, maby alreasy closed but many still open so it may be a start point: Status Issues Percentage Open 256 24% Reopened 10 1% Development in progress 5 Waiting for peer review 3 Closed 798 74% https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL/component/10309/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:component-issues-panel Now we can begin starting forum discussions to all those interestings features and find the better way to approach them =) Kind regards, Daniel",

For example, when someone like Derek C starts talking about the awkward handling of video, why isn't there a more positive response? If Derek is speaking out, then there might be an issue. These, I suggest are only indicators, they are not, of themselves, usability issues. Many issues are resolved easily, simply, but why have they caused a problem in the first place? One of my concerns right now is that the release schedule is so tight that the innovation it is driving might be interfering with the necessary polishing that should be done with supplementary releases. e.g. instead of a v2.9, how about a v2.8.2, then a v2.8.3, then a v2,8.4 and a v2.8.5 and so on, maybe to a v2.8.9.20.

I found Bb efficient enough to do what I wanted it to do Your version of BB must have been different than the one we had here. Or maybe the people setting it up and running it here didn't know what they were doing. Or perhaps BB was not configured properly, for whatever reason, it kept falling over - especially when accessing test and exam papers. It did not do what I needed it to do, and in no way was it considered efficient. So your experience was a lot better than 250,00 other people that I know about. As far as themes are concerned, the work being done now with Bootstrap sounds exciting, and I am sure the themes are going to look a lot better. With HTML5, and a larger role for Javascript, Moodle will be less confined by PHP, but time is the issue. The work has to be done, sure, but  it is going to take a while. And are those newer themes going to be backwards compatible as well? I would think probably not. Moving forward is critical for the longer term health of any product, but the right changes need occur a lot faster than they do now. Everyone is too busy worrying about things like versatility, flexibility, availability of a long line of tools, but usability is only recently an issue. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the importance of usability has been overlooked in favour of flexibility. But usability is a lot more important than would seem to be accredited. and btw .. don't you just love the way I can murder the English language... with real style...",

Of course, all that may be because I have always found TV as exciting as watching yacht racing, or grass growing and much prefer big screens and decent sound systems. Besides, I learn so much from my computer, every day there is something new to learn... isn't it wonderful?

          "Text": "I have always known that there are people out there who are just not able to update their Moodles as they would like. For example, where I work, our school's Moodle is hosted by a company that was taken over by Blackboard a couple of years ago. We are on v2.5, and while we used to get regular upgrades, these seem to be happening further apart. We cannot upgrade our Moodle whenever we like, we are at the mercy here of the host . That is an agreement made between the original host company and my employer. It sucks, for me - sure, but I live with it. We may be upgraded during our summer break over January, but maybe not, to v2.8.1, or maybe not, and so on. It is not about the importance of updating the technology, it is about the people who are performing the updates. BTW, it is a large site and hosts a lot of Moodles, at least 165 that I am aware of. (How many are active... well I would think a lot now, but it is still early days for a lot of schools. My Employer has gone over to a large, rapacious, software company to provide them with an email/sms/lms/and anything else they want, environment. This has a SSO, but the firewalls are set so you have to log in three to four or five times before it lets you go.  (I figured out why it wasn't letting anyone into the Moodle site at all, but my best guess is that the problem will change soon so we will get frustrated with a Moodle that doesn't work, and switch over to their LMS...as soon as it is ready.)",

There is a User Interface concept called affordance http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/affordance/ Because it is a grid with cells the gradebook looks a little like a spreadsheet and many users will be familiar with that concept, but the gradebook has very little similarity. To give two specific examples I genuinely have no idea how to change the order that items in the gradebook or how to arrange for an item to still exist and be used but to not appear in the gradebook or contribute to the results of calculations (i.e. hide) I don't actually need to be able to do those things at the moment, but in the past I have tried to do them and been stumped. By contrast if I had a need to perform arcane and unlikely groupings and grade calculations and the time to work on them I suspect the gradebook would allow me to do that. At this moment I am looking at the gradebook in the alpha of 2.9 and in the default install the left hand column is occupying about a quarter of the left hand side of the screen.  I know that the Gradebook is being worked on and I also know it is really complex, but it is something that has frustrated me in the past.",

In my experience, an observation like this is usually the starting point for designers to ask questions and do more user testing to pinpoint more specific causes of problems. I have two related questions about usability: 1) Is this forum on usability sustainable over time? and 2) How will anything said here impact the usability of Moodle? I ask Q1 b/c of Helen's comment, \"We once had a forum on usability but it didn't stick,\" and I wonder whether that's b/c people perceived the forum had no practical usefulness. Seems to me that the most useful Moodle community forums have two main features: 1) As a place to get help (\"This feature doesn't work - help!\"), and 2) As a place to ask the people who are creating Moodle if something could be improved, or why it was made that way in the first place. IMHO , the quiz forum is the most useful forum b/c Tim, the guy who maintains the quiz tool, is very active in it - solving problems, explaining why things work a certain way, and so forth. But if no one person is really responsible to advocate for improved usability of Moodle, then how will such things happen in this forum? Someone will say, \"I think x feature of Moodle could be more usable,\" and the response will be ... crickets? Which brings me back to my second question: How does Moodle integrate suggestions on usability, and is this discussion part of that system? I'm aware of a system that tracks suggestions for fixes and improvements, and people can vote on the suggestions. I'd be interested in hearing from someone who works with those suggestions how they actually inform the design of Moodle, or whether there's some other system for incorporating suggestions about improved usability. I'm aware of software design regimes that incorporate formal protocols of regular user testing and feedback, but I've not heard that Moodle has such a regime. Thanks.  -  Peter",

Well, from what I can remember some questions were used more than others across institutions- some elements of sporadic usage and some surprises e.g. UK/other country comparisons, but in the main-this gave an idea about the bigger picture ....oh you must remember surely. Well,  I think there is a hidden methodology in that work, which might be useful to help answer the following questions....not statements Does anyone know what that 20% is? Do different users use\na different 20%. What is taught? How is\nit taught? What sort of content is used? If\nthose were listed / prioritised it maybe better to discuss one feature at a\ntime in terms of what could be improved? (Of course there is no need for a cull-prioritized improvements just means a process that involves rigour/a robust system to funnel down and build back up again......everything else stays the same...so plugins stay) I think and I could be wrong-that moodle core needs to evolve for innovation....what is left out of that is so important because the stuff in core surely must lend itself as a foundation for future building/construction work.....decision making/judgement about such stuff needs to be informed by the users more so than ever-given the market currently.

There are core features 80% of Moodlers use like file upload , labels, forums, assignments, grading (I know the OU are in the 20% on assignments ). Most would like to be able to create a nice looking page which remains a challenge im Moodle. Every teacher has to setup a course, whats the first thing you are asked to do after its been created? Go to a page with around 50 different settings on it. No wizard, no workflow. Where Instructure were smart was figuring out what the core functions were, the ones 80% of people used and focussing heavily on those elements. Thus during vendor competition when they sit users down in a lab to compare systems Canvas wins out because users are not evaluating what the system \"could\" do they are looking for the one that makes their life easier based on the things they actually do day in day out. Grading, communication, the ease with which you can add files / activities anywhere in a page.... the basics everyone needs and uses. Be the best at those core tasks and you win most of the users over.",

Anyway, I can understand the points made and want to add to the activity chooser convo. 1. I agree with Tim in that fiddling around with it to improve font size/width/line spacing and whatever other dev secretarial issues that are pledged to justify ease of accessibility-for some- is/sounds big-ish and time-consuming and possibly a distraction from more important/priorities/stuff....maybe 2. I can also see the point Jez makes in that the activity chooser could and should be button categories...really I do see this as making sense.  Now, I have used a number of systems....Bb, OU system, Moodle and WebCT (as teacher and learner).....I also follow Canvas development closely because I like to do that as a hobby.... laughing again ........however, teachers do-quite often use thematic/categorized approaches in their teaching practices-I know- I have and do.....and so a media button makes absolute sense to me......and so on.....now this is about accessibility/immediacy/choice. 3. What Jez proposes next in his pitch....is such a file picker/activity chooser on the learner's interface just like the teacher  can access on their UI.....now.....if we are seeking consistency...then the style/dev secretarial approach also needs to be consistent so, new features....like the learner drop-down menu can build on what has gone before...building on what is there at the mo...without MDL-48306 ....well how does that square for future new features as outlined here?  I think if we are to think along those lines-long term improvements not necessarily short term pain in the arse adjustments for no obvious reason then we may all be on the same page-or not of course.  I suppose it is about priorities and workload=  practicalities and therefore need to take precedence.

Which has got me thinking about this. Meanwhile, at work, Niall Sclater, head of the OU's VLE programme has been going around saying to anyone who will listen: \"Any student who can order a book from Amazon should not have any trouble using the OU's VLE\". This seems like a really good way of summarising what Moodle's usability goal for students should be. So I was wondering if it was worth trying to come up a few other statements like this to summarise our usability aspirations for for other roles, so when we are discussing the details of how to improve usability, we have a common understanding of what the target is. Of course, this is quite ambitious, because Moodle has users from all around the world; and of ages from K-12 to university students to commercial training; and users who just touch Moodle occasionally, to users who work with it every day. The good thing about Niall's statement is that it related Moodle usability to some other common task, so applies across age groups and many cultures. I invite you to try to come up with your statements. I'll give my own attempts in a separate post.",

They are thinking in different terms, means and processes. Thats good , but its also a problem. If you are free to think really newly about a new product, its easy to understand the philosophy and processes behind. If you are experienced you think in other philosophies and processes: why doesn't it make the things like...? Is it done in the same way like...? Usability is the awareness of a user. And this is different for each person. Explaining processes in Moodle often I ask the teachers that I'm teaching how they do the things on paper. For example a quiz. Creating a quiz is a process with a lot of different steps they have to do. But they don't make this steps systematically. Some of the steps are made intuitive. Some teacher create grades and points during the correction of a quiz. Discussing the process of quiz editing in Moodle they say there are to much steps. It will be easier to make it on paper. In the terms of usability they say me, its no good usability. Problems of usability definition will be that user make comparisons with other tools (ICT tools and paper based) and their own habits.",

We already have the rule that any page should be produced with a fixed number of database queries, not matter how big the site is, and mostly we achieve that. (If you find somewhere that we don't, that is a bug, and should be filed in the tracker.) Number of clicks to achieve something is just one usability heuristic. Again I don't think hard rules are very useful. I would rather that the coding guidelines encourage developers to think properly about usability. (Rewriting the coding guidelines, including more user interface guidelines is on Martin's to do list.) I went to a talk comparing Moodle and Blackboard at the Brisbane Moodle Moot last October. That compared click counts for common operations, and Moodle was a clear winner.",

Example of using this in edit situation is assignment grading popup, which updates grading table. However this is not so easy in implementation. It would be actually good to get some functions to help implement it in core libs. As for page loading time, it also depends on page size (and size of accompanying scripts). Useful rule there would be to let big/slow pages show parts of them in the process of downloading. Right now many moodle pages show header, than nothing more before all page get loaded (this is probably caused by html layout they are used). This is easy visible on course editing page with AJAX on.",

          "Text": "I wonder if it would be useful to distinguish \"usability by role.\" Here's what makes me think of it: One thing I've always admired most about Moodle is its clean and user-friendly and uncomplicated interface. In fact, what I admire about Moodle is what some faculty at my college despised when they looked at it some years ago (\"We can't use that - it's obviously made for children\"). Ignoring that type of ignorance and moving on, I think Moodle's designers have an intuitive sense of clean and uncomplicated design, which makes Moodle really easy to pick up and use, whether you are a teacher, K-12 student, or college student. The only time I've ever experienced a \"MEGO moment\" with Moodle (MEGO = \"My eyes glaze over\") was when I took a formal Moodle class for admins and was introduced to the role-setting matrix in Moodle 1.9. It was truly mind-boggling - maybe still is (I haven't visited it in 2.x). Now, what is usable and straightforward for a teacher or student might be partly the result of an administrator who is working behind the scenes, making everything work smoothly. So is there a level of usability (a high or easy level) that is right for the novice user, while the Moodle admin is left to struggle with controls that are much harder to figure out? (like Tig Notaro's comment, after her mom died and she was diagnosed with cancer, \"God doesn't give you more than you can handle\"??). Or is there one level of usability that is right for *all* Moodle users? One reason I think it might be useful to consider this question is that I'd wager a high percentage of Moodle admins are actually novice admins - teachers who are running their own Moodle installations, corporate trainers who downloaded Moodle b/c their small companies needed an e-learning solution, and the like. They are amateur admins, not professional admins, and I wonder if Moodle's designers have striven to make Moodle's admin interface as easy to use as the teacher's or student's interface. Anyway, I'm glad we are having this discussion, and when I read Tim's points, I immediately started parsing the issues according to roles. Thanks.  -  Peter",

          "Text": "Hi, some thoughts then: Any student who can order a book from Amazon\nshould not have any trouble using Moodle. Yes,\nbut the interface between teacher and learner for engagement with an LMS such\nas Moodle needs to include a shared understanding about the purpose of such engagement....so,\nnavigation is one thing...a shared understanding about outcomes is quite\nanother * A Teacher who is\nan experienced computer user should be able to work out how to set up any part\nof a Moodle course, after reading only a brief description of the available\nfeatures in the built-in help or MoodleDocs . And\nif a teacher is not an experienced computer user, there needs to be\nliaison/collab with admins/LTs and a structured CPD pathway * A Teacher who is\nnot confident using computers should still be able to learn enough to create\nand use a basic Moodle course in a one-day workshop. mmmm.......in\ntheory, but I like to think teachers have questions and before executing a\ncourse as an outcome of a workshop....they may wish for a one-to-one session to\nfeel confident about application and affordances of the tools....to do what\nthey write on the tin eh! * Someone who has\npreviously installed Drupal, Wordpress, or another popular PHP web system\nshould be able to install Moodle for their own use, just by following the\ninstructions on MoodleDocs. Yes, and to be fair\nthe docs are crystal clear and helpful in terms of this * No one feature of\nMoodle should be so complicated that you cannot describe 90% of the\nfunctionality in that area in a chapter of a book like \"Using Moodle\"\nby Cole and Foster. Yes-agree,\nbut functionality in isolation doesn't go far enough....functionality bridged\nwith application vignettes is a winner in any text about moodle....given it's inherent\ncreative possibilities for innovative practice-and I have not been overly\ngenerous there-now you know me...Mrs Criticality! * An experienced\nPHP developer who has not previously worked on Moodle should be able to create\na new Block that something simple but useful in under a week, using the\ndocumentation new block template and help from the forums. Possibly,\nbut building on previous code is one thing-what one wants to do is another in\nterms of linkages with Moodle Version....now I could be wrong of course... [I think we should\nlimit this to 6 statements, so if you want to try, as well as writing each\nstatement, you will also have to decide which categories of people it is most\nimportant to have a statement about.] I\ndon't need to make 6 J just one: There needs to be more joined up thinking in terms of\nlinkages across Moodle's interface/UI and resources/ activities etc for teachers\nand admins to pick up on such connections in order to support the\nlearner....so, I am not saying nothing new- right?
