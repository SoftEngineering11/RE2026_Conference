As the formatting has changed to A-Z, it's now unclear whether the waitlist function would still be able to track next-in-line if someone registered cancels their registration. Therefore, if a workshop becomes full and several individuals are waitlisted, is the first waitlisted person still offered a position first? Does the waitlist function recognise a time-stamp of when people register to manage this, or is this new A-Z listing structure likely to impact the waitlist function for students? We look forward to your advice.\nLabel: ",

However, we have very large population of participants and very few people to actually watch the attendance.

For future sessions I was hoping for single checkbox on the initial page to \"turn-off\" all reminders. Then of course there is most hoping that administrators (instructors) would have a easy way of marking the attendance for all enrolled (select all) and allowing them to select the date of the event vs the current date. Instructors/administrators often do not receive the attendance roster on the same day as the event. Kind Regards, Shirley\nLabel: ",

I have a face to face session integrated in this course.  I created groups because I have a few face to face sessions in the morning and in the afternoon. I put conditional access to the morning or the afternoon sessions depending on group affiliation (group A or group B). It would be so practical if one can add a cohort or a group directly to a face to face. So far this is done manually. which is a pain because i have to upload users, enrol them in their cohort, add them to their groups. But I have also to add them to the face to face manually.

There are a few reasons for this and I am trying to rectify some of those as I go through things and sorry for the delays. One problem that the community of users can help me with is the way in which issues are being reported. At the moment there are many different threads being opened - here, in the plugin directory feedback, github, private messages to me etc - sometimes reporting the same issue or something that might be resolved within a different version. This means that it is difficult to track the exact issues and clearly identify where and when things should be corrected and to let the community know of updated code. I have switched off bug reporting on the github directory itself in the hopes that the Moodle tracker itself becomes the only place for issues to be reported. I'd like to also build a roadmap for coming versions and feature improvements so having all the issues in one place will really help this plan moving forward. There have been, since I took over maintenance, a few things I'd like to add and alter but first I need to get the current code into a consistent state. If you experience a issue please first check the tracker to see if there is an item already reporting this which you can add to and/or vote on and if not then please create a new one. The forums and plugin comments should ideally be used only for questions regarding general support such as configuration questions, suggestions for features and their related discussions and general use or feedback of the module. I will not be able to support bugs reported in these locations. In the meantime, thank you for your patience, Stacey\nLabel: ",

I did set the sessions and the roles (teacher and students, I couldn't find a manager role to assign), but if someone tries to enroll (even myself), get the message \" You are currently not assigned to a manager in the system. Please contact the site administrator. ! Of course I am the administrator, but I couldn't find the answer in the documentation. The FAQ says \"Starting with the Moodle 1.9 version of the Face-to-face module, a custom field called \"Manager's email\" is added to the user profile page\". But I don't see it in the user profile (I mean the one under site administration). Furthermore, adding the address to each student manually seems very cumbersome! So I guess there should be another way: is there a step-by-step guide? The only place to insert an email seems to be in the module settings \"sender address\", (as the sender should be the manger, I guess), but it doesn't work. There is a section \"Manager emails\" on the same page, but I couldn't understand those settings, particularly \"Ask users for their manager's email address.\" confused me. Should the student set their own manager's address? Could I be driven to some documentation that explain these issues, maybe starting from what a manager is and why should be different from the teacher? Thanks in advance for your patience\nLabel: ",

Maybe I am fixing something that is not broken - maybe I just don't follow the logic completely. Maybe there is something broken and this will help someone who is having the same problem.\n\nPROBLEM:\nManager Approval - When approving requests F2F is failing to accurately assign a statuscode of 60 (MDL_F2F_STATUS_WAITLISTED) when a session has reached capacity.\n\nIn the function:\nfunction facetoface_approve_requests($data) { ... lots of code ... and then you come to this...\n\n// Check if there is capacity\nif (facetoface_session_has_capacity($session, $contextmodule)) {\n$status = MDL_F2F_STATUS_BOOKED;\n} else {\nif ($session->allowoverbook) {\n$status = MDL_F2F_STATUS_WAITLISTED;\n}\n}\n\nFUNCTION WHERE THERE IS A PROBLEM FOLLOWS:\nfunction facetoface_session_has_capacity($session, $ context = false) {\n\nif (empty($session)) {\nreturn false;\n}\n\n$signupcount = facetoface_get_num_attendees($session->id);\nif ($signupcount >= $session->capacity) {\n// if session is full, check if overbooking is allowed for this user\n//if (!$context || !has_capability('mod/facetoface:overbook', $context)) {\n// return false;\n//}\n\n//the above commented out of the original f2f code and was replaced with this:\nreturn false;\n}\n\nreturn true;\n}\n\nI had to comment out the piece where it checks if overbooking is allowed for this user. When this piece of code is NOT commented out (as shown) it returns TRUE even when the session is at or above capacity - short circuiting its ability to indicate a session that is full.\n\nDoes this function get used by some other piece of f2f that needs those commented out lines? If this logic is required somewhere it will need to be moved out of the facetoface_session_has_capacity() function.\n\nFeedback? Does this function work \"as-is\" for others?\n\nThanks!\n-Rob\nLabel: ",

To resolve these I had to make changes to mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php, I've attached the patch to this post. To summarise the issues: $dbman->add_field(), create_table() and drop_field() appears to return void so don't assign this to $result. (This appears to be already known: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=217299 ). $OUTPUT->notification() is an empty object, add $OUTPUT to the list of globals at the start of xmldb_facetoface_upgrade(). Property $DB->debug isn't accessible (protected) so remove these. The second parameter for $DB->get_records() should be either null or an array. The field list for $DB->get_records() should be in the fourth parameter. Unless of course there's something very wrong with my installation. All the best, Leon\nLabel: ",

Of course, as I have customised both, I went back to basics to find it, and here is what I found. Regardless of the result of the Face to Face session, (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) Face to Face still injects a completion status of 1 into the table mdl_course_modules_completion . (Note - if course completion is set to require 100% to pass, this is not an issue - just reporting through Activity Tracker, which utilises the completionstatus flag in mdl_course_modules_completion ) Now one could argue either way for this - that they technically have completed the module, however got a pass mark of 0%, or they have not completed the module because they didn't turn up. Myself - I argue the second option - but interesting to see other thoughts out there. Any one with thoughts? Cheers Peter\nLabel: ",

A F2F course requires manager approval, and a user signs up to the course. An email is sent to the manager, and the student - all is good. However, the student is not given an indication on the screen that they are waitlisted, so they can sign in again. The big gotcha, is once they sign in a second time, even once they are approved and the status as an admin says booked, the end user still has the status as being able to sign up. They will NEVER see on their screen that they are booked in - they will always get the option to sign up. Of course, if they sign up again AFTER they are approved, then they get un-booked and put as waiting for approval, and the whole cycle starts again. Any thoughts? This is latest iteration of F2F and moodle 2.4.3+ (Dated this week) Cheers Peter\nLabel: ",

My idea was to: 1- Enable the Completion tracking \"Show activity as complete when conditions are met \" for facetoface to unlock the conditions \"Require view\" and \"Require grade\". 2- Create a third condition call \"Session is over\" which, if enable, will consider the course module for the current user as complete IF the current user is still signup for a session with the status \"session over\" 3- implement the condition \"session is over\" in the module facetoface and in moodle. For now it is working, I based the condition \"session is over\" on the condition \"require view\" and now every time the course page is view the condition check if the current user is still signup for a session over. I had to modify many things, I explain all the modifications I had to make in the .txt document. I am still working on to try a maximum to not modify the moodle code but the facetoface code instead, I would be very happy to have your opinion or your ideas to improve what I have done so far.

How do you handle updating an f2f event? Is the best practice to cancel the original event instead and create a new one? Wouldn't the user then have to delete the old event from their calendar?

But I'm having a devil of a time getting the classes set up in the first place, because of the Format - I've tried all the class formats, and none of them seem to fit our classes, which are one-off, 2 hr classes in a building. Can someone guide me to getting started? I'm really hung up on the Format, because everything seems to hinge on selecting the right one. Thanks! Julie\nLabel: ",

Could you please explain what site notices mean? One other thing - regarding custom fields. Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations of the field. In non-custom fields this was handled easily via the language editing. I don't know if this is a major change, but it may be worth noting for future versions.\nLabel: ",

It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes sessions appear on learner calendars with the times from a different session. For example, let's say that Joe is signed up for two different courses: Tuesday at 10:30 AM Wednesday at 10:30 AM In Joe's calendar, the Tuesday session appears correctly as being at 10:30 AM. However, his Wednesday session shows up as being at 2:30 PM (which happens to be the time of another available session, but he isn't signed up for that). I've verified that Joe is enrolled in the right sessions, and Joe can see the correct time if he enters the activity through the weekly outline rather than the calendar. Everything in the activity itself is right, but somehow the information is getting lost when it gets shared with the calendar. Any ideas on why this might be happening? -Christy Tucker\nLabel: ",

Right now we have two moodle courses set up for each course. One course is for the live instruction portion for which we use face to face. The second is for the online learning content where we have uploaded scorm content. The course is sequential meaning that the online content does not become available until the user completes the live instruction course. I tried using Activity Locking (I'm don't fully understand all of its features yet) but the problems I have are two fold: 1 - We run the same live instruction course in dozens of cities. Each instance/session is its own face-to-face and a user need only attend one face to face session to be eligible for the online content. It seems as if the activity lock is an all or nothing proposition, I can't set it to say that any face-to-face attendance would qualify to unlock the online learning content. 2 - The online learning content is accessible for 60 days from the face-to-face/live session attendance. Any ideas on how to control this? Right now we do this manually. Thank you\nLabel: ",

On my sandbox environment, the email is sent immediately after I assign an attendee to the session, which can cause problem if I select the wrong person in the list for example. I would like to explore different ways: - either having a confirmation button before sending the confirmation email (kind of approving the attendee's list, that would send the email to the whole list at one time) - or be able to setup a number of days before the session date to send the email for ex. 7 days before (my session events are often de-scheduled ans re-scheduled so I do not want to pollute users mailbox for nothing). This feature could also be used for reminder emails some days before the session. I have seen we can disable the email confirmation. If I do so and enable it while having already a list of attendees, what happens ? can we then send the confirmation mail to the list ?? Did anyone already developped something on this subject ? Feedbacks appreciated. Thanks for your help Sandrine\nLabel: ",

We use Moodle to train technicians around the world but one state requires us to provide face-to-face classes for the technician's first training. After they have taken the face-to-face class they are able to renew their training by taking a course online. (Our training certificates expire every 2 years) The problem is setting up a course just for that particular state that has enrollment limited to those technicians that have already taken a face-to-face class. Some changes would probably need to be made to the core Moodle files as well as the face-to-face code but I would love to have the face-to-face attendence be linked to the online course enrolment somehow. I don't want to have them automatically enrolled in the online course after they attend the face-to-face so the current external enrollment modules won't work for me. When a students attempts to enroll in the online course I would like to have moodle check to verify they have already taken the related face-to-face class, if they have they are enrolled, if they haven't they are told they need to take the face-to-face class first.\nLabel: ",

I hope I have explained this well.  In my testing it seems to be working beautifully, I just wonder if I am breaking something else by doing this.  ANy thoughts of comments? Scott Karren\nLabel: ",

My users were telling me they couldn't obtain a certificate after I marked them present in the course, so I did some looking around. I found that the mdl_facetoface_submissions table had a \"Grade\" field. It showed 0 for all my users, even though the actual grade book shows 100% and the Face to Face shows yes for attendance. When I changed the 0 to 100 in the table as a test, I was then able to get a certificate for my test student. Is there a bug in the attendance checkbox code that doesn't change that field, or is it my system that just no longer likes me (been a long day)?\nLabel: ",

Second, When a user signs up and selects to receive email and icalendar they are getting two emails one with the confirmation message and one with the ical attachment, again is this by design or a bug.

The Participants report shows the expected data. User-level activity reports (\"Outline\" and \"Complete\" reports) are also populated. Other noteworthy improvements: The module now uses a custom field on the user profile page for the manager's email address instead of the MSN field. The attendance data is now stored in the gradebook. Important bug fixes: The session key is now checked in all user forms. The take attendance page now displays the actual attendance and allows teachers to untick checkboxes. iCalendar appointments are no longer sent for wait-listed sessions. Remove internationalisation from log entries. Default email messages are no longer set in the site-wide settings page, they should simply be overridden in the language pack.

As the formatting has changed to A-Z, it's now unclear whether the waitlist function would still be able to track next-in-line if someone registered cancels their registration. Therefore, if a workshop becomes full and several individuals are waitlisted, is the first waitlisted person still offered a position first? Does the waitlist function recognise a time-stamp of when people register to manage this, or is this new A-Z listing structure likely to impact the waitlist function for students? We look forward to your advice.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

But later discussions are saying that Face-to-Face are meant to be for one session only registration. If someone wants to re-register for a future session, they would have to be marked as \"No-show\" for the session that they registered before. However, we have very large population of participants and very few people to actually watch the attendance. It would be hard to compare each person and mark people who didn't show up as no-show.  Is there a way to just open up the registration list to allow multiple signing up? Thanks!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I am also looking for a solution for this. Does anyone have the hack they can post here? Thanks!\nComment 2: I've been using face-to-face for 11 years and the answer has been NO the whole time. Marking them anything will allow them to re-register. Just mark each session. If you don't care if they actually attend or not, mark everyone attended... And for the inevitable next question, (can we have a select all?) probably not. I've asked the question several times over the years and again, the answer has been no. But it sure would be nice. I've heard the original developers have taken f2f up several levels but I don't think the new code is available to the community (and, that might just be hearsay).\nComment 3: Thanks Melanie. As to marking them anything - I cannot see that option at the moment?? Finally do you know of any other booking systems that allow this in Moodle? Was looking at 'Booking', but I cannot actually test it on moodlebites cause it doesn't let me create a new account. Essentially we run a series of workshops at different times and we want students to be able to sign up to multple AND receive email confirmations and notifications. Any help much appreciated. Thanks\nComment 4: If it does not give you the option to take attendance, the date is still in the future. You can only take attendance after the session begins. Back in '08, still in the days of 1.9...I did a bunch of research on something like this. I found nothing that has the functionality of f2f...attendance might be more what you're looking for...but I think it tracks more of a day to day thing and, again, requires marking. At my prior job, we customized f2f to add an attendance by id option. We all had magnetic strip ID badges that had our id numbers coded in, so we could connect a usb swiper (or use a keyboard with a swiper) and as people walked in, they could swipe for attendance. Or the teacher could type in their ID's manually. Or could copy the list of swipes and paste it in for additional sessions (we frequently had back to back classes and people were required to attend several on the same day). It was pretty slick. The guy who wrote the code said it wasn't too hard. But that was a code hack and I can't share it...I don't work there any longer and they a) stopped using moodle and b) were resistant to sharing (I don't know why, the director was like that. Didn't like Moodle or open source, liked secret squirrel, now he's paying over $50,000 a year for something that doesn't have the flexibility Moodle has).\nLabel: ",

We have installed the face-to-face plugin and using moodle 3.5. We have created the user profile field 'Managers email' and short name managersemail . We have enter a default in the field and locked it and hidden it as we want to be notified for approving users into the activity. I have gone backwards and forwards checking all the fields and spelling and cannot fix the problem of when the user tries to register it informs them that they do not have a manger assigned. \"You are currently not assigned to a manager in the system. Please contact the site administrator.\" The scenario is that we want the user to register, and an Administrator gets the managers email to approve the user onto the course. I am becoming very frustrated, can someone please HELP!!!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi again, After some more investigation I found that in earlier versions to make this work you had to fill the 'MSN ID' field, I did this and it worked. The problem is we want to be able to hide and lock the info into a default so our admins could get the managers emails. Having the 'managers email' location method working is needed for our propose. We can't hid the 'MSN ID' field.\nComment 2: That's very odd...in the 2.5 version (and before), when you installed the plugin, it added a custom user field \"Manager's email\" and it looked for that.  Now it does something different, which is kind of weird.\nComment 3: I agree with Melanie that this sounds strange. What version of Moodle and what version of Face-to-face are you seeing this issue? I haven't noticed this issue and we are using managersemail successfully with multiple versions of Moodle and the latest versions of Face-to-face. Jeremy\nComment 4: Moodle          : 3.5 Face to Face : 3.4.4  2018110900 Answer to Melaines post, there isn't a default 'Managers email'.  I had to create one myself As soon as I enter data into the MSNID, it works fine.\nComment 5: I am also having issues with the Manager email. I created the manager email custom field as suggested in another post on the profile and it still doesn't work.   I request the user to enter the email and it doesn't appear to save that information anywhere that I can find....not even in the MSNID field if populating that field is what makes the plugin work properly. Any suggestions? Moodle 3.5 F2F version:  3.4.3  (2018110900)\nComment 6: Hi Dave, I'm too in need of figuring out a way that we can have one of our staff auto added to the manager field so that we can approve requests internally. Did you ever figure this out?\nComment 7: I am too looking into finding a solution for this - have tried everything I could find online. we are on 3.6.3\nComment 8: Managed to get this working on our 3.6.3 Steps: Created a test course - added two users, assigned one as a student and other as Manager Added the 'Managers Email' field in the user profile field in the 'Other fields' section (short name managersemail). Opened 'Edit Profile' page for student user and added the Manager user's email address Created an F-to-F activity, with approval required option checked. Added a session. Signed up on the activity with student user and I did not get the error/message. Both the student user and Manager user received an email confirmation of the booking Hope it helps other people.

Using Moodle 3.6.3 with Boost theme. Been trying for two days to get Face-to-Face sessions working with guest access. Have gone through every site admin setting I can find, including: Settings>Site administration>Plugins>Authentication> Manage authentication Settings>Site administration>Plugins>Enrollments> Guest access Settings>Site administration>Plugins>Enrollments> Manage enroll plugin Settings>Site administration>Users>Permissions> Define roles Settings>Site administration>Users>Permissions> User policies I've set all courses to allow guests to view and enroll, system-wide by default. I've turned on auto-enroll. I've double-checked each FtF session and ensured that guest access is on. Guests system-wide have access to enroll in any session. Have set it so no password is required to enroll. There are no restrictions in place at the course, topic or session level. Guest access has never had a password requirement, so it seems unlikely that it has a corrupted password. Every time I click sign up for a session, I get, \"Sorry, guests are not allowed to sign up for sessions.\"\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Guests can access the course but they cannot access activities .  Of they are not enrolled in the class, the class won't have a way to track them.  I suppose you could override guest roles but that is not one I would recommend changing.  The point of requiring people to be students is to track what they are doing--guest access is not tracked, therefore having them participate is pointless...\nComment 2: Thanks for the reply. Yeah, the guest thing is unorthodox, but I was looking into that route thanks to a bureaucratic snafu. We will be offering computer training classes on this platform. Most of the students will have access via LDAP or OAuth, but there will be times when we have some warehouse folks taking courses as well, and most of them do not have either of those login options. (We were, of course, not informed of this until way into the process of setting up the server and the software, go figure). We were also told late in the game that some warehouse managers might want to bulk enroll their employees. The biggest issue is that (as near as I can tell), Moodle requires each student to have an email address. While I completely understand the need for that, it really limits our options for solving the problem. HR won't let them use personal emails. I'd just have them all register under their manager's email address, but I'm pretty sure Moodle doesn't allow that, either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\nComment 3: AH!  Well, you could create fake emails. But then they wouldn't get notices...but it sounds like they might not anyway. Yea, Moodle does require each account to have an email and usually prevents duplicates BUT I think you can disable that...or create accounts via a bulk upload with the duplicated email--just make sure to change the prevent duplicate emails from yes to no. If HR doesn't want them to use personal email then they need to make sure they have company emails.\nLabel: ",

Is there any way to tie passing grade to completion in this activity type? Thanks, Bruce\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Unfortunately not at this time. Partially attended gets recorded as a 50, fully attended as 100, and no show as a zero. Those are all grades, so completion is triggered for all of them. I usually recommend using grade restrictions on a later activity that has more robust completion options, such as feedback, to trigger course completion.\nComment 2: How would I set course completion to only occur for example for a grade of 100%? I have several sessions that a learner can choose from, they only need to attend one fully to pass... Is that possible through grade book? If so, can you provide an example? Thanks\nComment 3: Set a grade to pass and it won't give completion. So...step 1, must receive a grade (but not view, that can jack things up massively). Step 2: Grades, Gradebook setup, Edit/Edit settings for the F2F, Set your Grade to pass to 50 or 100 (whatever you expect). Save.  You might need to click Show more to see the Grade to pass.\nComment 4: At least in my testing on the latest version of the plugin and Moodle 3.5 and 3.6 that will still mark the activity as complete, but completed (did not achieve pass grade). So if course completion is tied to activity completion that will still mark as complete despite the no show. In some plugins there is an option to restriction completion to a passing grade, but F2F doesn't support that. So in this use case I would set the required course grade to 75 or 100 for course completion rather than rely on activity completion, or if there are other activities I would use a grade restriction instead of an activity completion to restrict access to the later activities. Jeremy\nComment 5: F2F does work with passing grade, but you have to set it manually in the gradebook. There is not a specific 'require passing grade' the way quiz or other modules have within settings, though. I've been requiring a passing grade this way for course and activity settings for years...\nLabel: ",

For future sessions I was hoping for single checkbox on the initial page to \"turn-off\" all reminders. Then of course there is most hoping that administrators (instructors) would have a easy way of marking the attendance for all enrolled (select all) and allowing them to select the date of the event vs the current date. Instructors/administrators often do not receive the attendance roster on the same day as the event. Kind Regards, Shirley\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I doubt it.  If you manually register (and then properly enroll, sense manual registration may add people to the course with no role), you can check the 'don't send email' box but I have never seen a way to block it if people sign themselves up. They can choose whether to get one or two emails but not to shut off email entirely. There is no native way to take attendance for everyone--at a previous job one of my techy coworkers wrote a script to add a link to the options which opened a page where you could enter an id number for each attendee and then submit in bulk.  It would also manually enroll people who showed up without signing up.  It was pretty slick.  But it did require an ID number. Our staff had a badge with an embedded code for their ID so they could swipe into the job sites...his code added something that with a USB swiper would read the id and made it super fast. Unfortunately, I don't have that code.  I thought he posted it for the community many years ago but have not been able to find it if he did...\nComment 2: Hello Melanie, That was super helpful.

I guess I am back to manually tracking off-line.\nComment 5: As an admin, you can always modify those dates.  I'm not recommending it, but it is possible--If you use adminer,  you can hunt down specific sessions and bulk change the completion dates and go to the course completion status and bulk change the completion date there, too.  Again...not advocating, just saying...\nComment 6: Hi Shirley, You may want to consider using the Reengagement plugin and the Recompletion plugin in combination. Reengagement will remind/email users after a time frame has elapsed. Recompletion will strip out grades and notify users. This also renders the certificate unavailable to the user. We have found by using Custom Certificate that if the user repeats activities a new certificate will become available (even though the certificate summary page would suggest otherwise) I do not believe Recompletion has been adapted for face-to-Face use yet.

Regards,\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I think what you're saying is that you want a session that allows the instructor to register/sign up students but you don't want the student to be able to sign up themselves. Is that right? If so, I'd limit capacity to 1 and sign someone up.  Then it would be 'at capacity' and would prevent students from accessing it.  The teacher can add people even when the session says it is full.\nComment 2: That's exactly what I am After Thank you\nLabel: ",

His description of the issue: There is an issue\nwith the Name and Introduction text fields. It seems like we only get ‘one\nshot’ at defining these.  If I want to make any changes to either the Name or Introduction text subsequent to creating and 'save and display'– these are not being\nsaved. The consequence is that we cannot make any changes to these\ntwo fields (quite important ones) in a F2F once it’s published…It means\ncreating new ones all the time. Also, even after duplicating an existing F2F\n(to save some time), it’s only changes in the “first” edit that are being\nsaved. Any subsequent edits do not display. Does anyone know of a solution to this problem? Thank you Ruthine\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I am updating this as a bug in Face to Face which I hope might be picked up in a future iteration? The problems are: 1. If an existing Face to Face session is duplicated (to save time typing out all again), the text in the introduction field is not copied across. If you then try to copy and paste them from the original, it does not display the new text (although it does show it in the editor). 2. Once a Face to Face session is created and saved, if further edits are required they do not display the new edits (although they do show in the editor). Thank you Ruthine Burton\nComment 2: Were you able to figure out a fix or workaround for this? We are running into the same problem with several activities scheduled. I can't tell which one was the original.\nComment 3: Actually I don't seem to be able to update the Introductory text at all once it is saved. We are using Moodle 3.1.7 (Build: 20170710) with Face-to-Face version: 2.3.4., 2017031500\nComment 4: Hi, I had the same issue; came to this forum looking for answers.

I put conditional access to the morning or the afternoon sessions depending on group affiliation (group A or group B). It would be so practical if one can add a cohort or a group directly to a face to face. So far this is done manually. which is a pain because i have to upload users, enrol them in their cohort, add them to their groups. But I have also to add them to the face to face manually.

The report shows everyone with a 50 in facetoface_signups_status.statuscode, and hides everyone with a 10. Them problem is everyone gets a 50 and then a 10 when cancels, so everyone shows up regardless. Any other solutions are welcome.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: There is an additional entry called superceded - if you only show those with 0 in this table, it will filter out those who have cancelled. I did think the status code was 70 though, not 50? I use a similar thing - config report below. Note - discountcode I use to produce a blank cell for the signature - we don't use discount code. select c.shortname, f.name AS SessionName, DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(fsd.timestart),'%e %M %Y')  AS 'Date', DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(fsd.timestart),'%h:%i %p') AS 'Time', u.username AS 'Payroll Number',  CONCAT(u.firstname, ' ', u.lastname) AS Name, fs.discountcode AS Signature from prefix_user AS u INNER JOIN prefix_facetoface_signups as fs on u.id=fs.userid INNER JOIN prefix_facetoface_sessions_dates as fsd on fs.sessionid=fsd.sessionid INNER JOIN prefix_facetoface_sessions AS fse\nComment 2: Just spotted I haven't updated this.

This results in the user being added to the course but with no role . The user then has no ability to participate in activities . Users who were previously enrolled into the course have the student role as expected. When added to the session they retain the student role and can participate in all activities. Is this normal behaviour for Face-to Face? OR is there a way to add users to a session (F2F) so that they are given the student role ?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Well, yes, this is \"normal\" for relative values in f2f.  I tell anyone who uses it to track classroom training to make sure to enroll students first.  But people frequently forget. I think there might be a 2.9 build where the maintainer might have addressed this...but I'm still on an old build, myself. Most of our users have an employee id...we added some code that let's us take attendance by id and takes care of three steps at once--enrollment, registration/booking and attendance.  Works really well for us.\nComment 2: Thanks Melanie... good confirmation.\nLabel: ",

If someone logs into my Moodle site and the time zone in their profile is set to Pacific time (they live in California) the start time for the face-to-face sessions will show 8:30am which is correct. When they receive the reminder email the start time is listed as 10:30am. As you can imagine this is causing some confusion. I am wondering if the time in the reminder email is the server local time which in my case is Central time. This would make sense give that 8:30am Pacific time is 10:30am Central time. Please help. Thanks, Dustin Elliott\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello everybody, In addition to this question, I was wondering how exactly the timezones are used in Moodle. Did not find the information in doc nor forum. I have exactly the same need as Dustin and would like to be able to send 3 different time information in the confirmation and reminder emails: - Student time (different attendees of the session can be in different timezones) - teacher time - Server's local time Which zones do I have to use to perform this ? Did anyone already do that with the correct informatiion at the end ? Thanks in advance for help, Sandrine\nComment 2: Ciao Does the facetoface module use the timezone of the system for ICAL appointments and remainder emails? How could I manage facetoface sessions for locations with different timezones? Maybe adding a new field \"Timezone\" in the form add/edit of facetoface sessions could be the solution... Waiting for your feedbacks Regards Matteo\nComment 3: Hi Matteo, We currently assume that the server timezone is the same as the user timezone. It would be good to remove that assumption. If you wanted to change this, have a look at all uses of \"userdate()\" in /mod/facetoface/lib.php The optional third parameter to userdate() is the timezone. For each user we send an email to, we should use his/her own timezone. Let me know if you get somewhere with this. I'd be happy to get this fixed. Cheers, Francois\nComment 4: Ciao Regarding the email notification, maybe the best/easiest solution (that doesn't not require ALL the users set correctly their timezone) is sending to all the users the same absolute time (for instance from 09:00 UTC to 17:00 UTC) Regarding the ICAL file, the ICAL appointment should contain an absolute time (for instance UTC): the Calendar Clients will convert the absolute time to a localtime using the user's timezone (in MS Outlook, Google Calendar,... you can set your timezone) Regards Matteo\nComment 5: I agree with using UTC for the iCal attachments. They should be displayed properly by the client. On the other hand, in the emails, we should be using the user timezone (as set in Moodle) because that's what users will see when they are logged in and sign up for the session. Cheers, Francois\nComment 6: Hi 1) ICAL attachment do you have any idea about this feature will be implemented? 2) EMAIL yes, you are right but usually the timezone is not an Corporate/ LDAP attribute but an Operating System setting and so it is not easy (think also to the \"Daylight Saving Time\" issue) to manage moodle timezone for thousands of worldwide students.. In any case (specially when a student does not setup correctly his/her timezone) in facetoface session lists view ( /moodle/mod/facetoface/view.php?id=XX) , it would be nice to show an ABSOLUTE time: simply adding the timezone of the student (for instance from 09:00 to 17:00 UTC+2).. In this case a worldwide student cannot have doubts about which timezone the time is related to (maybe Location? teacher? Student?). What do you think about it? Thanks Matteo\nComment 7: Hi Matteo, We don't have any plans regarding the iCal changes yet, so if anybody wants to have a go, feel free. Regarding emails, we could optionally include the timezone as part of what we display. For example, it would show \"9am to 5pm NZST\" on a New Zealand Moodle, 09:00 to 17:00 UTC+2 on a European server). That way, it would be clear what the timezone is and it would not penalise those who take the time to set user timezones properly. Cheers, Francois\nComment 8: Hi, Matteo, I had the same issue and i tried: $timezonul=$user->timezone; if ($timezonul == '99') { $timezonul ='0' ;} else {$timezonul = $USER->timezone;} and ... . '<td class=\"content\" style=\"width: 15%\" align=\"center\"><span '.$spanclass.'>'.$allsessiontimes.' '.' UTC + '.$timezonul.'</span></td>' ... or $alldates .=' UTC+'.$timezonul; in the lib.php file or <td align=\"left\"><?php echo $datetimestart[$i]; ?> - <?php echo $datetimefinish[$i].\" UTC+\".$timezonul; ?></td> in the signup.html page. It seems that it works for me. Can you try this lines? Thank you!\nComment 9: Hi Dorel I tested your code and it works fine. Many Thanks! I think this small patch would be useful for all F2F users... is it possibile to add it in the standard source code repository? Redards Matteo\nComment 10: Hi, Matteo, I made i small modifcation to the code, because the localserver timezone was hardcoded. If you want to obtain it dinamically you can use a function to calculate the delta between the local time and UTC . So the code should look like this : $timezonul=$USER->timezone; ( or $timezonul=$user->timezone) if (($timezonul == '99') AND (tzdelta()>=0) ) { $timezonul = \"+\".tzdelta() ;} else if (($timezonul == '99') AND (tzdelta()<0)) {$timezonul = tzdelta();} function tzdelta ( $iTime = 0 ) { if ( 0 == $iTime ) { $iTime = time(); } $ar = localtime ( $iTime ); $ar[5] += 1900; $ar[4]++; $iTztime = gmmktime ( $ar[2], $ar[1], $ar[0], $ar[4], $ar[3], $ar[5], $ar[8] ); return ( $iTztime - $iTime ) /3600; } Now you can elimnate also the + sign after the UTC string and so you will have corect data even for servers with localtime bellow 0 UTC . Please test it and tell me if it works for you. Thank you!\nComment 11: Manolescu, Can you tell me what file and where to put your code? I would like to test it on my DEV server as well. Thanks, Dustin\nComment 12: Hi, Dustin, Here is how i place the code: in the lib.php file function facetoface_email_substitutions($msg, $facetofacename, $reminderperiod, $user, $session, $sessionid) { $timezonul=$user->timezone; echo $timezonul; if (($timezonul == '99') AND (tzdelta()>=0) ) { $timezonul = \"+\".tzdelta() ;} else if (($timezonul == '99') AND (tzdelta()<0)) {$timezonul = tzdelta();} if ($session->datetimeknown) { ...... $alldates .= userdate($date->timestart, get_string('strftimetime')).

I hope it works also for you. Please let me know. Thanks in advance!\nComment 13: Manolescu, I was able to put the code in place and everything works and displays the time and time zone correctly on the site and in the confirmation email that is sent when someone signs up for a F2F class. Only problem is that the time in the reminder email is still not correct. For example: Server time is set to \"America/Chicago\" User time is set to \"America/Los_Angeles\" Session scheduled time is 11:00AM to 2:00PM America/Chicago which is the same as 9:00AM to 12:00PM America/Los_Angeles Reminder email for user says \"11:00AM to 2:00PM America/Los_Angeles\" but is should say \"9:00AM to 12:00PM America/Los_Angeles\". Was your code supposed to fix this?\nComment 14: Hi, This code is only to display the user timezone as an additional information . We think that this will help students to know exactly when the session will take time.\nComment 15: Ok, then your code does exactly what it is supposed to do. Thanks Again! Dustin\nComment 16: In order to cover the case in which a teacher subscribes a student i think that in the function facetoface_email_substitutions(...) we should also use $USER->timezone.\nComment 17: Actually the $USER variable refers to the currently logged in user. So in this case, we would need instead to get the timezone of the student by looking it up in the mdl_user table. Francois\nComment 18: Hi there, this is six years later. I am using Moodle Moodle 2.8.6 with the latest Face to Face plugin. Our server is in Vancouver (Pacific) but our admins are in Calgary (Mountain) We have students in both Pacific and Mountain Time zones.

We have a 2.8 test site that was running an old (2.5) version of F2F and it seemed to work just fine.  Usually I'm a big supporter of upgrading everything when I do an upgrade but between some of the open and closed tracker issues and comments here, I'm a little concerned.  If the newest version fixes the won't enroll people with a role, it would be excellent but...well, I'm nervous. And we customize ours a bit to allow trainers to take attendance using ID number rather than add/remove.  If the old version works, is there a compelling reason to upgrade it to a version that might not work and will require addtional work to function?  What can I expect if we do upgrade?  How would upgrading impact currently existing activities & sessions on the site?\nComment 2: Melanie, I don't have much of an answer, but what did you decide to do? We are just starting testing of our next upgrade - a jump to Moodle 2.9. I do know that upgrading can have a significant affect on exiting activities because it upgrades them as well, so we always do testing first on a \"clean\" install and then using a copy of production to examine the affect the upgrade has on existing content.\nComment 3: Honestly,  we upgraded the site but not the module.  We kept our  F2F version the 2.5 version and it seems to work fine (for F2F values of fine).\nLabel: ",

There are a few reasons for this and I am trying to rectify some of those as I go through things and sorry for the delays. One problem that the community of users can help me with is the way in which issues are being reported. At the moment there are many different threads being opened - here, in the plugin directory feedback, github, private messages to me etc - sometimes reporting the same issue or something that might be resolved within a different version. This means that it is difficult to track the exact issues and clearly identify where and when things should be corrected and to let the community know of updated code. I have switched off bug reporting on the github directory itself in the hopes that the Moodle tracker itself becomes the only place for issues to be reported. I'd like to also build a roadmap for coming versions and feature improvements so having all the issues in one place will really help this plan moving forward. There have been, since I took over maintenance, a few things I'd like to add and alter but first I need to get the current code into a consistent state. If you experience a issue please first check the tracker to see if there is an item already reporting this which you can add to and/or vote on and if not then please create a new one. The forums and plugin comments should ideally be used only for questions regarding general support such as configuration questions, suggestions for features and their related discussions and general use or feedback of the module. I will not be able to support bugs reported in these locations. In the meantime, thank you for your patience, Stacey\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

It is difficult to judge, but it appears to me that it all started when we moved to a new server . We use Moodle 2.8.1 Would anyone have a suggestion?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: We haven't noticed problems using Moodle 2.7+, but we have several blocking plugins preventing us from jumping to 2.8, so we haven't done much testing yet. There were some changes in the messaging and events systems that might have impacted a module like F2F which hasn't been updated yet.\nComment 2: While I would say F2F is a little temperamental, this doesn't sound like a F2F problem, per se.  That sounds like something going wonky in the chron.  I don't know much about how the fiddly bits work but when chrons aren't running right, nothing runs right. Also, I'm not totally sure, but last I looked the most up to date F2F plugin was for 2.7...there were quite a few changes in 2.8...it might just not sync up entirely friendly?\nComment 3: Thanks for the replies and I have past on the information. Unfortunately, the problems persist. As always, I enter my students manually one by one and when we have a few, I schedule a date for a session and the emails should be sent to the students and the manager. The first session only one student was notified! The second session some students were notified, but not all! The next 12 sessions all students were notified but no manger email went out!\nComment 4: The problem has still not been resolved and cron was singled out. As I understand it, the problem has to do with the upgrade to Moodle 2.8 and that the F2F plugin has not been updated. It appears that it is not a priority of the developers. What a shame, as this plugin has worked very well in the past and is important to my operation. Does anyone knows another plugin that could be used instead? Should I revert to an older Moodle? Or is there anyone out there that has the ability to update the F2F plugin?\nLabel: ",

We use the Face-to-face activity to allow learners to sign up for in person sessions and we also use prerequisites to track learner progress, etc. If we have multiple sessions available for one Face-to-face activity and the requirement for the course completion is a grade (attendance) in the face-to-face activity does it effect the course completion if they only sign up for one session? Or for the course completion to work properly with the prerequisities would they have to sign up for each session? Sorry if that is really confusing... Thank you in advance for your time and/or ideas!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It is my understanding that a user CANNOT sign up for more than one session in the same face to face activity. That is a problem for us, but in your case might be desirable. You can test this by setting up more than one session for a face to face and see if the same student can sign up to multiple sessions. To accomplish this in our setting we have to set up separate face to face activities , each with its own sessions. Your bigger problem might be that F2F counts any attendance status (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) as being a valid completion. This is also a problem for us but I have not had time to look into the solution that the followup message to this thread offers: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=225026\nComment 2: Hi Mia, Hmm - I think you and I seem to face the same challenges. My other answer to the above is - I have remmed out the lines that have partially attended or no show - if someone doesn't show, the facilitator actually removes them from the session. This way, they have to get a \"Attended\" to get a course completion. Obviously this may not work for everyone. Incidently, I have a cancellation report, which picks out students that have cancelled sessions and why, and when the person cancelling the session is not the student, puts it as a \"No Show\" Cheers Peter\nComment 3: yes I always read your face to face posts and it seems like we do have some of the same issues. Thanks for the info about the partially attended or no show -- we want to record no shows, though. We are working on a custom addition to Face to Face that adds another layer of approval after the manager approval so that an account number can be entered by a fund manager. In addition, the approval links that take the approvers to their approvals filter the approvals on the page so that only their own approvals show, AND the approver does not need the permission to the entire Attendees page if they use the link to access the approvals page. I hope that we can eventually get this code and some other code we are customizing in F2F incorporated into the main F2F module. Will tell more as it develops in case others are interested.\nComment 4: Hi all, I was searching for something completely different in Google, and this came up, which reminded me, I finally after 18 months found the root cause of the issue. By default, Moodle sets the default grade to pass as 0 (who knows why...) Once you change this default to 100, then any F2F activity created will have the no show, partial attendence etc marked as failed, rather than passed. I then also did a cheeky back end database to all F2F sessions to have the gradetopass setting set to 100. I hope this helps someone else. Cheers Peter\nComment 5: Thank you for your post, we have run into significant issues using the prerequisities for the face-to-face sessions and have decided to forego the use of prerequisites for this activity at this time but I will continue testing and let you know if I come across another alternative. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day!\nLabel: ",

I did set the sessions and the roles (teacher and students, I couldn't find a manager role to assign), but if someone tries to enroll (even myself), get the message \" You are currently not assigned to a manager in the system. Please contact the site administrator. ! Of course I am the administrator, but I couldn't find the answer in the documentation. The FAQ says \"Starting with the Moodle 1.9 version of the Face-to-face module, a custom field called \"Manager's email\" is added to the user profile page\". But I don't see it in the user profile (I mean the one under site administration). Furthermore, adding the address to each student manually seems very cumbersome! So I guess there should be another way: is there a step-by-step guide? The only place to insert an email seems to be in the module settings \"sender address\", (as the sender should be the manger, I guess), but it doesn't work. There is a section \"Manager emails\" on the same page, but I couldn't understand those settings, particularly \"Ask users for their manager's email address.\" confused me. Should the student set their own manager's address? Could I be driven to some documentation that explain these issues, maybe starting from what a manager is and why should be different from the teacher? Thanks in advance for your patience\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Piersante Once you setup Face2face every user will need to go into their individual user profile and enter an email address of their manager or a person who will approve their enrolment.  This is a must. The Face2face add-on uses a two-tier approval process. The first tier is the manager. Once the user sets their managers email address, they can go to a course and enrol. Upon their enrolment an email will be sent to their manager. The email will contacin a link for the manager to login and approve the enrolment. Once the manager has approved the enrolment, an email will be sent to the course coordinator /s. The course cordinator is anyone who has been given teacher or manager role within the course. You need to set these roles for every course. To approve the enrolment as a course coordinator, the person who has been allocated teacher or manager role for the course will log in and go to Site pages (left had side under home) and select Course coordinator approval. This is where the lis of students who have been approved to attend will show up for the course coordintor to approve to attend the course. Once the course coordinator approves the student, this completes the process. Please remember to set your course to use the Face2face add-on. Go to the course and under Users > Enrollment methods select Enrol Approval and move that to the top of the list (select the blue arrow). I normall delete the \"Self enrolment (student)\" if that is on the list. If it is grey out you dont need to worry. Manaul enrolments is normally at the bottom when using the Face2face add-on. You now need to set up your Face2face add-on by adding an activity. Go into the course, make sure editing is on and on the first topic you need to add a activity. Find the Face-to-face activity and select Add. You must add a name. I suggest you type in the name of the course as this will show up on the 2 emails as part of the enrolment process. You must check the following boxes: Approval required. Send notice to manager (confirmation message) Send notice to manager (Reminder message) Send notice to manager (Cancellation message) Click on Save and return to course Get a normal user with only student role to find the course and see is it asks you to enrol and put a justification in. Hope this helps Peter\nComment 2: Thanks a lot. Very clear and enlighting. The only information that was missing is that you must create an user field in the user profile and populate it with the manager email for each student, This is very different from what the FAQ say, as they suggest that the field is already there. Not only this was not clear from the documentation, but it is cumbersome, as the default manager address is only inherited by new (or updated) users. I had to open and save all the students profiles one by one, to let them to get it (I suspect that I could have added the email address to the data user field table directly in the database , but I didn't dare to try). I find it also illogical, as the manager would usually belong to the activity rather than to the students (students might have different facetoface activities , each with a different manager), so one would expect it to be defined in the session properties, rather than globally. Nevertheless, thanks to your note I was qickly able to put the module at work and I find it wonderful and very flexible. I now have one more question: the confirmation email has fields for venue, room and location, which in my case are empty. Where do you set them? thanks, piersante\nComment 3: \"I now have one more question: the confirmation email has fields for venue, room and location, which in my case are empty. Where do you set them?\" They are set as added custom fields in the settings for the face to face plugin: Site administration / Plugins / Activity modules / Face To Face Section - Custom Session Fields Create a new field for each of the 3 fields Note: I think the  short names need to be 'venue', 'location',  'room' - all lowercase. You can use capitals in the Name field.\nComment 4: Hello Where should the manager's email address field be created, and what is its short name? TIA John\nComment 5: Hi John To create the manager's email address field : Go to: 1. Site administration  / ► Users/ ► Accounts/ ► User profile fields 2. When there select   \"create new profile field” 3. Complete the settings for your new field: Common Settings: - Short name (must be unique): managersemail - Name: whatevername - Description: whatever ..... - Various Parameters : ...

I found a reference in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200970 to add the following code to course/lib.php but the code has changed enough that I am unsure where to put it. \"After the line: if ($url = $mod->get_url()) { around line #1646 in course/lib.php add: if ($mod->modname == 'facetoface') { include_once($CFG-> dirroot .'/mod/facetoface/lib.php'); echo '<div ' . $textcss . '>'; echo facetoface_print_coursemodule_info($mod); echo '</div>'; } else { and then add a closing bracket before the next else statement.\" There are two references to if ($url = $mod->get_url()) { in course/lib.php, where should I add this code to make it work?  Thanks. Scott\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Has anyone else gotten this to work?  I don't know exactly where to put the additional code and the setting to show sessions on the main course page does not work.  I'm looking for any insight or direction here.  Thanks. Scott\nComment 2: Hi, did you figure this one out. I'm trying to add the session list in moodle 2.5\nComment 3: I've also been looking at displaying the face-to-face sessions in the course page for Moodle 2.5. The previous message (which referred to https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200970 ) called out a location in course/lib.php. The code has changed, however, and I believe in Moodle 2.5 the place is in course/renderer.php , in the course_session_cm_text() function, at about line 775. However, just adding this code at that spot still leaves the link to the face-to-face activity in place, so you see both the list of sessions and the link to the activity.  I didn't like that, so I made another change, as follows. In the same course/renderer.php file, but in the course_section_cm_name() function, near line 670, there is code like this: \n```text\n   $url = $mod->get_url();\n\n\n    if (!$url) {\n\n\n         return $output;\n\n\n    }\n```\n Following that code, I added a clause like this: \n```text\n  if ($mod->modname == 'facetoface') {\n\n\n       return $output;\n\n\n  }\n```\n Between these two changes it seems to do what I want. However, I tried turning on debug messages, and found a number of warning messages, even though it appears to work well enough as described in the link above.  I have not yet had a chance to try to fix those warnings.\nComment 4: Hi Please could you or another kind moodler advise the exact code change needed in the renderer.php file to get sessions displayed on a course page. The 2.5 help doc mentions: 2.5 The code for displaying the course information has been moved to the renderer.php file. Now, in course/renderer.php, function course_section_cm_text(), near line 775, the current code is: \n```text\n       if ($mod->get_url()) {\n           if ($content) {\n               // If specified, display extra content after link.\n               $output = html_writer::tag('div', $content, array('class' =>\n                       trim('contentafterlink ' . $textclasses)));\n           }\n       } else {\n           // No link, so display only content.\n```\n Add the code to display facetoface sessions following the \"if ($mod->get_url()) {\" line. But the 2.6 doc omits this. I tried adding: if ($mod->get_url()) { if ($mod->modname == 'facetoface') { include_once($CFG->dirroot.'/mod/facetoface/lib.php'); With no luck It would be great to get this to work, any assistance gratefully received. Thanks\nComment 5: Hi All, I have just pushed a patch for Moodle 2.6 that should ensure that the sessions are displayed on the course page according to the display number set in the instance configuration.  It is available on branch MOODLE_26_STABLE at https://github.com/catalyst/facetoface-2.0/commits/MOODLE_26_STABLE Apologies for the delay!

Thanks Sarah x\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Sarah, The session cost setting for the F2F module is really only a display only value and there is no functionality to take or check for payment within the module itself. While this would be nice it is a large task and there isn't any design or development capacity for anything as of yet. The payment value itself though should be visible in the session booking details for the user to see when they are signing up and in the gradebook for administrators/teachers to view once the session date has passed.

I've had a look through the settings and permissions but can't spot a way to do it. Is there any way to do this without having to meddle with the PHP? (using a hosted moodle so I don't have access to the php files). If it's not already possible could I request it as a future feature? Thank you, Helen\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I would love for this feature to be added!\nComment 2: Helen, I have actually implemented something a little similar to what you are wanting in the form of not allowing students to cancel once the start time for the item ( lesson in our case) they have registered is within 2 hours or less. I hard coded it into the module instead of making the feature selectable because I was in a hurry and am not a pro at PHP. Nevertheless, as a result of poking around in the code, I do know where the lines are that simply need to be commented out if you only want to remove the ability to cancel. But, you said you don't have access to the php files right...? I don't think it would be that hard to simply add a toggle/tick box that allows for canceling or no canceling. If I get some time I'll work with it a little and if I actually managed to get something working I will offer it to Alastair who I think is the current maintainer. Regards Jason\nComment 3: Hi Jason, Your toggle/tick box for cancelling or no cancelling is exactly what I'm after. It would be fantastic if you could get it added to the face-to-face activity. Sorry for the very slow reply, I'd forgotten to tell moodle to email me if someone replied. Hopefully, Helen\nComment 4: Helen, My apologies for not seeing this and responding sooner. Since this post I have modified Face to face quite a bit more and am hoping to be able to soon provide the code to the maintainer in the hopes that she can merge the features I have added with the current version. I hope to be able to make this request by the end of this month (March) so hopefully the feature you are seeking will be included in the near future. Regards Jason\nLabel: ",

(Actually, anything which is held in the mdl_facetoface_session_data). However, if you do the backup with user data, and restore without user data, then it works. The issue is within the backup_facetoface_stepslib.php - line 128 $session_data_element->set_source_table('facetoface_session_data', array('sessionid' => backup::VAR_PARENTID)); which does the back up of the data only if user data is selected. I would recommend it be removed out of the user backup section and place it in the data backup section. (I moved it to line 121 before the line if ($userinfo) { This allows things like location to be backed up without user data.

Maybe there is something broken and this will help someone who is having the same problem.\n\nPROBLEM:\nManager Approval - When approving requests F2F is failing to accurately assign a statuscode of 60 (MDL_F2F_STATUS_WAITLISTED) when a session has reached capacity.\n\nIn the function:\nfunction facetoface_approve_requests($data) { ... lots of code ... and then you come to this...\n\n// Check if there is capacity\nif (facetoface_session_has_capacity($session, $contextmodule)) {\n$status = MDL_F2F_STATUS_BOOKED;\n} else {\nif ($session->allowoverbook) {\n$status = MDL_F2F_STATUS_WAITLISTED;\n}\n}\n\nFUNCTION WHERE THERE IS A PROBLEM FOLLOWS:\nfunction facetoface_session_has_capacity($session, $ context = false) {\n\nif (empty($session)) {\nreturn false;\n}\n\n$signupcount = facetoface_get_num_attendees($session->id);\nif ($signupcount >= $session->capacity) {\n// if session is full, check if overbooking is allowed for this user\n//if (!$context || !has_capability('mod/facetoface:overbook', $context)) {\n// return false;\n//}\n\n//the above commented out of the original f2f code and was replaced with this:\nreturn false;\n}\n\nreturn true;\n}\n\nI had to comment out the piece where it checks if overbooking is allowed for this user. When this piece of code is NOT commented out (as shown) it returns TRUE even when the session is at or above capacity - short circuiting its ability to indicate a session that is full.\n\nDoes this function get used by some other piece of f2f that needs those commented out lines? If this logic is required somewhere it will need to be moved out of the facetoface_session_has_capacity() function.\n\nFeedback? Does this function work \"as-is\" for others?\n\nThanks!\n-Rob\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: wow - is there a way to maintain line breaks and spacing in the post?\nLabel: ",

To resolve these I had to make changes to mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php, I've attached the patch to this post. To summarise the issues: $dbman->add_field(), create_table() and drop_field() appears to return void so don't assign this to $result. (This appears to be already known: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=217299 ). $OUTPUT->notification() is an empty object, add $OUTPUT to the list of globals at the start of xmldb_facetoface_upgrade(). Property $DB->debug isn't accessible (protected) so remove these. The second parameter for $DB->get_records() should be either null or an array. The field list for $DB->get_records() should be in the fourth parameter. Unless of course there's something very wrong with my installation. All the best, Leon\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

How do I setup a wait listed f2f session? Currently when I create a session and fill the booking it removes it from the available sessions list and tells me the booking is full. Scott Karren\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Scott, What we mean by wait-listed session is slightly different than what you have in mind I think. A 'wait-listed session' in the Face-to-face module is a session for which no date is currently set. Users can then register their interest in attending a Face-to-face course even if it's not offered at this time. There is no way at this time to \"exceed\" the capacity of a given session but this can be approximated by adding a second session without a date on which users can sign-up if the other one is full.\nComment 2: Francois Thank you for the clarification. So if a user signs up for a 'wait-listed session' as you have described above what happens if a booking opens up in a non-wait-listed session? Can users be moved automatically from a wait-listed session to a non-wait-listed session? What would the process be in this case? Scott Karren\nComment 3: No, at the moment, the two sessions (the scheduled one and the wait-listed one) are completely separate. Thus the wait-list cannot be used to fill the spots of the people who cancel, unless the instructor manually adds them, or if they come back to the page by chance and see that a spot has freed up. It would probably be a good idea to implement something like that though. I'd have to think about how to do this while keeping the UI as simple as possible. If you have any ideas, I suggest that you create a new ticket in the tracker and describe how you see it working. Cheers, Francois\nComment 4: Thanks for the reply. I have added CONTRIB-408 to the tracker. Scott Karren\nComment 5: I'm using the latest version of face to face in moodle 2.5 and the waitlist functionality seems to have no effect at all. Whether Allow overbooking is set to on or off, the session can be overbooked and no waitlist messages ever go out. Does anyone use this feature? It seems like the following tracker implemented a waitlist feature but it is not working for me: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-408?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:changehistory-tabpanel#issue-tabs\nLabel: ",

Of course, as I have customised both, I went back to basics to find it, and here is what I found. Regardless of the result of the Face to Face session, (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) Face to Face still injects a completion status of 1 into the table mdl_course_modules_completion . (Note - if course completion is set to require 100% to pass, this is not an issue - just reporting through Activity Tracker, which utilises the completionstatus flag in mdl_course_modules_completion ) Now one could argue either way for this - that they technically have completed the module, however got a pass mark of 0%, or they have not completed the module because they didn't turn up. Myself - I argue the second option - but interesting to see other thoughts out there. Any one with thoughts? Cheers Peter\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Actually, after a bit more work and investigating - it is not the F2F as such. By default with course completion, any grade is enough to complete. If you then go into grades, Grade Administration->Categories and items->Full View , then set the \"Grade to Pass\" to be higher than 0.(probably 100)  This then injects a 2 for a pass, or a 3 for a fail into the mdl_course_modules_completion module, and then need to modify the Activity Tracking to look for just a 1 or a 2, not anything that is inserted into the field. Simple when you know how????? Cheers Peter\nComment 2: We don't make use of partial attendance or no show.  If we did use no show, I would NOT want it to indicate that the activity has been completed under Completion Tracking. Thanks for sharing your workaround.  Looks a bit complicated to me though.  I think it'll be easier for us if I just remove the option to select partial attendance or no show to prevent teachers from selecting those options. If we were to use \"No show\" on our system, I would want it to allow users to re-book another session. As it is now, students can only book one session of a Face-to-face activity.  If they're not able to attend the session for whatever reason, how do I let them book another time instead.  I'm still not so sure how to handle this properly.\nComment 3: This did end up complex for us, and screwed with a few other things. So - in the back end, I remmed out the No Show and Partially Completed so the only thing that can be completed is Attended. If the student is a No Show, then the facilitator removes them from the session. In this way, they are not marked as completed, but they are also not prevented from booking into another session. I also have a report that displays reasons for cancelled sessions, and if the user that cancels the session isn't the student, then it reports as a no show. I hope that makes sense. Cheers Peter\nComment 4: Yes, it does make sense and it helps.  Thanks! I wish the teacher/facilitator didn't have to manually remove the no shows but I guess it needs to be done.\nComment 5: Peter, Thank you for sharing the information regarding this bug and your workaround. May I ask what ended up happening with the workaround? Which issues did you run into? In our case, we want to use the functionality of \"No Shows\" and \"Partially Completed\", but of course it has to function correctly. Thank you for sharing!\nLabel: ",

A F2F course requires manager approval, and a user signs up to the course. An email is sent to the manager, and the student - all is good. However, the student is not given an indication on the screen that they are waitlisted, so they can sign in again. The big gotcha, is once they sign in a second time, even once they are approved and the status as an admin says booked, the end user still has the status as being able to sign up. They will NEVER see on their screen that they are booked in - they will always get the option to sign up. Of course, if they sign up again AFTER they are approved, then they get un-booked and put as waiting for approval, and the whole cycle starts again. Any thoughts? This is latest iteration of F2F and moodle 2.4.3+ (Dated this week) Cheers Peter\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Actually, ignore this - I found the issue. (My meddling, not yours - my apologies) Ended up because I removed the no show (due to other reasons) by remming the line define('MDL_F2F_STATUS_NO_SHOW',            80); it inadvertantly caused an issue further down, where it would not ever show the person as having been booked in to attend the session.

Cheers, Alastair\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Alastair, after upgrading on my moodle 2.3.1 I get the following error message when I try to add a new session or edit an existing one: ERROR: Incorrect number of query parameters. Expected 1, got 0. Flotter\nComment 2: Hi Flottter, I am having trouble reproducing this bug. I have tested it on both a fresh install of Moodle 2.3.1 and an upgraded Moodle 2.3.1 and have been unable to reproduce the bug. Would you be able to turn on debugging and get some more information? and also tell me when exactly it appears. Does it happen when you click the add session button or when you click the \"Save changes\" button after entering details? It would be also be helpful to know if you have any custom fields and which settings you have chosen for the session. Thanks, Alastair\nComment 3: Hi Alastair, this is the debug message: Notice : Undefined variable: params in /public_html/testserver/mod/facetoface/lib.php on line 3619 It hapens when I click the lnk \"Add a new session\" Some additional info: PHP Version 5.3.16 5.5.24.55 Cheers, Flotter\nComment 4: Hi Alastair, I have had a similar issue but used a suggestion from an earlier posting as a work around... In the site admin settings I unselected the \"Session role\" where it indicated \"student\". I was then able to add sessions including the 3 custom fields that I have set up. Having tested it a bit I can get the student grades to flow through to the grades book; manually add and remove students and take attendance as intended. Apart from unselecting the site role it seems to work well for me. Cheers Mark\nComment 5: Hi, I'm new on here and in moodle development in general. on moodle 2.3.2 I found a bug in your old and new release, which gave me empty editor field when i wanted to edit session details, even tho database was updated. long story short, on line 210 \" $toform->details = $session->details;\" should be \"$toform->details['text'] = $session->details;\" after I did that I was able to edit session details. Dennis.\nComment 6: Hi Dennis, Meant to reply with a thank you - confirmed the bug in our system and patched it. :D Nice work. Cheers Peter\nComment 7: Dennis Thanks for the fix, works perfectly. Just to let others know it is in the sessions.php file Cheers Richard\nComment 8: Hi Alastair, my problem is, that the event/session dates are shown as global dates in the calendar, not as course dates. So our calendar is overcrowded with thousends of session dates. Is there a workaround to solve this problem?\nComment 9: I'm wondering this myself. The sessions all show up in ALL courses upcoming events block. It would be nice if they just showed up in activities 's course cal.\nComment 10: Hi, The same issue existed on 1.9 version - http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-2850 - but I thought this was changed to display a course based activity for calendar, but could also write to the global calendar. I've not yet used f2f on our 2.3 site - but was about to update today when I read through the forums. This would be a real pain on an otherwise great tool.\nComment 11: Hi Gordon,\n\nIn our case, an F2F activity allows us to schedule our courses in various cities around the country.\n\nIf the sessions did not display on the global events calendar, we would have to create them manually, so that our customers would still be able to view these upcoming classes regardless of whether or not they were enrolled in the course or even registered on the site.\n\nThis change would considerably diminish the value of the F2F module to us.\n\nI understand how important it must be for other users of the module to have the sessions viewable as a course level event, Perhaps a setup option where you could choose to display the session as either a global or course event would work.\n\nRegards,\n\nJenna\nComment 12: Hi All, Just thought I'd let people know that there is some work in progress to increase the configurability of the calendar events. Hopefully once that is done it will work for a lot more possible situations and be much more flexible. Cheers, Alastair\nComment 13: Hi Alistair, Great to hear it. Jenna - I agree that there are different use cases - it's the ability to make it configurable as either/or that's important. When you've got 40+ courses using the block having all sessions display globally becomes a negative as users get swamped with upcoming events - but I certainly see uses for being able to display a session globally to alert all users (eg drop-in sessions). Regards, Gordon.\nComment 14: Hi, Is there any update on this?  I, too, would like to be able to set F2F sessions as course events rather than global events. Thanks, Aylwin\nComment 15: Hey guys, I'm new here and I just have a question or two ... I have to use Moodle 2.4 for a project, soo is there a version of the face 2 face add-on for Moodle 2.4? Thank you, Vlad.\nComment 16: The current version of face to face works with our installation of Moodle 2.4.\nComment 17: Ok, thanks. I'm going to give it a try and reply you again in case I have any issues. Thanks again, Vlad.\nComment 18: It is a great module. Thank you for keeping up with it. Couple of questions: 1. We have not been able to display sessions on the course page (Windows install, Moodle 2.4) 2. All links to the documentation on the module download page are broken. Is there documentation we can use at different location?\nLabel: ",

I have been happily using a 1.9 version of moodle with face-to-face for about 4 years, and decided to attempt an upgrade to v2.3.   As per the upgrade documentation, that required going to v2.2 first. Unfortunately, the upgrade failed for the Face-to-Face module, with this error: mod_facetoface Field \"shortname\" already exists Stack trace: * line 573 of /lib/ddl/database_manager.php: ddl_exception thrown * line 141 of /mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php: call to database_manager->add_field() * line 540 of /lib/upgradelib.php: call to xmldb_facetoface_upgrade() * line 271 of /lib/upgradelib.php: call to upgrade_plugins_modules() * line 1437 of /lib/upgradelib.php: call to upgrade_plugins() * line 269 of /admin/index.php: call to upgrade_noncore() I removed the module and continued with the upgrade, which succeeded, and then attempted to add the face-to-face module again, but continue to get the same error. Is there a way to recover from this? The \" Server Checks\" page says that everything is ok.  I'm running PHP ver 5.3.8 and mysql ver 5.1.65.14.0.    I installed moodle ver 2.2.6 (planning to then upgrade to ver 2.3). Thanks for any assistance. -- Steve Messinger\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Steve, You should be able to fix this problem by changing the following line in mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php about line 141: $result = $result && $dbman->add_field($table, $field1); needs to be changed to if (!$dbman->field_exists($table, $field)) { $dbman->add_field($table, $field1); } Hopefully after that has been changed the upgrade will work without breaking. Cheers, Alastair\nComment 2: Hi Alastair, 1st thank you for your time.  I'm also getting the same error when trying to upgrade to facetoface 2.2+. I tried the code change you're recommending above but got a different error message.  Here it is.. mod_facetoface Notice: Undefined variable: field in /home/cooptraining/dev/mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php on line 141 Fatal error: Call to a member function getName() on a non-object in /home/cooptraining/dev/lib/ddl/database_manager.php on line 153 Version I'm using: Moodle 2.2.6 (Build: 20121112) My SQL : 5.0.92-log PHP: 5.3.18 Thanks, Pierre\nComment 3: Hi Pierre, Sorry it took so long to reply. I noticed a problem with the post I put up with the fix. On the first line where is says \"$field\" it should be \"$field1\". Hopefully once that is done it should work ok.

To the best of my knowledge multiple signups of the same person in multiple sessions of the same activity does not exist,  although there has been some discussion on this topic. You might consider creating multiple copies of the same activity with differrent dates or create a session with multiple dates and times. What is your objective?  ie what use case do you need to satisfy? Jenna\nComment 2: We want manager to sign up for an ongoing community event. The even will happen every Monday in 2013 and we want each manager to sign up multiple times until all the slots are taken.\nComment 3: A. Do you want each Manager to book and attend each Monday session throughout 2013? OR B. Do you want them to book individual sessions because you can not accomodate everyone each Monday? If A, then create one activity with one session containing multiple dates (every Monday) and have them book that event.; If B and its first come first serve, then you would have to create an activity for each Monday session throughout the year.  Again, you will find some discussion on signing up for multiple sessions in the same activity, but I'm not sure that anyone has enabled this in a recent release with custom code.  It's definitely not doable with the current release.

My idea was to: 1- Enable the Completion tracking \"Show activity as complete when conditions are met \" for facetoface to unlock the conditions \"Require view\" and \"Require grade\". 2- Create a third condition call \"Session is over\" which, if enable, will consider the course module for the current user as complete IF the current user is still signup for a session with the status \"session over\" 3- implement the condition \"session is over\" in the module facetoface and in moodle. For now it is working, I based the condition \"session is over\" on the condition \"require view\" and now every time the course page is view the condition check if the current user is still signup for a session over. I had to modify many things, I explain all the modifications I had to make in the .txt document. I am still working on to try a maximum to not modify the moodle code but the facetoface code instead, I would be very happy to have your opinion or your ideas to improve what I have done so far. Also i create a php file : Session_over.php to put at the root of facetoface.I wanted to give you the modified php files but when I create this discussion I couldnt upload more than 100kb.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi David, Which version of Face-to-face are you changes for? the 1.9 version 2.2 version. Are the changes you have made in version control ( GIT )? Would you be able to send me a diff file or branch off the Face-to-face github repository and submit a push request? If not can you email me the full files with all your changes? Thanks, Alastair\nComment 2: Hello Alastair, I am using the version 2.2 of Moodle and the version 2.0 (the one in the link you gave in your previous discussion \"Official Facetoface 2.0\"). Sorry but what do you mean by the changes made in GIT? I sent you the files that I modified by email and as I explain in my mail, now I am trying to change the checking of the course_module_completion table for all the user of all course to a daily task and not for the current user who just log to a specify course. Thank you for your quick answer.\nComment 3: Hello, I modify a bit the code to create a function who will be able to make a daily update of the Table Course_module_completion, to add a row for each sessions of each courses of all users of facetoface. I create a new class in a php file put in the facetoface folder. In the class a function I call this function in the course page view.php ( to try, late suppose to be call in the cron.php) Turn out, It inserts the line but got a fatal error: Fatal error: Call to a member function fetch_assoc() on a non-object in D:\\David\\xampp\\htdocs\\moodle22\\lib\\dml\\my sql i_native_moodle_database.php on line 813 I attach a php files ( 2 versions of the function inside ) The first one use an UPDATE and an INSERT in a FOR, but this time it inserts only one row then the fatal error. The second one is using INSERT INTO and \" implode \" to add the datas. It work but got the fatal error, and if call the function a second time it cannot read the database cause it is not an update but an INSERT on existing row. Where do you think this error come from? Any question email me, or post here\nComment 4: Hello, I made some change, the attach file is the php page I put at the root of the facetoface folder, and the class I am using is the class completion_info3. Right now the data are saved in the database everytime ( INSERT IGNORE INTO ) but still got the error : Fatal error: Call to a member function fetch_assoc() on a non-object in D:\\David\\xampp\\htdocs\\moodle22\\lib\\dml\\my sql i_native_moodle_ database .php on line 813 As I want to call this function in the cron.php for a daily update, if I put it in the admin/cron.php at the end, it got the error but at the end of the cron so no problem, but in the facetoface/cron.php it doesn't work because of the fatal error who kind of stop the normal process of the cron. Any ideas, Thanks?\nComment 5: Hello, I complete the options I wanted to do, Here the final session_over.php to put in the facetoface folder, the other modifications are in my first message of this discussion ( txt files) . You will just have to put call_insert_data(); of facetoface where you want to call the function. In my case, it is in the lib.php of facetoface in the cron function, to have a daily update. Thank you to the people who help me on that.\nComment 6: Hello, I currently put as much as I could in the module facetoface code, and as far as it is, it's working. My last problem is only one line in the completionlib.php of the lib folder, and 2 lines in the modedit of the course folder. I put the in the attachment a text file with the detail. If anyone have an idea I would be very glad to hear. Thanks.\nComment 7: Hi, I finish the last update, now it work perfectly, everything in the facetoface module and not in Moodle, I will try to put on GIT asap to show you how it work. Thanks\nComment 8: Hi David Please would you post here when this is available on Github - it's just what we are after so thank you for your work in developing it! Thanks\nLabel: ",

This is a serious SQL injection vulnerability. (this issue also exists in the 1.9 version\". i have no idea how potentially serious this is, but do know that other hosting providers don't seem to be so concerned about it. Jenna\nComment 2: Hi Glen and Jenna, Although PARAM_RAW is used, the data is still escaped by Moodle so will not result in an SQL injection vulnerability, nor is the search string stored or displayed to the user so will not result in a XSS vulnerability either. In short this does not appear to be exploitable, however the user of PARAM_RAW is still less than ideal so I have updated the f2f module to use a more restrictive param type - this should keep your hosting company happy. Cheers, Alastair\nComment 3: The latest code in the git repo at https://github.com/totara/facetoface-1.9 has the fix in. I'll get a packaged release out tomorrow that will include this patch. Cheers, Alastair\nComment 4: Thank you Alastair.  This will be very helpful for organizations using Remote-Learner as a hosting provider in the US.  Will you be able to make the same mod to the current 2.0 code? Regads, Jenna\nComment 5: Hi Jenna, Unfortunately I can't update the 2.0 version as it is hosted on a github account that I don't have access to. I could issue a pull request but noticed there has been one sitting there since the 31th of October that still hasn't been accepted so I'm not sure if they are being actively looked at. I will however message Jeremy Schweitzer and see if he can get it updated. Cheers, Alastair\nComment 6: Jenna, Alastair reached out to us and I think we've fixed this security issue in our 2.0 code. You can check it out here: https://github.com/mynameisdongyoung\nComment 7: Very much appreciated.  Thank you Jeremy and Alastair. Jenna\nComment 8: Yes.  Thank You very much Jeremy and Alastair.  Our service provider (Remote Learner) got the fix and certified it for use.  We are thrilled to be able to use this Module.  Thank You for your responsiveness and help.

This is not good for us. We need the calandar entry to be Course wide, as we have many different departments / courses using our single install of moodle. As it is, awards, programmes and courses will all have calendar entrys that do not apply to them. Does anyone have a soloution to this? We use Moodle 1.9.7 Many Thanks John\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I'll add +1 to this and have raised a bug report in the tracker for this specific issue if you'd like to vote - http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-2850 If events are course based they must be targeted at individuals on that course, not displayed on the site-wide calendar where they just confuse everyone else. Thanks, Gordon.\nComment 2: This isn't a bug  - you can disable this behavior under the Face-to-face options by unchecking \"Show on the calendar\". If you want it to show up on the course calendar you can either add it manually or wait for people to sign up and then it will appear on their own calendars.\nComment 3: I disagree - perhaps it's terminology semantics about what a bug is. Would you be happier if it was called a usability flaw? I have tutors starting to use this actively so the global calendar is getting overwhelmed with course specific content. The default setting is to show on calendar, and if you're co-ordinating training sessions that sounds like the right thing to do. The tick box option can't be disabled by the administrator without hacking the code. If the calendar populated was the course one instead of the site calendar it wouldn't be an issue. After testing this I've also found that if someone saves the event with those default settings then edits to uncheck the calendar box the events remain visible in the global calendar (I'd call that a bug too).\nComment 4: I still wouldn't call this behavior a bug. This is the exact behavior that plenty of people need, so a whole sale change to course specific context would be a regression for us. I see you added this request to the tracker, but I disagree with your characterization. Instead, a new feature request to add the ability to choose the context would more appropriate. I'd also say that the other two complaints are best served by feature requests as neither are technically a bug. A bug is when something doesn't function the way it was intended, in this case each function behaves exactly the way it was designed and are perfectly usable for many scenarios. However, I would agree that adding a way to set the global default for whether an event appears on the calendar or not and an easy way to remove events from the calendar would be useful new features.\nLabel: ",

I noticed that apart from custom  fields, the module site setting page includes a section on \"Site Notices\". This also appears in the language phrases of the module. Could you please explain what site notices mean? One other thing - regarding custom fields. Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations of the field. In non-custom fields this was handled easily via the language editing. I don't know if this is a major change, but it may be worth noting for future versions.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: > Could you please explain what site notices mean? I haven't used them before, but it seems like they provide a way to post notices for particular sessions, dependent on the custom field values for that session. So if you have some special instructions that apply to a particular session or group of sessions you can use it to inform the attendees. Apparently the notice appears in the new version of the face-to-face block (not yet on moodle.org but available here: http://git.catalyst.net.nz/gw?p=blocks-facetoface.git;a=summary ). > Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be > problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations >of the field. This is a difficult issue, because at the moment there is no way to add new language strings using the language string editor, so if you create a new custom field there's no way to create a language string for it. The session custom fields is based off the User profile fields code, so presumably this is also a problem for user custom fields too? Simon\nLabel: ",

For example, let's say that Joe is signed up for two different courses: Tuesday at 10:30 AM Wednesday at 10:30 AM In Joe's calendar, the Tuesday session appears correctly as being at 10:30 AM. However, his Wednesday session shows up as being at 2:30 PM (which happens to be the time of another available session, but he isn't signed up for that). I've verified that Joe is enrolled in the right sessions, and Joe can see the correct time if he enters the activity through the weekly outline rather than the calendar.

What I did was: Open the mod\\facetoface\\lib.php file Change all references to iCAL to vCAL (watch out for a few words that have ical in them - like practical). Change all references to .ics to .vcs. It seems to be working really well so far.  Fingers crossed I don't run into any problems!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: As an update, the one problem I'm still having with face-to-face is that I can't get a .vcs file on my Cancellation emails.

Right now we have two moodle courses set up for each course. One course is for the live instruction portion for which we use face to face. The second is for the online learning content where we have uploaded scorm content. The course is sequential meaning that the online content does not become available until the user completes the live instruction course. I tried using Activity Locking (I'm don't fully understand all of its features yet) but the problems I have are two fold: 1 - We run the same live instruction course in dozens of cities. Each instance/session is its own face-to-face and a user need only attend one face to face session to be eligible for the online content. It seems as if the activity lock is an all or nothing proposition, I can't set it to say that any face-to-face attendance would qualify to unlock the online learning content. 2 - The online learning content is accessible for 60 days from the face-to-face/live session attendance. Any ideas on how to control this? Right now we do this manually. Thank you\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Jon. As for issue one if you open just one face-to-face activity but then open different sessions for that activity (these can be on different times and in different locations) this should solve your problem. Actually, I think this should be the correct use of this activity. The only times we open more than one face-to-face activity, is when there is a significant difference between the two - e.g. begineer vs. advanced intructor-led training. I have an idea concerning issue 2. If you use groups and groupings, you can then put the online content (SCORM) to be visible only to a specific grouping , and then define the availability of this resource/activity according to when the group had the training. So, if you put copies of the SCORM activity in the course, only the group members would see it according to the availability setting set within the actvity. Using groups/groupings would also prove valuable to track the grades and completion of activities per group. You can distribute the people in the groups or perhaps better yet - avoiding manual work - give each group a unique key for course enrolment and they are then automatically put into their group. One more thing - is there a specific reason you put the online and face-to-face activities in different courses? Wouldn't it be easier for learners if you put it in the same course - say in topic 1 and topic 2? Best of luck. Ask more if I was not clear.\nLabel: ",

I don't know of any way to do this. The more sessions we have the harder it gets to find which session someone attended, it would be great if I could type in a part of someones name and have it list all the names in each session that match. This would work ok as a block but I would like to have it built into the face-to-face module. Any ideas? Finding which sessions a person signed up for is an issue because the way the Face-to-Face module works now a student can only sign up for one session per activity. If they sign up for a session and don't attend, they can't sign up for another session until they are removed form the roster of the first session. It would be much quicker to search for their name then it is to go though the attendee list of all the past sessions to find and remove them. Thanks,\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I think you can do at least some of this with the built in features of Moodle. With teacher/admin permissions: In the course page click Participants/Students under the \"People\" block Search the participants list if it is long Click the desired participant's name Click \"Activity Reports\" Tab Look for the face-to-face activity under the topic/week it is on You will see \"status: signed-up\" if the person is signed up I could not see how you could find out to what session they are signed up - let us know if you did...\nComment 2: Amir, I have most of the Face-to-Face classes on the frontpage so they aren't in an actual course and I don't think the method you listed will work. Thanks for the reply, maybe I need to move them into courses...

Any plans to manage the idnumber? thanks in advance matteo http://matteoredaelli.wordpress.com\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Matteo, I'm not very familiar with the feature you are describing (which might explain why it's not in the Face-to-face module!).\nComment 2: Francios, we are talking about a course_module's idnumber - that is new in Moodle 1.9 - and used, for example, in the gradebook on expert and import, and to refer to grades in calculations.\nComment 3: Yes, The attendances of facetoface sessions are saved in \"mdl_grade_items\" table with a blank IDNUMBER field when you create/update other activities like scorm you can setup an IDNUMBER and that value is then saved in \"mdl_grade_items\" when the user finishes the scorm object. we use IDNUMBER (of courses and scorm activities) as link to SAP ID courses. it would be useful to be able to set up an IDNUMBER for each FACETOFACE activity regards matteo\nComment 4: Hi, We are trying to obtain the same functionality so i think the code should be modified like this: • in the mod.html file of the module i think we have to add some lines like this : .... if (empty($form->activid)) { $form->activid = ''; } .... <tr valign=\"top\"> <td align=\"right\"><b><?php print_string('activid', 'facetoface') ?>:</b></td> <td align=\"left\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"activid\" size=\"55\" value=\"<?php p($form->activid) ?>\" alt=\"<?php print_string('activid', 'facetoface') ?>\" /></td> </tr> • then in lib.php of the module in the facetoface_grade_item_update function we have to use the facetoface->activid variable i think something like this : $params['idnumber'] = $facetoface->activid; It seems that in adding a new facetoface this will do the job. I am still working to see how to obtain a good functionality also in editing an already existing facetoface activity. If someone can take a look at this code i am waiting for feedback.

When signing up for a face-to-face session, the user has the option to be notified by: Email ical attachment Or both The issue I am having is if the user selects the both, or ical attachment (which is what our suggested option would be) the email comes through fine, however, the attachment shows as File type: Outlook Item File Size: 636 bytes If you click on the attachment it opens up a blank message in MS Outlook.

On my sandbox environment, the email is sent immediately after I assign an attendee to the session, which can cause problem if I select the wrong person in the list for example. I would like to explore different ways: - either having a confirmation button before sending the confirmation email (kind of approving the attendee's list, that would send the email to the whole list at one time) - or be able to setup a number of days before the session date to send the email for ex. 7 days before (my session events are often de-scheduled ans re-scheduled so I do not want to pollute users mailbox for nothing). This feature could also be used for reminder emails some days before the session. I have seen we can disable the email confirmation. If I do so and enable it while having already a list of attendees, what happens ? can we then send the confirmation mail to the list ?? Did anyone already developped something on this subject ? Feedbacks appreciated. Thanks for your help Sandrine\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Sandrine, If you use the teacher view (from the attendees list) to add/remove students to a Face-to-face session, then you can click the optional checkbox which allows you to suppress the email notifications before you add/remove attendees. That way if you need to add a bunch of people tentatively, you can click the checkbox and they won't hear about it under the reminder email comes in (which you can configure in the activity settings). If you need to remove them from the course before the reminder is sent out, then you can do so from the same page. As long as you click the checkbox before removing them, they will not receive an email. Cheers, Francois\nComment 2: Thanks François, Ive been trying what you've suggested, but I face 2 issues: - If I check the checkbox, then the confirmation mail is not sent to the attendees, but they receive anyway an email welcoming them to the course  such as: ' Welcome to 14 - Booking & Autofreighting! /a>' http://10.0.230.19/user/view.php?id=218&course=6 If you have not done so already, you should edit your profile page so that we can learn more about you: Is this linked to the fact that my course was not allowed to guest user ? If yes, what triggers this email and how can I cutomiez it ? would the workaround be to open the course to guest and what would be the consequences ? - If I follow your tip, then the user will only receive the remider message, and no confirmation message, right ? If I want to have both (i.e. a confirmation message when I decide and a reminder message at a predefined date before the session date, then I need to customize the confirmation mail feature, right ?\nComment 3: Hi Sandrine, That second email you mention \"Welcome to Course Name\" is not actually coming from the Face-to-face module. Instead, it's coming from:\nComment 4: HI François, Thanks for these details. Regarding your tips, I thought about it, but since I wish to map my users's list to the company Active Directory, which contains about 18.000 names, it is a bit tricky to find the right name to enroll to the session. Is there a known way to do a 'cut & paste' action with the attendee list ? Cheers, Sandrine\nComment 5: Not easily. I think that the cleanest solution to your problem would be to introduce the idea of active/inactive sessions. You could create a sesion which would be inactive (i.e. hidden from users) until you are ready to announce it. Confirmation emails would then get delayed until the session is active. Does that sound like it would solve your problem? Cheers, Francois\nComment 6: Thanks François. Indeed introducing a status (such as planned, open to enrollment, confirmed (means I have enough students to maintaint the session for example), cancelled, deferred) to the session could even enable more possibilities.. I'll think about it Cheers, Sandrine\nLabel: ",

We use Moodle to train technicians around the world but one state requires us to provide face-to-face classes for the technician's first training. After they have taken the face-to-face class they are able to renew their training by taking a course online. (Our training certificates expire every 2 years) The problem is setting up a course just for that particular state that has enrollment limited to those technicians that have already taken a face-to-face class. Some changes would probably need to be made to the core Moodle files as well as the face-to-face code but I would love to have the face-to-face attendence be linked to the online course enrolment somehow. I don't want to have them automatically enrolled in the online course after they attend the face-to-face so the current external enrollment modules won't work for me. When a students attempts to enroll in the online course I would like to have moodle check to verify they have already taken the related face-to-face class, if they have they are enrolled, if they haven't they are told they need to take the face-to-face class first.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Dustin,\nLabel: ",

Template-> Duration: [duration] Result-> Duration 20 hours I have not looked at the code, but does it do substraction in a time base (i.e. from 3:20 to 4:40 would be 1 hr 20 mins, (or less optimally, 80 mins) or does it try to do things decimally as in 1.33333333333333333333333 hours which seems a bit silly.... and in either case why would \"hours\" be used but the number fo minutes unless there was a bug....\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: OK, I looked over the code briefly.... It looks like duration is stored as a decimal hour (stange, no? why introduce a decimal when the number of minutes is an integer value) so this finds the decimal component of duration and compues the minutes $minutes = round(($duration - floor($duration)) * 60); and this is obviously the hours $hours = floor($duration); and then I lose my way with\nComment 2: Hi Marc, The duration field is actually separate from the start and end time. This is done because some sessions can be over multiple days. When adding/editing a session, the number that is entered is in hours with fractional numbers allowed (see the contextual help next to that field). Then it is stored in the database as a number of minutes. Finally, it's displayed to users (on the signup page for example) in a nicer human-readable way: 1 hour 30 minutes.

However, if I set the duraction per the context help screen to \"20 minutes\" and save and then copy or re-edit, the field is populated with 20, not 20 minutes, which suggests to me that \"20 minutes\" doesn;t work..... but if I set the field to .33 that does seem to behave as you suggest.....

I hope I have explained this well.  In my testing it seems to be working beautifully, I just wonder if I am breaking something else by doing this.  ANy thoughts of comments?

I have an issue with facetoface and Certificate, but found the problem in facetoface. My users were telling me they couldn't obtain a certificate after I marked them present in the course, so I did some looking around. I found that the mdl_facetoface_submissions table had a \"Grade\" field. It showed 0 for all my users, even though the actual grade book shows 100% and the Face to Face shows yes for attendance. When I changed the 0 to 100 in the table as a test, I was then able to get a certificate for my test student. Is there a bug in the attendance checkbox code that doesn't change that field, or is it my system that just no longer likes me (been a long day)?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Iver, I think that the reason why this isn't working is simply that we haven't updated the certificate module patch after we moved all of the Face-to-face grades to the 1.9 gradebook.

First, when adding attendees to a face to face through the add/remove attendees screen I am able to add more attendees then has been set in capacity, is this by design or a bug? Second, When a user signs up and selects to receive email and icalendar they are getting two emails one with the confirmation message and one with the ical attachment, again is this by design or a bug. Third, is it possible to attach an html editor to the details or email message editors so that html messages can be sent? The last is more of a request for information, I am not sure what all is involved in making that happen. The first two, if they are bugs I will log tracker issues for them. Scott\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Scott, The first one is by design. This is to allow a teacher to override the limit and sign up more students if they want to. Please file a bug though if it causes any problems (e.g. display problems). The second issue is configurable in the site-wide activity settings. Some mail readers (e.g. GroupWise) turn iCal attachments into a calendar item and make the email disappear completely. These people will need to enable the dual-email option if they want their staff to be able to read the confirmation email. As for the HTML editor, it would be possible to do this, but it hasn't been implemented yet. It is on our TODO list, it simply hasn't been a priority yet. Cheers, Francois\nComment 2: Francois Thanks for the info, it is very appreciated. With regards to the iCal emails. I looked in the site-wide face to face settings and the only option I have is to disable iCal emails for cancellation messages. Is there another option that I am missing? I have version 2008100300. As for the HTML editor, to implement this is it as simple as telling the details and email text boxes to use the html editor or are there other considerations with regards to how the face to face module sends emails out that need to be looked at? Scott Karren\nComment 3: Hi Scott, Sorry, I lied, the option isn't in the site-wide settings. It's per-user at the time of signup: - \"email & iCal\": you get two emails - \"iCal only\": you get a single email with an iCal attachment - \"email only\": a single email without attachments As for the HTML editor, if you search for \"htmlbody\" and \"posthtml\" in lib.php, that should be a good start. I would try to keep the plain text version in there as well for those people who can't get HTML emails (e.g. corporate policy). Feel free to share the good you have, this is definitely something that I'd like to see in the Face-to-face module. Francois\nLabel: ",

The take attendance page now displays the actual attendance and allows teachers to untick checkboxes. iCalendar appointments are no longer sent for wait-listed sessions.

So for each sessionid, I have 2 entries with timestart and timefinish Why is that? Shouldn't there be only 1 entry? Does 1 entry represent the date and the other the time? Can someone explain to me pls why there are 2 entries for each sessionid? 10x in advance\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: You're right, this table can contain more than one date per session. This is to support the multi-day sessions. So for example if you want people to signup for a 2-day first aid course, you can create a single session which requires people to show up on both days.

The module does not appear in the moodle module directory, and links to the face-to-face module that exist in other locations (such as this forum) do not work (e.g. http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=995 )\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Yes, I also noticed this yesterday.

Don't know if it's the latest version but you can still get it from here: http://download.moodle.org/plugins/mod/facetoface.zip Cheers\nComment 2: The problem appears to have been fixed. Face-to-face is back in the module list and all the links seem to work now. Thanks to whoever fixed it.\nComment 3: Hi, Apologies for the temporary disappearance of the Face-to-face entry in the modules and plugins database .

Many thanks, Richard\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: There is nothing currently in the face-to-face module that will do that.  Depending on the version of Moodle you have, you may want to take a look at Mike Churchwards events reminder hack.  You can find it at http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=755 Scott Karren\nLabel: ",

It looks great. I would know like to integrate it into the course page. I have read and re-read the instructions for doing this and keep coming up with a parse error with the code in place. I am not a developer but understand some basic coding, can someone give me very basic instructions on where this code should be placed or even a screenshot or copy of the lib.php with the code in place? Thanks for any help. Scott Karren\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Scott, What version of Moodle are you using? If you want, you can attach your course/lib.php file (before and after your changes) and I can let you know what the problem is. It's probably worthwhile to repost these instructions here for the benefit of other subscribers. Cheers,\nComment 2: Hi Francois, Please find attached my course/lib.php that I would like to add the code for Face to Face course integration. Perhaps you could let us know after which line in the lib.php file we should add the integration code... --- / cvs /moodle18/course/lib.php 2007-10-05 20:19:29.000000000 +1300 +++ course/lib.php 2007-11-06 21:14:08.000000000 +1300 @@ -1382,6 +1382,10 @@ echo \"</span>\"; } + } elseif {$mod->modname == 'facetoface') { +  include_once($CFG-> dirroot .'/mod/facetoface/lib.php'); +  echo facetoface_print_coursemodule_info($mod); + } else { // Normal activity // Accessibility : for files get description via icon. Thank you for a great mod. Tony\nComment 3: Hi Tony, The same instructions apply to your version: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Integrating_Face-to-face_sessions_on_the_course_page But the place where the code needs to be inserted is closer to line 1160. Francois\nComment 4: Thanks Francois... it works a treat! Tony\nComment 5: Francois Thanks for your help in this.  I am using the following: Moodle 1.9+ (20080327) Apache 2.2.6 Oracle 10.2.0.1.0 PHP 5.2.5 I have included both the modified and unmodified lib.php files.  Thanks again, my organization is very excited at the possibility of using this module within Moodle. Scott Karren\nComment 6: I have just improved the instructions on the Moodle wiki: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Integrating_Face-to-face_sessions_on_the_course_page The problem was that I used the patch format without really explaining what it meant. (Only the lines starting with a plus sign had to be added to the code.) I hope the new instructions make the process more obvious. Please let me know if the instructions are still not good enough though. Francois\nComment 7: Francois It worked like a charm, thanks for the help. Has there been any thought of integrating this as a course format? Scott Karren\nComment 8: Hi Scott, Sorry for the late reply. What do you mean exactly by \"integrating this as a course format\"? Do you mean integrating it so that Moodle displays the information on the course page by default? Francois\nComment 9: Francois Thanks for getting back to me. Yes, my original thought was to be able to display the information as part of the course summary so that students would be able to sign up for a f2f session from the available courses page. Thinking about it further it seems that it would make more sense as an enrollment plug-in. Something that would allow the students to sign up for the session they want without having to first enroll in the course and then sign up. One of the things that is a bit inconvenient is the fact that students need to enroll in the course, then sign up for a session. I now have two course rosters that I need to manage, if the student wanted to un-enroll from the course they would first have to cancel the f2f session and then un-enroll. Does this make sense? I am not a developer by any means but I would be willing to invest sometime to take a stab at it if you can point me to the correct files and provide some advice. Scott Karren\nComment 10: I think I see what you mean. At the moment, to approximate what you're describing, you'd have to have automatic enrolment and all of the Face-to-face activities in a course. I'm not sure exactly how I would implement what you're describing because it sounds like it would be putting a lot of interactivity into the course summary element. Perhaps a description of how your courses are organized and how they relate to the Face-to-face activities would help us figure out a way to support your workflow better.\nComment 11: Francois The majority of my courses at present are instructor led with complimentary materials online. I will have one class that I teach five different times throughout the next two months. Students will sign-up for one three hour session and then go online to download the materials needed for the class. Once class is completed they will go back online to complete the class assessment and evaluation. I could put the f2f activities in the first topic of a course and then all subsequent materials in other topics, but students still face the inconvenience of signing up twice for the course. What I kinda envision is that a student will select the course they want from the available courses list, the sessions sign-up screen will appear, the student will select the session they want to attend and then be taken to the course screen itself showing what session they are signed up for and have access to all materials. Again, I wonder if this would be something more suited as an enrollment plugin instead of an activity within a course? Let me know your thoughts or if you have additional questions.
