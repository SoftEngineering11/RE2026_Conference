I'm wondering if there are any plans to improve the (core) H5P attempts report page - it would be good if it was more like the quiz attempts page. If there are a large number of users in a course, and a small number of attempts, there seems no way to easily navigate to those attempts. I have courses where there are hundreds of pages of users listed. The quiz attempts page shows only the attempts, rather than all users whether or not they have attempted it. This would be much more useful. We use groups, and for teachers within groups they only see their own groups, so at least for those teachers it is easy to find the attempts. However, the page only tells a teacher how many attempts there are across all users, which is of no interest to them - they want to know how many attempts there are for their own groups. Again, the quiz attempts report does this very well as it states the total number of attempts and also the numbers from the teacher's own groups. It would be great if these features could be added in the future.\nLabel: ",

I want to prevent a learner from advancing the audio or video , like in Interactive Video. I want Course Presentation to stop on every engagement activity , and not advance to the next slide until the activity is completed and passed. I want Course Presentation to support transparent video. AVI and WebM allow an alpha channel. I want to create an avatar speaker to mimic an instructor, and have that avatar overlay the slide. This lesson is H5P Interactive video , and demonstrates what I want to accomplish in H5P Course Presentation. Why? Because it will be easier to revise individual slides and avatar videos. Because the avatar video is lower bandwidth. Thx\nLabel: ",

Since we have many videos of considerable size, we have uploaded the videos to our YouTube channel and used the link to create the interactive content. We have disabled skipping forward in the behaviour settings of the video. However, since this is a Youtube video, when I access the video on the Moodle app, I am able to skip forward by double-tapping on the video. I want to understand if there is any solution for this either on H5P or YouTube? (this happens only on the app and not on browsers) Another issue we are facing is that if we add a description to the video, then only the description is visible, the video doesnt appear on the app or it appears cropped.\nLabel: ",

The theme in use is Boost. The course formats I use are the standard one ( sections ) or Tiles format. The text editor in use is Tiny MCE. I use the H5P plugin ( black icon activity ) The problem I describe below occurs in both versions and with the different course formats and even if I change the type of text editor. On the previous version of the platform (3.7+), on the other hand, everything worked fine. I would like to understand how to solve it and if there are alternatives. Details In my courses, for ease of navigation, instead of putting H5P activities directly into sections, I decided embed those presentations into labels (or text or media areas) . This way the user can do the activities and then simply scroll down without having to first exit the activity and return to the course. The problem is that the embedded H5P activity is displayed cut off and thus missing the movement panes or the media progress bar, etc.. I have tried 3 types of embedding code. The first one: <p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;\">short description or subitle.</span> </p> <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\" align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> I've already tried changing the dimensions defined within the code , but nothing changes. However, if I put scrolling =\"yes\" the user can at least scroll down and see the rest of the activity...but it's annoying. The second: As the first one, but adding: <script\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/library/js/h5p-resizer.js\"\ntype=\"text/ javascript \"></script> In this case the activity appears cropped, but with a click on the activity it is resized. The third: (which worked on the 3.7+ platform) <div\nalign=\"center\" class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\"\nwidth=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\"\nscrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> This format, which should facilitate viewing with mobile devices, remains \"cropped\" and does not resize or I have to set scrolling to yes (as the first). The goal is to have the H5P window fully displayed. Can anyone help me or provide a better code, please? THANK YOU. 😀 David.\nLabel: ",

I am using Moodle Moodle 4.1.6+ (Build: 20231013) and using the native h5p plugin provided by Moodle (the blue button). I am aware of this post , but there it is only mentioned that content can be upgraded when saving an individual item. This is great of course, but is there any way to do a batch upgrade for all content (as it seems to be the case for the 3rd party hvp plugin?).

Many of the chapters in the course are made up of 3 - 10 H5P files. I would like the experience for students to be as seamless as possible, and not have to go back out to the course menu between H5Ps. I am looking for some best practices here. I will also need to be able to Restrict Access to future chapters until earlier chapters are completed. So, I need to preserve completion data - not for individual H5Ps, but for the collection that make up a chapter. I have some H5Ps that are quizzes. I'm fine with the quiz being a separate experience so that it can be graded on its own with no complications. I have seen some discussion about putting these all on a page, book, or lesson activity. Does someone have a resource for which method to use and why, or a pros / cons list for each, or something helpful in the way of best practices here? Thank you!\nLabel: ",

My problem is that while the H5P plugin is working on the live site, whatever I do, I don't seem to be able to get h5p content working on our development sites (whether the Moodle version is 3.8 or 4.1). It fails gracefully I guess but simply doesn't load the interactive content. My dev environment is using a dump of live, but I have also tried backups and restores and they don't work either in these environments. I have tried using \"update content type cache\" h5p libraries admin and that makes no difference. I can't see the h5p code unless I turned off \"use saved content\" in the h5p admin. If turn that off, I can see the h5p code in the module instance settings, but when I press save it says, \"Something unexpected happened. We were unable to save this content\".

The course format is \"Topics format\", with Enable completion tracking and Show activity completion conditions enabled. The courses are supposed to include more than one H5Ps, so I cannot use the \"Single activity format\". I am dealing with 2 separate issues: 1) When a student goes through the H5P presentation and answers the question in it, the result does not show in Moodle\nin the grade book. I tried to upload the H5P as a Course activity and also directly into the Topic Summary with same result. The issue is essentially similar to this one, only I am using \"Course presentation\": https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=438975 Do\nI understand correctly that in order to import results from H5P to\nMoodle, I basically have to create a custom script which takes care of\nthe XAPI integration? Or is there another way? 2) When the H5P is uploaded as Topic Summary (not as Activity), can I somehow track that it was completed (viewed) by students (for instance, by going through all slides, or answering to questions)? Or the tracking can only be activated for Course Activity elements? If possible, I would prefer using the Topic Summary than Course Activity, as the student don't have to open the H5P, instead they would see its content right away. Any advice would be appreciated.

However, if I create an interactive task, H5P green icon, and I choose the same task, the math expression is not displayed correctly, I see the latex code formula. Why does it occur? If I create a black icon H5P task and I use the task from content bank, latex is displayed correctly too. I installed the math displayed library and  mathjax in my server , modifing config.php file. I am making an interactive book from green icon H5P and I add different tasks, and in a dialog card I have written math expressions and they are not displayed and I can't create it in the content bank because the interactive books are differents. From content bank has less options than green icon type ( I don't know why). Then, How do I fix this problem? Second problem : I want to use Cornell notes h5p activity. I create the interactive activity (green icon), I select Cornell notes, I design the task and I publish it. When I try it as student role, I can write notes, but I can't save them. If I reload the task, I lose all notes and as teacher, I can't see the student's homework of this task. Can't I track or grade Cornell notes from my students?  Is it a bug? I hope to find solutions to my problems. Thanks.\nLabel: ",

As soon as I get to about 10 H5P-exercises I start to notice the difference in speed. When I have over 30 it becomes very slow. But I have content banks with more than 100 exercises!

A drag item (a small image) is to be dragged onto a spot in the background image. When I open the task in the browser on an iOS device (iOS 15.5; ipad or iphone; Browser Safari or Firefox latest versions), I can edit the task as expected. (The drag item can be dragged onto one of the drop zones. The task will be evaluated correctly.) However, if I choose an incorrect answer on the first try and then want to repeat the task, not only is the drag item moved, but also the content of the screen in the background . As a result, drop zones \"disappear\" to the left and are no longer visible or selectable. The drag item can no longer be placed correctly. The task can therefore no longer be processed. I've tried whether you can get to the destination by holding and dragging the drag item, for example, or by tapping the drag item and drop zone. But that was not successful. The problem does NOT occur with MacOS, for example on a Macbook. The problem under iOS is documented in a small video, which is attachted here. (Background: Users expect us to solve the problem. Switching to the Moodle app is not a solution the user wants. They also don't want to work without drag-and-drop exercises. The user is faced with so many iOS -devices used that a change to other devices is not possible.) I would be very grateful for hints on possible causes of error or possible solutions. Thank you very much in advance … Matthias Addendum: The error described does not occur in the same exercise under Wordpress/H5P.\nLabel: ",

We have a large number of users from different institutions, so consequently we use groups to ensure that teachers cannot see details of students in other institutions. The H5P attempts list does not respect groups, so teachers can see attempts from students in other institutions, which is clearly unacceptable. We've had to remove the permission for teachers to be allowed to see any H5P attempts for this reason, which is a pity. There is a tracker item here https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-71662 which was created last year but it doesn't look like anyone is working on it. This seems to me to be a serious privacy issue - surely all Moodle features should respect groups if separate groups are set and teachers do not have the permission to access all groups.

This is for a self-guided learning course and I would like to move the student in the correct direction after finishing a quiz in H5P.

I'm using Moodle version 3.9.2 I'm new to H5P and have access to it as as part of Moodle core. It's a great addition! I'd like to check that the audio files produced when doing the \"Audio Recorder\" activity don't use much file and disk usage resources on my server . If I add the activity, I assume that the files produced would be stored on my Moodle server. Is this correct? What happens if a student accidentally makes a very long recording? Could the recordings end up taking up a lot of space? All information much appreciated!\nLabel: ",

First question why two H5P's or are these different? Now to the issue, Added an H5P 1.22.3 activity (interactive video). First off noticed the Editor says H5Phub. Step 1: Uploaded an mp4 video, then went to step 2 Add Interactions. When trying to add the interactive content, we get an error message saying  \"Network Failure\". If we close this off and save this video - (without interactives), and play the video as if it were a student - it plays fine. Its adding the interactive content that does not work. In my initial search I saw something in regards to imbeded H5P vs H5P hub etc. Could this  be part of the issue? Could seeing 2 versions of H5P be a cause? I am having issues narrowing this down. I also changed the default moodle editor from tinymce to atto, could this be part of the issue? Thank you in advance. Chris Nelson\nLabel: ",

I'm\nmigrating my moodle server form 3.6 to 3.10 version (and\ninfraestructure too). Also, I'm starting to use H5P Activities , instead\nof the H5P Plugin. So I restore my course backups in my new moodle\nserver (on my new infraestrucure), and everything goes fine for me. But,\nwhen I've restored a course and ran the migrating tool to come out with\nthe new version of the activities in the course, everything goes fine\ntill the last activity(H5P.InteractiveBook). It shows me an error and\nthe migrating tool can't finish it work, so I can't migrate the\nactivity. First it shows to me a 502 Proxy Error on port 443, so I\ncheckout if everithing is working fine with my Firewall and Proxy\nservers, and it's all ok. I tried installing a new server on a testing\ninfra, and restore my course, and ran the migrating tool .... and\nnothing happends, I still have an error. The H5P activity is a H5P.InteractiveBook with some videos, and images inside, some question and hotspots. The error is: \"Proxy Error The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

Not sure there's an answer to this observation, but if the same image used in any h5P activity could adjust automatically in the activity for viewing, that would be great--you don't know how the image will appear until previewing the activity in the course site.

I have created interactive videos and interactive books in my test moodle installation 3.9.4+. Via contentbank and H5P activity I put them into courses to try with test-student accounts. In both activities there is a Submit button at the end, however, nothing gets saved. If the teacher looks at the grades of the course, none are displayed. And there is no way to view the attempts of students. If the teacher looks at the H5P itself, it always says \"This content is displayed in preview mode. No attempt tracking will be stored.\" Additonally, it always shows View all attempts (0 submitted) , even if students have submitted their attempts. It's as if the xAPI simply does not work at all, as if content can be created but no communication with moodle takes places for grading or watching progress. I'd appreciate any help in this matter.

There's your clone. Go back to step 6 and discover it doesn't matter which type you chose because you're going to overwrite it anyway. Ok so now I've made my copy and I realised that I don't need it any more. I'll just delete it again. I'll click the package I'll click, eh, maybe edit? Scroll around a while ... can't see anything maybe at the bottom? no? can't see a way to delete Oh wait a minute ... go to the themes control and switch to Boost Now there's a cog menu and underneath it a drop down with Delete Phew! Wow these copies are getting out of control. I'll just go organise them into folder with nice version names or something uh ... click on the folder icon? oh. oh I see.

I am wondering how to best control which content types are available on the site. Here are the options as I understand them: Enable the cron job to download all types from the h5p.org hub. Upload individual .h5p/.zip for each content type you want With option 1 you can download all of the available content types, then delete any that you don't want to support (maybe for accessibility , duplication of functionality of other tools you use, or media storage reasons). The problem with option 1, as I see it, is that any time the cron job runs to fetch updates it will also re-install those unwanted types). Option 2 is attractive, but I'm not clear on where to get the installer files for the content types I want to enable. According to the h5p site, the way to add content types is via the hub that is included in the WordPress/Drupal/ Moodle plugins . I feel like I'm missing a piece here?\nLabel: ",

Strangely enough, on our test system, I have been able to remedy the situation by simply deleting \"cache\", \"localcache\", \"sessions\", \"temp\" and \"trashdir\" (in both paths where applicable). On production, this doesn't seem enough. Only two differences between the systems: 1) Production has internet access and thus 2) Production has more current plugin and content type versions (see 1.21.2 vs. 1.21.8 above) I'm at an absolute loss. PHP Debugging on max level is not helpful: \"session_start(): Unable to clear session lock record\" I'm hesitant to start playing around with session handler, etc. My best guess is some interaction between H5P and the moodle cache. But not sure, how exactly... and even less what I could do about it.\nLabel: ",

Now, it can be used at the Course Category and Course level ( MDL-67786 ). On the other hand, substantial improvements have been applied to xAPI and we already have two of the key xAPI issues in integration, MDL-67734 and MDL-67788 within we can already\nhave tracking in the new H5P activity. Regarding the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we already have the issue in Peer review and we hope to have it in Integration soon. Furthermore, we are working on integrating the Moodle translation system in the H5P Editor ( MDL-68227 ) and adding a post in the translation forum where we explain our approach with the H5P editor localization.\nAlso, we would like to remove the ckeditor from the H5P Editor ( MDL-68240 ) in order to use the current editors in Moodle. Finally, the work in the Repository issue ( MDL-67812 ) has begun and it will allow to easily reuse the contents of the content bank. Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-68116 : Prepare Moodle to be ready when h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We already prepared Moodle to be ready when this year H5P closes h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We have removed https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/ [id] as default value in Display H5P filter and the embed field int the Atto button. It's important to notice that the api.h5p.org will continue to work and the only thing that H5P is going to change is the visibility of the test content on h5p.org, so that only the author can see it. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67734 : Create basic skeleton for a global xAPI library needed for H5P content. MDL-67788 : Add xAPI statement support to mod_h5p. Tracking the students's attempts using xAPI in the H5P activity.

Thanks Andrew for your contribution and Ferran for your hard work here ( MDL-67734 ). Creating folders for organising the content and renaming existing content from the content bank ( MDL-67787 and MDL-67790 ). Integration of the H5P editor ( MDL-67814 ). The first version of the editor is almost ready to peer review. We're currently trying to figure out how to integrate H5P translations with Moodle system. All the issues planned for Moodle 3.9 can be found on the H5P epic ( MDL-67425 ). BTW , the date of the next Moodle 3.9 release has been postponed one month and Moodle 4.0 is planned for November 2021. You'll find this information in the roadmap . Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-67707 : Create a new H5P activity. For now, it only lets teachers grade manually H5P activities . Integration with H5P automatic grading and reporting will be done in MDL-67788 , once xAPI skeleton lands. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67786 : Create a new 'contentbank' plugin type and a new H5P plugin in the content bank. MDL-67795 : Delete content option in the content bank.

This week we have been focusing on the basic structure and design of all different fronts we are working on: The first version of xAPI statement handler is already implemented, documented and waiting for peer review. You can find some more detailed information in xAPI MDL-67734 . The content bank is on its way. For now, the only module in core that uses content bank will be the H5P content manager, but we are sure more will come for future releases. And, as always in Moodle, everybody will be able to create their own content bank plugin as any other plugin type. We hope to get everything ready for Moodle 3.9 and encourage developers to create new plugins that suits their needs. We started working on the H5P core activity ( MDL-67707 ). This will enable users to create new core activities using existing H5P contents in the content bank. We will try to make it as compatible as possible with the current mod_hvp some of you are already using, to be sure you can continue using the content created in older Moodle versions. Hot topics: MDL-67060 : Improve admin UI to make H5P content types management easier for admins showing them all information together in the same page. MDL-67063 : Add a mechanism to support different H5P core_api versions in stable Moodle versions. Warm thanks: To Spanish healthcare system for taking care of some team members.

During this sprint, we will focus on finalizing the standalone version of the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we will provide the Content Bank with new features that will allow us to more easily manage the H5P content packages ( Epic 3.9 ) and integrate xAPI with the new H5P activity ( MDL-67788 ) allowing us to handle the tracking of the H5P contents. In addition, we are working on small issues that will turn the Moodle 3.9 H5P integration into a more robust solution ( MDL-67302 and MDL-67095 ). On the other hand, next week, the Moodle Moot Japan 2020 , from 26th to 28th, will be held in Kumamoto, Japan. There, our Moodle LMS Product Manager, Sander Bangma , will talk about H5P and the future of Moodle LMS. Another opportunity to hear directly from Moodle HQ. Hot topics: MDL-67337 Apply Display H5P filter inside <a> tags: From now on, when somebody copies an H5P content URL from a Chrome browser address bar and pastes it in Moodle's rich text editor, it is pasted as a link, inside <a> tags and the 'Display H5P' filter will be applied.

Our main goal for Moodle 3.9 is: Integration of H5P content types with Moodle gradebook and activity completion. Improved integration of H5P content type selection in Moodle's activity chooser. To this end, we have worked hard to get a first functional prototype that covers most of the needs expressed in the studies and interviews conducted to the community throughout 2019. The result, is an approach that allows Moodle to be more versatile in content creation. To do this, we have created a prototype that separates the H5P activity module from content creation. Two clearly different mindsets. One for the activity and one for the content creation. In this way, a user can create or add new H5P content from Moodle without associating them with an activity. On the other hand, through the activity, you can access those contents in a simple way and use them through a new repository where you can\nchoose the H5P created in the Content Bank and take advantage of all the activity's functionalities as activity completion or grading. On the Content bank, you will be able to create, import and edit H5P files, among other functionalities.\nThrough this separation, we enhance the reuse of H5P contents that are created or imported into Moodle allowing them to be used in any activity or using the Atto editor or the filter anywhere in Moodle. It will help to provide Moodle with great\nflexibility looking forward to the future. We would like to add all the news and progress in the integration of H5P and Moodle every week. Hot topics: You can check the prototype of the activity here . We will add the link to the Content Bank prototype as soon as possible. We are still working on a full version. You can check the Epic for 3.9 here . We are still finishing the work of adding issues in the epic.

It is pretty easy to use. It usually looks good (if you build it well). I keep hearing people say it is better than SCORM (old and broke) and these are people who know what they're talking about. But I keep finding little things that are deal breakers. I can caption video. That's great! But if I add audio, no captioning. I can use YouTube video, which already has captioning (possibly bad captioning, but captioning)...but if I use it in interactive video, where I add questions or interaction, the captioning is gone. There's no way to get captions on a YouTube video with interactive video that I can find. Interactive video is so cool. But if you use a large video (what video isn't?!?), your whole site might suddenly start crashing. Yes, I'm sure. And reporting. This is a big one. First. The reports are...not easy to find. Why would I go to the gradebook for activity reports? Well, if I'm using H5P, that's where I go. If I create an interactive video module, my users have to answer the questions and then manually submit them for it to report to me that they have done anything. If they don't do the submitting thing (and there is no way to know you need to do this), it might not remember they did it. Sometimes it starts where they left off...and sometimes it doesn't. And if the site crashes because the video is big...it always forgets. (to be fair, really large scorm modules can muck things up too, but they remember doing it). I'm not hung up on WHEN they started, just that they did. And that they finish. And that it knows they finish. If I want completion to be contingent on completing the whole thing...well, there is no tracking. I can just click next indefinitely and not do anything. If I set up branching, there is a button at the top that lets me skip entire sections . If I want completion to be contingent on a specific score...well,It doesn't do completion on a particular score--only if a score exists...I could fiddle with grade book settings for a grade to pass but I'm not confident it would actually work, because, well scoring is weird. Really weird. I can get grades (or complete/incomplete) from SCORM. If I find an error and need to change it while it is being used by students, when I make the change, it forces my users to start over. Updating SCORM is easy and doesn't mess up reporting. If I want to know how people answered questions. Well, I'd better use something else. That's not something H5P does. SCORM does it (badly--but I can get the data!). I really want to use H5P but I don't think I can. I need these features that SCORM has. Discuss?\nLabel: ",

It is, admittedly, a long video--90 minutes. Throughout, there are questions (hence, interactive).  It went live and within about 45 minutes my server started acting strange. Users across the site started experience Server 500 errors, intermittently. We looked into it.  Something has been opening database connections, leaving them open, sucking up resources and then spontaneously aborting them.  And then the server crashes. It comes back up and starts all over again. Only one thing has changed: the H5P module went live and started getting use. We had no problems when testing it before the go-live, but then it was just me messing with it. So, it seems pretty likely that the issue is related to the H5P. I switched to H5P from SCORM because I didn't like the way the scorm published video couldn't seem to remember where it left off if the user had to stop and come back (Camtasia published scorms just aren't that smart. The alternative is manually captioning 90 minutes of video in Captivate. No. Just...no. Of course, that would work. but I've already spent hideous amounts of time fidgeting my captions to deal with the fact that Safari and Chrome only allow one line of caption...). I'm running Moodle 3.6.2 (will probabaly upgrade to 3.7 in November or Dec).  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or why it would cause this problem?\nLabel: ",

I can't do that - where am I looking for in the folder structure - am I looking in the mod/hvp folder or some other folder e.g. lib/ I'm not finding it very clear, but that is probably me misunderstanding.

Do you know how can I do this? I was trying to do this, so tried to \"receive a grade\" for h5p content. But it does not seem okey.\nComment 3: The way that I would go about this, is add the video using the 'h5p interactive video' element - I would add an interaction at the end of the video which asks a question. This could be asking them something factual from the video (with an identified correct answer), or this could be a question along the lines of - 'having watched the video, are you ready to move onto the quiz' (where yes = correct, no = incorrect) You then have the necessary information to check 'completion' - which is then used to make the quiz activity available. An alternative (and less good) way of doing this, is to make the quiz available but not shown on the course page, you then (again using h5p interactive video) add a summary screen which includes the link to the quiz. I have done this with a client who specifically wanted this, but this isn't great for the person to revisit the quiz in the future, and if you create a new course based on this one, you would have to remember to go into the H5p to update the link to the quiz.\nComment 4: I already use h5p content. I added a question at the end of the video like your example. The question is working but even a student answer the question and complete the video, the quiz is not being eligible. It still says \"you have to recevie a grade\" on the quiz screen.\nComment 5: Which version of Moodle are you using? And are you using the core H5p item, or the 3rd party H5p activity. With newer versions of Moodle and the core activity you should be able to set the required passing grade within the h5p activity setup itself. If you cannot do this (e.g. older moodle or 3rd part plugin) what you have to do, is do this via the gradebook - which is a bit fiddly. Go into the Gradebook, and Gradebook setup\nComment 6: I am using Moodle 5.0.2 and core h5p item. Would be so good if you have screenshots about steps. I am still searching about this. I am trying to use different combinations on settings of h5p content, activity and general settings.\nComment 7: If you have Moodle 5.0 then you shouldn't need to worry about the Gradebook - you should be able to set the pass score directly in the H5p activity in the course. I don't have Moodle 5 yet myself, so cannot produce screenshots for you. Note - please see the comment from Oliver about the need to add in a 'Submit screen', I had forgotten to mention that (I was answering via my phone before so didn't have an activity open in front of me at the time).\nComment 8: Could be the issue: Interactive Video does not send any results unless the student actively submits them via a submit screen. One submit screen should be inserted at the end of the video automatically, you can add more, and students can open one themselves by clicking on the star button.\nLabel: ",

I'm wondering if there are any plans to improve the (core) H5P attempts report page - it would be good if it was more like the quiz attempts page. If there are a large number of users in a course, and a small number of attempts, there seems no way to easily navigate to those attempts. I have courses where there are hundreds of pages of users listed. The quiz attempts page shows only the attempts, rather than all users whether or not they have attempted it. This would be much more useful. We use groups, and for teachers within groups they only see their own groups, so at least for those teachers it is easy to find the attempts. However, the page only tells a teacher how many attempts there are across all users, which is of no interest to them - they want to know how many attempts there are for their own groups. Again, the quiz attempts report does this very well as it states the total number of attempts and also the numbers from the teacher's own groups. It would be great if these features could be added in the future.\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

In case you have any further questions, I'm moving your post to the H5P forum where the experts hang out (as I don't know anything more about managing H5P content types!)\nComment 2: Hello. Sorry for my late reply. I have installed a fresh installation of moodle to test it. It is not a H5P case. It's a moodle case because of the proxy is not used when trying to download contetent types. I already tried to import manually the content type but it is not a suitable solution (upgrading content types is complicated). And some content types needs specific versions of libs. The easiest way is to use the proxy. The line ++ Blocked https://api.h5p.org/v1/content-types/: The URL is blocked. [user 2] ++ says that the url is not reachable. But a manually curl using the proxy is working: `* using HTTP/1.x` `> GET /v1/sites HTTP/1.1` `> Host: api.h5p.org` `> User-Agent: curl/8.14.1` `> Accept: */*` `>` `* Request completely sent off` `< HTTP/1.1 200 OK` And a manual test using the cURL lib in php works too. How could I force the use of the proxy in moodle. Set the proxy adresse/port not work. Alternatively, could you tel me which file is used for the job ? Maybe I can try to set directly in it the proxy ? Thanks.\nComment 3: Found. It was a moodle probelm. The defautl config blocks a lot of IPs for curl requests. I have to customize this t get it working ...\nComment 4: \"The defautl config blocks a lot of IPs for curl requests.\" You must be using some third-party packaged Moodle.

I want to prevent a learner from advancing the audio or video , like in Interactive Video. I want Course Presentation to stop on every engagement activity , and not advance to the next slide until the activity is completed and passed. I want Course Presentation to support transparent video. AVI and WebM allow an alpha channel. I want to create an avatar speaker to mimic an instructor, and have that avatar overlay the slide. This lesson is H5P Interactive video , and demonstrates what I want to accomplish in H5P Course Presentation. Why? Because it will be easier to revise individual slides and avatar videos.

How can I do this for H5P interactive video? TIA Prasita\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: You'd need to change the code of Interactive Video, there's no such setting, unfortunately. The downside of this approach would be that you'd get multiple attempts registered inside the gradebook, one for each transmission. The other downsides would be those implied by patching and forking. Note that all involved H5P contents (the main content and its subcontents) send out xAPI statements (\"results\") individually. The respective H5P integration (e. g. the plugin for Moodle or Moodle's own integration) could pick those up and store them as they see fit, but commonly do not. They only keep track of the main content, which in this case is Interactive Video. In other words: This could also be done by changing the code of the H5P integration (Moodle) without the need to change content types (and would help for some other content types, too). You'd probably have to introduce the concept of preliminary scores though, if Moodle's gradebook (or other host platforms' grade books) don't have that in order to make clear that the user has not completed the exercise. And, of course, there would be some variations, but long story short: You won't make that happen without changing code. Alternative: Use a Learning Record Store instead of Moodle's Gradebook, but that's likely not want you want.\nComment 2: Thank you Oliver, I shall experiment with the Learning Record Score to see if it fits the requirement.\nLabel: ",

I removed all custom css for the theme and in the H5P settings and it makes no difference. Has anyone had this happen?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: There was a problem a few versions back, where the 'container' that contained the H5p content was dynamically reacting, so it would load, then resize itself slightly to fit, but that then changed the dimensions, so it resized again - and it basically got into a repeated loop of making itself slightly bigger then slightly smaller which appeared to the user as flickering. If my memory is correct it only did it on certain browsers (sorry I forget which) and it only did when the screen width was within a certain range (e.g. it didn't happen on narrow screens or very wide screens). The solution was to add some CSS to change the way the container behaved - but as this was a few versions back, I no longer have that code, but if you use the inspect tools to inspect the page as it is doing it, you may be able to work out the culprit, and make the necessary tweak to stop it from happening. Apologies for being slightly vague here, but it was 4 or 5 years ago that this happened - I thought it had gone away for ever so didn't keep the code that fixed it.\nComment 2: thank you so much for replying! Yes I suspect it is a sizing issue but I've inspected and not found anything that works. But I will press on. IF ANYONE ELSE KNOWS THE SOLUTION, please reply... this is keeping us for upgrading past our current version of 4.3. Note it did not happen in that Moodle version, and removing all custom CSS did not solve the issue. We have not changed anything except the Moodle version.\nComment 3: We have a client experiencing similar in Moodle 4.5. As described, appears to be dynamically resizing, and appears as a flickering. It's also a branching scenario with video. We have not found a solution thus far.\nComment 4: Thank you, yes we saw it in 4.5 also, which is why we then switched to 4.4.6 hoping it would not happen there but it does. It does not happen in our current production version of 4.4.3. So something happened between 4.4.3 and 4.4.6\nComment 5: Solved by adding additional css to h5p settings: html.h5p-iframe, html.h5p-iframe > body { width: 102%; height: 102%; } html.h5p-iframe .h5p-content { width: 60%; height: auto;\nComment 6: Dear Mia, It seems to me that there is a margin or content etc. that is pushing the H5P container beyond the 100% width therefore a matter of working out what that is to improve the solution and gain a better understanding of the 'why'. What are the exact steps to replicate please? Kind regards, Gareth\nComment 7: I guess the steps would be to add a branching scenario and then put a video in it while using the Moodle versions I have found that have the issue. That would be 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6. It happens with nothing extra in the boost css or the H5P css. Happens in chrome and edge but not Firefox . Turning off hardware acceleration in browser settings has no effect (that was one suggestion I had on another site).\nComment 8: Dear Mia, Do you have an example h5p file I can use please?  As the one on H5P.org that contains a video cannot be downloaded -> https://h5p.org/branching-scenario#example=439819 . Gareth\nComment 9: UPDATE: Actually, perhaps there was a browser update at our organization because the issue is no longer happening, even without the new custom css I put into the H5P settings to solve it. So I'm going to just need to keep an eye on this. It is working now. === I can send you an abbreviated version with public domain video placeholders. The videos and the original lesson are pretty big to post. ok to send you a PM in Moodle?\nComment 10: Dear Mia, Thanks for the update. If the browser update doesn't work, then I'd be intrigued and have a look with a link sent via PM. Kind regards, Gareth\nLabel: ",

Portability is meant to be a feature of H5P. I think the most important difference in the options is how the package files are stored and managed. The content bank provides a convenient place to store a content package so that it may be used in more that one place with out duplicating the file. A package in the content bank can be included with the filter in multiple locations or the file can be linked into activity using the Moodle file system using the content bank repository which is searchable. If you edit the package, changes will appear every the package is linked. These features are unique to the content bank implementation. If you do not need these file management features, it does not matter as much which implementation you use (the other implementations may be more straight forward because that lack these features).\nLabel: ",

The requirement is that: Students who score 80% or higher should be able to review their incorrect answers along with the correct answers for further learning. Students who score below 80% should not have access to any feedback or see which questions they answered incorrectly. I’ve explored various settings and options, but I haven't found a straightforward solution that meets these criteria. Has anyone implemented a similar setup? Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help! Best regards, Danny Charland Account Manager | Catalyst IT\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Danny from Catalyst, Short answer is : it can't be done with H5P alone. But... if you combine an H5P activity with the power of Moodle, you can get a workable result. Here’s a detailed approach to achieve this goal: First, create the quiz using H5P and integrate it into Moodle as an H5P activity. Make sure that the H5P content is set to record attempts (using xAPI if necessary) to accurately track scores. Then, use Moodle’s grading feature to record the results of the H5P quiz. This will enable you to use the grade as a condition for accessing feedback. Next, create an additional activity or resource (such as a page or file) that contains the correct answers or feedback on the students' mistakes. Use Moodle’s \"Restrict Access\" feature to ensure that this resource is only available to students who have achieved a grade of 80% or higher. To configure this, go to the resource settings, then to \"Restrict Access,\" and add a condition based on the H5P quiz grade (e.g., Grade >= 80). By default, students with a score below 80% will not be able to see the resource containing the feedback, as the access restriction will automatically exclude them. Finally, make sure to test this setup with a student account to verify that the access conditions work as intended. This method leverages Moodle's conditional access features alongside the flexibility of H5P activities to meet the specific feedback requirements. By ensuring that grade tracking is enabled for the H5P activity, you can precisely control who has access to the feedback. HTH --C\nLabel: ",

The following libraries cannot be installed because they require a version of core API 1.26 while Moodle contains version 1.24. - H5P.CoursePresentation - H5P.InteractiveVideo - H5P.BranchingScenario In addition, the H5P.Collage library contains a different version number between that retrieved in the json (0.3.20) and that of the h5p file (0.3.17), which has the effect of attempting to update this library on each execution of the scheduled task. We use H5P heavily on our platforms and these problems are very restrictive. Can you let us know if a solution exists or if there are plans to fix it. Thank you very much for your help.

The theme in use is Boost. The course formats I use are the standard one ( sections ) or Tiles format. The text editor in use is Tiny MCE. I use the H5P plugin ( black icon activity ) The problem I describe below occurs in both versions and with the different course formats and even if I change the type of text editor. On the previous version of the platform (3.7+), on the other hand, everything worked fine. I would like to understand how to solve it and if there are alternatives. Details In my courses, for ease of navigation, instead of putting H5P activities directly into sections, I decided embed those presentations into labels (or text or media areas) . This way the user can do the activities and then simply scroll down without having to first exit the activity and return to the course. The problem is that the embedded H5P activity is displayed cut off and thus missing the movement panes or the media progress bar, etc.. I have tried 3 types of embedding code. The first one: <p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;\">short description or subitle.</span> </p> <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\" align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> I've already tried changing the dimensions defined within the code , but nothing changes. However, if I put scrolling =\"yes\" the user can at least scroll down and see the rest of the activity...but it's annoying. The second: As the first one, but adding: <script\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/library/js/h5p-resizer.js\"\ntype=\"text/ javascript \"></script> In this case the activity appears cropped, but with a click on the activity it is resized. The third: (which worked on the 3.7+ platform) <div\nalign=\"center\" class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\"\nwidth=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\"\nscrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> This format, which should facilitate viewing with mobile devices, remains \"cropped\" and does not resize or I have to set scrolling to yes (as the first). The goal is to have the H5P window fully displayed. Can anyone help me or provide a better code, please? THANK YOU. 😀 David.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I can't help, I'm just reporting the same issue...\nComment 2: In your example code, I do not see a reference to the resizer script that H5P needs (except for the 2nd).

But I assume you're talking about questions in the \"question bank\" instead of \"content bank\" : there is no connection between the two.

The only interface for inserting an existing H5P into an Interactive Book is the copy and paste function of the H5P editor. Open one of the existing questions by clicking edit button in content band, click 'Copy' button in the editor, navigate to your Interactive Book and edit it, click 'ADD CONTENT' and the the 'Paste' button in the new content. The past button is enabled only if there is a compatible content type in the clipboard.\nComment 4: Thank you that was extremely helpful! I knew it had to be possible...somehow.

Additionally, as of Moodle 3.8 and later, H5P support is included as part of core Moodle. This means you have the capability to create and interact with H5P content directly within Moodle without the need for any additional plugins. This core integration also supports the tracking of student interactions with the content, which can be incredibly beneficial for educational purposes. HTH C.\nLabel: ",

If you're staying on the same machine, you can copy the content (button top right in edit mode), and past it in another activity.

Basically, until a couple of days ago, H5P activities were displayed correctly whether they were embedded in a label or displayed directly by clicking the activity. Now I see them all very small, positioned in the upper right corner compared to the original space they should occupy. I did not make any updates before the problem and even updating the plugin does not change anything. In fact, now it has asked me to activate the OER hub and I am getting an SSL problem... Have any of you experienced this problem before and were able to solve it? Thanks for any help. Merry Christmas.

Have you attempted purging the caches? Is your cron job running as frequently has it should - once per minute. If I re-call correctly, H5P 'phones home' and auto acquires it's modules and updates to those modules.   That's part of cron job. And the 'biggy' ... 4.1 is now 4.1.8 - time for an update?

So since the questions were timestamped in h5p to an existing video and now the video has since been taken down, it seems h5p had deleted the content/questions from the summary task section.

When I attempt to 'get' any activity to install and use in the editor of the H5P Interactive Content plugin the editor window disappears and nothing happens.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Same problem here. Here are the details: Moodle 4.1.1 (Build: 20230116). PHP 8.0. H5P mod_hvp version 1.23.0 dated 2022121200 Additional plugin (the black icon). H5P settings: Use H5P Hub mod_hvp | hub_is_enabled Yes Add an activity or resource / Adding a new Interactive Content / Get (a content) / Install / Installing : nothing happens ! Browser Console says: TypeError: e.contentTypes is undefined value https://MYMOODLESITE/mod/hvp/editor/scripts/h5p-hub-client.js?ver=2022121200:54 (etc.) 1.- On my Moodle site the core H5P mod_h5pactivity works fine, scheduled tasks retrieves h5p contents from the h5p hub OK. 2.- Using H5P mod_hvp Additional plugin (the black icon) I cannot retrieve H5P contents from the H5P hub, but of course I can still upload H5P contents created elswhere, which I use as a workaround, but this is still annoying and unexplainable. Anyone else having this problem?\nComment 2: Thank you for replying and for providing more details. I am quite new to H5P and sadly I don't have access to the work around as I'm unable to generate H5P content if not through moodle, the other options are paid for options no?\nComment 3: @Adam, Are you an admin or a simple teacher on your Moodle site? If the Moodle contents have been installed by your admin, then you could go to your course's Content Bank and create your H5P activities there, then export them to your computer and re-import them in the h5pactivity plugin. Or you could install Lumi on your own machine, create H5P activities there, export and re-import to your Moodle site. But let's hope someone finds a solution to our problem to avoid having to resort to workarounds.\nComment 4: Thanks again for helping Joseph. I am the admin and it's basically a new install. I'm just a small private class teacher and have made the moodle for myself so I still have alot of learning to do. All I have installed is the mod_hvp plugin. The other H5P plugin was intalled by default. I will take a look at Lumi, thank you!\nComment 5: Moodle 4.0.4 and mod_hvp 1.23.0 here, and no problem found in using the plugin. And Lumi is working too... Maybe ver 4.1 broke something?\nComment 6: Hi Adam, It could be that the cron task , that picksup contenttypes has not 'run' yet. I noticed this with new installations, since the task frequents is like 1 a month, when you have a new install it does not straight away 'downloads'/ 'make the contenttypes' avaiable. If you are a site admin (or when not give them these instructions): Login to site Go to Server > scheduled task search for the task \" Download available H5P content types from H5P.org (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task) if the column last run says \"never' then click on the radar fill in at minute */1, the rest is * Save the changes Wait 1 to 5 minutes (it kind of depends on how frequently your cron is running) Refresh the page, check if column last run now has a data and time Click on the 'radar' again check thebox \"Reset task schedule to default\" Save changes Go to the COntent bank and check if you now see Contentypes. If this did not work, check with your technical team/server contantperson if the Cron is correctly configured. Redo the steps. I hope this fixed your issue. Gemma\nComment 7: Hi Gemma, thank you so much for your detailed reply. It looks like you have identified the error. None of the services have ever been run. Moodle was installed automatically for me by the web hosting service I'm using. I'm going to open a ticket with them as I have Moodle knowledge but very little knowledge about managing a server especially when it comes to managing php files. I'm just a team of one so hopefully I can get my head around it. Thank you!\nComment 8: Thank you, now through the default H5P plugin that came installed with Moodle 4 it's working. I can now add content through the content bank. Thank you thank you thank you! Installing content still doesn't work for the other H5P plugin however. But as long as I have a way not to create the content I'm happy!\nComment 9: That was awesome. I too was wondering why on one site I had H5P content, and on the other there was no possibility to add any content since the add button was inactive. You tip worked perfectly for me, and I am using Moodle 4.2+ with PHP 8.1. Why does Moodle wait so long to download this content?\nComment 10: I've just run into what I think is this same problem. I've added it to the Tracker: MDL-80031 h5p_get_content_types_task won't run for up to 30 days on install .\nComment 11: When trying to download contents from the H5P hub I'm getting this error in the php_error.log: [07-Feb-2023 16:42:36 Europe/London] Default exception handler: Exception - chmod(): Argument #1 ($filename) must be of type string, resource given Debug: Error code: generalexceptionmessage * line 247 of \\mod\\hvp\\classes\\framework.php: TypeError thrown * line 247 of \\mod\\hvp\\classes\\framework.php: call to chmod() * line 415 of \\mod\\hvp\\editor\\h5peditor- ajax .class.php: call to mod_hvp\\framework->fetchExternalData() * line 307 of \\mod\\hvp\\editor\\h5peditor-ajax.class.php: call to H5PEditorAjax->callHubEndpoint() * line 133 of \\mod\\hvp\\editor\\h5peditor-ajax.class.php: call to H5PEditorAjax->libraryInstall() * line 289 of \\mod\\hvp\\ajax.php: call to H5PEditorAjax->action() Any idea anyone?\nComment 12: Hi Joseph, i just uninstalled H5P (plugin - black icon) on 4.1 and reïnstalled again. I cannot make a connection to the hub for some reason. I am running php 8, maybe that is the issue (?). not sure, no issues in 3.9 with php 7.4 and this version of the plugin. But it's not the same issue as Adam reported, since that was H5P core related. So I think this best reported to H5P directly since it seems to be unrelated to Moodle itself. - gemma\nComment 13: After racking my brains for 2 days trying to find the reason for this bug, finally discovered that a fix was suggested here https://github.com/h5p/moodle-mod_hvp/pull/472 almost 4 months ago ! Let's hope the H5P team will release a new version of the plugin so that it can finally become usable in Moodle 4.1. In the meantime, if you have an easy access to your Moodle files, you can apply the fix yourself, it's only a few lines to be changed. I've done it on my Moodle test sites, and can report it's working well. 😉\nComment 14: I've spent pretty much half the day trying to figure out how to get the h5P \"Adding a new Interactive Content\" to work. The Select Content Editor shows up, no matter which content type I choose nothing happens, when I press install. I see above there is a fix, but I could not find in my files where to make the proper changes. I did open the classes/framework.php file but do not see the 4 items listed on the fix which reference changing \"stream\" to \"filename\"? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something , any help would be greatly appreciated,\nComment 15: The file that needs fixing is located at YOURMOODLESITE\\mod\\hvp\\classes\\framework.php and you can view the patch at https://github.com/marsh0lion/moodle-mod_hvp/commit/c64aaae370212bc0bda2a6fdc6d5c1187ce318a5\nComment 16: I found out that I cannot install H5P apps directly from the adding interactive content section within a course, but I can download them from moodle,org choose the upload option in adding interactive content and it works perfectly. So this option suit my needs and I am able to use H5P assets in my courses. Thanks.\nComment 17: Didn't you try applying the fix I suggested?\nComment 18: Yes I did, and actually left the file with the changes on it. I get the same result when trying to install H5P content directly. It could be a server restriction.\nComment 19: I have try the fix and nothing changed. it still cannot install activities\nComment 20: Can you share the link for downloading H5P content type files from moodle.org? It shows the plugin only but cannot find individual content-type files to upload directly.\nComment 21: Thanks Joseph! I made the changes in framework.php and it really works well and solves my problem. I noticed that people are facing this problem since January 2023, but still it is not updated in the plugin. Hope soon we will receive the new update. Thanks once again for the solution.\nLabel: ",

Many of the chapters in the course are made up of 3 - 10 H5P files. I would like the experience for students to be as seamless as possible, and not have to go back out to the course menu between H5Ps. I am looking for some best practices here. I will also need to be able to Restrict Access to future chapters until earlier chapters are completed. So, I need to preserve completion data - not for individual H5Ps, but for the collection that make up a chapter. I have some H5Ps that are quizzes. I'm fine with the quiz being a separate experience so that it can be graded on its own with no complications. I have seen some discussion about putting these all on a page, book, or lesson activity. Does someone have a resource for which method to use and why, or a pros / cons list for each, or something helpful in the way of best practices here? Thank you!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I created a blog post (and video) on how to embed H5p into other Moodle areas, which will help you go through the mechanics of how to do this: https://davefoord.wordpress.com/2021/11/05/moodle-tricks-of-the-trade-embedding-h5p-activities-into-other-moodle-areas/\nComment 2: In addition to what Dave already mentioned, you could use the autolink or Récit autolink plugin to just link to your H5Ps from any Moodle page. The Récit autolink plugin has a setting where the H5P acitivity opens as a modal. My suggestion is useful when you don't want to many H5Ps in a page to load at once (strain on server ).\nComment 3: My go to H5P tool is the 'Interactive Book' which is considered and 'Aggregator' Content Type (CT). The Interactive Books(CT) pages are Columns (CT) which allows you to put muliptly other Content Types(CT). It also has a nice table of contents that have indicators to mark completed or not similiar to the new v4.0 Course Index indicators. Plus the [Summary & subit] screen is very useful to know what is completed or answered correctly. So with a single Content Type 'Interactive Book' you could make a mini-course. We use this for student's study guides.\nComment 4: I think interactive book is just the solution I was looking for. Thank you. Now just a bunch of copy paste work ahead of me!\nLabel: ",

I might be wrong, but I think the correct answers are definitely not in the jsonContent. But who am I to argue against senior developers? Maybe they are encoded in the subContentId, for example \"638ddbbf-a920-4aef-b27b-f08f37ba0715\", which would be difficult to decipher. Could someone with authority who really knows the facts answer the following questions. With H5P, the correct answers can be revealed from the browser: (select one) ○ True ○ False If true: (select one) □ The answers can be revealed easily. Please demonstrate in an undoubtful manner. □ The answers are encoded and can not be revealed easily.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi! 1) True. 2) The answers can be revealed easily. Please demonstrate in an undoubtful manner. One could check the `H5PIntegration` object (as demonstrated at https://campus.oercamp.de/lessons/sollte-ich-h5p-fuer-pruefungen-benutzen/ ), one could find the same information in the page source inside the script that's used to pass the values from the server to the browser, one could check `H5P.instances` and check the actual instance, one could have a look in the source using the browser's development tools, set breakpoints and even modify things, ...\nComment 2: Hello Oliver, Thank you for your reply. I found H5P instances in attached JS files... that didn't tell me anything. For the record, IMHO I would say that finding and understanding what the correct answer is from H5P instances in a script is probably doable for savvy programmers, but not doable for 99.9999% of Moodle users.\nComment 3: Hi! I am not talking about attached JavaScript files. An instance is the representation of the content type in the browser's memory and can easily be accessed. I agree that this is one of the \"harder\" things, but anyone can type `H5PIntegration.contents` into the console and find his/her way to the parameters (`jsonContent`) as I demonstrated in the video. If just one person with very average coding skills required creates a browser plugin to make this even more convenient and a little better arranged ... If that's \"easy enough\" to rule out \"high-risk assessment\" is up for you to decide, but please feel having been informed.\nComment 4: The content of this forum post has been removed and can no longer be accessed.\nComment 5: ...please feel having been informed. Thank you for the transparency. To be honest, I didn't believe it when I was told you could see the answer. I also didn't think it could be easy to do. Knowing it's the opposite, unfortunately I will not use H5P questions in my quizzes because they are used to assess my students in a university engineering course, and I do not want anyone to think that they could cheat that way.\nComment 6: Knowing it's the opposite, unfortunately I will not use H5P questions in my quizzes because they are used to assess my students in a university engineering course, and I do not want anyone to think that they could cheat that way. That's fair judgement I'd say and what I'd recommend - not that I am a fan of exams the way they are today in the first place, but that's what H5P is not really suitable for. It's no silver bullet (like any other tool isn't one).\nComment 7: How high is the \"high-risk\" here? To my knowledge H5P quizzes are not even tied to the Safe Exam Browser.\nComment 8: Where are the other knowledgeable programmers? and why aren't they helping to set the record straight? H5P was not designed for assessments (only). It should be (and is) usable for all kinds of contents and content for teaching and learning also goes way beyond the notion of assessments. B ut if high-stakes assessments are that crucial (I am not a teacher, I cannot judge) , then choosing client-side evaluation was clearly a design flaw. I don't know the background however, so I can't tell what the prerequisites were. Server-side evaluation is on the roadmap of H5P Group, but I don't thing this is going to hit the shelves soon, because it would mean quite some work to redesign the core of H5P and also existing content types. So, the answer to \"Where are the other knowledgeable programmers?\" most likely is at \"H5P Group\". There are not too many H5P developers outside of the H5P core team, at least as far as I now of. I also don't believe that the moodle team is going to invest resources. And my answer to \"why aren't they helping to set the record straight\" would be manifold: lack of documentation (for external contributors), lack of interest (the moodle team included H5P in core even though they knew it's using client-evaluation when they started, and they probably don't want to invest resources in \"competition\" that would make it easier to get server-side evaluation into other platforms, too), lack of funding (the number of developers who would work on this in their free is tiny), complexity of the project (many technical aspects, possibly even coordinate developers inside and outside of the H5P core team), ...\nComment 9: I am far more interested in learning than assessment and H5P is a wonderful tool for learning. Once the learning is done Moodle Quiz is an excellent tool for assessment (especially with the cool 3rd party question types like Gapfill, Wordselect and Formulas). However people should be aware of the key differences.\nComment 10: In education, it is more and more about learning, for example with flipped classrooms. The harsh reality is that as long as there are report cards or grade transcripts and, for example, minimum levels of achievement for access to higher education, strict assessments will be necessary. So there is room for both types of questions. However, as Marcus said, people should be aware of the differences, which many probably aren't. As for me, I know now. I particularly thank Oliver for his openness and his explanations.\nComment 11: I think this discussion should be PINNED ! Many thanks !\nComment 12: Hello together, thank you for this enlightening discussion and demonstrating the possibilities. Apparently it is question type dependent. It seems that with some H5P types picking the answers is not possible or very difficult? For the fill in the gap question type demonstrated in the video, I was also able to recreate/search it out in Moodle (\"h5player (embed.php) -> h5p-iframe-[idnr]\"), only in a different place than in the Drupal example ( https://apps.zum.de/apps/15985 ). But I did not find it for multiple choice in Moodle (using Moodle 3.11.15). Is it possible to say that the correct answers are findable for each H5P type, but it's just a matter of effort and knowing the right place? Thank you very much for a classification! kind regards Klaus\nComment 13: The issue is not the effort required to work out how to do it, it is more that if the stakes are high and one person somewhere can work out how to do it, that knowledge will quickly spread around the globe. if the stakes are high and something is difficult, someone somewhere will probably automate it, e.g. a greasemonkey/tampermonkey script.\nComment 14: Hi! H5P editors fill out a form that is structured by the semantics.json file (even if there's a visual editor used as in Course Presentation, in the end one fills out the form). That semantics.json file can easily be understood, in particular if you look at the rendered editor next to it. It's quite obvious that for \"Multiple Choice\" the answers field holds the answer options including the text and the correct state. The structure will vary from content type to content type, but the principle is the same for all of them. The H5P Core transfers all the parameters that were entered by the editor from the server side to the iframe on the client side by passing a JSON object that follows the same structure as semantics.json. You could retrieve that information as part of the `window.H5PIntegration` object as `window.H5PIntegration.contents[cid-<contentId>].jsonContent` directly from memory. Just try running `for (id in window.H5PIntegration.contents) { console.log(JSON.parse(window.H5PIntegration.contents[id].jsonContent)); } // no error handling` in the development console inside either the H5P iframe's context or its parent's context and explore the output. You could even find the answers without knowing about the semantics.json file ... You could do the same programmatically as well, of course. Best, Oliver\nLabel: ",

I thought I'd share this in case it's useful to others. I found a method to wrap an H5P in an HTML container and to add a timer so that the H5P is hidden after the time expires. Here's the HTML (which I just added to a Moodle page): <strong>Timed Activity in H5P</strong> <div id=\"timer-display\"></div> <div id=\"h5p-container\"></div> //get the path to your local resizer script from the H5P iframe embed code and add it below <script src=\"<Path to h5p-resizer.js>\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script> <script> // Set the time limit in seconds var timeLimit = 30; // 30 seconds // Get the container elements var container = document.getElementById(\"h5p-container\"); var timer = document.getElementById(\"timer-display\"); // Create the iframe element var iframe = document.createElement(\"iframe\"); // Set the source URL of the iframe - edit this with the URL of your H5P in Moodle iframe.src = \"<URL to your H5P in Moodle goes here>\"; // Set any additional attributes for the iframe - you can get these from the iframe code generated by the H5P element iframe.setAttribute(\"width\", \"xxx\"); iframe.setAttribute(\"height\", \"xxx\"); // Append the iframe to the container - this makes the H5P display on the page container.appendChild(iframe); // Start the timer var countdown = setInterval(function() { // Display the remaining time in minutes and seconds var minutes = Math.floor(timeLimit / 60); var seconds = timeLimit % 60; // Update the timer element with the remaining time timer.innerHTML = \"<p>Time remaining: \" + minutes + \"m \" + seconds + \"s</p>\"; // Check if the time has run out if (timeLimit <= 0) { // Stop the timer clearInterval(countdown); // Time's up - replace the H5P with a new message container.innerHTML = \"<p>Time's up!</p>\"; } // Decrease the time limit by 1 second timeLimit--; }, 1000); </script>\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: This is great thanks.  I've adapted it a little so it gives learners a 30-minute timer each time they access an activity - I wanted it for an escape room activity.

Since the execution of the scheduled task \\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task in early may we have experienced various issues with H5P. When we try to add a new course presentation, we have various lines with things like [field:group:coursepresentation:presentation]. no errors are referenced in the web console. If we still try to create this content, we end up with an empty content.  This time, the web console have the following error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slides') If we try to add the course presentation demo from the H5P site we can see this error message : Exception : Call to a member function get_content() on bool And these two errors in the web console : 1) Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () 2) h5p.js?ver=1680857919:997 Uncaught ReferenceError: H5PIntegration is not defined We have versions 1.25.5, 1.24.14 and 1.22.11 of course presentation installed. We used to have other problems like infinite loading for previously created resources but we managed to fix that by uninstalling and manually reinstalling a few H5P components. We've had a lot of network issues on the day where the scheduled task \\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task executed so it's possible that we lost connection to the H5P server halfway through the task. H5P worked correctly before that scheduled task executed back in May. For reference, I've previously posted that same question on the H5P forums where they told me that the problem seemed to come from Moodle.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Laurent, It seems the system cannot load the needed component, and your hypothesis of a disrupted scheduled task could be correct. One way to check that : run the task manually... For that : find the relevant task in the scheduled tasks click on the wheel to access the settings set al time/day fields on *. Keep only the minute one on */1 Run cron manually : in the site security settings, set \" Cron execution via command line only\" on \"no\" load the page https://[site.example.com]/admin/cron.php set \"Cron execution via command line only\" on \"yes\" again Check execution : go back to the task page and check the last execution time for the h5p task if not set to now, run the cron again check if the h5p activity error is connected If done, don't forget to reset the execution planning of the h5p task. HTH Christophe\nComment 2: Hi Christophe, I've just done that and the problem is still present. Here is the journal of that execution of the cron task \n```text\nExecute scheduled task: Télécharger depuis h5p.org les types de contenus H5P disponibles (core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task)\n... started 09:08:08.

That is right? 2) Would it be possible to download all H5Ps in bulk? I have already read that it is a lot of work to puzzle the H5Ps back into the course after restoring the course. But having to recreate all the H5Ps would even be much worse. Thank you -SNT\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi, Assuming you are using H5P Core and not the plugin... 1) Not true. When backuping, be sure the \"content of the content bank\" is checked, and the H5P activities will be backuped. Restoring should not be a problem on the same site. I did occasionally have to relink the activities when restoring to another site. 2) Not that I aware of HTH Christophe\nComment 2: Thank you very much for your reaction. When we back-up, all options have a checkmark. But as soon as we use H5P's we get the warning File references to external contents are included in the backup file. These won't work if the backup is restored on a different site. I made a mini course, just containing one H5P-activity. When I tried to make the backup I got the warning above. Do you have any idea what goes wrong? -SNT\nComment 3: Might depend which version of Moodle you are using. Cf. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-74201 - see the fixed versions.\nComment 4: Thank you very much for the information. We are using Moodle 4.1. I just discovered that the size of the backup increases when I add an additional H5P. So H5Ps have to be saved somehow. But what is the cause and meaning of that error message? I'm backing up a Moodle course that only contains 2 H5Ps. File references to external contents are included in the backup file. These won't work if the backup is restored on a different site. -SNT\nComment 5: Normally, this means the course has links to files within Moodle, but just in your installation of Moodle. If you restore this course and restore it to another Moodle instance, those files won’t be there. Otherwise, it tells you the backup file was successfully created. Maybe you've links to a private file or other parts of your Moodle...\nComment 6: Thank you for the information. I tested it once more. I get the warning as soon as the course contains a linked H5P. When the course contains only a copied H5P, the warning does not appear. But even when I link the H5P, the back-up becomes larger with a significant annount. So I suppose the H5P is backupped. Can this be explained? -SNT\nComment 7: As I experimented myself, yes the H5P is backuped. But, when restoring ON ANOTHER MOODLE SITE, you'll have to relink the activity to the the H5P container in the content bank. I can only guess the physical location of the content bank is site-related...\nComment 8: Thank you for helping to sort it out. -SNT\nLabel: ",

Can I upload loads of h5p files at once?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Can I upload loads of h5p files at once? No, you can't. 🙃 This is due to the particular nature of H5P files.\nComment 2: What nature would that be?\nComment 3: It is more a more of logical limit of the area to which the files are uploaded. The activities only are able to display one H5P at a time. The content bank displays the H5P after uploading so uploading multiple files would be confusing. Technically you can upload multiple files Into a Folder resource or the Private files block and move them on the server to content bank with a repository plugin. It is also possible to upload multiple H5P in a course backup and merge them into the course content bank. There is also a web service for adding content to the content bank that could be used to upload multiple files using a scripting language on the desktop.\nComment 4: … but it's a bank of content. Surely actually rendering the content afterwards is purely optional? Seems like it would be a very sensible addition to Moodle. Maybe I'll throw together a ticket and PR. Yeah, I thought of using a web service, but it seems like the only services available are `core_contentbank_delete_content` , `core_contentbank_rename_content` and `core_contentbank_set_content_visibility` . Am I missing a trick here? We have some courses with a LOT of H5P content in mod_hvp and we'd dearly like to move all that content over to the content bank. It seems kind of crazy that there's no built-in method for doing this.\nLabel: ",

To reproduce: On course page, go into edit mode Click on \"Add an activity or resource\" Select the H5P core activity (blue button) in the activity selector On the parameters page, give a title On the parameters page, drag/drop a H5P package into the \"Package file\" zone Save and return to course Open the Content Bank (Course main menu More > Content Bank) The H5P package we added is not there. Which is not the behavior you should expect and contradicts with the sentence on parameters page \"Use the content bank (opens in new window) to manage your H5P files\". This is also not documented on https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/H5P_activity . Any thoughts about the why? Is this a bug or is it useful? Christophe\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Christophe, I hadn't noticed this, but it is quite expected from my understanding. The content bank is like the H5P authoring tool and it only contains the activities that are created there or the ones that have been added manually there, it's not as sophisticated as an aggregator.\nComment 2: Hi Beatriz, Thank you for your reply! In my opinion is this behavior not intuitive, which is again another source of confusion in the use of H5P (see my other threat about this). H5P is scoring high in Moodle HQ's 2022 Integrations Surveys Results . Let's hope HQ will hear the sound of the cries of the users... Anyone other thoughts about the glitch I mentioned? Christophe\nComment 3: @Christophe, 1.- I agree that this is confusing. The sentence \"Use the content bank (opens in new window) to manage your H5P files\" should be removed from that screen, it's useless and confusing. 2.- There are 2 ways to add an H5P content when using the blue icon: a) directly dropping an H5P content created elsewhere (e.g. with Lumi) into the Files box; b) clicking on the Add icon, which takes you to the Content bank where, hopefully, you have previously created the H5P you need. \"You can drag and drop file s here to add them \" is wrongly formulated, since you are only allowed (of course) to drop one H5P file in that box. This should be re-formulated. 3.- I expect the Moodle programmers who integrated H5P into core could not make up their mind whether to only accept creating H5P course activities by using H5P contents previously created in the Content Bank or to provide an easy \"shortcut\" for using H5P contents created outside the Content Bank. Hence the regrettably confusing interface. 4.- Anyway, I agree with your original post question \"where does it go?\". If an H5P content (created elsewhere)  is inserted directly into a course activity it should automatically be made available in the Content bank. This would be coherent with the way questions are created and inserted into a quiz activity. Questions for a quiz are either created beforehand in the Questions bank where they become available to a new quiz, or created when a new quiz is created, and subsequently become part of the question bank and available to any new quiz.😃\nComment 4: @Joseph, 4 - good point : coherency with the Questions Bank ! Christophe\nComment 5: Forcing the #4 behaviour would have to mean that this H5P activity must use the \"by reference\" (linking) method. Dropping the file immediately into the activity (currently) means you do NOT want to use the Question Bank to edit but just load the file. I think there should be an option for the teacher given there: - Do you want to simply embed the package into the activity (without adding it to the Question Bank)? OR - Do you want to add the package to the course's Question Bank, link to it from this H5P activity, and be able to edit the package in this course's Question Bank? Or something to this effect.\nLabel: ",

H5P and our Moodle was set up prior to my time at my organisation. We are using the H5P (HVP) plugin. I will probably move to the core plugin when I upgrade our Moodle version. My problem is that while the H5P plugin is working on the live site, whatever I do, I don't seem to be able to get h5p content working on our development sites (whether the Moodle version is 3.8 or 4.1). It fails gracefully I guess but simply doesn't load the interactive content. My dev environment is using a dump of live, but I have also tried backups and restores and they don't work either in these environments. I have tried using \"update content type cache\" h5p libraries admin and that makes no difference. I can't see the h5p code unless I turned off \"use saved content\" in the h5p admin. If turn that off, I can see the h5p code in the module instance settings, but when I press save it says, \"Something unexpected happened. We were unable to save this content\". The console shows a list of errors such as \"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at drag-n-drop.js?ver=1.1.5:1:1)\". In the console the most common error is \"h5p.js?ver=2020080400:976 Unable to find constructor for: H5P.InteractiveVideo 1.22\". I haven't upgraded the Interactive Video library, but I that is the same version running on my live site where the h5p works. Any help gratefully received.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Also probably important, on Moodle 4.1 it says, \"Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)\" and appears to be looking for something in \"/pluginfile.php/1/mod_hvp/cachedassets/{hash}\". That is why I was so happy when I saw the \"update content type cache\" button but it didn't work - nor does purge caches. Possibly something in data directory (moodledata) isn't there\nComment 2: Seems that some components are badly installed. I should uninstall/reinstall plugin before trying to repair. If uninstall fails from plugin directory, delete mod_hvp dir through FTP . HTH\nComment 3: I think it was an incomplete copy of the filesdir or moodledata causing the problem\nLabel: ",

The course format is \"Topics format\", with Enable completion tracking and Show activity completion conditions enabled. The courses are supposed to include more than one H5Ps, so I cannot use the \"Single activity format\". I am dealing with 2 separate issues: 1) When a student goes through the H5P presentation and answers the question in it, the result does not show in Moodle\nin the grade book. I tried to upload the H5P as a Course activity and also directly into the Topic Summary with same result. The issue is essentially similar to this one, only I am using \"Course presentation\": https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=438975 Do\nI understand correctly that in order to import results from H5P to\nMoodle, I basically have to create a custom script which takes care of\nthe XAPI integration? Or is there another way? 2) When the H5P is uploaded as Topic Summary (not as Activity), can I somehow track that it was completed (viewed) by students (for instance, by going through all slides, or answering to questions)? Or the tracking can only be activated for Course Activity elements? If possible, I would prefer using the Topic Summary than Course Activity, as the student don't have to open the H5P, instead they would see its content right away. Any advice would be appreciated. M.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Results will only be submitted once the students reach the summary slide of a Course Presentation. Might this be the issue? And no, you do not need to implement anything special related to xAPI. It's just an option to get way more information than you'll get from moodle's gradebook.\nComment 2: Thanks for clarification. In the meantime, I figured out that all required functionalities work well, when the H5P presentation is uploaded as a Course Activity instead of Course Summary. So I will just use that and forget about the Course Summary use case. M.\nLabel: ",

In Site administration / Tasks / Scheduled tasks is the Download available H5P content types from h5p.org\n\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task task working?

First problem: I have a problem with latex expression in h5p tasks. I have checked if  I create a task in content bank and use latex code, I can see the math expression correctly. However, if I create an interactive task, H5P green icon, and I choose the same task, the math expression is not displayed correctly, I see the latex code formula. Why does it occur? If I create a black icon H5P task and I use the task from content bank, latex is displayed correctly too. I installed the math displayed library and  mathjax in my server , modifing config.php file. I am making an interactive book from green icon H5P and I add different tasks, and in a dialog card I have written math expressions and they are not displayed and I can't create it in the content bank because the interactive books are differents. From content bank has less options than green icon type ( I don't know why). Then, How do I fix this problem? Second problem : I want to use Cornell notes h5p activity. I create the interactive activity (green icon), I select Cornell notes, I design the task and I publish it. When I try it as student role, I can write notes, but I can't save them. If I reload the task, I lose all notes and as teacher, I can't see the student's homework of this task. Can't I track or grade Cornell notes from my students?  Is it a bug? I hope to find solutions to my problems. Thanks.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Ivan, Please abide to the usual forum rule, only one problem per post!\nComment 2: Sorry. I didn't know it. I wanted to save time and I thought that 2 post could be counterproductive. Now I can't edit it. What can I do? Can I delete it and writing 2 posts? Sorry again.\nComment 3: Both your question that you also posted on the H5P forum have already been answered there. Please try asking at one place first and only ask at another place if you do not get a satisfactory reply. Your approach may be convenient for you, but please keep in mind that you are using resources of other people. LaTeX : The H5P plugin for moodle (green/black icon) and moodle's custom H5P integration (blue icon) are two separate things. They do not share libraries, and you will have to install the MathDisplay library for the one that you want to use LaTeX with. Cornell Notes : moodle's custom integration does not support H5P's \"save content state feature\".\nLabel: ",

The problem I encounter is that the more H5P-exercises in one content bank, the slower the content bank becomes. This is not only a problem when trying to open the content bank itself, but also when using the file picker to get to the content bank. Content banks with only a few exercises run smoothly. As soon as I get to about 10 H5P-exercises I start to notice the difference in speed. When I have over 30 it becomes very slow. But I have content banks with more than 100 exercises! These become almost inaccesible. Waiting times can be between 5 and 10 minutes. Often I just get a time-out. I read nothing about this on the forum. We can't be the only school with this problem, right?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: We are facing the same issue. We have ~500 H5P files on each content bank.\nLabel: ",

Is there a way to override this seemingly default behaviour so that I can get the questions displayed as poster. Thanks\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Damian! It's not moodle that's setting the button defaults, but the H5P Interactive Video content type. And looking at the code, it seems to be done intentionally, but I don't know the reason. I suppose you should leave a feature request on the H5P forums . Best, Oliver\nComment 2: Thanks - not afraid to modify the code if I have to - would you have any suggestions on where to start looking? h5p forums says maybe here https://github.com/h5p/h5p-interactive-video/blob/master/src/scripts/interactive-video.js#L2045-L2093\nComment 3: It depends on how you want the content type to behave. There's an option that gets hidden . So, you could for instance modify the code that hides the setting and change everything as needed. Or you could alter the behavior in general . Or ...

I backup from the first site and restore on the second however, all the activities are made with hp5 interactive video and I can not restore a course easily as it complains that an external file are not included. I need to download the h5p files and upload them one by one. I am wondering if there is the chance to share the same file (the two sites are on the same server ) or use the ftp to find the files, download them and upload them in the second site massively. Or any other solution that help me to find a easiest way to migrate the site is very wellcome.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Were you able to get backup/restore to work with h5p?\nComment 2: FYI - From what I have seen there is a problem with H5P embeds and activities when you LINK to the original in the Content Bank (alias). If you store a copy, restore works. (Though of course linking makes major sense because editing of H5P can only be done in the Content Bank...) A workaround would be to ALWAYS CLEARLY NAME those H5P activities which are linked to. Then - after restore - you should be able to mend the broken links. Maybe even now, in the courses you moved, there will be some hints in the embedded links that will tell you out the H5P file's name you can try to re-link . It's unfortunately much worse in the case of activities - here the aliased file disappears completely, and so there's no hint - unless you remember which activity it was, or can check back at the original course location.\nComment 3: Sorry to be cross-posting, but I have just added some screenshots to the other related discussion; https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=427198#p1761664 .

A drag item (a small image) is to be dragged onto a spot in the background image. When I open the task in the browser on an iOS device (iOS 15.5; ipad or iphone; Browser Safari or Firefox latest versions), I can edit the task as expected. (The drag item can be dragged onto one of the drop zones. The task will be evaluated correctly.) However, if I choose an incorrect answer on the first try and then want to repeat the task, not only is the drag item moved, but also the content of the screen in the background . As a result, drop zones \"disappear\" to the left and are no longer visible or selectable. The drag item can no longer be placed correctly. The task can therefore no longer be processed. I've tried whether you can get to the destination by holding and dragging the drag item, for example, or by tapping the drag item and drop zone. But that was not successful. The problem does NOT occur with MacOS, for example on a Macbook. The problem under iOS is documented in a small video, which is attachted here. (Background: Users expect us to solve the problem. Switching to the Moodle app is not a solution the user wants. They also don't want to work without drag-and-drop exercises. The user is faced with so many iOS -devices used that a change to other devices is not possible.) I would be very grateful for hints on possible causes of error or possible solutions. Thank you very much in advance … Matthias Addendum: The error described does not occur in the same exercise under Wordpress/H5P.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Matthias! If it's working on WordPress, then you could check what version of \"Drag and Drop\" (H5P.DragQuestion) is running on each platform. There was an update late in April that was supposed to fix the issue that you are describing. Maybe all you need to do is update the libraries and upgrade the existing contents. Best, Oliver\nComment 2: Hi Oliver, Thank you for your quick response. I will check the versions and see if an update brings the solution. Matthias\nLabel: ",

My question here is...do we face any issues if we upgarde moodle to its latest version which already have buil-in H5P. Does our data reflect automatically after upgrade or we'll loss our H5P data? Do we have to keep using H5P plugin to retain the data after moodle upgrade?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Moodle's own H5P version works independently from the H5P version you already have in use. While there are plugins which allow the conversion from the original H5P plugin to the Moodle version, it is probably a good idea to continue using the original version for the meantime. Once you are familiar with both version, you can make an informed decision whether to use only one version or keep both versions around.\nLabel: ",

Can you successfully embed other iframes into your book module, such as to a youtube video, or is H5P the only issue Do you have 'Content cleaning everywhere' enabled in your site Experimental settings\nComment 6: I have similar issue. Not able to embed the H5P content into the Q and A forum. While adding in edit mode I can see, but when I save it's not displaying.\nComment 7: Hi, I was having a similar issue, and following your suggestion, I was able to confirm that: 1. Yes, I can 'view' the H5P activity directly. 2. No Iframe doesn't work on other areas also - like a page module. 3. I cant embed youtube videos as well using the iframe. So, I am guessing there is some setting that is not allowing iframe on my moodle... I am trying to look it up. If you are aware of it, or if the solution is something different, please share. Thank you.\nComment 8: hi Sunny It could be that your provider placed a header on the server that is preventing this: x-frame-option: deny If that is not the issue - even though it is a LTI provider setting you could try this: enable 'Allow frame embedding' (in \"Site Administration > Security > HTTP security\") Gem\nLabel: ",

We have a large number of users from different institutions, so consequently we use groups to ensure that teachers cannot see details of students in other institutions. The H5P attempts list does not respect groups, so teachers can see attempts from students in other institutions, which is clearly unacceptable. We've had to remove the permission for teachers to be allowed to see any H5P attempts for this reason, which is a pity. There is a tracker item here https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-71662 which was created last year but it doesn't look like anyone is working on it. This seems to me to be a serious privacy issue - surely all Moodle features should respect groups if separate groups are set and teachers do not have the permission to access all groups.

If the next activity is restricted conditionally based on the score (or pass/fail) of the H5P, the link to the next activity can vary and is not immediately refreshed once the H5P is finished. The only solution is to have the student go back to the course overview page or have them refresh their browser so that Moodle unlocks the correct restricted activity. Has anyone else ran into this issue or know of any way to solve it? It was confirmed by the development team that this is a bug, but I would like to see if anyone has any workarounds! This is for a self-guided learning course and I would like to move the student in the correct direction after finishing a quiz in H5P. If the student performed well (let's say over 75%), then I want them to move on to the next topic. Otherwise, another practice activity in the same topic should be shown. I am hoping to achieve this without having the student go back out to the course overview page.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I don't believe this is a H5P specific issue. You are talking about activity completion, and restrictions. It's important to understand that completion activity is not \"instant\" because it relies n the Cron job of the server .

Sometimes, when the students finish the Quiz, it take too much time to change the status to \"Passed\", and since the activities are connected together, the student cannot do the next one. Has anyone an Idea how to fix this? Thanks a lot.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Completion data, like many other aspects of Moodle, is controlled by the scheduled task = cron job. These days that should be set to a couple of minutes, probably 5 at maximum, unless your site is absolutely huge. So you should maybe take a look at how often the cron job is running now.\nComment 2: Hi Stuart, thanks a lot for your reply. I noticed that my server dosent allowd cron jobs below 15 min, this is why I'm running them now externlly every minute. And the system status in Moodle shows that they are running well. But I still have this problem.\nComment 3: I guess you may be on a shared hosting system then, if Cron is restricted to 15 minutes. So you have setup an external server service to trigger Cron remotely. You also need to check that the specific scheduled tasks around completion are not too long. I just checked on Moodle 3.11, and they appear to be default at ASAP (result being they should calculate on each Cron run), but I'm not sure about earlier versions, they may be set to 5 minutes for example to spread out the load. Might be some H5P scheduled tasks worth checking also.\nLabel: ",

This would be instead of going down the route of a paid hosting package on H5P.com. In testing I have not been able to display H5Ps on other websites (using the embed code). Is this by design or can I enable our Moodle to host external H5P content via a settings/config change somewhere?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Nick, This should be possible if the users have rights to access the pluginfile. This usually means that it is part of a activity that has guest access enabled. I think that means you would need to enable auto login guests on site, add guest access to a course, and make sure guest can preview activity.\nComment 2: Hi Daniel, Thanks for your reply. So guest access to the course and activity needs to be available in order for the general public to be able to view the embedded copy of that H5P on our external (Joomla) website?\nComment 3: I would assume so if access is unauthenticated (ie ungraded, untracked). If you were looking for LTI features of h5p.com, Moodle can be set up as a LTI provider and any module can be configured as an LTI offering. I do not know whether Joomla supports LTI, but I would not be surprised if it did.\nComment 4: I had the same problem and found that there is a code library ( https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone ) for allowing h5p to run standalone. But you have to be coder to know how to use it. So I built a quick in-browser tool to package h5p's so they can work in a standalone way. It takes in the h5p package and gives you a zip file with all the standalone files included. Maybe it could help, rather than dealing with all the guest access requirements and linking to the correct pluginfile.php, etc. https://frumbert.github.io/h5p/index.html\nComment 5: This looks super-useful and works well on my test site. Thank you Tim! Any tips on how to dynamically resize an H5P when it is placed in an <iframe>?\nComment 6: And another alternate approach might be to put the content on your own H5P OER Hub https://h5p.org/oer-hub-coming and then share it out to both Moodle and Joomla. That's more of a commitment, but if you are deep into H5P as your key tool, that's a solid approach.\nLabel: ",

First question why two H5P's or are these different? Now to the issue, Added an H5P 1.22.3 activity (interactive video). First off noticed the Editor says H5Phub. Step 1: Uploaded an mp4 video, then went to step 2 Add Interactions. When trying to add the interactive content, we get an error message saying  \"Network Failure\". If we close this off and save this video - (without interactives), and play the video as if it were a student - it plays fine. Its adding the interactive content that does not work. In my initial search I saw something in regards to imbeded H5P vs H5P hub etc. Could this  be part of the issue? Could seeing 2 versions of H5P be a cause? I am having issues narrowing this down. I also changed the default moodle editor from tinymce to atto, could this be part of the issue? Thank you in advance.

Our goal is to make it easy to author, distribute and deliver active learning experiences. As a long-time fan of Moodle and H5P, we are at point where we are ready to start a much deeper integration to Moodle, especially by using LTI 1.3/Advantage. I would like to begin a discussion to evaluate the merits and shortcomings of this new suite within the context of the needs of both Moodle authors, as well as Moodle developers. A long-time fan and admirer, Leo Cunha CTO, Curriki.org\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: That seems to be an interesting option if you can host another server or pay for it. The LUMI app ( https://lumi.education/ ) can also be used for making and editing H5P modules. It is also free, open source, and you can download an app for PC, Mac or Linux and run it in your own device, without installing or paying for a server. Plus, it has a great multi-language support for the names and descriptions of all H5P modules.\nComment 2: Hi Leonardo, I am not sure I understand the intent of your message above and am not sure what response you are wanting. This forum deals mostly with the two current implementations of H5P available in Moodle as well and using H5P as an LTI consumer. It mostly involves user problems with those methods. If you are providing a source for H5P materials, this may the right place. Developers that work on those implementations often respond in this forum to problems, but if you with details of setting up a new integration, there may be more developers interested in the General development forum or in LTI forum. It might also help to create a tracker issue if you want attention from the core development team. Moodle HQ is interested in Open Educational Resources as is Joubel and both are working at establishing content hubs. You may have luck contacting either of those directly.\nComment 3: Hi Daniel, You are right, I may have misplaced the post My intent was exactly what you mention. On one side, as a provider of OER technology, it is exactly what you mention - to collaborate on a content hub, as well as to provide a tighter integration between the content hub and LTI/xAPI compliant LMSs. As a long-time user and integrator of Moodle, I am working on strategies that can also make it easier for (a) authors to build, sequence, and distribute H5P activities , (b) make it more seamless for learners to consume those experiences inside the LMS, and (c) leverage xAPI/Learning Record Store to standardize the collection of learning analytics across LMSs compliant with open standards.\nLabel: ",

As there were no response, I post it here as well. We run Moodle 3.9. A non-editing teacher can see results and e-mailadress in H5P-activity by changing user-id in URL . I have a non-editing teacher and students in groups in course. Course is set with separate groups. The non-editing teacher access the Grades by the navigation meny in the course  to see the students results. By clicking the grade analysis button at a h5p activity, the score is shown, so is the students e-mail-adress. If the non-editing-teacher changes the user-id in the URL , the teacher will se the results, name and e-mailadress to an other user, that is not connected to this non-editing teacher, and is in an other group, This is not wanted considering privacy. When I try the same in a Moodle quiz, the non-editing teacher get the message: «You are not allowed to review this attempt.» Is this a known issue?

To add to the confusion, you get this option to \"make copy of this file\" when you are adding an activity or resource in Moodle.

I've split your post from the original discussion for hopefully someone else to answer.\nComment 2: Because H5P content is HTML5 it will always fill the maximum space / correct ratio. That's so the responsive nature will 'fit' the actual display (not use absolute sizing). Without using some (fairly advanced) HTML code you can't alter the size, and in 99% of cases if you did it would cause problems on different screen sizes that you didn't anticipate.\nComment 3: Video can be embedded in H5P course presentation and the the dimension set there relative to the size of the total course presentation. This however may make it appear to small on some devices. If you are embedding content with the H5P filter you can embed the link with a HTML container and set the max-width on the container on better use bootstrap col classes to choose with based on available screen resolution. For activities this coudl be done by overriding a template in the theme. Generally though I think the idea of responsive design is for users to control the sizing by changing their window size.\nLabel: ",

No attempt tracking will be stored.\" Additonally, it always shows View all attempts (0 submitted) , even if students have submitted their attempts.

They are on Chromebooks. I powerwashed the one kid's device (not the rest) but it didn't fix the issue, so I assumed it would not help the rest. The video plays for the students but the questions that were created for the video do not work. Also, the time left on the video never changes even though the video is playing?

When the teacher (standard teacher role) tries to create a new H5P activity, the H5P editor does not load but displays an error message \"Error, unable to load libraries.\" The same problem occurs with a dummy teacher, but not when I create a new H5P activity with a site admin account. Backup and restore on another system didn't solve the problem. I've also checked whether permissions for the teacher role were changed in the context of this specific course, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Assigning another, more privileged role to the teacher didn't do anything, either. Moodle is 3.8.2+ Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

What could be the problem? I have been able to use many other tools (drag and drop, mark the words, drag words, etc.) without any problem... It is just \"fill in the blanks\" what is giving me a constant headache. Please help me!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Alicia! Could you possibly share the content that you're having the problem with, and maybe also some context (e.g. browser, operating system)? Otherwise it's hard to help. Best, Oliver\nComment 2: Hello Oliver, Thank you so much for your quick response! My site is a Moodlecloud one. I use  Mac Mini running macOS X Yosemite and the browser I normally use is Firefox . I am building a languaje course which needs many different excercises, but especially \"fill in the blank\" activities . I decided the best way to present all the information and activities was to do it in an interactive book. The problem is that if one single page includes one long \"fill in the blanks\" the whole thing starts to fail. If I dare to have two \"fill in the blanks\" then the book refuses to open altoghether and after I have edited and saved the book, the \"page\" doesn't stop blinking until I push the edit or close buttons. I have seen that if I eliminate alternative answers it does not fail so\nmuch, but then again, if there are two of these activities in one page,\nor just one not so short (more than 5 blanks) then it won't work. This is an example of the kind of questions: ﻿ 1. A partir de mañana, ella *conducirá* el programa. 2. No importa lo que digas, no me vas a poder *convencer* de comer gusanos de maguey. 3. El puesto es tuyo porque te lo *mereces*. 4. Debo estar a la cocina porque el pollo se está *cociendo*. 5. No tenía idea de que *luciera* tan joven. I hope this gives you a better idea of what's happening. Many many thanks for your attention!\nComment 3: Hi Alicia! I have tried to reproduce your problem at https://h5p.org/node/1089348 . I couldn't. Neither on a modern platform, nor on a (emulated) Yosemite with Firefox (V78 which seems to be the last one as support for OS X ran out). JavaScript can be pretty heavy on a CPU, so my best guess is that your Mac Mini (you didn't mention the version) is not the youngest fellow and cannot cope with the computation that's going on in the background. It's a little hard to rule out other issues if you cannot share your content. Cheers, Oliver\nComment 4: Hi Oliver, Thank you so very much for all what you have done trying to help me solve my problem! I think I found how I can still work and do what I need even with my equipment! Apparently, Google Chrome is more \"at ease\" running all the different activities. As soon as I changed browser, my problem stoped. I hope it stays stable (I'll come here and inform of any change)! Your question about the browser I was using gave me the idea to try a different one. So you did help me! Thank you again and all the best!! Alicia\nLabel: ",

In the current 3.9 core version of H5P has this problem been dealt with? i.e. Is the answer key held back on the server ? I carried out a quick check with an H5P multiple choice question and I couldn't find the answer key in the page code, but maybe I did not go deep enough. Any thoughts?

Right click to show 'This frame only', then search for jsonContent on the page source for to find the question source.\nComment 2: Its fundamental to the design difference between H5P and the Moodle Quiz. H5P is mainly in the browser and the Moodle Quiz never reveals the answer until it is ready. You have to be keen and determined to find the data in H5P, but if it is high stakes, someone will and once one person has you should assume everyone has.\nLabel: ",

I'd like to stop it and log out and start following the lesson tomorrow again, the video is paused at 35,30 minutes. The day after I come back to the lesson and to this precise task and I would like the video to start at 35,30 minutes. Is it possible?

So it should be asked on the H5P community: https://h5p.org/forum As far as I know, the H5P Interactive Video does not have a 'resume' function.\nComment 2: Hi! This is possible if you activate the \"save content state\" option in the settings of the H5P plugin. If users are logged in, many H5P content types (including Interactive Video) will then store the current state in a regular time interval that you can set as well and whenever a task is checked. There's also a pull request for optionally adding that feature for users who are not logged in, but it will probably take some time until that one is added. This question becomes moodle related if you are not using the H5P plugin but the H5P integration into moodle core of moodle 3.8+. To the best of my knowledge, the moodle core version does not feature the \"save content state\" option. Best, Oliver\nComment 3: Oliver is right. Unfortunately the very useful \"Save content state\" is not (yet?) available in the H5P integration into Moodle core version. I mentioned this issue in this post . Joseph\nLabel: ",

The content bank looks a bit like a repository browser, but it's not. he current process for cloning content isn't that obvious: open a package by clicking on it click on EDIT, as if you wanted to change that package press the copy button at the top press CANCEL press CLOSE to go back to the content bank. use the add button and scroll around in the list till you find the same content type (why isn't this an autocomplete type box?) and click that type Click on the 'Paste' button at the top and agree with the dialogue. There's your clone. Go back to step 6 and discover it doesn't matter which type you chose because you're going to overwrite it anyway. Ok so now I've made my copy and I realised that I don't need it any more. I'll just delete it again. I'll click the package I'll click, eh, maybe edit? Scroll around a while ... can't see anything maybe at the bottom? no? can't see a way to delete Oh wait a minute ... go to the themes control and switch to Boost Now there's a cog menu and underneath it a drop down with Delete Phew! Wow these copies are getting out of control. I'll just go organise them into folder with nice version names or something uh ... click on the folder icon? oh. oh I see. Well, big old list of Presentation Actviity (copy) (copy) version 2 final (copy) Final version it is then. I might as well just have the files in dropbox and set it up as repository. I like the idea of content bank, and the fact that there might one day be other types of content libraries that can be added not just h5p.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Tim, I agree the Content bank could be improved. I'm missing particularly the feature you indicate of creating folders to organize the H5Ps.\nComment 2: Yeah, this process is terrible, compared to what happens with the H5P plugin - which basically creates an Activity in the same way as other Moodle activities . And can be duplicated in the same way. My feeling at this stage is that the plugin can be used side-by-side, until the concept, and practice, of the content bank is worked out better. I still don't really understand WHY the H5P content is treated this way, and not the same as other Activities, e.g. like a SCORM object is.\nComment 3: I totally agree. Maybe we should do it as feature request at tracker.moodle.org.\nComment 4: There is less obvious, but slightly more straight forward way to clone content. Cliick Upload content Select add file button on file picker Choose Content bank repository Select content to copy and upload It still is a lot of clicks though. I am not sure what functionality in the plugin you are comparing this with since the content bank does not exist at all. You can duplicate activities when editing course and this creates a new content file to edit. Duplicating a content outside the bank is still the same, but it is not editable there.\nLabel: ",

It comes by default on Moodle 3.9. Can they SPAM , crosscript or freeze other students' browsers with malicious H5P content? Is it even possible to create malicious H5P content? Best, Fabian\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello Fabian, as standard settings, the student role doesn't have access to the content bank, i.e. they cannot create any H5P content. I have checked and, in the case of an essay question, the Atto editor doesn't display the H5P button in a student role, so there are no security issues in this regard. But the best would be to create and dummy student account and check how is the role configured in your site.\nComment 2: Thank you Beatriz. I didn't think of login in as a student to see if the button appeared or not. Apparently it doesn't appear by default for the student role in the Atto. Thank you! Best, Fabian\nComment 3: It is possible to create a malicious content type, but new content types have to uploaded by a system administrator. It can not be done by normal users. Javascript is loaded from the content types. When editing content users can really only change plain text. The H5P filter allows users to include content from external sites, but only those on a list specified by the admin as safe. It is possible that malicious code is on one of those sites if the admin is not careful.\nComment 4: Thank you Daniel, That was very useful too. Best, Fabian\nLabel: ",

I want to write h5p content for moodle that would get the current logged in user id, name and use that info to create the h5p content. Please help/advice me if that can be done. I appreciate any help/advice. Thanks.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I'm not sure I know where to start with this ! If you are new to Moodle, and H5P, it sounds like you are trying to code using PHP or similar? - returning unique data from the database ? I guess my question is \"Why?\" What is it you are trying to do? When users access an H5P content type, let's say a Quiz, then Moodle already knows that user, and if they get a score at the end of a H5P Quiz, that is passed to the Moodle Gradebook. I can't understand why you feel you need to access the \"userid and name\" to \"create\" H5P content ?\nComment 2: Hi. Thanks for replying. We are using moodle to send details scorm results to another system that use to store the detail results. Now we need to show users those results in moodle too. So i am trying to make an h5p that will basically retrieve the results from the other system for the user logged in through web service and present them to the user. I hope i clarify my intent. Do you think making h5p in this scenario is good or i need to create a moodle plugin. Thanks and Regards\nComment 3: Hi Faisal, I'm not a developer, but as Stuart suggested, I don't think there's an H5P content for that. As you indicate, an API or a plugin would be the only option.\nComment 4: Hi. Thanks Beatriz, Yes i realised that h5p is not the right way to do that so i created a plugin to accomplish this. Thanks\nComment 5: If you want to retrieve data from another system, and put that into Moodle, then H5P is definitely not going to be the pathway for this. You would be using PHP and/or SQL to display data, or more likely inject it into the database. This doesn't appear to be a H5P question, but a development question. So you should probably ask this type of question in the developer forum.\nComment 6: Hi. Yes i have build a plugin for that. Thanks\nLabel: ",

I am on Moodle version 3.9. In addition, I looked at database activity but students only seem to be able to supply a link to H5P content but neither upload it nor create it. In Forum activity, .h5p files can be added by the student role which is good but does not meet my needs. I am curious what I should be looking or searching for next to find a way to have students create H5P in Moodle (just like a teacher can). I don't want to send students to H5P.org Thank you in advance.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: If you want students to be 'Teachers' in a certain context , isn't that better achieved by using the Assign Roles options, rather than editing the Role itself? e.g. if you want Students to be Teachers, in a specific Course, you can make them Teachers in that Course. Making Students into Teachers within a Courses in a specific context is also possible. But if you edit the Student Role, to give them moodle/course:manageactivities capability then anyone with the Student Role will have that permission and capabilities EVERYWHERE they are enrolled as a Student ! Is that really what you want ?\nComment 2: Hi Dirk, The H5P editor in 3.9 works in the content bank. The content bank is in the course context so there is only one per course. If you allow students to access it they will be able to use all the content there (belonging to other students), but you can restrict them to editing there own content. If that is okay, students should be able to then include any of the content in other activities like wiki or glossary entries using the H5P filter. You do not need to use the H5P activity unless you need to have results of the activity recorded in grade book (which students should not normally access).\nLabel: ",

I am wondering how to best control which content types are available on the site. Here are the options as I understand them: Enable the cron job to download all types from the h5p.org hub. Upload individual .h5p/.zip for each content type you want With option 1 you can download all of the available content types, then delete any that you don't want to support (maybe for accessibility , duplication of functionality of other tools you use, or media storage reasons). The problem with option 1, as I see it, is that any time the cron job runs to fetch updates it will also re-install those unwanted types). Option 2 is attractive, but I'm not clear on where to get the installer files for the content types I want to enable. According to the h5p site, the way to add content types is via the hub that is included in the WordPress/Drupal/ Moodle plugins . I feel like I'm missing a piece here?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I'm trying to set the same up for our M3.8 test instance that doesn't have cron running, but as admin I can't see where to download the H5P content types from to add into \"/h5p/libraries.php\"?\nComment 2: Hello, I will add my interest to the one expressed in previous questions in this conversation, even if I think my perspective is a bit different,  because we are still running 3.5, which was official LTS up to Monday. We are planning to integrate H5P as a plugin in our campus, but we would prefer to offer a selected set of content types to our users. We think that this would be less confusing for them. Is there any way to do such a thing, instead of giving to any user with teacher role in any course the ability to install new content types? We are not about not  giving permissions, just trying to set an intuitive environment. Many thanks in advance for any tip, link or experience on deploying H5P in a big Moodle installation. cheers,\nComment 3: Ramon, my understanding with 3.5 is that you can do some management of the content types when using the plugin but it takes some set-up. It is best if you limit who can add a content type in the first place because once they are added it is not straightforward to remove an unwanted one - here is some info from a Slack discussion I was having: \"Content types are activated and upgraded in the activity editor within a course. There is not an option to remove a content type once activated. With capabilities you can limit content type management and just have you admins do it. You can do some library management at the admin settings level, including \"restricting\" libraries. We have used this feature to take away a content type that was accidentally or dependency activated, e.g. appear.in for Chat and Talk.\"\nComment 4: Many thanks, Ben, your tip will be very useful. We still need to get around the whole issue, but I'm sure we will manage to make a good and clear config for users. This will be a very useful resource.\nLabel: ",

When attempting to view or edit any H5P interactive video on our Moodle site, we simply get a timeout resulting in bad session locks. I'll list all the relevant specs and changes I can think of: New Moodle version: 3.7.4 Change of $CFG->cachedir and $CFG->localcachedir Content Type library updated from 1.21.2 to 1.21.8 Servers (both production and test) are running memcached for sessions H5P version is 1.20.2 on both servers Directory permissions are identical on both servers (777 for moodledata and separate cache dirs) I've tried to replicate the issue on our test system and was successfull in doing so by simply moving said cache directories to their default location (in moodledata) and back (to their custom directory). That was enough. Strangely enough, on our test system, I have been able to remedy the situation by simply deleting \"cache\", \"localcache\", \"sessions\", \"temp\" and \"trashdir\" (in both paths where applicable). On production, this doesn't seem enough. Only two differences between the systems: 1) Production has internet access and thus 2) Production has more current plugin and content type versions (see 1.21.2 vs. 1.21.8 above) I'm at an absolute loss. PHP Debugging on max level is not helpful: \"session_start(): Unable to clear session lock record\" I'm hesitant to start playing around with session handler, etc. My best guess is some interaction between H5P and the moodle cache. But not sure, how exactly... and even less what I could do about it.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: What happened when you originally tested this upgrade ? I mean, you must have tested the upgrade procedure before moving a production site from Moodle 3.4 to 3.7.4 right ?\nComment 2: Thanks for your reply, Stuart. I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can. When originally testing this upgrade, everything seemed fine. I needed to take some additional steps to reproduce the problem on the test system in the first place: Moving around the cache & localcache folders. It might be worth noting that these changes (moving cache & localcache to more performant storage) were the only changes not tested in detail on the test system. (i.e. we checked whether the whole system would work with these changes, but not every single activity) We can add new H5P content, including interactive videos. That seems to work. We also do have *some* existing interactive videos that work. There does not seem to be a predictable pattern which work and which don't, though the majority fails to load. Other H5P content seems to work just fine. I'm planning to stop the production server completely for a short period of time tomorrow morning, allowing me to clean all moodledata directories I think might be involved: cache, localcache, lock, temp, trashdir Might it be worth a shot to add the \"muc\"-folder to this list?\nComment 3: Tried everything mentioned. Switched cache directories back to standard. Emptied caches and other related directories. Changed session handler back to file sessions. Finally rebooted the server. Sadly, no change in behaviour. Next, we're going to give our test system an internet connection so we can update the H5P libraries to the same versions as we have on production. See if that makes the problem occur in the same stubborn way. -.-'\nComment 4: Well, if the problem is cache related (and it doesn't sounds like it's version issue as new content is adding OK), then it's worth clearing all caches. But if you have a proxy or other similar service as well that could be involved?\nComment 5: Hello again, Stuart! We finally managed to resolve the problem. Our developer spent about his whole afternoon debugging and finally spotted the issue: In our php.ini, the value for \"max_execution_time\" was way too short, leading to writing processes to /temp being disrupted. Sessions were also corrupted within the process. After raising this value from about 30s to 300s, everything works fine. Cheers and thanks again for your time and insights\nLabel: ",

Now, it can be used at the Course Category and Course level ( MDL-67786 ). On the other hand, substantial improvements have been applied to xAPI and we already have two of the key xAPI issues in integration, MDL-67734 and MDL-67788 within we can already\nhave tracking in the new H5P activity. Regarding the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we already have the issue in Peer review and we hope to have it in Integration soon. Furthermore, we are working on integrating the Moodle translation system in the H5P Editor ( MDL-68227 ) and adding a post in the translation forum where we explain our approach with the H5P editor localization.\nAlso, we would like to remove the ckeditor from the H5P Editor ( MDL-68240 ) in order to use the current editors in Moodle. Finally, the work in the Repository issue ( MDL-67812 ) has begun and it will allow to easily reuse the contents of the content bank. Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-68116 : Prepare Moodle to be ready when h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We already prepared Moodle to be ready when this year H5P closes h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We have removed https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/ [id] as default value in Display H5P filter and the embed field int the Atto button. It's important to notice that the api.h5p.org will continue to work and the only thing that H5P is going to change is the visibility of the test content on h5p.org, so that only the author can see it. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67734 : Create basic skeleton for a global xAPI library needed for H5P content. MDL-67788 : Add xAPI statement support to mod_h5p. Tracking the students's attempts using xAPI in the H5P activity.

Thanks Andrew for your contribution and Ferran for your hard work here ( MDL-67734 ). Creating folders for organising the content and renaming existing content from the content bank ( MDL-67787 and MDL-67790 ). Integration of the H5P editor ( MDL-67814 ). The first version of the editor is almost ready to peer review. We're currently trying to figure out how to integrate H5P translations with Moodle system. All the issues planned for Moodle 3.9 can be found on the H5P epic ( MDL-67425 ). BTW , the date of the next Moodle 3.9 release has been postponed one month and Moodle 4.0 is planned for November 2021. You'll find this information in the roadmap .

This week we have been focusing on the basic structure and design of all different fronts we are working on: The first version of xAPI statement handler is already implemented, documented and waiting for peer review. You can find some more detailed information in xAPI MDL-67734 . The content bank is on its way. For now, the only module in core that uses content bank will be the H5P content manager, but we are sure more will come for future releases. And, as always in Moodle, everybody will be able to create their own content bank plugin as any other plugin type. We hope to get everything ready for Moodle 3.9 and encourage developers to create new plugins that suits their needs. We started working on the H5P core activity ( MDL-67707 ). This will enable users to create new core activities using existing H5P contents in the content bank. We will try to make it as compatible as possible with the current mod_hvp some of you are already using, to be sure you can continue using the content created in older Moodle versions. Hot topics: MDL-67060 : Improve admin UI to make H5P content types management easier for admins showing them all information together in the same page. MDL-67063 : Add a mechanism to support different H5P core_api versions in stable Moodle versions. Warm thanks: To Spanish healthcare system for taking care of some team members. It has been an intense week, but it's getting better.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Amaia: I see the integration in core means a new module:  mod_h5p. We at ULPGC are currentý using Moodle 3.5 with mod_hvp plugin installed. We have some content created by teachers with hvp.   ¿How do you contemplate  migration form mod_hvp to mod_h5p? In other words, when H5P will be in core, are there plans for backward compatibility with mod_hvp or for content migration? When upgrading moodle 3.5 with mod_hvp installed to moodle 3.9, what it's supposed to happen with existing hvp?\nComment 2: Excellent question Enrique I believe many people will be looking at this right now. By this, I mean administrators of sites already using H5P via the plugin. For the integration of H5P into Moodle core I believe it will be 100% essential that all existing H5P content in Moodle courses will be rendered correctly by the core plugin. I'm sure the Moodle developers working on this will understand the impact if this isn't the case.\nComment 3: Hi Enrique and Stuart,\nComment 4: Hi Amaia: This is going to happen just one time for Institutions having mod_hvp installed and with content. It would be fine for us to have a migration tool form ONE version of mod_hvp (perhaps the latest stable by April or so) to the initial version on mod_h5p in moodle 3.9. So we don't need this event been added and stored forever in the module db/upgrade.php For mod_h5p the history of upgrades would be clean, and always within mod_h5p. I', thinking something like the admin_tool tool_assignmentupgrade when mod_assignment was deprecated and mod_assign was born. The key point is that I think admins do not need a complete \"any previous version of mod_hvp is compatible with any future version of mod_h5p\". We need a path for upgrade, avoiding being trapped by scenarios where maximal upgradeable state in an install doesn't match with minimum upgradeable in the other branch. The current mod_hvp version 1.20.2 (2020020500) is compatible from moodle 2.7 up to 3.8. So, and admin migrating to 3.9 (or further) just will need to upgrade mod_hvp yo this 1.20.2 (2020020500) version (or other agreed with hvp people in these months before 3.9), then migrate to initial mod_h5p in a 3.9 installation, and then upgrade that to 4.0 or 4.3 in the future. I wholeheartly agree with Stuart that content migration is a must. Unthinkable otherways.  This must be part of the initial implementation plans for h5p integration in core.\nComment 5: Thanks for your input and feedback. We will take your experience into consideration. Thanks again, Enrique. We hope you will continue to help us with further input. Amaia\nComment 6: Hi Amaia, I wonder what are the pros and cons you came up with when decided to develop a new H5P module in core. can you share? Also, we are concerned about the migration process, as we are using a patched upstream mod_hvp to support RTL (see: https://github.com/iucc/h5p-moodle-plugin ) Will you support RTL in the new H5P module for version 3.9? And also concerned about possible broken links that might occur on our systems after using the assumed to be developed \"migration tool\", as we embed a lot of H5P activities all over the course using \"ATTO embed H5P button\" we developed: https://github.com/iucc/moodle-atto_hvp Please consider above scenarios. Nadav\nComment 7: Hi Nadav, Thanks for sharing your code on RTL patch in mod_hvp. Of course this will be an issue we will need to guarantee on the new H5Pactivity so I create a new issue for it in order to adapt and test this specific configuration ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-68151 ). Embed H5P into Atto won't be migrated to activities. Atto button and H5P new activity are separate functionalities. The migration tool we are evaluating is from mod_hvp for now.\nComment 8: Thanks Ferran for making it clear. I guess we will deal with this on our side, as we upgrade to 3.9 I will upload the RTL fixes to the new H5P module (H5Pactivity) via MDL-68151 .\nLabel: ",

Our main goal for Moodle 3.9 is: Integration of H5P content types with Moodle gradebook and activity completion. Improved integration of H5P content type selection in Moodle's activity chooser. To this end, we have worked hard to get a first functional prototype that covers most of the needs expressed in the studies and interviews conducted to the community throughout 2019. The result, is an approach that allows Moodle to be more versatile in content creation. To do this, we have created a prototype that separates the H5P activity module from content creation. Two clearly different mindsets. One for the activity and one for the content creation. In this way, a user can create or add new H5P content from Moodle without associating them with an activity. On the other hand, through the activity, you can access those contents in a simple way and use them through a new repository where you can\nchoose the H5P created in the Content Bank and take advantage of all the activity's functionalities as activity completion or grading. On the Content bank, you will be able to create, import and edit H5P files, among other functionalities.\nThrough this separation, we enhance the reuse of H5P contents that are created or imported into Moodle allowing them to be used in any activity or using the Atto editor or the filter anywhere in Moodle. It will help to provide Moodle with great\nflexibility looking forward to the future. We would like to add all the news and progress in the integration of H5P and Moodle every week. Hot topics: You can check the prototype of the activity here . We will add the link to the Content Bank prototype as soon as possible. We are still working on a full version.

Warm thanks: To Rafael Lechugo our UX expert, for sharing with us his great ideas and for demonstrating great patience with all of us.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: This is awesome news, I do wonder if it would be possible to have the H5P Atto Editor allow the user to both choose, create and embed new HP5 content. To my understanding, currently the Atto H5P editor only allows you to embed pre-created content using a link. From a usability point of view, it would be great to allow the user to create and embed in a single motion. And then possibly save into a Content Bank. (Ive thought the same about Atto Embed Quiz question tool.) regards, Brad\nComment 2: Hi, Brad. Thank you very much for participating in the development of the H5P project and for contributing new ideas. We agree with you on the benefits your proposal brings to users, and we will include it in our list of new features to implement. Thanks again, Brad, we hope you will continue to help us with further input.\nComment 3: Creating H5P content in Moodle isn't supported yet in core - only if you are using the H5P plugin can you create H5P content within Moodle.\nLabel: ",

Remember that H5P Epic for 3.9 is the central reference for tracking project progress. Hot topics We've been working on: xAPI ( MDL-67734 ) - xAPI statement validation and PHPUnitTests H5P editor ( MDL-67814 >) - getting a fully operational standalone version, no hvp plugin required. Finding out how to interact with the content bank. Content bank ( MDL-67786 ) - creating a new content bank type plugin (H5P will be the first one). Besides, we have been improving the initial integration of H5P available from Moodle 3.8, such as MDL-67063 (allowing several versions of the H5P core library to coexists) and MDL-67060 (enhanced libraries management). And finally, we have been working intensively on the prototypes of the content bank and how it will interact with the H5P editor: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/2YVQAY2BCRJ#/screens/402513375 Warm thanks A big shout out to our team leader, Carlos Escobedo.

It is pretty easy to use. It usually looks good (if you build it well). I keep hearing people say it is better than SCORM (old and broke) and these are people who know what they're talking about. But I keep finding little things that are deal breakers. I can caption video. That's great! But if I add audio, no captioning. I can use YouTube video, which already has captioning (possibly bad captioning, but captioning)...but if I use it in interactive video, where I add questions or interaction, the captioning is gone. There's no way to get captions on a YouTube video with interactive video that I can find. Interactive video is so cool. But if you use a large video (what video isn't?!?), your whole site might suddenly start crashing. Yes, I'm sure. And reporting. This is a big one. First. The reports are...not easy to find. Why would I go to the gradebook for activity reports? Well, if I'm using H5P, that's where I go. If I create an interactive video module, my users have to answer the questions and then manually submit them for it to report to me that they have done anything. If they don't do the submitting thing (and there is no way to know you need to do this), it might not remember they did it. Sometimes it starts where they left off...and sometimes it doesn't. And if the site crashes because the video is big...it always forgets. (to be fair, really large scorm modules can muck things up too, but they remember doing it). I'm not hung up on WHEN they started, just that they did. And that they finish. And that it knows they finish. If I want completion to be contingent on completing the whole thing...well, there is no tracking. I can just click next indefinitely and not do anything. If I set up branching, there is a button at the top that lets me skip entire sections . If I want completion to be contingent on a specific score...well,It doesn't do completion on a particular score--only if a score exists...I could fiddle with grade book settings for a grade to pass but I'm not confident it would actually work, because, well scoring is weird. Really weird. I can get grades (or complete/incomplete) from SCORM. If I find an error and need to change it while it is being used by students, when I make the change, it forces my users to start over. Updating SCORM is easy and doesn't mess up reporting. If I want to know how people answered questions. Well, I'd better use something else. That's not something H5P does. SCORM does it (badly--but I can get the data!). I really want to use H5P but I don't think I can. I need these features that SCORM has. Discuss?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Melanie, I'm not as experienced as you in the use of SCORM , but I have written a lot of storyboards for SCORM-compliant tools such as Storyline and, before that, I had created materials with HotPotatoes and later with H5P for my own courses. I was surprised about how difficult it was to create interactive activities with Storyline or Articulate. We needed the job of an experienced developer and prototype and alpha and beta phases to create something that I could create in less than 30 minutes with other tools and update without problems. From this perspective, I found H5P better than SCORM.\nComment 2: So, I've created SCORM content with Lectora, Camtasia and Captivate. I've seen/manipulated content developed with other products. I've heard some really good things about Articulate (so your complaints are surprising. Back when I first started working with Lectora, if I had seen Articulate first, I probably would have gone that direction instead. But I love Lectora.) I've also used eXe and iSpring. Honestly, I recommend Quiz for testing always. SCORM reports results but cannot give any kind of effective stats on overall participation. Quiz gives stats. LOVE that. I don't test is scorms ever if I can help it (knowledge checks for interactivity, applicability stuff but not actual testing) My experience with people who complain about authoring software is that they generally haven't learned how to set them up properly or they don't think outside the box or they want something that does the hard stuff for them. It really helps to know what you want before you start. I think building in H5P is generally easy. I want to like it. I want to use it. But it can't do what I need with reporting and some of the 'interactions' are a bit clunky. I tend to build branching type stuff...there are four things you have to do but you can do them in any order you want, and my materials tell you when you've completed one. H5P...not so much...you can branch but it is more story branching than what I do. That said...I LOVE story branching! I have used it in the past for human resources training and case management training... I wish I could use it for what I do but the thing I need it...well, it's IT training, which makes story telling more complicated and I'll only have a month of development time (plus my regular job duties for supporting tech for all our departments, answering help calls and managing our Moodle) which isn't a lot of time. Research says a 1 hour on-line module should take about 80 hours of development. I don't think I ever take that long...but you're better off with smaller bites of content--10 to 15 minutes apiece (so, as much as 20 hours of dev)--our attention spans aren't that long and with our tech dependence, they are getting shorter! Tom Kuhlman (Articulate) calls short courses coursels, which I love--he is my hero, so awesome! (Well, and Dan Marsden and Tim Hunt. And Helen and Mary...) Interactivity takes time. You have to know what you want and how it should look/behave. If the student does X, what happens? If they do Y, what happens? It can help if you can create a template and build from there. I once built a course where the student had three case files they had to complete. It was mostly story telling and choose-your-own adventure types stuff with good ending and supervisors telling you you did the wrong thing. It took a ridiculous amount of time to build and was incredibly complicated...but it worked...later I stripped all the actual content out and saved it as a template shared it with a work group I'm a part of...I don't know what happened with it after (but people still talk about it and that was 2 years ago). Lectora is expensive, but I think worth it. It also allows a lot of granular control--variables, action sequences. In fact, if you want any interactivity, you must use variables and action sequences, which requires some braining and working out what you want and when. Captivate is less expensive (but getting more expensive every year) but gives less control--I could set conditions in lectora where if X was true (like a specific quiz grade or range was acheived) then the course would be marked complete at the end but I can't do that in Captivate--completion reporting is hard coded--you give it a grade for passing an that is it--I sometimes don't want 80%, I want a range because it isn't a quiz, it is an assessment of something (like a personality quiz) and Captivate is balls at that. And branching is hard in Captivate (it's hard anyway, from the brain standpoint, but harder). So, that was kind of a dis to people who complain about the tech...to be fair, I complain a lot about Captivate--but that is because it takes about 3 times longer to build something in it than Lectora. Knowing how to do something only gets you so far...but creating interactive video is pretty easy with H5P, which is why it was so attractive. It's fairly easy with Camtasia, as well, but there are weird things about reporting there, too (but it reports and reports completion) and sometimes it crashes or does weird stuff. The short answer is both of SCORM and H5P require skills (with the tech, with design, with knowing what you want). If you just want to share some information and don't care about tracking (like a ppt), it might be easier to use H5P (or upload the ppt). If you want tracking, SCORM works better because, well, it tracks. If you want interactive video and don't care about tracking, H5P is probably nicer to use. If you need to know the person actually did the whole activity, SCORM is better, in spite of being an oldster. And branching, well, if you want tracking and don't care about looking spiff, Lesson is fantastic. If you want tracking and pretty, SCORM. If you just want pretty, well, H5P is okay. But this is a data driven world. We want tracking. If it is just practice, that's fine, go for H5P. But if it isn't practice, I have to still go with SCORM. And that makes me sad.\nComment 3: I re-read my post this morning and realized, I really kind of under valued lesson . Lesson is fantastic. Period. You can, with skill and effort, make it look good. It isn't as easy to make pretty as H5P. You can do it though. The tracking is cool (not quite as nice as quiz, doesn't really track retakes for stats) but a little clunky. But in all ways, Lesson is still terrific. You can't do interactive video with it. But branching! Unbelievably powerful! None of that has anything to do with the inherent weaknesses of H5P...just didn't want to make it sound like I don't appreciate Lesson. I do. A lot!\nLabel: ",

It is, admittedly, a long video--90 minutes. Throughout, there are questions (hence, interactive).  It went live and within about 45 minutes my server started acting strange. Users across the site started experience Server 500 errors, intermittently. We looked into it.  Something has been opening database connections, leaving them open, sucking up resources and then spontaneously aborting them.  And then the server crashes. It comes back up and starts all over again. Only one thing has changed: the H5P module went live and started getting use. We had no problems when testing it before the go-live, but then it was just me messing with it. So, it seems pretty likely that the issue is related to the H5P. I switched to H5P from SCORM because I didn't like the way the scorm published video couldn't seem to remember where it left off if the user had to stop and come back (Camtasia published scorms just aren't that smart. The alternative is manually captioning 90 minutes of video in Captivate. No. Just...no. Of course, that would work. but I've already spent hideous amounts of time fidgeting my captions to deal with the fact that Safari and Chrome only allow one line of caption...). I'm running Moodle 3.6.2 (will probabaly upgrade to 3.7 in November or Dec).  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or why it would cause this problem?\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I'm running into problems installing the plugin. This is the guide: https://h5p.org/comment/6610 Everything is okay until I get to the Install Now button... which isn't there. So I've downloaded it and gotten to step 5. This is where I always get the error message that the page can't be displayed. I'm scratching my head as to why. Would it have anything to do with needing to have a registered Moodle site? Thanks for any help, J.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It’s nothing to do with being a registered site or not. But I’m slightly confused - easily done at the moment 😁 - you said you’d got to step 5 in that guide, but the Install Now button is mentioned in Step 2. The Install Now button will only show if you’re installing the version of the plugin that is compatible with your version of Moodle. So what version of Moodle are you on? And if you have managed to get to Step 5 and your getting a blank screen, there’s a problem. You’ll need to turn debugging on to troubleshoot that .\nComment 2: Hi Jon, Thanks for the reply. I got to step 5 by downloading the zip file and then instead of installing from the plug-in directory, uploaded the zip from my computer and got to step 5 that way. I'm using Moodle 3.6. So I turned on debugging...  and what you said about the compatibility issue made a lot of sense. I went through the process again and... dun dun dun... the install button appeared. I got this page: Moodle 3.6 Install plugins from the Moodle plugins directory \n```text\nDebugging output enabled\nDownloading mod_hvp ... OK\nValidating mod_hvp ...\n```\n And then: Moodle 3.6 Install plugins from the Moodle plugins directory \n```text\nDebugging output enabled\nDownloading mod_hvp ... OK\nValidating mod_hvp ...

It’s the error message when no more specific error message is suitable. It may be difficult to troubleshoot this error because it can be triggered out by many different issues. When you switched debugging on, did you select an option for displaying the debug messages? Choose the DEVELOPER option and try the install again. And do you have access to your web server error logs?\nComment 4: Please note: I am just going to move this thread, as it's not directly related to Teaching with Moodle...\nComment 5: Hi Jon: I've just encountered the exact same 500 error. below are debugging messages, could you please to advise how to fix it? thanks a lot ------ upload the h5p plugin zip file Moodle 3.8 Install plugin from ZIP file Debugging output enabled ZIP /Applications/ MAMP /data/moodle38/temp/tool_installaddon/5efa6290-4ecb-4396-b4e0-efea37e0b617/plugin.zip Validating mod_hvp ...

It should only be used for testing and development. You may encounter problems with third party plugins such as H5P that are only available for versions up to Moodle 3.7.\nComment 8: Also 3.8 is due for code freeze in October 2019 and release in November so it is very early days.\nComment 9: Thanks Jon and Marcus. Seems I’d better to downgrade to 3.7 Average of ratings: - Permalink Show parent Reply\nLabel: ",

Lot of our students obviously are going to listen to this in the background while on Facebook, that's just the reality of people including myself if I was taking these courses. So if anyone moves away from the tab and the video hits a question. It will pause and no question will be displayed when the user goes back to see why it paused. So they will just play the play button and rinse and repeat until the video ends. This makes h5p extremely frustrating to use as a video question platform. Is there any setting that needs to be changed to work around this? Thank you so much.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi! I just tried to reproduce your issue on all the major browsers, but I couldn't. The videos stops and shows interactions just fine even if I am browsing i a different tab. Could you please describe your system (operating system + browser + host (moodle, drupar or WordPress) including version numbers each)? Best, Oliver\nComment 2: This happens with all our clients and all our laptops. We are using moodle 3.3, browser is firefox . Though I am pretty sure this also happens on chrome. Operating system is windows 10. Firefox and windows are up to date.\nComment 3: Actually I have more data. This does not happen on all of our courses. So maybe there is a settings that messes this up all for one of my courses that doesn't have that setting but all my other courses do. I'll have to investigate I will see shortly. Edit: Nevermind. The one that was working now all of a sudden did not work when switching tabs.\nComment 4: Hi there! I only have moodle 3.4 at my disposal, but anyway: I couldn't reproduce the issue. I used the latest version of Firefox and Chrome, tried interactions in button and in poster mode. Maybe there's someone in the community who could have a look on a moodle 3.3 system and rule out that another plugin is causing the issue? Best, Oliver\nLabel: ",

What happens if that company decides to pull that plug-in or ask for a payment for use? What is the liability if a teacher accidentally uses copyrighted material? Would the individual teacher be liable for that mistake? Thank you for the help.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Kevin! We're getting hired by several organizations (often universities or other institutions close to education) for extending the functionality of H5P. Also, in the very near future, there will be h5p.com which offers features on top of just providing content types, e.g. data storage or analysis. Those will not be free. H5P is open source software, so even we went down or became dickheads, someone could take the mantle and establish something like a core team to continue development. If someone wants to, he or she could also do that right now and fork the whole project. Feel free to judge how open and dedicated we are by having a look at our source code , lively discussions on our forums or our ticket system where you can even track what we're working on. We may be a company, but H5P is a community project and should be to a larger degree even. Are you asking if we should be held accountable for copyright infringement by others? Best, Oliver\nComment 2: Hi Q1 & 2: Yes, the idea of Free and Open Source Software is a change of paradigm. Read about the GPL http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt , which is also the https://docs.moodle.org/dev/License of Moodle. Q3: Accidents happen. But no software developer takes responsibility for accidents at the user end!\nComment 3: Thanks for the reply. I guess I worded the copyright question wrong. I was worried more about it in a different way.\nComment 4: I am not sure whether you got the answers to your questions, Q1 and 2 I mean. > Q1. How are they making money off of it? Probably you meant https://h5p.org/ and got the answer from a developer. The point is, there are many, many different models in financing a FOSS product. To make the matters complicated, the model of a particular product may change during its history. So the general question has no full answer.\nComment 5: Hi Kevin! I guess #3 is hard to tell, because it can depend on the jurisdiction you're under or the organization you're in. For example, professors in Germany have something called \"Institutshaftung\" where the university is liable unless the professor was clearly negligent. It's different for teachers in schools, where the exact terms can depend on the federal district you're in, etc. Sorry for not being more helpful. Best, Oliver\nComment 6: I'm betting your initial fear is that you have invested in 3rd party plugins in the past and gotten everyone onboard using it only to have the rug pulled out from underneath you. You don't want to be burned again and are being cautious in adopting any additional plugins. We are the same way.  So much so that we use Moodle for that very reason, in that we are in control of our LMS.  We can say with certainty that until we turn off the servers we can provide teachers with this service. We quickly adopted the H5P plugin based on what we saw in their forums, the usefulness of the plugin to teachers, and just a general feeling that this is too good to not offer to our teachers - even if it went away.  Almost an \"enjoy it while you can\" assumption. As you can see from Oliver they are very much interested in keeping this open source.  I wouldn't delay trying it out.  It's very good.\nLabel: ",

So I've put the main h5p in the modules folder and updated the database . That went fine put in the settings all is well. Then it starts shouting about missing modules and telling me they are missing from the disk. e.g modulename /mod/hvp 2016051306 I can download something from the site it directs you to but that seems to say drupal and wordpress (no mention of Moodle and seems to unzip into an awful lot of folders) then the only instructions it has are to go through the front end of Moodle into the libraries. I can't do that - where am I looking for in the folder structure - am I looking in the mod/hvp folder or some other folder e.g. lib/ I'm not finding it very clear, but that is probably me misunderstanding. Can anyone shed any light please? Thank you Heather\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: "
