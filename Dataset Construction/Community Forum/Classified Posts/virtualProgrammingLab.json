I am teaching a basic programming course and I use VPL for my evaluations. Most questions are fairly simple and can be solved in a few miliseconds, so I randomly create 100 test cases and assign a grade according to how many of them are correctly solved. Most questions take one or two seconds to be graded in this manner (or at least this is how long it takes after I click on the \"evaluate\" button). However, the \"Maximum execution time\" is not respected. Here's a MRE: There are 128 test cases, all equal to Case = Test input = 1 output = 1 Solution (in C) is #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"1\"); return 0; } It takes about 2 seconds to compile and 1 to evaluate, when it works. Maximum memory is 512MB, maximum execution files 128MB and maximum processes is 10. When I set up Maximum execution time to 8 minutes or more, it evaluates as above; However, anything below that yields \"Global timeout\". Some VPLs which I created evaluate in 4 minutes, others 2. I couldn't find a pattern. IT in my uni noticed that vpl_evaluate.cpp ( https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl_evaluate.cpp ) has these lines: int timeout = maxtime / testCases.size(); for (size_t i = 0; i < testCases.size(); i++) { //... if (timeout <= 1 || Timer::elapsedTime() >= maxtime) { //... addFatalError(\"Global timeout\"); and that maxtime = maximum time in seconds (integer). So if maxtime < testCases.size() we automatically get a \"Global timeout\" error, and this might be related to this issue. However, it does not explain why it does not evaluate in 4 minutes. So, I always have to set up a relatively high maximum execution time in order for correct answers to be properly evaluated (4 or 8 minutes, usually), even if they are actually evaluated basically instantly. However, whenever a student makes a nonending loop, they have to way for that whole time (4+ minutes) in order to get the timeout error message and be able to try again. This hinders VPLs usability in exams, which are time-sensitive. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem as a professor (no access to uni server and moodle plugin configs)? Or is there anything I could indicate IT to do? I note that this problem was already noticed in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=451871&lang=en . Thank you very much.\nLabel: ",

According to the documentation, the correct way to assign a grade is by echoing a string in the format 'Grade :=>> [value]'. For example, I'm using: `echo \"Grade :=>> 8.33\"` However, when the evaluation runs, the string \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" appears in the output of the evaluation report, but the actual grade for the submission is not being set by VPL. It seems like VPL is not interpreting this line as a grade assignment. Here's an example of the output I'm seeing: \n```text\nGrade\n8.33\n\n\n\nGrade :=>> 8.33\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n (Note: The \"Grade 8.33\" line before \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" is part of my script's output, not the VPL grade assignment itself.) Could anyone please advise on what might be causing this issue? Is there a specific placement for this command in 'vpl_evaluate.sh' (e.g., must it be the very last line of output)? Or are there any other configurations in VPL or Moodle that I need to check to ensure this command is correctly parsed as the final grade? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\nLabel: ",

I am very fascinated about your VPL Jail Server Projects and its features. We have been recently moved to MOODLE LMS system. And we are using VPL for programming practices. We are having 3000+ users. Under normal circumstance VPL is responding good if more number of users using we find VPL is bit slow. So we decided to put more horizontally scale based on no of users. For that i have personally testing VPL docker images especially ubuntu-full. Everything works fine if i created as separate docker container in a separate VM and accessed through common physical router. But when i tried to run moodle and vpl containers in same machine and connect with docker network it is not working. In console i am getting ws (web socket) error. Please advice on this i have tried in many ways but the result is same. Dr.Rajasekaran\nLabel: ",

I have installed it globally on the JAIL server and modified the javascript_run.sh script to link to the module. Due to permissions, it cannot access the module. However, it works fine if I copy the whole node_modules folder into the execution directory at run time. This seems unnecessary and repetitive when it is being used multiple times and by many users. So, basically, is there a shared directory which all users can access during execution where I can put the module files? Or if I create one, what ownership and permissions would it need?

I wonder whether there's any option in VPL to ensure that user code cannot access the network in any way? We enable access to Moodle from a very restricted testing environment, but it would be ideal if VPL wouldn't allow access to external network.  This may be able to be done with regular firewall rules on the VPL execution server , but it would be ideal if this was something that could be turned off or on by faculty, and I suspect the default option should be off. Thanks! Jason.\nLabel: ",

It is working fine now, but I had a few issues during the installation: First, if you are using a router, you need that your real IP ports 80 and 443 from outside be foward to your local IP (192.something) [you do it by configuring your router] and that those ports also be fowards from your IP to your NAT IP inside Virtual Machine (10. something) [you do it by configuring the network on Oracle Virtual Machine). Second, I got a hell of time to put the SSL certificate to function. The non secure host / OK was working fine but the SSL  host / OK was given a not secure error. I tried to copy the etc/letsencrypt .pem files to the respective correct names on the etc/vpl, however, it did not work. Later I verified that the size of the copied files were way smaller than the original ones and instead of copying the files, I just put the link of the pem files inside the vpl jail server conf files and it started to work just fine. Those were the two major issues I get and I had to say it took me a couple of hours to solve it, but now I'm happyt it is working fine.

First of all, many thanks to Juan Carlos for providing this tool. I would like to use VPL to propose some challenges to my students in my algorithms and abstract data type course. To be pertinent, the challenge must treat large (up to 10 to 20MB) files as input. My problem is that the files are displayed in the main page of the activity : the page is thus quite slow to load (a few seconds). The IDE is also slow when I want to save a file, it seems that all the files are saved even if only one single file is modified ? Here is my question : how could I solved these slowdown issues ? One solution could be to create my instance files on the fly, but maybe there is a better solution or a configuration that I missed ?\nLabel: ",

If they turn off the due date and only use the activity completion settings with an expected completion date, once that date and the conditions have been met, the Overdue no longer appears, but the assignment will show that it is x many days late. This is problematic because one of our professors only accepts fully correct coding problems and docks students .2 for late assignments, so Moodle thinking they are all late is not good, nor is seeing numerous Overdue items every time they open Moodle, despite already submitting.\nLabel: ",

Inspired by its flexibility, together with my colleagues I am trying to connect it in the common workflow with programs we have installed on our server . Our use case is as follows: on our server, we set up a VM with Ubuntu 20.04 64b and latest VPL jail jail server communicates with Moodle without problems, we can run standard software tools and software we compiled and installed in `/usr/local/bin` , for example we have mapped a partition with additional software to be able to access and run the software on the mounted partition, the user needs to be added to secondary group, let's call it `secondarygroup` with guid `2000` `` in Ubuntu VM we are able to add the `vpl` user to `secondarygroup` using `usermod -a -G mygroup vpl` and we are able to run the software. But of course the vpl user won't be a prisoner in the VPL jail. So we need to add all prisoners to `secondarygroup` . Question So my question and problem is: how to add prisoners to (a) secondary group(s) . What I've tried For the purpose of testing I reduced the `MIN_PRISONER_UGID` - `MAX_PRISONER_UGID` range to 10000-10007. I found `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` file, which seems to be executed each time after I run `systemctl restart vpl-jail-system` I modified `set_etc` function in the mentioned file so that `$JAILPATH/etc/group` file has an additional line with `secondarygroup` and `$JAILPATH/etc/gshadow` file is generated (details below) `` Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/ehjSaSoZPX , I also attach the files (before/after) `` Result (VPL in the browser) `` For the testing purposes, I put several command in the `vpl_run.sh` , and the result is as follows: `` \n```text\ncat /etc/passwd : \n\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:10000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:10001:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:10002:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\n\n\np10003:*:10003:10003:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\n\n\np10004:*:10004:10004:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n\np10005:*:10005:10005:prisoner 10005:/home/p10005:/bin/bash\np10006:*:10006:10006:prisoner 10006:/home/p10006:/bin/bash\n\ncat /etc/group : \n\nroot:*:0:root\np10000:*:10000:p10000\np10001:*:10001:p10001\n```\n In the `groups` and `id` I would expect seeing `secondarygroup` , but it is not there. Also, `gshadow` looks like this in Ubuntu VM: \n```text\ncat /jail/etc/gshadow\ncat /var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/gshadow :\n\nroot:::\nsecondarygroup:!!::p10000,p10001,p10002,p10003,p10004,p10005,p10006\n```\n I also did an experiment when no custom `gshadow` is generated, with the same result as above. Summary So it seems that either I am doing something wrong with purely linux-related files that determine user groups or there is something VPL related I am not aware of. Is there any way to add prisoner users to secondary groups? I will appreciate any help.\nLabel: ",

We recently started the process of integrating the functionality of VPL into our own moodle and to evaluate VPL concerning its interoperability with other automated grading systems for programming tasks . In this context m y University, in colaboration with many other universities, developed an XML exchange format called ProForma . ProForma is an exchange format for programming exercises/tasks. It formalises the specification of programming exercises, for example, the description, required programming language and suggested tests for evaluating the student submitted code so that exercises written for one tool can be exported and imported into another tool. We are interessed in extending the functionality of VPL so that it would support the uploading and further processing of tasks in our ProForma format, and if possible, we would like to avoid breaking the VPL standard, as we are interessed in making use of future new VPL releases. Therefore, we are wondering if there is interest from the side of the global VPL community to integrate this extra functionality into VPL and if so, we would like to collaborate with the creators of VPL for assistance. That way, everyone could make use of the ProForma format to exchange programming tasks independent of the learning respectively grading platform and we would still be able to rece i ve future VPL updates down the line. Please contact me if you are interested. Best regards, Zaid Akad\nLabel: ",

My first thought was the vpl_evaluate.cases file, but it is a list of correct cases, I found out. First time user. Apologies if this is a FAQ. I did a forum search though, they are bewildering for a beginner. ;( Edit: Is the VPL Question type the answer?

I usually use the due date as the last possible date to submit an vpl assignment and I set \"Expect completed on\" a week or two before the due date. I use this technique with other acitivities as well, e.g. quizzes, lessons, ... all of them show up in the timeline block with the \"expect completed on\" and there actual due date as long as the activity was not yet completed. VPL activites are not in the timeline block, neither with their due date nor with their expect completed on date. In the course calendar the due date results in a calendar entry, but again not the expect completed on date as it is, with the other activities. Is there a specific reason for this behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Both VPL and moodle have their latest version installed. Regards Lisa\nLabel: ",

Doing tests directly based on the VPL works perfekt: evaluation of the code on the evaluate.cases file works as espected. But as soon as I am trying to grade the tests based on the Moodle Plugin vpl_question, I get the error: \"An error occured during question grading (no grade obtained)\". I tried to debug this (debug level 8 on the jail server ), which shows me that the files are uploaded as expected, the output of the test result is written into the log entry also. But it seems that this result is not transferred back to the moodle server correctly. I get the same error when I activate the checkbox \"Validate\" inside the question activity, as soon as I try to save the question. Can you please help me in solving this problem? Many thanks!

In a first-year subject is very important that students learn a good codification: getter, setter, equals, etc. Is it possible to add this feature?? I find out a book \"developing programming courses with moodle and vpl\" that shows a solution for my purpose, however, from my point of view, it is a bit difficult to do it. And finally, I don't know if it is possible to integrate the PMD analyzer code in VPL (or another one) in which you can set the features that PMD has to check in student programs and VPL returns an error it has not a good codification.

I'm trying to use the forward slash character (/) within a regular expression in the \"vpl_evaluate.cases\" file but \"no test case found\" message is shown when evaluating the output of any student program. I guess there is something wrong when Moodle is processing such a regular expression... For example, the output of the program should be the string \"2/2\" or \"02/02\", i.e., both strings are valid, so I think regular expressions come to play in this case because using exact match we can not define alternative clauses... If I define the following test case: \n```text\ncase = Test 1\n\n\ngrade reduction = 20%\n\n\ninput =2\n\n\n2\n\n\noutput = /(2\\/2)|(02\\/02)/\n```\n Moodle shows a \"no test case found\" message when I tried to evaluate any program. I think the problem is related to the use of '/' within the regular expression, any help? Thanks in advanced! José\nLabel: ",

We can bulk download all the submissions of all the students using download all submissions link. However, we are facing problems linking the submissions to the Moodle's ID number. The directory names for different students are in the format: <last name> <first name> <moodle code>. However, this code doesn't come  in the grader report. How can we link this code to the actual student <ID Number> in the grader report (or email address)?

I am teaching a basic programming course and I use VPL for my evaluations. Most questions are fairly simple and can be solved in a few miliseconds, so I randomly create 100 test cases and assign a grade according to how many of them are correctly solved. Most questions take one or two seconds to be graded in this manner (or at least this is how long it takes after I click on the \"evaluate\" button). However, the \"Maximum execution time\" is not respected. Here's a MRE: There are 128 test cases, all equal to Case = Test input = 1 output = 1 Solution (in C) is #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"1\"); return 0; } It takes about 2 seconds to compile and 1 to evaluate, when it works. Maximum memory is 512MB, maximum execution files 128MB and maximum processes is 10. When I set up Maximum execution time to 8 minutes or more, it evaluates as above; However, anything below that yields \"Global timeout\". Some VPLs which I created evaluate in 4 minutes, others 2. I couldn't find a pattern. IT in my uni noticed that vpl_evaluate.cpp ( https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl_evaluate.cpp ) has these lines: int timeout = maxtime / testCases.size(); for (size_t i = 0; i < testCases.size(); i++) { //... if (timeout <= 1 || Timer::elapsedTime() >= maxtime) { //... addFatalError(\"Global timeout\"); and that maxtime = maximum time in seconds (integer). So if maxtime < testCases.size() we automatically get a \"Global timeout\" error, and this might be related to this issue. However, it does not explain why it does not evaluate in 4 minutes. So, I always have to set up a relatively high maximum execution time in order for correct answers to be properly evaluated (4 or 8 minutes, usually), even if they are actually evaluated basically instantly. However, whenever a student makes a nonending loop, they have to way for that whole time (4+ minutes) in order to get the timeout error message and be able to try again. This hinders VPLs usability in exams, which are time-sensitive. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem as a professor (no access to uni server and moodle plugin configs)? Or is there anything I could indicate IT to do? I note that this problem was already noticed in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=451871&lang=en . Thank you very much.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Luiz, Thank you for reporting this issue, and sorry for the inconvenience you’re experiencing. You are correct — the BIOTES evaluator represents time limits as integer seconds and distributes the total maximum execution time among all test cases. Specifically, the timeout for each case is calculated approximately as: `timeout_per_case = maxtime / number_of_cases` Because of this design, if the number of test cases is large and the total time limit is not proportionally higher, the timeout for each individual case may become too small, causing a “Global timeout” error even when the total execution time seems reasonable. To avoid this, you should ensure that the maximum execution time is greater than the number of test cases . The more test cases you have, the larger this global time limit needs to be. Better Solution: Use the GIOTES Evaluator This limitation has been resolved in the newer GIOTES evaluator (VPL version >= 4.3.0), which is mostly compatible with BIOTES but provides much more flexibility in timeout management. With GIOTES , you can: Define a default timeout per test case using \"time limit=\" before any case, Override the timeout for specific cases using \"time limit=\" in the case, and Use floating-point values for more precise time limits (e.g., 0.5 seconds). This allows you to manage large numbers of test cases efficiently without artificially inflating the total maximum time. Server Configuration Note Be aware that the jail server configuration can also limit the maximum execution time.\nBy default, the jail server’s global timeout is 1800 seconds (30 minutes) , but this can be freely adjusted by the jail server administrator. In most cases, the default settings work well. However, reducing the number of allowed processes too much can negatively affect performance and lead to unexpected timeouts, so I would recommend keeping the default or slightly increasing it rather than lowering it.

The first part sits on the server and runs the code in a sandbox environment. Thus, if we want to run a specific package of, let us say, Python, then if the computer that has the VPL server running can compile Python, and has the package available and correctly configured, the code sent to it will run, and you will have an output. The Moodle plugin facilitates sending the code to the server; thus, instead of the professor downloading the student code to their development machine, executing the code, and viewing the results, the plugin does this work. There is also a way to automate checking. If the professor spends a little time, higher automation in the evaluation of the results is possible. This summarises the workflow. Now, to address your query: The sandbox environment should also have access to the GPUs. There is work to be done under the hood, however, if there is experience in setting up GPUs on another machine of similar architecture, it should be a cinch. Extensive testing is required to fully understand the workflow. Process execution limits should be suitable for the proposed workload. Very few institutions will run the backend jobe server on GPU and CUDA capable servers, although it is possible. We are curious to now the outcome and welcome the experience of your team and the professor's success in this interesting, relevant and emerging learning direction.\nLabel: ",

because the user’s browser connects directly to it when running activities . Also, modern browsers block access to non-secure resources ( `http` or `ws` ) when the main Moodle site is loaded over a secure connection ( `https` ). This means that if your Moodle server uses `https` , the browser will prevent access to a VPL Jail Server that uses `http` or `ws` . To resolve this, you should configure your VPL Jail Server using a public IP and `https` . This ensures compatibility with browsers’ security requirements and allows proper communication of browsers and the Jail Server.\nComment 2: It worked, thank you very much\nLabel: ",

According to the documentation, the correct way to assign a grade is by echoing a string in the format 'Grade :=>> [value]'. For example, I'm using: `echo \"Grade :=>> 8.33\"` However, when the evaluation runs, the string \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" appears in the output of the evaluation report, but the actual grade for the submission is not being set by VPL. It seems like VPL is not interpreting this line as a grade assignment. Here's an example of the output I'm seeing: \n```text\nGrade\n8.33\n\n\n\nGrade :=>> 8.33\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n (Note: The \"Grade 8.33\" line before \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" is part of my script's output, not the VPL grade assignment itself.) Could anyone please advise on what might be causing this issue? Is there a specific placement for this command in 'vpl_evaluate.sh' (e.g., must it be the very last line of output)? Or are there any other configurations in VPL or Moodle that I need to check to ensure this command is correctly parsed as the final grade? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello, Just a few questions to better understand your issue: What is the result you expect? How do you check that the grade is not actually set submission? The setting \"Automatic grading\" in \"Execution options\" might help (as a first guess). Best regards, Astor\nComment 2: Same problem here, any solutions so far? (Automatic Grading is already on) PS: just did it. Instead of echoing the grade directly, we need to create a script that does that (not sure why): echo \"echo Grade :=>> 8\" > vpl_execution chmod u+x vpl_execution Or if you want to run a python script to make the evaluation: echo \"python3 test.py\" > vpl_execution chmod u+x vpl_execution \"test.py\" must be checked in the \"files to be kept during execution\" page.\nComment 3: Hi, The reason for this is that there are two separate steps for execution: preparation and actual execution. This allows teachers to better customize the way they want to evaluate submissions (such as compiling, cleaning, generating tests, etc.). So yes, you need to create an executable \"vpl_execution\" file, which will then be executed. The latter execution is the one that should echo the grade.\nComment 4: Hi, I have the same issue as Rafael I run a .jar file that returns me a grade so that the vpl can automatically save it on moodle its basically like this: java -jar vic-vpl.jar > output.txt cat output.txt GRADE=$(grep -Eo '[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?' output.txt | tail -n 1) echo \"##vpl:grade $GRADE\" but because of this issue the grades are never sent to moodle, so the user never gets their grade after completing the activity\nComment 5: Hi, As said above, when using custom evaluation mechanisms, echoing the grade directly will not work. You need to create an executable named \"vpl_execution\" that will print the grade in the format \"Grade :=>> XXX\". Best regards,\nAstor\nLabel: ",

One issue I have is that when students include audio in their applications, it causes errors when I run them remotely using VPL. I don't actually need to hear the audio, but students enjoy adding it. Is it possible to install a \"dummy\" audio system on the VPL server ? Would installing something like PulseAudio work for this? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: To answer my question, PulseAudio with a null sink works seamlessly.

This variable allows Node.js to locate global modules, including the `readline-sync` module your script depends on. To address this problem and ensure your JavaScript code executes in VPL, a temporary solution can be implemented until the upcoming VPL release, which will include an automatic configuration of the NODE_PATH variable. Here is an enhanced script for your `vpl_run.sh` file. This script sets up the NODE_PATH variable and prepare the run of your JavaScript code. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n# This file is part of VPL for Moodle - \nhttp://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/\n\n# Script for JavaScript language using NodeJs\n# Copyright (C) 2024 Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino\n# License \nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\n GNU GPL v3 or later\n# Author Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino <jcrodriguez@dis.ulpgc.es>\n\n# @vpl_script_description Using nodejs with the first file\n# load common script and check programs\n. common_script.sh\ncheck_program nodejs\nif [ \"$1\" == \"version\" ] ; then\n    get_program_version -v\nfi\n\nget_first_source_file js\ncat common_script.sh > vpl_execution\n[ \"$(command -pv npm)\" != \"\" ] && (echo \"export NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g)\" >> vpl_execution)\necho \"nodejs \\\"$FIRST_SOURCE_FILE\\\" \\$@\" >> vpl_execution\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n Please apply this script in the \"Execution files\" of your VPL activity and let us know if you encounter any further issues. This workaround should serve well until the next VPL release. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nComment 2: As instructed, I copied the script to vpl_run.sh file and executed the code again, but the same error is showing up: \"Program terminated but unknown reason.\". Is there any log file I can attach that might help? Or any other information I can pass on to you that can help you debug this error. Thanks and regards\nComment 3: Dear Amit Singh, Thank you for your patience and for following the instructions to execute your JavaScript code in the VPL environment. It seems the issue persists despite the script adjustments for the NODE_PATH environment variable. This suggests that there might be another underlying issue at play. You can explore additional debugging steps: Environment Check: Although the provided script should correctly set the NODE_PATH, it's worth manually verifying the environment variables within the jail server to ensure they are set as expected. You can do this by adding debug statements in your `vpl_run.sh` script to print out environment variables to the console. Resource Limits: The issue might also be related to resource limits within the VPL environment. It's possible that the compilation of the evaluation program exceeds the available memory, causing it to terminate. To diagnose this, you can temporarily increase the resource limits for your VPL activity and see if the problem persists. Direct Execution Test: As a more direct test, you can attempt to execute your JavaScript code directly in the jail environment without using the VPL execution scripts. This can help determine if the issue is with the VPL setup or the code itself. To facilitate this, a simple C program like the following can grant you access to the jail command line, enabling you to run the JavaScript code manually and observe any immediate feedback or errors. Set the file with the following code as first file in your submissions. \n```text\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    system(\"/bin/bash\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n Please, attempt these steps and share any findings. Best regards, Juan Carlos\nComment 4: Hi Juan, I'm experiencing this exact same issue both with readline-sync and also prompt-sync npm modules. I've use the pre-vpl-run.sh execution file to include the npm lines for these modules. This made the code work via the Run button, however when I click the Evaluate button it seems to be terminating on a readline.question or prompt. With the line: - Program terminated but unknown reason. I've tried your script in the vpl-run.sh. But to no luck. I'm not sure how to check for the NODE_PATH variable. I've upgraded to the latest VPL-Jail-System 4.0.3. Could these libraries be using the Stdin and once used be sending a program termination which VPL-Jail-System is detecting as the end of the program? Steve\nComment 5: Dear Amit Singh and Steve Wentworth,\nComment 6: Dear Steve, Using pre_vpl_run.sh to install the required Node.js packages during each execution or evaluation is possible, but it tends to be time-consuming and not always reliable. A more effective approach is to install the necessary packages globally on the execution server. This ensures they are readily available without repeated installations. Regarding the issue with asynchronous input/output, you're right—Node.js and some of its packages can take full control of the terminal, which can interfere with VPL’s evaluator and cause unexpected behavior. After testing several packages that support synchronous input/output, I found that readline-sync works well and integrates properly with the VPL evaluator. I’ve tested it successfully with both VPL version 4.2 and the upcoming version 4.3. I hope this resolves the issue you're facing. Note: Please avoid using the plugin notification feature to ask technical questions, as it does not support threaded communication. Best regards, Juan Carlos Rodríguez\nLabel: ",

The machine is accessible from internet with public ip and fqadn domain name . I have setted vpl to listen on port 8443 https and 8080 http and i have created let's emcrypt certificate.I have setted  url path adn so i have configurated moodle with url. My moodle website it is on shared hosting  and the version it is 4.4. i have flaged in vpl moodle plugin to accept self signed certificate. On vps the firewall is disabled and dthe firewall directive is setted to 0. Now i have write a simple vpl task in python..like the sum of two number. When it exceute the task moodle replay that connection have gone in timeout. In the client beowser utl http:// server :8282/OK respond OK. Where is the problem ? thank you\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Giuseppe, Thanks for your message. I understand that when you mention \"I have set VPL to listen on port 8443 HTTPS and 8080 HTTP\", you are referring to the VPL Jail System . Just to clarify, installing the VPL Jail System on a VPS is not the most typical setup. If accessing `http://server:8282/OK` returns “OK”, then the VPL Jail System is likely running correctly. However, there may be a small typo: based on your earlier message, I believe the correct port should be `8080` , not `8282` . Assuming your Moodle site is using the default ports (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS), here are a few key points and recommendations to help you troubleshoot the timeout issue: Checklist to verify configuration Verify the ports Double-check the port numbers you’ve configured, both in the VPL Jail System and in the Moodle VPL plugin. Use full external URL In the Moodle VPL plugin configuration, ensure you're using the full external URL (e.g., `https://your-domain:8443` ). Do not use `localhost` here, note that this URL is send to the browser to access the VPL-Jail-System. Check HTTPS functionality Make sure you can access `https://your-domain:8443/OK` . This will confirm that the VPL Jail System is properly serving over HTTPS. URLPATH security It is highly recommended to configure the `URLPATH` parameter in the VPL Jail System. This adds a layer of security by ensuring only authorized Moodle servers can access it. Self-signed certificate setting Since you are using a valid Let's Encrypt certificate, the \"accept self-signed certificates\" option in the Moodle plugin should be disabled . Reverse proxy and WebSocket support If you're using a reverse proxy to expose the VPL Jail System, ensure it supports WebSocket connections . Note that the `/OK` endpoint does not use WebSockets, so its success does not guarantee that task execution will work properly. Remove unnecessary HTTP port If you're not using HTTP on port 8080, consider disabling it to reduce attack surface and potential misconfiguration. Let me know if you continue to experience issues after these checks. We’ll be happy to help further. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nComment 2: Hi, Thank you >>I understand that when you mention \"I have set VPL to listen on port 8443 HTTPS and 8080 >>HTTP\", you are referring to the VPL Jail System. Just to clarify, installing the VPL Jail System on >>a VPS is not the most typical setup. I refer to vpl- jail server\nComment 3: Hi, i have solved ! My shared host block all outgoing port for secure reason. Now i use 443 and jail-server-vpl reply to my request. I have only a question ? When i try to set urlpath = secret and restart jail-vpl-system and try to reach from moodle on my https://domain.example/secret the connection failed. This problem it's present via browser too when i lanche the test page https://doamin.exaple/secret/OK . Why ? Thank you\nComment 4: Hi Giuseppe, I'm glad to hear you were able to identify and resolve the issue related to blocked outgoing ports. Regarding your question about `URLPATH` , please try setting it with a slash like this in your VPL Jail System configuration: \n```text\nURLPATH=/secret\n```\n Please note that the correct test URL should be: \n```text\nhttps://domain.example/OK\n```\n Accessing: \n```text\nhttps://domain.example/secret/OK\n```\n will return a 404 error because `/OK` is only available at the root path ( `/` ). The `/secret` path is used internally for execution requests and does not expose the `/OK` endpoint. If you want to verify that the Jail System is using the configured `URLPATH` , you'll need to test with an actual execution request from Moodle, not by accessing `/OK` through the browser.

Reading a file works, but writing to file unfortunately not. I've tried with additional file in \"execution files\" and with additional file in activity, none of it works. Is there a way to write to file during running a program? Whole activity can be seen in VPL demo site for teachers (Topic 3/pars) FileManager::FileManager() { input_path = \"data_in.txt\"; output_path = \"data_out.txt\"; if (!open_file(in_file, input_path, std::ios_base::in)) std::cout << \"error with opening input file!\" << std::endl; if (!open_file(out_file, output_path, std::ios_base::out)) std::cout << \"error with opening output file!\" << std::endl; } void FileManager::write_file(std::vector<uint16_t>& input) { if (!out_file.is_open()) return; for (auto& i : input) { out_file << i << std::endl; } }\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Karolina, VPL uses a sandbox environment. Files do get written, however, after the execution stops, the files created are deleted.\nComment 2: Dear Karolina Suliga, Thank you for your question. VPL is a flexible system that can be adapted to many different approaches. While the default Basic Input/Output Test Evaluation System does not directly check the content of files, you can use the “program to run” and “program arguments” options to execute custom commands that do. I’ve reviewed the “pars” activity on the demo server and have a few suggestions that might help: Preventing Students from Modifying Header Files: If you want to ensure students don’t change the provided header files, include those headers in both the Requested Files and the Execution Files . In the VPL editor, these will appear as read-only, and during execution, only the versions from Execution Files will be used — giving you full control. Writing to and Checking File Contents: It seems you were close to a working solution. I’ve corrected and improved the execution scripts on the demo server. The activity should now correctly check the contents of the output file. I recommend adding a few more test cases with different file content outputs to thoroughly assess student solutions. Best regards, Juan Carlos P.S.: I’ve uploaded the corrected execution files here to ensure their content is preserved\nComment 3: Thank you very much!\nLabel: ",

Just checking whether it is the VPL, which introduced this service? The server is Ubuntu 22.04. The Jail System is 4.0.3.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Visvanath, No, the VPL Jail System does not require the `multipathd.service` . However, you can use it if your system setup benefits from it. The `multipathd.service` is typically used in enterprise environments to provide redundancy and high availability for storage devices. Unless you have a specific need for that kind of setup, it's safe to disable the service. Also, I recommend updating your VPL Jail system to version 4.0.4, which includes various improvements and fixes.

I am wondering if there were some people involved who were good at the human/management side of things, e.g. negotiating, collaborating, compromise and all the intangable \"leadershippy\" stuff that can make so much difference.\nComment 2: Yes, it was a highlight. A slow one to develop, leading to a big-bang, the competition night. And why it made off the ground, so elegantly? I have to be careful in selecting a single party. Instead I would say there was a series of lucky chances. The don who was in-charge of the operation took the trouble to visit the long series of workshops on conducting on-line tests with Moodle, although they were using the quiz module for years. That is where VPL came in, thanks to the workshop Astor, developer of the VPL question, conducted. The don recognized the freedom and ownership of data of the Open Source solution (VPL + Moodle). Before we realized, LEARN the umbrella organization and the player EduNET, which is everywhere, were providing the resources resp. expertise. The write-up has the details. So from the management side, it was the consistency of the don who held the reins.\nComment 3: Dear Visvanath Ratnaweera, Thank you for your kind words. Public recognition of the often behind-the-scenes effort truly helps fuel the motivation to continue supporting the teaching and learning of programming worldwide. It's a pleasure to see VPL being part of such meaningful initiatives, and I’m glad it could contribute to the success of UoJCoders v3.0. Warm regards, Juan Carlos\nLabel: ",

Changed: echo \"sqlite3 $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution To: echo \"sqlite3 $DBFILE < \\\"$FILENAME\\\"\" >> vpl_execution # Ensure non-interactive execution This ensures that when .sql files are added to the execution script, they are passed to sqlite3 non-interactively.\nComment 2: Dear Garth Brady, Thank you for reporting this issue and for your investigation into its cause. For many years, the run of `sql_run.sh` execution script for SQLite3 generate a code to go in interactive mode showing the software version. However, it seems that now also shows the version when VPL is evaluating the student code. Upcoming Fix: In the next VPL release, we plan to modify the sql_run.sh script to suppress the SQLite3 version output when in the evaluation process. Workaround: In the meantime, to resolve the problem, you can customize your `vpl_run.sh` (based on `sql_run.sh` from the VPL source) . For example, modify the code block that checks for batch mode. Instead of: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n    echo \"sqlite3 $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n you can change it to: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   if [ -f vpl_evaluate.sh ]; then\n       BATCHOPTION=\"-batch\"\n   fi\n   echo \"sqlite3 $BATCHOPTION $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n If you wish to avoid going in interactive mode of SQLite3 when running use: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   echo \"sqlite3 -batch $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n Thanks again for your valuable feedback. Please let us know if you have any further questions or suggestions. Best regards, Juan Carlos\nComment 3: Thanks very much! I should have read through sql_run.sh more thoroughly!\nLabel: ",

Like PHP. How about running maven project with tomcat plugin ... is that possible ?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello Rajasekaran, VPL does not currently provide out-of-the-box support for Servlets or JSP . However, because VPL can be configured to manage different runtime environments (e.g., text terminal, GUI, or web applications), it’s theoretically possible to adapt it for Tomcat-based web applications. If you have experience with Tomcat, you can use the existing PHP run script as a starting point and modify it to launch Tomcat (or another Java web server ) within the VPL environment. This approach may also involve adding Maven (for dependencies) and the Tomcat plugin to manage deployment. Keep in mind that configuring a servlet/JSP environment in VPL requires additional resources and significant setup time. If you decide to pursue this route, you will need to : Install Tomcat (or another web server), Maven, etc. in the VPL execution server. Customize a run script to compile your project (using Maven, if desired) and start Tomcat. Configure ports as the PHP script does. This is definitely an advanced use case and may require considerable effort, but it can be a viable solution. If you do try it, your feedback or any shared scripts would be valuable to the community. Best regards.\nComment 2: Thank You Juan, Let me have a try\nLabel: ",

I get custom evaluation working, I get auto grading with riget vpl_evaluate.cases working, but not both. As soon as I try to write my own vpl_evaluate.sh and even vpl_evaluate.py, I can write things like echo \"Grade :=>> 100\" echo \"Grade :=>> 100\" echo \"Grade :=>> 100\" as much as I want, it is not autograded. I use a second Moodle account as a student to check it. So, could someone please provide the simplest vpl_evaluate.sh and (would be nice) a vpl_evaluate.py to redirect (since I much more fluent at Python then Bash) to demonstrate this? The cpp to check might be students_file.cpp with a main() and a print out of sqrt(16) if that matters. Best regards Johannes\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Here's one provided to me a while back. It points to vpl_evaluate.sh (which I reference as an example below). There's no custom grading here, but I use php to generate randomized test case data and it works great: #!/bin/bash # $Id: php_run.sh,v 1.3 2012-09-24 15:13:21 juanca Exp $ # Default PHP language run script for VPL # Copyright (C) 2012 Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino # License http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU GPL v3 or later # Author Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino #load common script and check programs . common_script.sh\nComment 2: Hello, Here is a VERY simple setup: vpl_evaluate.sh: \n```text\n# vpl_execution only executes our python script\necho \"python vpl_evaluate.py\" > vpl_execution\nchmod u+x vpl_execution\n```\n vpl_evaluate.py: \n```text\n# Here there is only the grade but obviously you would do other things\nprint(\"Grade :=>> 100\")\n```\n For this minimal example to work, remember to check \"vpl_evaluate.py\" in \"Files to keep when running\". Also, if you want the grade to be effective in gradebook, please set \"Automatic grade\" to \"Yes\" in \"Execution options\" menu. Best regards, Astor\nComment 3: Dear Astor, thanks a lot, that actually works (Just a nuance: The command must be echo \"python3 vpl_evaluate.py\" > vpl_execution ) I am not quite clear why vpl_evaluate.py must be in \"Files to keep when running\". Best regards Johannes\nComment 4: Dear Garth, thanks a lot for your sample. Unfortunately, I have a hard time understanding it since I am poor at Bash (and even at PHP for that sake). Also, you seem to rely on evaluate.cases which you didn't provide. Furthermore, your sample implies that you have more stuff like common_script.sh and *all its dependencies*. At least, I don't have the dependencies, and your script emits an error or a warning stating that there should be END_OF_PHP not END_OF. Best regards Johannes Best regards\nComment 5: Basically, vpl_evaluate.sh is first executed and its goal is to produce an executable named `vpl_execution` . At this point, every execution files and submitted files are available. Then the VPL clears all execution files from the environment, and executes the `vpl_execution` file. At this point, in the environment, you would find submitted files, `vpl_execution` , `common_script.sh` , and any file generated by the first phase. If you need an execution file to be present during this second execution phase, you need to check it in the \"Files to keep when running\" menu. Here I suggest this because python is interpreted, but for a compiled language, you would typically compile your `vpl_evaluate.xxx` then you can freely use the generated executable. Or even better name that executable directly `vpl_execution` !\nLabel: ",

I am working with a vpl_evaluate.sh file that evaluates my students by checking that an html page is correctly written and other proposed tests. Is there a way to access the evaluation attempts? Let's say that if a student after two failed attempts is deducted 10 points. I am using a file to count the number of evaluations and updating it after an evaluation attempt but in each evaluation it is deleted and keeps the same value. How can I deal with this? Any feedback will be helpful.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello, You can use built-in feature in VPL to reduce the grade at every automatic evaluation, with a custom number of \"free\" evaluations to begin with.\nYou can find it in Settings under the \"Grade\" section. See \"Reduction by automatic evaluation\" and \"Free evaluations\" field.\nComment 2: Hi, thanks. When you apply the automatic evaluation reduction, is there a way to access the number of evaluations that the student has carried out to determine their grade in the vpl_evaluate.sh file or how do I apply the grading features in my vpl_evaluate.sh file? Could you show me an example?\nComment 3: Dear Jonathan Córdoba, The grade penalization applies to the evaluator's (whether human or automatic) final mark. If you're looking for a way to track the number of evaluation attempts within your vpl_evaluate.sh script, VPL provides built-in grading features that might help. You can configure \"Reduction by automatic evaluation\" and set a number of \"Free evaluations\" in the activity settings. For more details, please refer to the documentation: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/basicfeatures.html#grade Best regards, Juan Carlos\nLabel: ",

It seems awfully short sighted to allow arbitrary code execution open to the entire internet. Short of whitelisting VPL Users at an external firewall is there really no easy way to secure this?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Jacob, to secure VPL execution servers and prevent external access, you can: Use HTTPS with the appropriate certificates. Configure the `URLPATH` parameter in the execution servers. This acts as a secret key only known to the administrator, ensuring that only requests with the correct `URLPATH` are served. Set the `TASK_ONLY_FROM` parameter, which allows you to define a whitelist of IP addresses without relying on an external firewall. You can find detailed instructions on implementing these security measures at VPL Documentation - Security Parameters .\nComment 2: Using the URLPath is an ok solution its not great as there are tons of indexers which get data from plugins on browsers so it wouldnt take long for it to leak. Thanks for the assistance. You should probably mention this more clearly in the documentation as I checked and found over 900 servers which are accessible from the internet which have been indexed with the VPL Favicon which dont have passwords. I imagine most of these server owners arent even aware of this being an issue insecure by default isnt a great configuration :/\nComment 3: Dear Jacob, The `URLPATH` configuration parameter is solely utilized during the execution task requests between the Moodle server and the execution server. This “password” is neither required nor accessible from the user's browser in any form. Communication between the user's browser and the execution server is protected through single-use tickets generated by the execution server for each execution. The concerns about data leakage from browser plugins or indexers do not apply to URLPATH, as it is never exposed outside the server-to-server communication. It is important to base security discussions on a clear understanding of how these mechanisms work. If you have further technical questions or need clarifications, feel free to reach out. Best regards, Juan Carlos\nComment 4: I wish the port which was used by this service for websockets could be separated from the port for task submission because without auditing the code base we are blindly trusting there are no exploits possible on a server which by design allows code execution. We solved this by using NGINX to prevent anyone from connecting to the task submission URL_PATH. But I think the issue still stands that there are over 900 servers which I can execute arbitrary code on the internet right now at this very second due to the insecure by default configuration. At a minimum requiring the user to set a URLPATH would resolve this issue I can provide the list here but it isnt difficult to find by just using any service which indexes favicons.\nComment 5: I don't see a clear advantage in using separate ports for task requests and WebSocket connections. WebSocket connections are secured using HTTPS and switch to WebSocket protocols, ensuring robust encryption. Additionally, many organizations aim to minimize the number of open ports to streamline security management. Regarding your concern about system administrators potentially being unaware of the risks of omitting the `URLPATH` parameter, future releases of VPL will address this. We will introduce warnings in the execution server startup process and in the VPL plugin's execution server checks. These warnings will explicitly highlight the risks of not using `URLPATH` and strongly recommend its configuration to enhance security.\nLabel: ",

Is there an option to cleanup previous submissions. The inode count on our server is hitting the max limits.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Mubeen, Thank you for reaching out regarding the issue of large file storage caused by previous submissions in VPL. Addressing this concern is on our TODO list, and we have planned different approaches to resolve it effectively. These include: Generating a zip file for each submission. Creating a single zip file containing old submissions for cleanup. While these features are under development, you can try the following interim solutions: Adjust the \"Discard Submission Period\": In the plugin's global settings, increase the \"Discard Submission Period\" from the default value of 1 minute. This change can help manage submission retention. Perform a Backup and Restore: (risky) As a more involved solution, perform a backup of the course (including users and activities ) and then restore it. This action will remove all submissions except the most recent ones. These steps should help mitigate the issue until the planned features are implemented. Best regards, Juan Carlos\nComment 2: Thank you for the update and for outlining the planned approaches. I have increased \"Discard Submission Period\" to 4 minutes. I am uncertain about performing a full backup and restore due to the large number of courses involved. Is there a way to automate the process by generating a list of old files and subsequently removing both the files and their corresponding database entries using a script? Regards, Mubeen\nLabel: ",

Not saved: Execution server was silent - no message received When I try the test I can successfully run my code, but after submitting it I get the same error message and no grade. I tried debugging with mitmproxy and I can see that in both cases no attempt was made to contact the VPL jail server. Is this a configuration issue on my part? What should I check next? Software versions: VPL 4.2.4 VPL Question 2.0.0 VPL Jail server 4.0.3 (running in debian 12 LXC container) Moodle 4.4.1+ (20240620) PHP 8.3.8\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello and sorry for the long response delay. I was not working on VPL Questions at the time and did not see an obvious answer so I postponed it. I missed at the time a detail that I think is the problem. The error message you get says \"Not saved\", which means that the VPL Question failed to submit the code to the VPL activity (thus not even trying to execute it). The most probable cause I can see is that you did not set the \"Maximum number of files\" to a sufficient number in VPL settings > Submission restrictions. Try to set it to at least (number of required files + number of execution files). Please let me know if this fixes the issue. Sorry again for the wait! Best regards,\nAstor\nComment 2: Hi, I'm trying to create a simple JS question like \"Create an isOdd function\" so that shouldn't need more files, but anyways I set the limit to 10 and the same problem persists. I enabled dev debug logging on the page and managed to get this output after trying to save with validation enabled: \n```text\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$templatelang is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$templatecontext is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$answertemplate is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$teachercorrection is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$validateonsave is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$execfiles is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$precheckpreference is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$precheckexecfiles is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nDeprecated: Creation of dynamic property qtype_vplquestion_question::$gradingmethod is deprecated in /var/www/moodle/question/type/questiontypebase.php on line 1022\n\nWarning: Undefined array key 0 in /var/www/moodle/question/type/vplquestion/locallib.php on line 57\n```\n Not sure if this helps, but this is all I could find.\nComment 3: This sure helps, thank you. What I understand regarding the last line is that your VPL does not have any required/requested file. Try to create one requested file on the VPL activity then try again. If there was previously a requested file or if the problem persists, it might come from the fact that you are using Moodle 4.4 and I only tested VPL Questions up to Moodle 4.3. I will check the compatiblity and issue a fix if needed soon.\nComment 4: In my first attempts I had a requested file, however in the last one I didn't, but after adding it I now get a different error: \"-No test case found\" but I have a case defined in the question.\nComment 5: In that case, I see two possible causes: - either you lack test cases in vpl_evaluate.cases in the question form, - either you lack the execution file pre_vpl_run.sh with contents as specified on the plugin page .\nComment 6: Looks like it's the second. I assumed it's pnp and honestly I never thought of reading the whole plugin page. Now it works as excepted, although simple programs sometimes return OOM with a 128MiB limit, but that's probably a VPL issue. Thanks for the help.\nLabel: ",

I tried following this guide . I both set the vpl-jail-system server in Moodle with the subfolder path and without it. But it both failed with no HTTP response neither 404 error.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear wz, I believe that the current URL schema used to interact with the VPL Jail Server does not support the use of subfolder paths when placed behind an reverse proxy. This limitation is due to the way the VPL Jail Server URLs are structured. While this could be addressed in the future to provide more flexibility in how the VPL Jail Server is configured, it is not a high priority at the moment. For a workaround, I recommend using an alias name for the Nginx server instead of a subfolder. The alias name can redirect requests to the VPL Jail Server, allowing you to place the VPL jail server machine (with other name and IP) behind the Nginx server while keeping the current URL schema intact.

I am very fascinated about your VPL Jail Server Projects and its features. We have been recently moved to MOODLE LMS system. And we are using VPL for programming practices. We are having 3000+ users. Under normal circumstance VPL is responding good if more number of users using we find VPL is bit slow. So we decided to put more horizontally scale based on no of users. For that i have personally testing VPL docker images especially ubuntu-full. Everything works fine if i created as separate docker container in a separate VM and accessed through common physical router. But when i tried to run moodle and vpl containers in same machine and connect with docker network it is not working. In console i am getting ws (web socket) error. Please advice on this i have tried in many ways but the result is same. Dr.Rajasekaran\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dr. S. Rajasekaran, Thank you for sharing your experience with VPL. Details are important for understanding the behavior and performance of VPL. Could you please indicate if you have tested adding more Jail servers to your Moodle server to resolve the performance issues and what resources (especially RAM) the machines you added have available? Using one machine for both the Moodle server and the Jail Server may raise some inconveniences. You must limit the resources available for the Jail Server to avoid slowing down Moodle when the jail server gets very bussy. From your statement, “I tried to run Moodle and VPL containers on the same machine and connect with Docker network,” I understand that you are trying to expose only the Moodle server to the internet. Note that, as indicated in the manual, the Jail Server must also be exposed to the internet (see the third requirement). Documentation on VPL Jail System Requirements To run both servers on the same machine, you may use two names or different ports for the same machine. The first approach requires proper configuration of a reverse proxy using Nginx or Apache , for example. Remember to set the correct URL (reachable from the internet) for the jail server in the VPL plugin configuration. Note that if you use localhost or the localhost IP (127.X:X:X) for your jail server it will only be available from a browser on that machine. If you are trying to build a Load Balancer, please read the following documentation: Load Balancer Documentation Additionally, be aware that modern browsers reject non-secure requests (HTTP or WS) from secure pages (HTTPS). Kind regards, Ph.D. Juan Carlos Rodriguez\nComment 2: In running both Moodle and VPL on the same we too had to bite hard. Can't remember the details but they are documented here: Securing vpl-jail-system on a production >LAMP server .\nLabel: ",

I have installed it globally on the JAIL server and modified the javascript_run.sh script to link to the module. Due to permissions, it cannot access the module. However, it works fine if I copy the whole node_modules folder into the execution directory at run time. This seems unnecessary and repetitive when it is being used multiple times and by many users. So, basically, is there a shared directory which all users can access during execution where I can put the module files? Or if I create one, what ownership and permissions would it need? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Nevermind - I figured it out! It was some weird permissions on my system.\nLabel: ",

But VPL says it fails the test and the output does not match. Here is the case at vpl_cases: Case = Teste 1: input = 3 !Boa vontade em terra de homens de paz! Paz na terra aos homens de boa vontade! 7 output = /Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa \\(1-7\\) : Digite um texto com ateh 1000 letras:\\nSequencia numetrica com codigos das 16 palavras:\\n *63  *720  *45  *386  *9  *263  *9  *871  *871  *51  *386  *161  *263  *9  *63  *720 *\\nSelecione a funcionalidade f do programa \\(1-7\\) : Tchau\\./ And here is what VPL says after the evaluation: Test 7: Teste 1: Incorrect program output --- Input --- \n```text\n 3 \n!Boa vontade em terra de homens de paz!

I need to use backslash before the parenthesis. This is a question about the option that VPL has to match a regex. And my problem is that the regex matches but the plugin says it does not.\nComment 5: Hi Bruna, It seems like the issue is related to the use of the backslash \"\\\" in your regex. In programming laguages strings, the backslash is used as an escape character to represent special characters in a string, such as \"\\n\" for newline and \"\\t\" for tab. When using regex, backslashes are also used to escape special regex characters to treat them as literal characters, for example, \"\\.\" to match a dot instead of any character. However, in VPL regex, the first use of the backslash (for special characters like \"\\n\") is not implemented. So, if you want to represent a newline, you should directly write the newline character in the editor instead of using \"\\n\". Please try replacing your \"\\n\" with an actual newline character in your expressions. Note that the \"output=\" option in VPL allows for multilines. Additionally, using regex can sometimes be complex and may require external tools to identify discrepancies. Simplifying the expected output of student's code, using simpler regex patterns or other types of expected output as numbers or text may ease the process of writing test cases and improve readability.\nComment 6: Hi, Thanks for the response, I tried using the newline and removing all special characters to avoid using backslash, but it still did not work: --- Input --- 3 !Boa vontade em terra de homens de paz! Paz na terra aos homens de boa vontade! 7 --- Program output --- Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa 1-7: Digite um texto com ateh 1000 letras: Sequencia numetrica com codigos das 16 palavras: 63 720 45 386 9 263 9 871 871 51 386 161 263 9 63 720 Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa 1-7: Tchau --- Expected output (regular expression)--- Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa 1-7: Digite um texto com ateh 1000 letras: Sequencia numetrica com codigos das 16 palavras: *63 *720 *45 *386 *9 *263 *9 *871 *871 *51 *386 *161 *263 *9 *63 *720 * Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa 1-7: Tchau I understand it would be easier to simplify the expected output, but I am only the TA... Is there something I can do to fix this?\nComment 7: This test case definition works for me with a program that output the same that your first post program output: \n```text\nCase = Teste 1:\ninput = 3 \n!Boa vontade em terra de homens de paz! Paz na terra aos homens de boa vontade!\n7S\n\noutput= /Selecione a funcionalidade f do programa \n\\(1-7\\)\n: Digite um texto com ateh 1000 letras:\nSequencia numetrica com codigos das 16 palavras:\n *63 *720 *45 *386 *9 *263 *9 *871 *871 *51 *386 *161 *263 *9 *63 *720 *\nSelecione a funcionalidade f do programa \n\\(1-7\\)\n: Tchau\\./\n```\nComment 8: Weird. Here for me it does not work. I managed to solve the problem changing the expected output... But thanks a lot, it is really useful to know that the first use of the backslash (for special characters like \"\\n\") is not implemented. Best, Bruna\nComment 9: Dear Bruna, Of course, you must use \"\\\" to escape any special meaning char in regex as \".\", \"(\", etc., but you should not use \"\\\" for common non-printable characters like newline, carriage return, tab, etc. For these characters in VPL, you must use the actual character and not the common escape sequence used in programming language literal strings. I wrote the VPL regex this way, and it works for your case. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nLabel: ",

We enable access to Moodle from a very restricted testing environment, but it would be ideal if VPL wouldn't allow access to external network.  This may be able to be done with regular firewall rules on the VPL execution server , but it would be ideal if this was something that could be turned off or on by faculty, and I suspect the default option should be off. Thanks! Jason.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Jason, The feature you describe would indeed be useful, but currently, it is not available in VPL. To achieve the desired restriction, I suggest having two jail servers: one with external access restrictions and another without. This way, teachers can select the appropriate server based on their requirements. To simplify configurations, the \"base on\" feature in VPL can be utilized to streamline the setup process.\nComment 2: Hi Juan Carlos, Is there somewhere I could suggest this feature to be added as a future add-on to VPL or is it perhaps something you will consider? Do you have some recommendation/guidance for firewall rules that I could apply which would restrict access to the network, but not interfere with accessing the execution server? I understand that communication between the Moodle server and the execution server needs to be open, and communication between the execution server and the user needs to be open, but what ports can I limit? Thanks! Jason.\nComment 3: I did end up making this solution work via firewall rules. For the time, I restrict access to external network on my general execution server, but in the future, I will add another execution server if necessary, or if you implement this functionality in the general tool it would be great. I'm concerned that if I have multiple VPL servers, faculty may use the wrong one, opening up a hole in their test that they are not aware of. Jason.\nLabel: ",

In the VPL, there is no distinction between draft and final submissions. A student can upload or modify their work as many times as they want until the due date, including versions that have already been assessed. Before the due date, students can continue to modify their submissions. Typically, teachers assess the student's work after the due date. If a student has uploaded a submission by mistake, they can still modify or replace it before the due date without needing any additional permissions.

I have been trying using index.php as my script. It opens a browser session (not ideal, but I can probably live with it). However, I get \"The requested resource `'/'` was not found on this server \" in the browser. What else do I need to do? Is there any documentation specifically on testing PHP using VPL? Thanks, Mark Stern\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I use php all the time with vpl.  What are you specifically trying to achieve? ie. <?php echo ‘test’; should not launch a browser instance but return the normal input, output and expected output that vpl normally generates when running test cases.\nComment 2: OK, I tried that simple test and it worked. So I guess I have to gradually make it more complicated until it breaks. However, it is still using a browser. Maybe if I do auto-grading (which I plan to do, but I have not got there yet) the browser will disappear.\nComment 3: I have made progress. It is no longer using a browser. My current problem is that it is running the wrong script. It is running the student's script. The student's script defines a class. I want it to run my own script that instantiates that class and runs methods. I can do that by invoking it in vpl_run.sh, but if I do that I do not get the arguments passed from vpl_evaluate_cases using \"Program arguments =\". Is there a way to do this?\nComment 4: Dear Mark Stern, To clarify when a browser appears or not while using PHP with VPL: If the student's code or your code includes an `index.php` file, the system assumes you are using a PHP web application. In this case, it will attempt to open a browser. Otherwise, the system will run the PHP CLI, executing the first student's file. For more details, you can refer to the default PHP run script available at the following link: default PHP run script . If you want to change this behavior, you need to create your own `vpl_run.sh` script. Note that you can detect if you are running in an evaluation action by checking for the presence of the `vpl_evaluate.sh` file. Remember to select the PHP files in the “Files to keep when running” section. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nLabel: ",

Of course, I cannot grade the plots automatically, but I do want the code of each student to run automatically and show the plot, so that when I grade manually, I see the plot next to the code. It it possible with VPL? How would you achieve this?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Here is the solution I tried: * I created two \"requested files\": the first is a Python file (called compare.py) where the students should fill in their code; the second is an empty image file (called comparison.png). * In the Python code, the last line is `plt.savefig(comparison.png)`, which is the command that saves the current plot to the file comparison.png. I tried it as a student, but it did not work: I did not see the file \"comparison.png\" appear. What is the right way?\nComment 2: Hi, This solution would not work, as it saves the image on the execution server . When the process ends, the files are deleted from the server. At no point does the file come back to the Moodle server. If you are only evaluating the plot, you may use VPL to let your students program it, then grade an Assignment activity where students submit a screenshot of their plot, for example.\nComment 3: I want to evaluate both the code and the plot. If I have two requested files, as I did (a Python file and a PNG file), can students simply upload their PNG file as part of their VPL submission, so that I can see the picture along the code?\nComment 4: But then, how do I know that the picture they upload is really the one generated by their program? Isn't there a way to run their program \"on the spot\" and immediately see the generated picture?\nComment 5: You can make the execution show a graphic output by using vpl_wexecution instead of vpl_execution in execution files (see https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/advancedfeatures.html#execution-files ) Executing students code will show up the generated plot.\nComment 6: Thanks a lot! To give more detail to future readers, here is what I did (maybe there is a simpler way to do it?): 1. Opened the Additional Options -> Execution files. 2. Copied the default python code from here https://github.com/jcrodriguez-dis/moodle-mod_vpl/blob/master/jail/default_scripts/python-3_run.sh into the `run.sh` file. 3. Changed the last lines to automatically rename the file to vpl_wexecution: ``` . common_script.sh check_program python3 if [ \"$1\" == \"version\" ] ; then get_program_version --version fi get_first_source_file py cat common_script.sh > vpl_execution echo \"export TERM=ansi\" >>vpl_execution echo \"python3 \\\"$FIRST_SOURCE_FILE\\\" \\$@\" >>vpl_execution chmod +x vpl_execution get_source_files py IFS=$'\\n' mv vpl_execution vpl_wexecution IFS=$SIFS ```\nLabel: ",

Second, I got a hell of time to put the SSL certificate to function. The non secure host / OK was working fine but the SSL  host / OK was given a not secure error. I tried to copy the etc/letsencrypt .pem files to the respective correct names on the etc/vpl, however, it did not work. Later I verified that the size of the copied files were way smaller than the original ones and instead of copying the files, I just put the link of the pem files inside the vpl jail server conf files and it started to work just fine.

Is there a way to upgrade it to version 18 or 20 which is compatible with with npm 10.4.0? This issue stems from the error I'm currently facing. \n```text\nERROR: npm v10.4.0 is known not to run on Node.js v10.19.0. This version of npm supports the following node versions: `^18.17.0 || >=20.5.0`. You can find the latest version at \nhttps://nodejs.org/\n.\n```\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Amit Singh, It's important to note that the jail server installer typically installs, using the local package manager, the latest versions of development software stock available in the Linux distribution you are using. This include npm, used, and nodejs. However, you have the flexibility to use any version of the development software on your jail server. The key limitation is ensuring that the command line interface of the software version you choose is compatible with the scripts used by the VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) plugin. Specifically regarding your query, the npm command is utilized by the jail server installer exclusively for installing Node.js packages. Meanwhile, the Node.js command is employed by the VPL plugin's JavaScript runner. Both commands rely on straightforward command line interfaces, which means you should encounter no issues when updating or downgrading these pieces of software. Regarding updating Node.js to a version that is compatible with npm 10.4.0, as you've described the requirement ^18.17.0 || >=20.5.0, it can be accomplished in the usual manner and with the standard precautions associated with software updates. Please note, this process is independent of the VPL jail server's specific considerations.\nLabel: ",

Here is a quick example: \n```text\n#################################################################\n\n\n# caesar.py for XY\n\n\n# by PQ, 16 February 2024\n\n\n# Last changed: 29 February 2024\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Copy this code, go to Edit and submit it, Save and Run\n\n\n# You encrypt with positive shift.

My problem is to make sure that they've run the program at least once. For that I made this test case: \n```text\ncase = Case 1\n\n\ninput = 'ABCD'\n\n\n3\n\n\noutput = 'DEFG'\n```\n But that test always fails! It should be the opposite: always pass.

These connections originate from the user's browser. The error message \"Http(s) Unsupported METHOD CONNECT\" indicates that either your browser or a proxy in your network is attempting to send a CONNECT method request to the Jail server. The CONNECT method is typically used by proxies but doesn't make sense for the Jail server. To resolve this issue, consider the following steps: Verify your network configuration: Ensure that there are no misconfigured proxies in your network that might be causing this issue. Use a full transparent proxy: If necessary, set up a transparent proxy that doesn't interfere with WebSocket connections. Direct connection to the Jail server: If feasible, try connecting directly to the Jail server without any intermediate proxies to see if the issue persists. I hope this helps you diagnose and resolve the problem effectively. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos.\nLabel: ",

The evaluation script will provide specific inputs and the expected outputs from those inputs. I think what I need to do is modify the vpl_run.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh scripts to get input from a file. However, the default files are empty - empty seems to mean \"use the default\", but I cannot see the default to modify it. So: What are the defaults? Is there a better way of doing it? Thanks, Mark Stern\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Correction - I do not think I need to change vpl_run.sh.\nComment 2: To evaluate Java exercises with specific inputs and expected outputs, you can utilize the `vpl_evaluate.cases` feature. This approach allows you to assess the program's input and output independently of the programming language used. It eliminates the need to modify the `vpl_run.sh` or `vpl_evaluate.sh` scripts files. For detailed information on how to set up evaluation cases using `vpl_evaluate.cases` , you can refer to the documentation at the following link: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nLabel: ",

We are testing a VPL environment and the professor who is testing it is getting the following error: Jail:\nout of memory (1024MiB) I made changes in MAXMEMORY to 5, 10GB (and restarted vpl service) and the professor reports that he can still only choose up to 1GB in the advanced settings. Just wondering if 1GB memory is hard limit, and if not, how can we extend it. Than you! Don\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: What kind of script is he running that requires more memory? I run fairly complicated scripts with 128Mb.\nComment 2: In response to your query regarding the maximum memory limit in the VPL environment, it's important to note that there isn't a strict hard limit imposed. However, it's crucial to understand that there are three distinct levels of resource limits to consider: VPL Execution Server Level: The first level of resource limitation is at the VPL execution server. You can configure resource limits at this level, and details on how to do so can be found in the official documentation here: VPL Execution Server Configuration . Moodle Plugin Configuration Level: The second level involves setting resource limits at the Moodle level through plugin configuration. You can explore the necessary configurations in the plugin's global settings. Refer to this link for more information: Moodle Plugin Configuration . VPL Activity Level: Finally, the third level of resource limits is at the VPL activity level within the activity settings. It's important to understand that the most restrictive limit among these three levels will be applied when executing VPL activities . You can find additional details on this level of configuration here: VPL Activity Level Configuration . In summary, while there isn't a fixed hard limit for memory allocation, the resource limits imposed by the three levels mentioned above collectively determine the maximum memory available. To extend this limit, you should carefully adjust these configurations as per your requirements, keeping in mind that the most restrictive setting will take precedence.\nLabel: ",

When clicking the Run button, I want only the currently selected file (the one that is shown to the user) to be executed. Is there any information about this file that can be used in the execution scripts? In the documentation of the environment variables from vpl_environment.sh, I did not find anything promising. Maybe, an environment variable containing the path of the currently selected file could be added in a future version of the VPL plugin? Thanks Kay\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: The capability to execute a specific code file depend on the programming language in use. Detailed information can be found in the language-supported documentation available at VPL Supported Languages . Kindly refer to the \"Build/launch details\" detail of each language. Should the programming language permit, you may designate the initial file for execution by rearranging it to be the first in the editor's file list. Please be advised that the editor interface provides a dedicated button for reordering files. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos\nComment 2: Thank you for the quick response. In my case, I have a VPL with several files containing C source code, e.g. task1.c, task2.c, task3.c etc. Each source file is a task on its own and thus each file contains a main function. Since the standard build / launch script (blank vpl_run.sh) compiles all source files present, the linker complains about multiple definitions of main. The easiest way of interaction for the student would be to see only the currently edited file to be compiled and executed, leaving all other files untouched. Since I use a custom build / launch script, I was thinking about a special environment variable containing the path to this specific source file. Do you think it would be feasible to add such a variable? Best regards Kay Otto\nComment 3: Dear Kay Otto, I understand that in a multiple-file C enviroment, each containing a main function, the standard build/launch script can lead to linker errors due to multiple definitions. Having a special environment variable would facilitate the compilation and execution of only the source file being edited. I am pleased to inform you that it is feasible to add such an environment variable. Your request has been added to our TODO list for consideration in future VPL releases.

My problem is that the files are displayed in the main page of the activity : the page is thus quite slow to load (a few seconds). The IDE is also slow when I want to save a file, it seems that all the files are saved even if only one single file is modified ? Here is my question : how could I solved these slowdown issues ? One solution could be to create my instance files on the fly, but maybe there is a better solution or a configuration that I missed ?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Nicolas BODIN, I appreciate your interest in using VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) for your algorithms and abstract data types course. Thank you for bringing up your concerns regarding the page load speed and file saving behavior. I'd like to address each point: Slow Page Load for Showing Large Files: The delay you are experiencing is due to the system is interpreting unknown file types as code files, thus attempting to render them. Solution for Slow Page Load: To circumvent this issue, you can rename the files with a .bin extension. This will mark the files as binary, and the description page and editor will not attempt to display their content. To add these .bin files to the editor, you can use the drag-and-drop feature or the import functionality. Required vs. Execution Files: You don't necessarily need to add these large files to the \"Required files\" section. Adding them to the \"Execution files\" section and marking them as \"Files to keep when running\" will suffice for your purposes. File Saving Behavior: The editor, by design, saves all the files every time you execute a save command, regardless of whether a single file or multiple files have been modified. I hope this addresses your concerns and assists you in efficiently using VPL for your educational needs. If you have further questions or require additional clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Juan Carlos\nLabel: ",

It is imperative to employ the `end_of_jails` command as last line to ensure that other execution servers are not inadvertently used. Furthermore, I recommend leveraging the \"based on\" feature. This allows you to easily modify configurations by using one as a foundation for all subsequent activities pertaining to the same programming language. For more detailed information, please refer to the following documentation: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/advancedfeatures.html#local-execution-servers and https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/advancedfeatures.html#the-based-on-feature Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nLabel: ",

If they turn off the due date and only use the activity completion settings with an expected completion date, once that date and the conditions have been met, the Overdue no longer appears, but the assignment will show that it is x many days late. This is problematic because one of our professors only accepts fully correct coding problems and docks students .2 for late assignments, so Moodle thinking they are all late is not good, nor is seeing numerous Overdue items every time they open Moodle, despite already submitting.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Please provide the version of Moodle, the VPL plugin and the jailserver.\nComment 2: Dear Kristi Burch, This issue has been resolved in the version 4.2 of VPL.

The description will be a link to the VPL assignment (which will not be graded).\nComment 2: Why use VPL at all for this? I would use a regular Moodle assignment where I describe in detail what I'm expecting from my students, a screenshot of what the webpage should look like, and a rubric to match. After the deadline, I'd ' Download All' and manually assess them using the rubric (shouldn't take long).\nComment 3: Why use VPL at all for this? Because it gives a more pleasant experience for the students. They can create their files in Moodle and see what the web page looks like in a browser, all in Moodle. Why does HTML exist in VPL, if not for this type of scenario?\nComment 4: I hear what you're saying, but I always found that the HTML development was so slow as students (1) write HTML and then (2) click the 'Evaluate' button to launch it in a mini-browser window. This always takes quite a bit of time and isn't particularly speedy. It's also tedious to mark online. Why not have them develop locally using VSCode or Notepad++ then have them upload to a Moodle Assignment with rubric where, as you're marking, you can bulk download and grade more quickly?\nComment 5: I have a mandate to make the course as interactive as possible. My boss encourages me to use things like VPL. In my very limited experience, I have not found VPL that slow.\nComment 6: Don't get me wrong, I've been using VPL for 10 years and it's FABULOUS. I just find the time it takes to run the pop-up browser to preview the webpage much slower than say using something like this where they can instantly view their HTML. If you didn't want to locally develop (fastest), they could certainly write their code in something like this and then paste their raw code into VPL and submit if you really wanted to use VPL.\nLabel: ",

The students have to write a small programm to get a playlist of songs. First, they have to ask how many titles the person wants to enter (number), and then the input \"Enter a title\" comes up as often as the first number mentionned. The output is a list of the titles. As this programm is to see how \"for\" works in python, I would like to get a second exercise with a nicer output: not in a list, but in a row like: title title title And here starts my problem: the output without quotes will also take a list-utput as true. And then I enter quotes, the output is evaluated to false because of the first input (number of songs, you want to enter). Thank you for any help! Luise expected code and testcase: musik = [] anzahl = int(input('How many songs do you like to get in your list? ')) for i in range(anzahl): titel = input('Titel: ') musik.append(titel) for i in range(len(musik)): print(musik[i]) case = beliebige Eingabe input =3\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello, I don't think we can take student input and evaluate it against test cases. I believe with the way the server flow is structured, the input must be generated by the server in order to be evaluated by the server.\nComment 2: Hey Garth, thank you so far. I do not understand the point you mentioned. What do you meen by \"the input must be generated by the server\"? I thought that with \"input = ...\" I give a fixed input (not coming from the students) and with this input I would like to have a specific output: not in a line or list, but every input as a single output in a new line. My input (via testcase input) is: 3 (number of titles I want to add to the list \"musik\") a (first title) b (second title) c (third title) the expected output is: a b c and I would like to reject with the testcase outputs like: a b c [a,b,c] So, the input is not coming by the students but by the testcase itself. But I can't handle the output. Without the quotes my testcase will also exept the output I would like to reject, this the quotes, my testcase rejects all output I have, also the correct one in several lines.\nComment 3: Did you look at https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html#checking-exact-text\nComment 4: Yes. But, I can't figure out how to optimize it for my case. VPL is telling me, that the expected output is: a b c but it found: How many songs do you like to get in your list? Titel: Titel: Titel: a b c It looks like if VPL counts the input-words as output if I use \"checking exact text\" (what I need because of the separated lines I would like to have...) If I put all the text from the inputfield in the testcase under output =, all works fine. But I don't want to do this, because I don't know the exact text the students may use to motivate the input. Something like \"How many songs?\" should also be okay. Every idea is welcome! Perhaps, where is something in the system I do not understand until now?\nLabel: ",

The workaround is to run the nested X server \"Xephyr\" and display the vpl_wexecution program to the nested window. Below is the steps for preparing the jail server: Install Xephyr (apt install xserver-xephyr) Modify /usr/sbin/vpl/vpl_vnc_launcher.sh, replace the line \"$HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\" with the following block \n```text\n        if [ -f $HOME/.glx_required ]; then\n          VNCDISPLAY=$(ls $HOME/.vnc/*.log | sed -e \"s/[^:]*://\" -e \"s/\\.log$//\")\n          XEPHYRDISP=$(($VNCDISPLAY+25000))\n          Xephyr :$XEPHYRDISP -fullscreen &\n          while true; do\n            DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP xdpyinfo >& /dev/null\n            [ \"$?\" == \"0\" ] && break\n          done\n          DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        else\n          $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        fi\n```\n For a VPL instance that requires GLX support In \"Execution files\" section, add an empty file called .glx_required In \"Files to keep when running\" section, tick .glx_required In \"Resources limits\", the option \"Maximum memory used\" should be at least 256MB In fact, the workaround is a preliminary work. It has been tested in single-user case (at least for my programs). I am not sure whether it works without trouble in multi-user case. Hope this would help in your case.\nComment 2: I discovered that Xephyr has some keyboard event issues on VNC server. I used Xpra to replace the VNC server. It seemed working properly. However, it consumes more resources. I have forked the VPL repository and added my ad-hoc solution here: https://github.com/breeze833/vpl-xmlrpc-jail-glx\nLabel: ",

We're using VPL for Java , C and Verilog here at York University and are looking to expand its use because it's so useful.  Being able to harness the student ID would be great. James P.S.

Is the intention to put that into the vpl_run.sh shell script? James\nComment 3: Yup, but I'm not sure how to pass it to the student script as input. See the dev discussion here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=187465\nComment 4: Hello, You might be interested in the Variations feature of the VPL. It does not exactly use the userid, but it allows to create a set of variations that will be randomly assigned to students. The variation affect the exercise description and can be used with testing scripts.\nLabel: ",

Inspired by its flexibility, together with my colleagues I am trying to connect it in the common workflow with programs we have installed on our server . Our use case is as follows: on our server, we set up a VM with Ubuntu 20.04 64b and latest VPL jail jail server communicates with Moodle without problems, we can run standard software tools and software we compiled and installed in `/usr/local/bin` , for example we have mapped a partition with additional software to be able to access and run the software on the mounted partition, the user needs to be added to secondary group, let's call it `secondarygroup` with guid `2000` `` in Ubuntu VM we are able to add the `vpl` user to `secondarygroup` using `usermod -a -G mygroup vpl` and we are able to run the software. But of course the vpl user won't be a prisoner in the VPL jail. So we need to add all prisoners to `secondarygroup` . Question So my question and problem is: how to add prisoners to (a) secondary group(s) . What I've tried For the purpose of testing I reduced the `MIN_PRISONER_UGID` - `MAX_PRISONER_UGID` range to 10000-10007. I found `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` file, which seems to be executed each time after I run `systemctl restart vpl-jail-system` I modified `set_etc` function in the mentioned file so that `$JAILPATH/etc/group` file has an additional line with `secondarygroup` and `$JAILPATH/etc/gshadow` file is generated (details below) `` Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/ehjSaSoZPX , I also attach the files (before/after) `` Result (VPL in the browser) `` For the testing purposes, I put several command in the `vpl_run.sh` , and the result is as follows: `` \n```text\ncat /etc/passwd : \n\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:10000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:10001:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:10002:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\n\n\np10003:*:10003:10003:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\n\n\np10004:*:10004:10004:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n\np10005:*:10005:10005:prisoner 10005:/home/p10005:/bin/bash\np10006:*:10006:10006:prisoner 10006:/home/p10006:/bin/bash\n\ncat /etc/group : \n\nroot:*:0:root\np10000:*:10000:p10000\np10001:*:10001:p10001\n```\n In the `groups` and `id` I would expect seeing `secondarygroup` , but it is not there. Also, `gshadow` looks like this in Ubuntu VM: \n```text\ncat /jail/etc/gshadow\ncat /var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/gshadow :\n\nroot:::\nsecondarygroup:!!::p10000,p10001,p10002,p10003,p10004,p10005,p10006\n```\n I also did an experiment when no custom `gshadow` is generated, with the same result as above. Summary So it seems that either I am doing something wrong with purely linux-related files that determine user groups or there is something VPL related I am not aware of. Is there any way to add prisoner users to secondary groups? I will appreciate any help.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It looks like I found a partial solution to my problem. Not sure about its safety, but seems to be working. The trick is to modify and recompile the vpl daemon C++ code so the user GID is always the same (2000 in my case). Technically no secondary group, but I get the group membership I need. Won't work if several groups per prisoner are needed. Procedure: Do all the steps on the installation page until this step . Stop before executing `install-script-sh` . OR simply `cd` to your `vpl-jail-system-[version]` directory you used for vpl jail installation. Find the following line: link `src/processMonitor.cpp` file `processMonitor::becomePrisoner(int prisoner)` method `setresgid` function ( `unistd.h` ) Modify the line: `if (setresgid(prisoner, prisoner, prisoner)!= 0) {` After modification (hard-coded gid=2000 in my case): `if (setresgid(2000, 2000, 2000)!= 0) {` Stop the daemon and backup config if you made any customizations: `sudo systemctl stop vpl-jail-system.service` `sudo systemctl disable vpl-jail-system.service` `` `sudo mv /usr/sbin/vpl /usr/sbin/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/ /etc/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf.backup` Re-run installation script in order to recompile the daemon (respond \"no\" to software & SSL key installation queries if you have them already installed): `sudo ./install-vpl-sh` Edit `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` (fresh one was copied from `vpl-jail-system.initd` during the previous step). Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/1JZPOA982x Before: \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$I:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:p$I\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n After (replace `mygroup` and `2000` as needed): \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        local MYGROUP=\"mygroup\"\n        local MYGROUPGUID=\"2000\"\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$MYGROUPGUID:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        echo \"$MYGROUP:*:$MYGROUPGUID:\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n Note: it is another topic, but you may need to add `set_other /yourpath` in `start_vpl` function and `unset_other /yourpath` in `stop_vpl` function to be able to access custom-mounted filesystems in the jail. Restart the vpl jail service: `sudo systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service` Result (in the browser): \n```text\n+ id\nuid=10005 gid=2000(mygroup) groups=2000(mygroup)\n\n+ members mygroup\np10000 p10001 p10002 p10003 p10004\n\n+ cat /etc/passwd\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:2000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:2000:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:2000:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\np10003:*:10003:2000:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\np10004:*:10004:2000:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n+ cat /etc/group\nroot:*:0:root\nmygroup:*:2000:\n```\n To summarize: I think this is a good enough temporary solution (although with ugly hardcoded gid) but I would be happy to know if it can be done better (or included as a feature in the next VPL Jail release) and about security issues The solution doesn't add prisoners to secondary group. It just sets common primary group for them. Is there any solution for prisoners to belong to several groups? I have no idea what is the purpose of `/etc/shadow` file in the jail context , since both `/jail/etc/shadow` and `/var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/shadow` contain host server users' info and not the prisoners' I think there is a small bug in the original `vpl-jail-system.initd` script. Result is similar to the one above: for `MAX_PRISONER_UGID=10005` , the user p10005 is not added in `$JAILPATH/etc/passwd` and `$JAILPATH/etc/group` . Only the users p10000-p10004 are added. However, the daemon sometimes randomly selects such user.\nLabel: ",

We recently started the process of integrating the functionality of VPL into our own moodle and to evaluate VPL concerning its interoperability with other automated grading systems for programming tasks . In this context m y University, in colaboration with many other universities, developed an XML exchange format called ProForma . ProForma is an exchange format for programming exercises/tasks. It formalises the specification of programming exercises, for example, the description, required programming language and suggested tests for evaluating the student submitted code so that exercises written for one tool can be exported and imported into another tool. We are interessed in extending the functionality of VPL so that it would support the uploading and further processing of tasks in our ProForma format, and if possible, we would like to avoid breaking the VPL standard, as we are interessed in making use of future new VPL releases. Therefore, we are wondering if there is interest from the side of the global VPL community to integrate this extra functionality into VPL and if so, we would like to collaborate with the creators of VPL for assistance. That way, everyone could make use of the ProForma format to exchange programming tasks independent of the learning respectively grading platform and we would still be able to rece i ve future VPL updates down the line. Please contact me if you are interested. Best regards, Zaid Akad\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

Here is a minimal example to explain what I mean: - The students are supposed to write the ubiquitous helloworld . - The expected output string is \"Hello, World!\" - They are allowed to evaluate the answer  any number of times. - During the evaluation I want to catch typical wrong outputs like \"Hello World!\", \"Hello, world!\", etc. and give them corresponding feedback, \"Comma missing\", \"'World' should be written in uppercase\", etc. How can I achieve that? My first thought was the vpl_evaluate.cases file, but it is a list of correct cases, I found out. First time user. Apologies if this is a FAQ. I did a forum search though, they are bewildering for a beginner. ;( Edit: Is the VPL Question type the answer? That would be a vertical learning curve, since I want to put this to test the coming week!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I'm not sure how to accomplish exactly this, but I found this website quite helpful: http://dominiquethiebaut.com/dftwiki3/index.php/Moodle_VPL_Tutorials\nComment 2: This should be achievable via execution files and advanced evaluation mechanisms. VPL Questions act only as an interface between VPL activities and Quizzes, and use the same evaluation logic than VPL activities.\nComment 3: Hi That is what I expected. Could you be more specific? Do you have pointers to tutorials, example, etc.?\nComment 4: I cannot find a detailed, public documentation for this... So, here is a short explaination of what I know :D The files that you will edit are the ones in Execution Files: `vpl_run.sh` (for Run action), `vpl_debug.sh` (for Debug action), `vpl_evaluate.sh` (for Evaluate action). It is possible to only edit some of them. In your case, you only need to edit `vpl_evaluate.sh` All files submitted by the user are available in the environment. The `vpl_execution` file should write on standard output all information regarding the evaluation of the submitted code. All files submitted by the user are still available in the environment. There are several line formattings you should know about: - A line starting with `Grade :=>>` followed by a grade will set the grade of this evaluation. - A line starting with `Comment :=>>` will output a comment visible by the user. - `<|--` and `--|>` can be used to display multi-line comments. - Within multiline comments, lines starting with `-` will be displayed as headings, lines starting with `>` will be displayed as pre-formatted text. Dummy example for vpl_evaluate.sh contents: \n```text\n  echo \"echo Grade :=>> 100\" > vpl_execution\n  echo \"echo Comment :=>> \\\"Well done!\\\"\" >> vpl_execution\n  chmod +x vpl_execution\n```\nLabel: ",

This doesn't work: \n```text\noutput = /.*/i\n\n\n/.*/i\n```\n First time user. My reference was https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php?view=article&id=65:general-documentation&catid=20 > Creating automated tests.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: No echo coming and not finding any other VPL specific documents on regular expressions I started to reverse engineer the VPL text patterns but ran aground right at the start. My test case: \n```text\ncase =\n\n\ninput =\n\n\noutput = 'mm'\n```\n Works as expected: Only the following program line (in Pascal), \n```text\nwriteln('mm');\n```\n returns \"1 test run/ 1 test passed\" everything else, 'm', 'mn', ' ', and so on return \"Incorrect program output\" . Now comes the odd part. Here is the new  test case: \n```text\ncase =\n\n\ninput =\n\n\noutput = '--'\n```\n Now not  only \n```text\nwriteln('--');\n```\n returns success, but many, many other strings. '-', '---', 'm', 'mn', 'mnn' and many more. What haven't I understood? Could very well be a rookie mistake.\nComment 2: I'm still learning VPL myself, but do \" vs ' make a difference in the output? i.e. output = '5' vs output = \"5\"? See docs: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html#output\nComment 3: Voila! \n```text\ncase =\n\n\ninput =\n\n\noutput = \"--\"\n```\n (double quotes) behave \"normal\". Many thanks! I wonder though what '--' means to VPL. My original problem is still pending. I will check the docs you've provided.\nComment 4: re #1: I'm afraid I don't know how to test for anything given that I'm always testing for something! re #2: I believe '--' qualifies as nonstrict text (see here https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html#checking-text ). The docs are quite thorough and contain lots of options. I tend to make custom cases where I generate random input for my test cases and then require exact text on the student output ( https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html#checking-exact-text ). This may prove useful to you if you're interested in the approach I'm taking here: ( https://github.com/itsguysmiley/vpl-samples ).\nComment 5: Thanks a lot! I get simple regexps working now, more by trial-and-error. What I miss is a full definition of the regexp language in the VPL, something comparable to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference .\nLabel: ",

I usually use the due date as the last possible date to submit an vpl assignment and I set \"Expect completed on\" a week or two before the due date. I use this technique with other acitivities as well, e.g. quizzes, lessons, ... all of them show up in the timeline block with the \"expect completed on\" and there actual due date as long as the activity was not yet completed. VPL activites are not in the timeline block, neither with their due date nor with their expect completed on date. In the course calendar the due date results in a calendar entry, but again not the expect completed on date as it is, with the other activities. Is there a specific reason for this behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Both VPL and moodle have their latest version installed. Regards Lisa\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Lisa, The VPL version 4.0.0 does not support the timeline block and the \"expected completion date event\".

Really I don't know why your Certbot does that but the solution is easy: change the symbolic links to the correct file. Notice that instead of using symbolic links you also can use the new parameter to indicate to the SSL certificate (fullchain.pem) and SSL key (privkey.pem) files. See ttps://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-2.7.0/configuration.html#ssl-key-file Best regards, Juan Carlos\nComment 2: Hi Juan Carlos Indeed, rechaining the symbolic links did the trick. Now they are: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 56 Mar 24 22:08 /etc/vpl/cert.pem -> ../letsencrypt/live/HOSTFQDN-0001/fullchain.pem lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 54 Mar 24 22:10 /etc/vpl/key.pem -> ../letsencrypt/live/HOSTFQDN-0001/privkey.pem I think the problem was that an Apache process was already running at the standard port. It must have confused letsencrypt. BTW , I am going to move VPL-jail-server to port 8080 and get my Apache back. This a tiny VPS for practicing VPL. I would be nice if it contains Moodle and VPL. It is \"legal\", I hope. ;) From what I see in the configuration, it is as simple as PORT=8080 in the vpl-jail-system.conf, am I right?\nComment 3: HI Visvanath. Notice that if you want to use VPL and Apache at the same machine and Apache is using Certbot to get the SSL certificates the correct way to install VPL is to indicate that you already have certificates and using symbolic links or the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE parameters to allow VPL to get access to the certificates got by Apache. I guess that if you are getting two different certificates for the same HOSTFQDN the Certbot generates two different directories. If you are using Apache on the default ports HTTP:80/HTTPS:443 you must set VPL on two different ports g.e. HTTP:8080/HTTPS:8081. You can also remove the HTTP port from VPL. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-2.7.0/configuration.html#ssl-cert-file Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 4: I am having the same problem. How ever it did not generate any pem files lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    49 Jun 29 15:43 cert.pem -> /etc/letsencrypt/live/pythonml.site/fullchain.pem lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    47 Jun 29 15:43 key.pem -> /etc/letsencrypt/live/pythonml.site/privkey.pem -rw-------   1 root root  3814 Jun 29 16:33 vpl-jail-system.conf -rw-------   1 root root  3814 Jun 29 16:33 vpl-jail-system.conf.LAST root@pythonml:/etc/vpl# cd /etc/letsencrypt/ root@pythonml:/etc/letsencrypt# ls accounts cli.ini csr keys renewal renewal-hooks root@pythonml:/etc/letsencrypt# ls -la total 40\nComment 5: Dear Luis, It seems that certbot has failed to install your certificates. Please, stop VPL jail and retry running certbot. \n```text\nHNAME=pythonml.site\n\n\nsystemctl stop vpl-jail-system\n\n\ncertbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d $HNAME\n```\n Notice that HNAME must contain your full internet server name. Remember start VPL with \n```text\nsystemctl start vpl-jail-system\n```\n Best regard, Juan Carlos.\nComment 6: I encountered the same issue and it was due to -0001 appended to the FQDM.\nLabel: ",

Anyone know what might be causing this? The evaluate functions works fine with .php files but not with .py files... strange.\nComment 2: Dear Garth, this was a known coding error fixed 4 years ago. Notice that this code is in the Moodle plugin not in the execution server . It seems that you are using an old VPL plugin version, or you are running a VPL activity customized using as a base the code of that old version. The second option may explain why the problem does not affect all activities . Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 3: Hi Juan, I understand what you're saying, but here's the situation: I have one moodle server and two other jail servers, one using ubuntu 16, the other using ubuntu 20. All is working fine on the ubuntu 16 instance (3.4.3+, 2.6.0), but the newly installed, vanilla ubuntu 20 returns this error (and only when running python, it seems) running server 2.7.2 and plugin 3.4.3+. On the new ubuntu20 server, I was getting the error \" The execution server needs to install \"python\" to run this type of program\"...  So I installed python-is-python3 in order to circumvent the error but now it gets the error I originally posted: \n```text\nvpl_evaluate.cpp: In member function ‘const char* I18n::get_string(const char*)’:\nvpl_evaluate.cpp:508:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]  508 | }      | ^\n```\n Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?\nComment 4: ***Update from my note above... VPL evaluates just fine as a teacher on the ubuntu20 jailserver (View All Submissions -> Evaluate All) but not when clicking the 'Evaluate button' when in the IDE (as student or teacher).\nComment 5: Dear Garth, this is a real stranger behaviour. I don't know why you get the message of a problem that was fixed 6 years ago. You can see the fix at https://github.com/jcrodriguez-dis/moodle-mod_vpl/commit/b2ba631b1e607dc4715cbe06f23ee12c436431bf#diff-968e2b4ee38e659f51d0196ff63f5f02075caa509d2f9a4855c2f8257342201aL509 . I don't have at hand an Ubuntu 20.04 but I will get one to try to replicate this behaviour. You also may try to use the package that install the execution server installer : sudo apt install python3 Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 6: Hi Juan, Yes, I agree, it is strange. Current version is the default install of python3 which ships with Ubuntu 20.0.4 so after apt-get update on the ubuntu20 server the current python version is 3.8.10. Did you see in my note below that this error does not occur when a teacher clicks 'View Submissions' then 'Evaluate All'?\nLabel: ",

I copied vpl_run.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh  from https://github.com/jimburton/vpl-unit-test So now I used my own Junit Test and it works that´s not the problem but if I click on run as a Student I got only the status Junit Test is ok. But imagine the student wants to check with the console for example he or she wants to type two numbers in but the console doesn´t ask for the two numbers it automatically tests the method´s and give an error or not. How can I use the console and check for the test or better the student has only the right for testing with the console and the only thing is to evaluate. Can someone find a solution or has the same problem ?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Kemal Uluz. I think that you must remove your vpl_run.sh file (remove the contents) and let VPL runs the default script to run Java. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 2: Dear Mr.Rodriguez-del-Pino, what do you mean by (remove the contens). If I delete everything the error is that there is no executable file. And if I delete only the lines where Junit is in ..then I got a compilation error because the program can´t find the test cases from the execution files. So I tried as a Student role and that´s what I´m getting from the compilation window. I hope I was able to explain my problem as well as possible. greeting\nComment 3: Dear Mr.Rodriguez-del-Pino, I had delete everything out of vpl_run.sh until these lines: #!/bin/bash . common_script.sh javac -J-Xmx16m -Xlint:deprecation *.java cat common_script.sh > vpl_execution chmod +x vpl_execution And what I got from my Console if I run the programm is Connection closed nothing else..\nComment 4: Dear Mr Kemal Uluz, Better does not remove the vpl_run.sh file set the file with the full content. Now change the line that starts with 'echo \"java '. You must there replace the class name (\"Main\" in the file you show) with the name of the class you want to run. For example for a student's file Number.java that contains the main static method, the class name must be Number. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 5: Dear Mr.Rodríguez-del-Pino, you mean this line : echo \"java -enableassertions -cp $CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/junit4.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MyTest\" >> vpl_execution but I don´t know the CLASSPATH of the file .. How can I point the source which the student creates or didn´t I understand something not. Best regards\nComment 6: Dear Mr Rodriguez-del-Pino, I hope you can help me again in this matter. as a student i create the file Numbers.java and as an admin I have MyTest.java where the @Test methods are in it echo \"java -enableassertions -cp $CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/MyTest Numbers\" >> vpl_execution It works that way but if I click on evaluate it doesn´t create the points which I have in my Main.java as Admin. It would be great if you can help me on that. Best regards\nLabel: ",

I believe Step 1 worked successfully. The interface shows \"connecting\" and then \"retrieve results\" and then nothing. If this is expected behaviour then it was successful. If this is not expected behaviour then it was unsuccessful. In either case the \"No execution server\" error does not display. Maybe I am misunderstanding the \"Check execution servers: VPL Editor and Compiler\" page. The \"Current Status\" column has a \"Ready\" value, but the \"Last error\" column has a \"request failed: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\" value. I understand the last error and I have fixed that error during the upgrade. The problem, I believe was that the cert.pem file was linked to X.509 certificate instead of the full chain (cert.pem -> /etc/letsencrypt/archive/jailserver/fullchain5.pem). Browsing to both http://jailservername/OK and https://jailservername/OK returns OK. I also confirm that I can access the paths by using wget from a command line from the Moodle server , and it also returns OK.

The execution server rejects a task if the memory requested is greater than the memory available in the server or greater than the MAXMEMORY parameter value (set in the execution server configuration). To avoid the problem, the \"Maximum memory used\" parameter in the site administration vpl plugin must be set to a value equal or lower than the MAXMEMORY in the execution server configuration and the available memory in your execution server. The line with \"Memory requested 2097152000\" shows a strange number of bytes. It seems that your installation has a very high \"Maximum default memory used\" value (site administration vpl plugin setting) and a low MAXMEMORY in the execution server configuration. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 6: That was exactly the problem. The parameters on the plug-in was too large for the resources on the server. Setting the Maximum memory used - value fixed the problem. Thank you very much for helping solve the problem.\nLabel: ",

This type of problem is a challenge for me that I accept with a smile. I took your test cases, wrote and small program and the tests failed.

For a while, I thought that the testing system has some bugs, but After many tests, I rewrite from scratch your test and voila the tests worked as expected. ​At that moment I was astonished. I looked for hidden characters in your test code with no luck. Finally, I realized that to represent the minus sign, you wrote a large hyphen from the UTF-8 charset (\\342) instead of the common hyphen of the ASCII table with char code 45. You can see that the hyphen near the 1.0 is a little bit larger than the hyphen near the 2.0 Please, use the common hyphen to represent the minus sign and the problem will vanish.

Doing tests directly based on the VPL works perfekt: evaluation of the code on the evaluate.cases file works as espected. But as soon as I am trying to grade the tests based on the Moodle Plugin vpl_question, I get the error: \"An error occured during question grading (no grade obtained)\". I tried to debug this (debug level 8 on the jail server ), which shows me that the files are uploaded as expected, the output of the test result is written into the log entry also. But it seems that this result is not transferred back to the moodle server correctly. I get the same error when I activate the checkbox \"Validate\" inside the question activity, as soon as I try to save the question. Can you please help me in solving this problem? Many thanks! Best regards, Michael\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I have the same problem.... I have read the documentation 10 times, triple checked every setting. And then I have searched everywhere on the web, but it seems that no one knows the answer... And the conventionnal VPL assesments work fine... This error seems to be impossible to explain... Good luck...\nComment 2: Hi, I am exactly this problem. In the preview question, I get the following: Evaluation details: \n```text\n\n```\n Evaluation error: \n```text\nAn error occured during question grading (no grade obtained).\n```\n But I can make the Pre-check without problems: \n```text\n\n```\n Evaluation: \n```text\n-Summary of tests\n```\n \n```text\n>+------------------------------+\n```\n \n```text\n>|  1  test run/ 1  test passed |\n```\n \n```text\n>+------------------------------+\n```\n It appear that exist problem only when grading, but the rest is ok. I would like to use VPL in a quiz for formative activities , and use VPL as an activity for evaluation, but the grades on the quiz are important to measure the student progress. I guess that is a small detail, since not much people have this problem. Regards, José Coelho\nComment 3: Check your web server settings. A http to https redirection was messing the grader and when i disabled it, it worked !\nComment 4: Hi @José Coelho, Which version of qtype_vplquestion are you using? It was a known problem, that seemed to come from http/https settings of execution server. It should have been fixed with qtype_vplquestion v.1.3.6. An cause for this issue may be the grade setting on the VPL activity. Is this VPL graded, and is the grade visible? The Pre-check process does not retrieve the grade, only the evaluation details. The Check/grading process, however, does need a grade from the VPL activity.\nComment 5: Hi Astor Bizard and Alexandre Meslé, Thanks for the help. I worked last week with the administration, but I am not an administator. We try several configurations in the global configuration, some stop the pre-check from working, and no configuration could make the grade working. We conclude that should be something in the execution server, since we change the local execution server to http://demojail.dis.ulpgc.es , it works, if we set to our server https://vpl-jail.uab.pt (or http://vpl-jail.uab.pt ) do not work the VPL question, but work the VPL activity. I made now a test, after submiting a VPL question that return no grade, go to the VPL activity and submit the data that was there (from the VPL question), and return the following: Testing 1/1 : 1 <|-- -Summary of tests >+------------------------------+ >| 1 test run/ 1 test passed | >+------------------------------+ --|> Grade :=>> 1 So, it appear that only our execution server and VPL question are not working 100%. I will confirm with the administration, but I think we have the latest version, since the platform have the upgrade last month. I checked the grade in VPL activity and it have a grade, that is visible to the students (but the course is now closed, I am preparing the next semester). I already setup a quiz without time limit, so the students can return and continue, during each module. Thanks to the VPL question type, I could put all content in a single quiz, so I can also make a block with results of top 100 of student progress, based on that quiz. I will keep the previous tool as a backup, but I think this will be a clear better tool/method, since the students are reading and have a zone to write / complete the code and check the result, and I can see what the students are doing. If the problem is not solved until the semester start, I can always setup the quiz without grades, but with that I would lost the top 100, that I think works well in student motivation. Regards, José\nComment 6: Thanks for the support. The problem is solved. After reinstalling the certificates in the execution server, everything works! Best regards, José\nLabel: ",

Is there any functionality similar to question bank, where we will have all the vpl questions and use them as an activity item in the course so we don't need to replicate. Any information or suggestion or workaround for this scenario will be helpful, Thank you. Sam.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I don't believe so... However, Moodle does offer a 'metacourse' option for situations like this.

VPL ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_vpl ) is an activity module. VPL Questions ( https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_vplquestion ) is a question type. However, in any case, students have to be able to submit their code on the VPL module. This means they have to be enrolled in the course the VPL module is in. Which also means that activities have to be copied in any course you want to use them in. Metacourses may be a solution, as Garth Brady said. Best regards, Astor\nComment 4: Hi Astor, Thanks for your note, I was mainly interested in reusing the VPL activity in multiple courses as it supports multi-file complex evaluation. I am clear on the vpl question type item which is part of the quiz module but it is limited to single file simple evaluation.\nLabel: ",

Currently, we have to clone their repositories and then run a grading script on them. Is it possible with VPL to automatically grade such submissions?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Also, all the files required for grading are in my GitHub repositories, for example: https://github.com/cpp-exercises/pandemic-a Is it possible to automatically use these files in a VPL assignment, rather than copy&paste each one?\nComment 2: I have been watching Github's classroom development for years and use VPL instead - it is by far a superior program. You would need to create individual activities for each assignment, but this is a quick process (I tend to make a 'master' activity with the settings I want, hide it, and then duplicate it for each assignment. Students can either upload their code or use an online IDE. VPL supports a wide range of software - if you haven't done so already, check out VPL's docs page for specific details: vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/support\nComment 3: Thanks, but I am not sure I understand: is it possible to have the students submit a link to their GitHub repository, and have VPL automatically grade it? (that is: clone the student's repository, copy the grading files on top of the student's files, run them, and compute the grade).\nComment 4: No, vpl does not integrate with github to my knowledge. Students would need to either enter their code in the IDE or upload it as a submission file for VPL to autograde.\nComment 5: Dear Erel, VPL is a flexible tool that may be adapted to different approaches: At first glance, you can try the following: - Create a VPL activity - Set the activity \"Execution options>>Run script to C++...\" - Create a \"Requested file\" called githublink.txt - Got to \"Execution files\" and create a script called \"pre_vpl_run.sh\" (sorry undocumented).

How can I limit the number of submissions/evaluations? How can we export the highest grade among all submissions? Currently, the module exports the lastest grade. Thank you.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I will try to answer your three questions. Q1) Limiting the execution time for each test case. A1) At this moment you cannot set a different run-time limit for each test case. The default test program set a run-time limit equals to the total run-time limit divided by the number of test cases. The run-time limit can be set in the \"Maximum execution resources limits\" option. Q2) How can we limit the number of evaluations/submissions? A2) The number of evaluations or submissions cannot be limited. You can only penalize each evaluation. Q3) how to export the highest grade among all submissions like in CMS. A3) You cannot get the highest grade of each user, only the grade of the last submission. You can export the activity grades from the grade book of Moodle. Notice that VPL is not developed to support programming contest.\nComment 2: Dear Juan Carlos Thank you for the valuable plugin, I've been using it for the past months and it works great. Regarding Q2 - My students are submitting over and over to \"hack\" my tests. Of course I can penalize them, however this is not a good enough solution, as they need to think twice before each submission - something that I do not wish them to do. Also, they think it is petty and that it is some kind of a punishment. I believe that a better solution would be to limit the submissions to X times a day. It will stop the \"hacking\" as well without punishing them. Is there any chance that this feature will be supported in the near future? Best regards, Achiya\nComment 3: I agree. I also noticed that students, who are too lazy to install a working IDE on their computer, use the system as an IDE. They submit hundreds of times, and it puts a lot of load on the server . A hard limit on number of submissions per day would be very useful.\nComment 4: Yes, I agree this may be useful, however using a combination of the penalty per submission and 'free submissions' can work nicely. For example, if I set free submissions at 3 and then penalize each submission 25% thereafter, this would certainly encourage local development.\nLabel: ",

I am wondering if it is possible to check the Java or C/C++ style Guidelines. In a first-year subject is very important that students learn a good codification: getter, setter, equals, etc. Is it possible to add this feature?? I find out a book \"developing programming courses with moodle and vpl\" that shows a solution for my purpose, however, from my point of view, it is a bit difficult to do it. And finally, I don't know if it is possible to integrate the PMD analyzer code in VPL (or another one) in which you can set the features that PMD has to check in student programs and VPL returns an error it has not a good codification. Thank you very much and you've done a really good job!!!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I agree, style check is important. In my C++ course, I use `clang-tidy`, and it extremely helpful. Students learn a lot of style guidelines just from running clang-tidy on their code and trying to overcome the warnings.

I guess there is something wrong when Moodle is processing such a regular expression... For example, the output of the program should be the string \"2/2\" or \"02/02\", i.e., both strings are valid, so I think regular expressions come to play in this case because using exact match we can not define alternative clauses... If I define the following test case: \n```text\ncase = Test 1\n\n\ngrade reduction = 20%\n\n\ninput =2\n\n\n2\n\n\noutput = /(2\\/2)|(02\\/02)/\n```\n Moodle shows a \"no test case found\" message when I tried to evaluate any program.

But how do I set up the VPL execution server to always redirect to HTTPS? I need to do this since it's possible to go to http of it which is not secure.\nComment 8: Dear Ricardo, At this moment, who configure to use http or https are the Moodle administrator by setting the plugin configuration and using HTTP or https at the \"Execution servers list\" and the teachers with privileges setting the local server list. Also the execution server administrator can control the access to the server by configuring the vpl-jail-service. Notice also that by default if your Moodle server use HTTP connection the browser will use not cyphered WebSocket connections with the execution server. Parameters at /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf you can use to control the access to your execution server: PORT : Sets the server port number for http and ws. Default 80. If you change this port only users that know the port number can access using HTTP to your server. In a future version, this access can be removed. e.g. http://servername:34377 URLPATH : Represents the PATH expected in execution requests. It acts as a password, if the URL PATH in the execution request does not match, the request is rejected. By default \"/\". If you set it only Moodle server that uses this URLPATH can use the service. e.g. http(s)://servername/PASS TASK_ONLY_FROM : IPs or networks (type A, B or C ) from which execution requests are accepted. You can set multiple separated by spaces. This parameter only affects Moodle servers, access from clients (browsers) is done using frugal tickets. If this property is not set the server will accept requests from any machine that set the correct URLPATH. Default not set. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 9: I have the same message.

I have a problem with dotnet 5. I have installed dotnet cli on the jail server and use it successfully in my evaluation script , that compiles both the students project and the testing project. Nevertheless, I have encountered several problems: To make it work, I had to set the limits to: Max memory - 1GiB, max exec. size - 128 MiB, max num. of processes - 500. If I try to reduce any of these numbers - the compilation of the second project hangs and I receive a timeout (there is no error in logs, even when I raise log level to maximum). Of course both projects are extremely small and their compilation on my computer does not require these resources. If several nuget packages are involved - these resources are insufficient.

I tried using this guide which you recommended: http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Tutorial:_Moodle_VPL_--_A_Multi- File_Java_Program_with_Data_File However, even when I click the keep files when running on my text files the VPL dosen't seem to accept this kind of argument as in the guide. for example when I type case=Test 1 input= input.txt output=\"1\" The VPL interprets the \"input.txt\"(which is a file I kept in the execution files) as a string to enter the student program. I would appreciate your help of how to run a test case with a text file of my own. Thanks alot!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello. Ron Viner. I guess that you need (required) to use the standard input to give the data to the student's program. You can resolve this need with this approach: 1) Create a  script \"inputFile.sh\" to pass the file to use as standard input to the student's program. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nread filename\n\n\nif [  ! -f \"$filename\" ] ; then\n\n\n    echo \"Error: file $filename not found\"\n\n\nelse\n\n\n    # Runs student's program with $filename as standard input\n\n\n    ./vpl_test <$filename\n\n\nfi\n```\n Remember to mark \"inputFile.sh\" as \"file to keep when running\". To have the script available at testing time. 2) You must add to each test case at vpl_evaluate.cases file the following: program to run = ./inputFile.sh Example: \n```text\nCase = Test file input\n\n\nProgram to run = ./inputFile.sh\n\n\ninput = data1.txt\n\n\noutput = \"Expeted result\"\n```\n Important: VPL is not ready to evaluate based on the code runtime. VPL does not use a queued execution leading to the possibility that some tasks run in the same execution server at the same time. To palliate this problem the teacher, after all, can reevaluate all the student submissions using a dedicated jail server. In this situation, the evaluation tasks will be run one by one. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 2: Dear Juan, Thanks alot, it seems to solve the problem. except one little thing, now after I have this test case option available the students program prints with the output this warning : >/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.utf8) to be a little more specific, the evaluation window contains this : Incorrect program output --- Input --- > input0.txt --- Program output --- >/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.utf8) >756 --- Expected output (exact text)--- >756 I would appreciate your help with getting rid of this warning in the output of the students program. Thanks in advance, Ron\nComment 3: Stranger error. I can not reproduce the problem in regular conditions. I guess it was there before. Please, tell me if when you run (not evaluate) the student's programs the message appears. You can try adding to the script \"export VPL_LANG=he_IL.UTF-8\" but I am not sure it will work. Also, It seems that VPL does not manage correctly the conversión from Moodle \"he\" language to Linux \"he_IL.UTF-8\" locale. Anyway, you can work around the problem by installing the \"en_US.utf8\" locale in your jail servers. Notice that VPL uses this language as a fallback in case of locale setting fails. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 4: It is actually a warning which always appears when running or evaluating, and usualy I just ignore it, just that in this case where the input is taken from a text file the program prints the warning as well as the program output. I tried adding to the script \"export VPL_LANG=he_IL.UTF-8\" but unfortunately it didn't help. I will try to contact the technical department of my university and figure out if it is possible to install the \"en_US.utf8\" locale. Thanks and best regards, Ron\nComment 5: A temporal workaround can be to remove the first line of the student's output. \n```text\n./vpl_test <$filename 2> > (tail -n +2)\n```\n This code will remove the first line of the stderr and do nothing with the stdout. Note that spaces matters. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nLabel: ",

If I'll create two servers and wiil balancing access to them - there is a chance that moodle will not connect to the same machine that the user browser connects... Any experience with that ? Documentation ? tnx a lot,\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: I am not an expert in load balancing configuration but I think that with the network architecture of VPL it may be difficult to use an \"execution server\" load balancer. Notice that the execution process takes different steps and requires different network connections that need to be established with the same server in the cluster. For example, the evaluation process takes these steps. 1) A user launches an evaluation process. e.g. the user clicks evaluate button. 2) The browser sends a request ( AJAX / JSON ) to the Moodle server. 3) The Moodle server selects an execution server (with retries) and sends the task to an execution server (HTTP/XMLRPC). The execution server generates different security tokens as a response to de request. The task start. 4) The Moodle server responds to the Browser request with information with the \"execution server URL \" and the security tokens. 5) The browser connects with the execution server using the URL+security token and the \"WebSocket\" protocol to monitor the task. 6) When the task end, the monitor sends a request (AJAX/JSON) to the Moodle server to retrieve the task report/result. 8) The Moodle server request the \"execution server\" the task result (HTTP/XMLRPC) with the security token, save it and return the result to the browser. 9) The browser shows the result.\nLabel: ",

At IIT Delhi, we are trying to write custom evaluation scripts for grading that examine previous submissions and compare with their next submissions and give penalty based on the difference in the two submissions. We can bulk download all the submissions of all the students using download all submissions link. However, we are facing problems linking the submissions to the Moodle's ID number. The directory names for different students are in the format: <last name> <first name> <moodle code>. However, this code doesn't come  in the grader report. How can we link this code to the actual student <ID Number> in the grader report (or email address)? The first names and last names can be ambiguous in large classes where multiple students may have the same first and last names. Thank you, Rahul\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Rahul Garg, The current version of VPL does not generate the data  that you need for the student identification and I don't know a workaround to get this information.

Wanted to know how I can add unavailable languages like Ruby or Oracle db. Can I even evaluate multiple languages in a single program. Is creating a VM the correct way to execute it? Can I create evaluation scripts directly in the plugin to achieve the same or web services would be a solution. Any instruction documentation would be great.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Q1 Wanted to know how I can add unavailable languages like Ruby or Oracle db. A1 You can install the compiler/interpreter into your execution server and write an execution script. You can know the available languages by creating a file with \".all\" extension and running it. Due that VPL is a stateless execution system, may be difficult to develop scripts to execute Oracle queries inside VPL due to the need of keeping Oracle security/passwords and its and own users. Q2 Can I even evaluate multiple languages in a single program. Is creating a VM the correct way to execute it? A2 The I/O test system is independent of the programming language. The system detects the language used based on the filename extensión. If you want the student to write a program using a mix of languages you need to write your own scripts. Q3 Can I create evaluation scripts directly in the plugin to achieve the same or web services would be a solution. A3 Yes, you can customize the system. But notice that all executions will be done in the execution server. Q4 Any instruction documentation would be great. A4 Sorry for the poor documentation. You may search for similar questions in the old forum. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=154988 Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 2: Thank you for your reply. Wanted to know if there are any examples or demonstrated steps to install unavailable languages in vpl.\nComment 3: You can review the supported language scripts ([lang]_run.sh)  at https://github.com/jcrodriguez-dis/moodle-mod_vpl/tree/v3.3.8/jail/default_scripts These scripts check, compile or prepare the source code to be run. Their aim is to generate the programs/script named vpl_execution or vpl_wexection that really will be run. Notice that to customize an activity you must go to \"advanced features\"> \"execution files\" and write your own vpl_run.sh script, the system will use your vpl_run.sh for your activity instead of any [lang]_run.sh applicable. To easily replicating customization you may go to \"execution option\" and use the \"based on\" feature \". Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nLabel: ",

And furthermore the program won't properly evaluate submissions. How do I fix this?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Ricardo, you have made an interesting question. First I must say that VPL was not thought to manage large files, the files are fully managed in memory. In this case, the message \"connection fail: error\" comes from a PHP Fatal error due to memory exhausted. To avoid that one PHP script uses too much memory (taking memory needed for other scripts) the memory used by each script is limited by configuration (php.ini). The solution to this problem is to increase the PHP memory limit. Notice that binary files are coded as b64 to be sent in JSON . Due this question, I added \"showing a verbose message for this problem\" on the TODO list. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nLabel: ",

A student account submits several submission files, and when I go to execution files, and I click on \"Evaluate\", it turns out that those files that the program is calling for under \"customEval.py\" are not even inside the temporary directory that the Moodle server makes for the purpose of this evaluation. Only files like customEval.py, vpl_run.sh, vpl_evaluate.sh, etc. Are those student submission files located somewhere else in the server? If so, where? What other directory? How can I get to this other directory? Would I have to use the grep command in the code, or the Python equivalent of that? If the student submission files are in there somewhere, I could type in code to copy them over to the temporary directory for the evaluation process.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Dear Ricardo, I don't know what are you trying to do but I will try to explain how the evaluatión is carried out. 1) A user pushes the \"evaluate\" button related to a submission. 2) The system package the submitted files plus the \"execution files\" (set of files defined in VPL activity) and the custimized or default scripts for \"run\" and \"evaluate\" actions. 3) The system selects an execution server. 4) The system sends the package to the execution server 5) The execution server creates a home dir for a temp user and unpackages the files there. 6) Compilation stage: The execution server runs the vpl_evaluate.sh script. 7) if vpl_evaluate.sh generate the vpl_execution program goes next stage. 8) The system removes all \"execution files\" (set of files defined in VPL activity) but not the files in \"Files to keep when running\" (VPL activity advanced setting) 9) Run stage: The system runs vpl_execution (The test program) and processes the output to generate a report and grade. 10) The systems remove the home directory and the temp user.\nComment 2: Thank you. I have a few more questions. 1. Some of the files defined in the VPL Activity do not get packaged for use in evaluation (such as example submission files that can be used for testing purposes), which is what I am trying to do. So far I had to use a separate student account to test it, and the test worked, but now I need to know how to get more new files in besides the main ones and other ones that do get in. 2. Follow up of question 1, it seems like when a student submits a file, and a file of the exact same name is defined in VPL activity, the student's file(s) that are in VPL activity are not packaged for the evaluation and seem to be ignored. Why is this? This test was even done with both files (student's and in the VPL) have the same contents., so is this supposed to be some sort of anti-plagiarism measure? 3. Under what privileges do the scripts execute and the submissions get evaluated? A student can run the evaluation script to auto check their submissions' output, but that student should not be able to do anything that compromises security, such as have access to the execution files in VPL activity.\nComment 3: Dear Dr. Carlos, This question is a follow up to Ricardo's question. Here is what we are trying to do. Instructor: * Instructor defines a programming homework in the VPL. * Instructor defines a number of files (about 10) that will be used for testing the homework. These files can be packaged in a zip file, or can be uploaded individually. * Instructors loads these files in VPL using \"execution files\" upload mechanism. The instructor can see those files. Indeed, when zipped files are uploaded, the VPL automatically unzips them and shows them. Student: * Implements the programming homework * Presses the evaluate button, which should cause the evaluation to occur. What we have found is the following: After the evaluate button is pressed, the evaluation script runs, and: * The student's test programs gets copied. * Only some of the files in the \"execution files\" are copied. N ot all files from execution files are copied * Evaluation fails because not all of the instructor's testing files are there. We checked the directory by running a python script when an evaluation takes place. The script iterates over the files of the home directory. It shows that only some files are copied, and most of the instructor's test files are not. Is there something that we are missing? We truly appreciate your help in this regard. Regards, Raju Pandey\nComment 4: Dear Ricardo, A1) Please read the answer to the Raju post A2) The security is first. Yes if the student submits files with the same name that files in the \"Execution files\" the one in the \"execution files\" is used. A3) All executions in the VPL execution server are done as a temp regular user without privileges. To avoid the students' access to the testing code see the answer to the Raju post. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 5: Dear Ricardo and Raju, Have you set these files at \"Files to keep when running\"? else the system removes these files before running the code (Step 8) IMPORTANT (if you allow the students to run their code on this activity): As you are using these files to test the students' submissions the presence of these files while the students run its code allows students to view the test code and may lead to cheats. To remove these files from the run action add the file \"pre_vpl_run.sh\" to the executions files. This script is run before the vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh. The vpl_run.sh may look like: \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nif \n[ ! -f vpl_evaluate.sh ] ; \nthen\n\n\n   \nrm \ntest_file1.py\n\n\n   \nrm \ntest_file2.py\n\n\n   ...\n\n\nfi\n```\nComment 6: Dear Dr. Carlos, Your suggestion worked. We had not set the \"files to keep when running\" properly. Thank you again for your quick reply and help. Regards, Raju\nComment 7: 👍👍\nComment 8: I tried creating the pre_vpl_run.sh file, even making sure to checkmark it under \"Files to keep when running\", but for some reason this file isn't running at all. The contents of the file don't matter, the VPL will not execute this file first, and I even checked to make sure the name of the file was right. It seems I do have to get this file to run first before vpl_run.sh because otherwise the student's files would be deleted by the code meant for pre_vpl_run.sh before the program evaluates them. It seems that pre_vpl_run.sh would run first, deleting the sample files, before the student files are added into the temporary space, then the student files are added in and vpl_run.sh is run, and the sample files do not cancel out the student files because they (sample files) were deleted first. How do I get this file to run before vpl_run.sh?\nComment 9: Dear Ricardo, It is very difficult to spot the problem without the details. Please, download the \"requested files\" and the \"execution files\" and post it to try to find the problem. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 10: I don't feel like I'm at liberty to share the files, but I also don't think that would help as the problem actually has to do with the VPL itself choosing which shell file to run first. Is there a way to change which exact file is run when Run, Debug, or Evaluate is clicked?\nComment 11: Dear Ricardo, To customize what program VPL runs when Run, Debug, or Evaluate is clicked you can write your own vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh or vpl_evaluate.sh at \"execution files\". Notice that these files are the \"compilation stage\" and generate the program that finally is run that must be named vpl_execution. You can see examples of these files at https://github.com/jcrodriguez-dis/moodle-mod_vpl/tree/v3.3.7/jail/default_scripts Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 12: Thank you. We decided to move on to using an AI-experience center (AIEC) called Jupyter for students to be able to store their files on that server, with each student/instructor having their own directory there. We want to integrate that server to our VPL LMS-client, and we want students to be able to download the files they work on in Jupyter and then upload them to a VPL for evaluation. One issue we have is the security. When trying to download a file, someone should be presented with an authentication request (username/password). Is it possible to use a client like Putty or WinSCP to SSH into a Jupyter server? If so, what would be the proper credentials? I tried this with WinSCP and failed, possibly because the server may not have FTP /SFTP installed. The thing is, from the VPL I am able to use the wget command with the link to the file to download it onto the temporary drive in the VPL server during the execution. This should fail and/or ask for authentication credentials. We do not want students to be able to see or get files they're not supposed to. How can I implement this kind of security to any of the servers? I believe our main goal is to unify all 3 servers (Jupyter, VPL, LMS)\nComment 13: Dear Ricardo, Your question does not have an immediate or easy answer. The authentication of VPL is under Moodle control. There is no easy way to access VPL without Moodle authentication. VPL provides (under Moodle control) a web services API you can try to use. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nComment 14: Dear Juan, Thank you for your response, but what we are trying to do now is find a way for VPL to be able to access a student's files on their directory on a Jupyter server and grade them. For the time being we log in and download them manually, then submit them to Moodle, but we want the execution of the VPL to get the files automatically so that when a student decides to have their files evaluate, the VPL will get them from Jupyter and grade them. I understand what you explained to me about how there's no easy answer, but I came up with another idea based on what I know works, and I explain it below. Since I am capable of using wget to do this, I thought if there was a way, with the use of strings and variables, to run a wget that gets the correct files based on the name of the student on Moodle and the name of the student on Jupyter. I would assume these have to match, but is there a line of code that gets the name of the student running the execution which would be stored as a string during the execution itself? This would help in the creation of the file path for wget, which uses variables and strings to construct it in the program. One last question, I would like to know if and how it's possible for a student to run the VPL's execution without providing their own file manually in Moodle since this would be done automatically by the VPL's execution itself. Thank you!\nLabel: ",

You may have problems with the different types of output test. The output has the following format and types: \"output = text \" can span multiple lines. It ends with another statement. A test case can have multiple outputs statements, if one or more matches the student's program output the case is passed. There are four types of outputs: only numbers, text, exact text, and regular expressions: Numbers : only numbers are written. Only numbers are checked out, the rest of the text is ignored. The real numbers are checked with tolerance. example: \n```text\noutput \n= 4\n\n\n5 6.8\n```\n Text : Only words are checked, the comparison is case-insensitive and the other characters are ignored. example: \n```text\noutput \n= lemon orange\n\n\napple\n```\n Exact text : The text is enclosed in double-quotes.\nComment 4: Its my great privilege that you reply me. Sir i would like to share you something, Which will show you why i ask you my previous question. i write following program in VPL. Q. Write a program to input 3 number from the keyboard and check which number is greatest. #include<stdio.h> int main() { int a,b,c; printf(“enter the avlaue of a,b,c); scanf(\"%d%d%d\",&a,&b,&c); if(a>b) { if(a>c) { printf(\"a is great\"); } else { printf(\"c is great\"); } } else { if(b>c) { printf(\"b is great\"); } else { printf(\"c is great\"); } } } When i run this program enter the a value of a,b,c     3 2 1 output =  a is great Evaluate But problem is that when i comapre with test case case1 : case = check gretest number input 3 2 1 output=a is great -------+ |  1  test run/ 0  test passed | +------------------------------+ Test case failed 0/100 case2 : case = check gretest number input 3 2 1 output=b is great -------+ |  1  test run/ 1  test passed | My view To evaluate a program I passed two different test cases. According to me case 1 is correct because its output match with program output. But the moodle gives a result  test case failed. Similarly I passed a second case, which according to me is wrong because it does not match with program output. Thats why i ask that one question. Why its behave strange.\nLabel: ",

I would like to know how the Moodle VPL plugin handles two jail servers? Do it only use the second server when the first is offline? Do it also split requests between servers?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Douglas, The system splits tasks between the servers. For each task, the selection of the execution server is as follow 1) If there are servers online then one is preselected randomly. If a server was marked offline 5 or more minutes ago, it's considered already online for this preselection. 1.1) If the preselected server is found offline the server is marked as offline and repeats step 1. If the preselected server is found overloaded repeats step 1. 2) If all online servers have been preselected then all servers, online or not, are sequentially preselected again. 3) If no server can be selected a message is shown to the user. - Notice that after preselecting a server, it is checked to know if it is or not online and if it is overloaded.

I am curious that on my Linux server , some student programs are being saved with DOS style line endings, that is, instead of a line feed (hex 0A) at the end of the line, there is a carriage return (hex 0D) and a line feed (hex 0A). They are being saved in /var/www/moodledata/vpl_data etc. I was hoping that you could explain why, or in what circumstances, the student code would be saved in DOS format on a Linux computer. Thanks very much in advance, All the best, Charlie\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hello Charlie, I have reviewed this issue and this is the current state: By default, when the student writes code by hand, it is introduced with the Unix end of line format, but if you upload , import or drag and drop files it keeps the source end of line format. This behavior may be a problem, taking into account that the code is run in a Linux machine and some compiler or interpreter may reject the code. On the other hand, this behavior of keeping the original line end format may be a feature for users that save and download the code from VPL. Please, describe the inconvenience that generates this behavior to try to give an appropriate answer to more users. Anyway, this issue has been marked as a bug.

Add the main.cpp and the calculator.cpp to the activity description. The student has enough information to resolve the problem. Add the main.cpp and the calculator.cpp to  activity setting > advanced setting > Execution files. These files will go with the submitted to be compiled with each run, debug or evaluation. You can remove the main.cpp and the calculator.cpp files from the description if you add them also to the \"requested files\". No problem if the student modifies these requested files, the files with the same name at \"advanced setting > Execution files\" will replace them before send the code files to the execution server .\nComment 2: Hello again sir, Thanks for your advice.

You must use \"URLPATH=/moodle\" 2) You must restart the service \"systemd restart vpl-jail-system\" after a configuration change. Important: you must update the VPL plugin to the 3.3.7 version due to a bug that prevents to run Java programs in the 3.3.6 version. It is highly recommended to use https due to the web browsers are reluctant to allow using http connections from pages using https. Best regards, Juan Carlos.\nLabel: ",
    "You are a requirements analyst auditing discussion forum posts for potential feature requests.\nYou will be provided with a Moodle discussion forum post that includes the post title, post description, and comments associated with the post. Moodle is a free and open-source learning management system (LMS) used by schools, universities, and workplaces to create online courses and manage learning activities.\nYour task is to classify if the provided discussion forum post is a feature request or not for Moodle. A feature request is a post where the user asks for new functionality, missing functionality (e.g., features available in other apps), new content, or changes/improvements to existing features in future releases. Posts that are not feature requests include: bug reports, troubleshooting questions, usage questions, configuration issues, announcements, or general discussions. \nRespond strictly with one of the following labels: FEATURE_REQUEST or NOT_FEATURE_REQUEST. If the forum post is a feature request, return FEATURE_REQUEST. If the forum post is not a feature request, return NOT_FEATURE_REQUEST. Use the post title, post description, and associated comments with the post to make your assessment.\nForum Post: \nPost title: Would this fix also apply for the Java version of VPL\nPost description: Hi Juan Carlos, Would this fix also apply for the Java version of VPL? I am getting the same 'incorrect program output' error for the Hello world program in the tutorial http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Tutorial:_Moodle_VPL_--_A_Java_Hello_World_Program Thanks, Joe\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Joe, version 2.0 of VPL is outdated and not maintained, and does not have vpl_evaluate.cases file. Please report your Moodle and Execution server version and the vpl_evaluate.cases file content and your java program to try to resolve your problem.\nComment 2: Hi Juan Carlos, Apologies for the delay in replying. I understand what you mean and it helped me to understand what was going wrong. VPL is doing exactly what I need it to do now, Thanks very much, Joe\nLabel: "
