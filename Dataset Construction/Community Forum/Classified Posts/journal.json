We noticed that there are multiple open pull requests on GitHub that contain fixes which have not yet been merged. For now, we plan to apply the relevant patches ourselves in order to keep the module running during this academic year. However, given the current lack of activity and the absence of an official release supporting Moodle 4.5, we are considering discontinuing the use of this module next year unless maintenance resumes. Could you please confirm whether there are any plans to continue maintaining this plugin or if it’s being phased out? It is a shame, because this module has been very valuable and interesting to use in our courses. Thank you for your work so far. Best, susana\nLabel: ",

I am designing a training course for teachers to better understand the core components of our courses, one of of which is the journal. We have the diary plugin also installed to give more functionality to the journal module. The csv file download is confusing a lot of the teachers as they struggle to read the entries. Is there another format that the journal can be downloaded into or has anyone had any luck converting their csv files into a more manageable/readable format? Many thanks! Kit\nLabel: ",

I somehow missed the original question posed by Robin Latham, but in a private message yesterday, I provided her a partial solution, and it was so simple, I am mentioning it here so that others can implement it, too. She asked:  \" Could we get a toggle to be able\nto organize the journal entries by student last name rather than as it\nis now by date of entry only?\" Not a toggle, but a change to alphabetical order...In the lib.php file, look for: function journal_get_users_done($journal, $currentgroup) { It should be around line 702, depending on your version of journal. Just a few lines below that look for: $ sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY j.modified DESC\"; Change it to: $sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY u.lastname ASC, u.firstname ASC\"; This will cause both the users that are done and the users who have no entry, to be listed alphabetically when a teacher goes to the page generated by report.php. I have made a pull request to try and get this change into the Journal code at github. Robin also asked: \"Also, if we could be able to download the entries, that would be nice.\" I do have a solution for this, but it is nowhere nearly as simple, requiring the addition of about 100 lines of code lib.php and nearly that many in report.php. Time permitting, I will try to add it to my github version of Journal, and will post here when it is available. Download entries is actually available in a new plugin I am developing, based on Journal, named, Diary. Over the years, I have seen numerous requests for a Diary plugin, and mine is similar (based off of) Journal with the added capability of giving the user a new blank entry, every time they go to edit on a new calendar day. Still have lots to do, but if anyone wants a look see, let me know via private message, and I will give access. Or you can git a, mostly current version, from the Diary master branch at my github account.\nLabel: ",

Deadline is something like three hours before my course, and I will use their contributions to prepare mini-lectures. Grading is simple (if they submit something reasonable, they get full credit). I only take marks off if they submit reading summaries (paraphrasing the content of what was read, not personal, not reflective). For the purpose of my mini-lecture preparation, I want to annotate their submissions, e.g., with comments on passages such as one can do in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Adobe Acrobat, etc. I don't want to do this on hard copy in 2015. I'd like to be able to generate a word cloud using the content. I could have up to 40 students in two sections (80 students total) and I don't have a secretary to help me click! Looking at the Journal activity in Moodle, I think it comes up short on the annotation feature (at least based on the documentation I looked at, there seems to only be a form field for instructor feedback and a grade). I'm thinking of going with Assignments (there's bulk download of Word/PDF/etc.) documents although a Word cloud wouldn't be possible (that's not a show stopper). I'd appreciate feedback from the Moodle community regarding this approach. Thanks!\nLabel: ",

I really like the Grade Me block for alerts as to what needs to be graded, but it presently does not have a plugin for showing Journal entries that need grading. Last weekend, while laid up with another cold, a truly UNWANTED gift from my students, I managed to cobble together a working plugin that will do what's needed. The modification adds one folder, one file, and modifies one other file of Grade Me. Right now I am waiting on a reply from the Grade Me folks about getting a copy of the plugin to them. If anyone would like to try it out, I can provide a copy of it.  Just be forewarned, I have developed it for Moodle 2.7 versions of the Journal and Grade Me and have not had any time to test on any other versions. I might be able to do so next week, but no guarantees. It does work very nicely on Moodle 2.7, Moodle 2.8 beta, and Moodle 2.8 RC1. AL\nLabel: ",

However, our moodle adminstrator is not keen and says I should be using the assignment tool. Journal was disabled on our system but he has  reactivated it.  He seems to think Journal will be fully withdrawn as a function soon. We are about to update to moodle 2.2 I think.  I would be very grateful for any thoughts or ideas on this from anyone who has used journal.\nLabel: ",

What I liked about the Journal was the way the student could see all their entries on one page when they clicked on the link in the upper left (on my site).  This encouraged them to think of the Journal as a progression of thought and showed how their thinking or reflection was evolving as the course went on. It didn't look like a gradebook but rather was more personal - a journal that they \"owned\" rather than a series of assignments from the teacher. When they click on Assignments then it looks like a gradebook - each assignment is separate and they click multiple times in order to view each entry.  (And journal-like entries are mixed with other writing assigments). One of the harder things is to get student to connect the material earlier in the course to material later in the course and one of the uses of my journal was to get them to keep reflecting on this.  Sure I can ask them to do this using the Assignments, but the just the layout of it makes it more difficult and I don't think they feel the \"ownership\" that a Journal encourages. Bottom line - a series of Assignments is not a Journal - nor is a Blog unless they allow for making the Blog private.  [ Yes a peer-available or public Blog adds another dimension but depending on the course may not be appropriate.  ] Just venting here. Hacking Journal to work in 1.7 is not an option for me.\nLabel: ",

This would seem to be a useful feature for people handling large classes that don't want to put them in groups. I have 120 people in one group and it takes a while to load each journal entry and is almost impossible to scroll down efficiently. I have a 1.5MB connection so that shouldn't be an issue but I have tutors using modems. I'm using 1.2 beta and you have to load all the journal entrie for all groups before you can select a group. Has that changed in 1.2 final release. Generally the groups feature works well and is a great new feature.\nLabel: ",

We noticed that there are multiple open pull requests on GitHub that contain fixes which have not yet been merged. For now, we plan to apply the relevant patches ourselves in order to keep the module running during this academic year. However, given the current lack of activity and the absence of an official release supporting Moodle 4.5, we are considering discontinuing the use of this module next year unless maintenance resumes. Could you please confirm whether there are any plans to continue maintaining this plugin or if it’s being phased out? It is a shame, because this module has been very valuable and interesting to use in our courses. Thank you for your work so far.

I'd like it to auto-grade to preserve anonymity.  Is this possible with the diary activity or another module? So far, my attempts have not worked.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi John, I'm not sure what you mean regarding, anonymous, but in a Diary activity, the teacher can ALWAYS see what the students write. Students can only see their OWN writing and do NOT have access to another students writing unless the students share the writing via some other means. e.g. Physically show them on their screen, or via copy and paste in an email message. You can set up automatic prompts that update at whatever time interval you desire. Each day is okay. Changing the required number of words each day is one of the automatic prompt options. You can also setup and use a, Gloassary of Common Errors (the actual name is optional), that is also accounted for in the auto rating suggested scoring. This makes it possible to enforce proper spelling so that the modern slang of such things as, u, instead of you, can be enforced. The autograding is actually only a suggested rating that the teacher can acept with one click of the mouse, and even if they apply the suggested rating they can always over ride it, and change the rating and feedback.\nComment 2: Thank you for the response. This is all very helpful. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the Diary activity will be useful for what I need. Basically, I'm trying to implement a daily writing journal for song writing students. I'd like to have these students write (anything) at least five times per week, and at least 200 words per entry. I'd like to reward them with a grade and I'd like Moodle to grade it automatically so that I DON'T have the need to look at it - thereby protecting the sanctity of the entries. Their writing would ideally be totally private, even from me as the instructor.\nLabel: ",

We are looking for a way to edit and fix it but I don't see how. I know on some activity types you get the option to re-grade if there are changes made to grading, but I don't see that for journal activities . Do you know how?\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: So far as I know, there is no way to do what you want in Moodle, as the capability is just not built into Journal. However, I will admit that I have changed a Journal from a Maximum grade of 100 to 10 and Grade to pass from 70 to 7, but had to do it directly in the database using phpMyAdmin . The biggest hurdle was to make sure I found the correct entry in the mdl_grade_items table. I then had to go and regrade every journal entry. I also did that in the database as it is quicker. Everything appeared to have been changed and updated correctly. WARNING: I do not recommend that you do this on a production Moodle site, but if you MUST make sure you back up your current data first. As an alternative, I know that at one time I was changing how much an activity was counted for in a final grade book calculation. Sorry to say I do not remember how I got in there to change that. What I do remember is just how much of a pain it was to do that. It probably was along the lines of putting the faulty journal in it's own category and then set how much that category counts towards the total grade.\nComment 2: Darn, since we're on a hosted version of Moodle editing the database is probably not something I can do and our host company will likely get cranky. I proposed something similar to the instructor in terms of the grade book solution you mentioned. I told her she could add a manual grade column and transcribe the correct grade there and take the original journal out of her calculations.\nComment 3: That's probably best. Could also create a new journal, with the correct grade setting, and then have all the students copy and paste their entry. Then just delete the old journal with the wrong settings.\nLabel: ",

I was on version 4.0.2 (Build: 20220711) (2022041902.00) so I managed to upgrade to the latest version 4.1.1 (after a terrible run in with SQL databases) but the error still persists. I did try diary but found it too advanced for my purposes, which was simply to document the student's thoughts every session. The diary was, however, fantastic for an area for students to write their stories in.\nComment 3: I am sorry to hear that the upgrade did not fix the problem for you. I know that in Diary I added code to fix it. Unfortunately, I just don't have time to create fixes for journal, anymore and the current maintainers are generally slow to respond to problems posted here in the forum. If you play with Diary a little more, you will discover that you can have it work just like the journal plugin. Edit all entries > No Edit entry dates > No Enable statistics > No Enable automatic rating > No, but it is optional. Ratings > No ratings, but can be set to any of the five rating types. All the other settings are optional and truthfully, just those first 3 items are the key to making Diary work like Journal. Granted, since you can change the, \"color\" of things, it will look just a little different. 😁 And as you've discovered, it is great for other types of activities .\nComment 4: Awesome AL, I shall play with the diary some more with your tweaks. All the best.\nLabel: ",

Can one is able to delete only a specific entry? Thank you!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Mary Jan, In normal use, teachers have no way of deleting a journal entry. A student can do a select all and delete the text but the empty record should still there and should be visible to the teacher. However, it can be done directly in the database using something such as, phpmyadmin.\nComment 2: Hello, thanks! the entry was deleted by another teacher not by strudent.What is phpmyadmin and how can I use it ?\nComment 3: phpMyAdmin is free and open source software that would need to be installed by whoever maintains your server . Also, it is one of those programs in which if you do not know what you are doing, you can easily break and render inoperable any database based program, such as Moodle.\nLabel: ",

I somehow missed the original question posed by Robin Latham, but in a private message yesterday, I provided her a partial solution, and it was so simple, I am mentioning it here so that others can implement it, too. She asked:  \" Could we get a toggle to be able\nto organize the journal entries by student last name rather than as it\nis now by date of entry only?\" Not a toggle, but a change to alphabetical order...In the lib.php file, look for: function journal_get_users_done($journal, $currentgroup) { It should be around line 702, depending on your version of journal. Just a few lines below that look for: $ sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY j.modified DESC\"; Change it to: $sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY u.lastname ASC, u.firstname ASC\"; This will cause both the users that are done and the users who have no entry, to be listed alphabetically when a teacher goes to the page generated by report.php. I have made a pull request to try and get this change into the Journal code at github. Robin also asked: \"Also, if we could be able to download the entries, that would be nice.\" I do have a solution for this, but it is nowhere nearly as simple, requiring the addition of about 100 lines of code lib.php and nearly that many in report.php. Time permitting, I will try to add it to my github version of Journal, and will post here when it is available. Download entries is actually available in a new plugin I am developing, based on Journal, named, Diary. Over the years, I have seen numerous requests for a Diary plugin, and mine is similar (based off of) Journal with the added capability of giving the user a new blank entry, every time they go to edit on a new calendar day. Still have lots to do, but if anyone wants a look see, let me know via private message, and I will give access. Or you can git a, mostly current version, from the Diary master branch at my github account.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Ooops! My wife was after me to go do something, and I forgot to include one other change that alphabetizes the users who have NOT made an entry. Do the change listed above. Then, in the file report.php down around line 158, look for this line of code: $users = get_users_by_capability($ context , 'mod/journal:addentries', '', '', '', '', $groups); Change it to this: $users = get_users_by_capability($context, 'mod/journal:addentries', '', $sort='lastname ASC, firstname ASC', '', '', $groups); Sorry for not catching the omission while making the first post.\nLabel: ",

Deadline is something like three hours before my course, and I will use their contributions to prepare mini-lectures. Grading is simple (if they submit something reasonable, they get full credit). I only take marks off if they submit reading summaries (paraphrasing the content of what was read, not personal, not reflective). For the purpose of my mini-lecture preparation, I want to annotate their submissions, e.g., with comments on passages such as one can do in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Adobe Acrobat, etc. I don't want to do this on hard copy in 2015. I'd like to be able to generate a word cloud using the content. I could have up to 40 students in two sections (80 students total) and I don't have a secretary to help me click! Looking at the Journal activity in Moodle, I think it comes up short on the annotation feature (at least based on the documentation I looked at, there seems to only be a form field for instructor feedback and a grade). I'm thinking of going with Assignments (there's bulk download of Word/PDF/etc.) documents although a Word cloud wouldn't be possible (that's not a show stopper). I'd appreciate feedback from the Moodle community regarding this approach. Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nNo comments posted on the postLabel: ",

I would prefer to include those changes only in master (or also 2.8 as it has just been released) but I am not feeling like backporting it to 2.7 and 2.6 as the changes have not been properly tested in real environments, only in testing environments but I would reconsider it if some of you are experiencing important performance issues.

Thanks in advance.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi David, Personally, I have not noticed any performance problems with the Journal add-on, but my Moodle site is quite small and I never have more than 17 student journals being viewed at one time. Content is just short 5 paragraph essays of 21 sentences. Thanks for your continued work on this module, AL\nComment 2: Thansk David, We would appreciate to have this enhacements on performance in Moodle 2.6. We discovered this problem in a huge  Moodle: +2k courses, +38000 users... +150 users per course (the average is 23 users per course). With a journal with more than 150 entries, the function that calculates the number of entries does arround 700 DB queries (4-5 queries per entry)... It costs 180-200 seconds to render the entire page. Now, with that improvements it cost only 40 queries and arround a second to render. We would definetely try the cron improvements in this production site and we will try to report the results. Cheers!\nComment 3: Thanks for replying AL and Pau\nComment 4: I've released new Journal module versions from 2.6 to 2.8 including an important performance improvement by Pau. There are other performance improvements in the current development branch (future 2.9 mod_journal release) but I prefer to be conservative and don't backport them to 2.8, 2.7 and 2.6. The next Journal module version for 2.9 will include all the performance improvements.\nComment 5: Thanks David! I'm happy to see improvements on this module, We will be migrating to 2.8 in the next months so we will test it when it happens! Ens veiem!\nLabel: ",

About three weeks ago I discovered that most versions of Journal (including 2.6) have one small bug in the journal lib.php file if you are using Journal set for Grade > None and with debugging turned on. The bug is a notice that an offset is not set and is caused by checking to see if a grade has been overridden in the gradebook...but no entry is in the gradebook because the Journal is set for no grade. A couple of days ago I came up with a fix that will most likely be in the next version along with a new feature I've come up with that posts a notice that a journal entry needs to be regraded if the student makes changes to an entry that has already been graded. The upshot of it all is that it will not hurt to go ahead and use Journal 2.7.2 with Moodle 2.8. Tonight I will finish pushing that last fix up to my github account and you can get an updated copy with the fixes, if you would like to. HTH , AL\nComment 2: My fixed and enhanced version of Journal is available from https://github.com/drachels/moodle-mod_journal/tree/MOODLE_27_STABLE Changes are in both the MOODLE_27_STABLE and master branches. Note: I just now received an email from the Journal module maintainer and he is planning to do some work on the Journal module next week, so keep an eye out for an updated version on Moodle.org. AL\nComment 3: Could you take a look at this entry in this forum area. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=279887 I am an instructor using journal for this site and was the one that found the problem and reported it to Judy. Any thoughts? Thanks. Martin.\nLabel: ",

I really like the Grade Me block for alerts as to what needs to be graded, but it presently does not have a plugin for showing Journal entries that need grading. Last weekend, while laid up with another cold, a truly UNWANTED gift from my students, I managed to cobble together a working plugin that will do what's needed. The modification adds one folder, one file, and modifies one other file of Grade Me. Right now I am waiting on a reply from the Grade Me folks about getting a copy of the plugin to them. If anyone would like to try it out, I can provide a copy of it.  Just be forewarned, I have developed it for Moodle 2.7 versions of the Journal and Grade Me and have not had any time to test on any other versions. I might be able to do so next week, but no guarantees. It does work very nicely on Moodle 2.7, Moodle 2.8 beta, and Moodle 2.8 RC1.

Fortunately, the current of Journal (for Moodle 2.6) appears to be working on my Moodle 2.7 testserver. Thanks for any answers!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi Samuel, Not sure when Journal for Moodle 2.7 will be available. David Monllaó (Lead maintainer) has been pretty good about releasing versions for each Moodle but he only does enough to keep it working and is not adding any new capability. The latest version for Moodle 2.6 works with Moodle 2.7, but if you turn on debugging to developer mode, there are about 30 warnings of various types that will show up depending on what part of journal you are in. Most are related to deprecated methods of getting info and adding log entries. There is one set of two warnings that will show for every student entry when you view all the student entries. Now...the reason I know these details is...I have played with trying to do a little programming in Moodle over the years, and literally just yesterday, had picked the Journal activity as something to play with while on summer break. It is very simple compared to other activities , without too many files to learn about. I am down to just two warnings left to try and figure out. They both show up for the teacher but only one shows up for students. I have fixed the log entries and even added a couple of new ones. If you would like a copy with my modifications, to try out, let me know. The modifications do not change the journal database tables at all. Hopefully, sometime tomorrow, I will have the last two warnings  fixed. I'm going to quit \"playing\" for now. Students \"gifted\" me a cold and it is getting to me, so I'm done for the day. AL\nComment 2: Hi Al Thanks for your answer. We now have a copy of our production- server running with Moodle 2.7, and the journal appears to be working correctly (except the debug-messages you mentioned). I guess we will wait for David Monllaó's version, since we will upgrade our production-server in August. I would come back to your offer (an adapted version of the journal) David's release is delayed for some reason, ok? Thank, Samuel\nComment 3: Hi Samuel, I'm in a long leave since march and I have less time to spend in projects I contribute to, but I return to Perth next week; I will release the 2.7 version during the next couple of weeks.\nComment 4: Well, good news thanks David. -Derek\nLabel: ",

I have added Journal to a Moodle 2 install and have two teachers using Journal with a group of students. The students have made entries and the teachers have given them feedback. The students cannot see the feedback from their teachers. The course settings have \"show gradebook to students\". The journal settings I made \"no grade\" and that is what the teachers see when they write in the feedback. They cannot give a grade. When you edit the journal settings it shows as if grade is set to \"100\". Help? Is this a bug I should report or is there something else I should check first? Thanks.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi there The Journal module has been deprecated, which means it is no longer a part of core Moodle and hasn't been since 1.9 With the improvements to the online text assignment, the advice being given is to move instructors over to using that instead. There is a developer working on the gradebook-Journal connection. You may want to contact him. Here is a link to the issue tracker for the project: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB/component/10880 Cheers KerryJ\nComment 2: Hi Tabitha,\n\nIt seems a bug (or a pair). Thanks for reporting it will be fixed tomorrow\nComment 3: Thanks David. Should I put it in tracker or will you? Thank you.\nComment 4: Answering my own question... Journal activities edition always shows the default grade, 100 - http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-2869\nComment 5: Hi Tabitha, there were two different problems, the other one is that the feedback is not shown on \"no grade\" journals, I created another tracker entry ( CONTRIB-2871 ) for that. You can upgrade to the latest version from CVS since now, or wait until tomorrow or saturday to download through the Modules & Plugins link Thanks for the bug report!\nLabel: ",

You can check this by going to 'Update this Journal', but if it has elapsed, the journal will not give you an editing button or window. Matt\nComment 2: I get the update button & window to edit.

I've never used a journal so I might be quite wrong here but I would have thought the benefit of a having groups would be from the teacher's point of view and would not affect the students. If you have groups set up then you can filter the results in your gradebook to only seeing one group or class of students' journals at one time, instead of seeing every student you have on the course. Since students can't see each others' work anyway ,whether it is ungrouped or grouped, it doesn't really make any difference to them.\nComment 2: Gerhilde, Journal module is going away so it perhaps does not make sense to start exploring it now...... I would look at the online assignment and experiment with that and then repost your question in the other forum.....\nLabel: ",

In her classroom, I set her role to course-creator. With this combination, she should be able to see the journals of her students and stay a member of her classroom simultaneously (if her role in the classroom is set to administrator, she is no longer member of the class!). It is important to control, that the person, wich is course-creator, is NOT inscribed simultaneously as teacher or student, if so, the system won't work! I would be glad to hear about a solution, that avoids the need of distributing administration-rights so freely ... Heini Trümpy\nComment 4: This does make sense as I recently gave this instructor administrator rights.  I will add her as a course creator for the class involved (sigh...she is in several classes!) and see if that has a positive effect.

I´ve been noticing that journal module doesn´t send any email informing of students updates. Is it my error on installing? Is it standard? Is it possible to make it happen? Actually I need the same feature in every interaction module... (homeworks, workshops, etc...) Just in case... If I had to insert some code to make this simple email message be sent to me... what would be the page to insert it? Thanks!\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Henrique, It's been several months since you posted this question, and nobody has responded here in the forum. I'm wondering if you got an answer elsewhere, because I'd like to be able to do the same thing! If you DID get an answer, would you please let me know? Thank you, Sunada\nComment 2: I am bumping this as well.... because we are having problems with Journals also. Thanks, Cherry\nComment 3: I hate me-to messages as much as the next guy, but I'd also like to find a way to get notified by email when students update their journal entries. The problem isn't new as I wasn't receiving notifications last year either. I do receive notifications of completed assignments and I am subscribed to most of the forums. Is there something obvious that we don't see or are notices just not a feature of the Journal module?\nComment 4: I'll add my 'ME-TOO' to this as well. I'd really love to be notified as the journal is pretty much at the core of what I'm doing here and if I have to go in and look each day at every student's journal, then that its going to be tedious in the extreme. So, if anyone out there has a solution....bring it on!!!\nComment 5: Nigel, I haven't found a quick fix or a setting for journal e-mail notification, but here's how I save a lot of time when checking for new journal entries: 1) Click \"Journals\" in your \" Activities \" block. Click \"(View ___ journal entries)\". When the journals open, they're in chronological order. If you check each day or so, you'll know at a glance which entries are new. OR 2) Click \"Reports\" in your \"Administration\" block. Select the date you want to check, click the drop-down arrow by \"All activities\" and select \"Journals,\" click \"Get these logs,\" and any journal entries on that date will be listed. Hope this helps. If anyone discovers a setting, please let me know too. Cindi\nComment 6: Thanks for that. Next question, being new to all this and \"haven't checked it and as I'm here now I'll ask it\" kind of thing, can I do exactly the same with the blogs? Thanks so much\nComment 7: Because I work with elementary students, I haven't used the blog feature yet. Checking the blogs on our school site, I note they're in chronological order just like journal entries. I added a blog and checked the \"Reports\" feature in the \"Administration\" block. What I saw was \"blog view\" instead of \"blog post.\" Until someone gives us a better suggestion, perhaps using chronological order will save you some time.\nComment 8: Thanks Cindi. I guess this is something to happen 'down the line'. The course is mainly ongoing and reflective with the opportunity for some private and personal comments, hence the blog aspect is the perfect vehicle for this, but I would like to know when someone has written so that I can respond quickly and provide encouragement and guidance in a timely fashion.\nLabel: ",

What I liked about the Journal was the way the student could see all their entries on one page when they clicked on the link in the upper left (on my site).  This encouraged them to think of the Journal as a progression of thought and showed how their thinking or reflection was evolving as the course went on. It didn't look like a gradebook but rather was more personal - a journal that they \"owned\" rather than a series of assignments from the teacher. When they click on Assignments then it looks like a gradebook - each assignment is separate and they click multiple times in order to view each entry.  (And journal-like entries are mixed with other writing assigments). One of the harder things is to get student to connect the material earlier in the course to material later in the course and one of the uses of my journal was to get them to keep reflecting on this.  Sure I can ask them to do this using the Assignments, but the just the layout of it makes it more difficult and I don't think they feel the \"ownership\" that a Journal encourages. Bottom line - a series of Assignments is not a Journal - nor is a Blog unless they allow for making the Blog private.  [ Yes a peer-available or public Blog adds another dimension but depending on the course may not be appropriate.  ] Just venting here. Hacking Journal to work in 1.7 is not an option for me.\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Hi, Maureen, Actually, you convinced me!

I have set my editing time to 1 minute, but still, it is taking some time for entries to appear in the administrator's view.

How did you change the editing time? Is that the same as changing the length of days that the journal is posted. It seems the shortest time is one day. How did you change it to one minute?

I was upgrading from a version from about March 10th, to the latest version in the CVS . I ran into the following errors when it did the journal module upgrade. It says there are errors in the SQL syntax. Is this a serious problem? How can it be fixed? journal module needs upgrading ( mysql ): SELECT * FROM mdl_journal WHERE introformat = '3'\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: It's a bug in cvs:/moodle/lib/wiki_to_markdown.php which converts all texts using the obsolete 'Wiki-like\" formatting to Markdown, now fixed in CVS. Did you use the Wiki-like format a lot? Those entries may look a little odd now because of the failed upgrade. To fix it, when you get the new code, you can try decrementing the number in the database ->modules->journal->version and re-upgrading.\nComment 2: Thanks, Martin!\nLabel: ",

We are looking at introducing personal development planning for all students and were wondering whether anyone had any experience of using the journal as a personal development planning tool? We would envisage the journal being used by students to record reflections about their learning on the course and perhaps they would be prompted/asked questions at key points in the course by their tutor? It wouldn't be graded. Has anyone tried this and if so would you share your experience with us? Thanks : )\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: On a course \"Coping with change\" (New Curiosity Shop) I've used the journal, with trigger questions such as \"record your reflections on this in your journal\", or \"to what extent does this model reflect your experience? put your comments in your journal\". It seems to work very well.\nComment 2: Thanks Joanna, Can you tell me, do you assess or track the entries? If not, what do you think makes the students complete the journal and what is the uptake of it as a tool by students?\nComment 3: There is a place to give feedback, so I give general comments. At the moment I'm working with a very small group - so it's easy just to read what's written and be supportive (or challenging if that's what they want) I see it as very much their stuff, as I would in a f2f course when students were working on their personal development. I suppose they complete it because the trigger questions interest them and they think they ought to as it's part of the course. Assessment is problematic: should we assess someone else's personal development? and if so how? I would prefer that they assess themselves against a framework developed collaboratively.\nComment 4: Please come and talk! (GUIDE - Glasgow University Initiative in Distance Education - just down the road from you?! - NB we currently support any Moodler in the University - especially but not exclusively distance ed. staff and learners). Moodle will easily facilitate the sort of PDP work you may have in mind - yes, via Journals but also via other 'features' - if you want to ensure learner-learner/s interaction and extend from a tutor-learner one-way interaction - so, via Dialogue, Forum etc etc.  Do come and talk - it sounds very do-able and relatively straightforward. The great joy of Moodle (and a key reason why the U of Glasgow has recently adopted it as its centrally supported VLE) is its inherent flexibility, its potential to afford a range of learning opportunitities (such as PDP here) espec. those premised in soc. constructivist learning and support, and its relative ease of use (thereby affording learning enabled not driven by technology).   A further plus for moodle.org is its potential to enable folk in the same institution to communicate! It would be good to hear from anyone else using Moodle for PDP and I seem to recall seeing some messages about it - will use 'search' and see!\nComment 5: There's a posting by Ger T (re. a CETIS newsletter) at http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=13641 and from there to the WS4RL (Web Services for Reflective Learning) site at http://cetis.ac.uk:8080/frameworks/learning_domain_services/personal_development_management/ws4rl/view\nLabel: ",

Especially with my latest set of questions on database , they could upload sample databases to illustrate their answers.\nLabel: ",

I initially intended for the students to submit a 500 word (2 pages) summary of each unit.  My questions are: Is 500 words too long for Journal entries and can I edit their entries (similiar to editing a Word document) to provide feedback on their writing skills? Thanks, Jim\nComments associated with the post: \nComment 1: Jim, The journal doesn't have the capability of editing like Word, but it is a useful way to give quick and frequent feedback about writing and about ideas. I like having students revise their journals through the week with frequent suggestions from me. Giving developing journals one minute of attention here and there, saves enormous amounts of editing/grading/reading time for the teacher at the conclusion of the process. If you REALLY need an \"in-line\" editing function, you can spend the time to login as the student, and edit the journal in a different font color (using the HTML editor), though the logging can get tedious with big classes. The absolute proper use of a journal is probably to have the student reflect and revise on his own for a period of time. Then the teacher provides feedback. For this functionality, no module is better. But, hey, this software is incredibly flexible, so I don't think it is wrong to re-imagine its use to fit your situation. best, Tom\nLabel: "
