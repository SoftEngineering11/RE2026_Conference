          "Text": "Using Moodle 3.9, with the latest (20220718) SAML2 plugin, it properly redirects to the IdP (SecureAuth) for authentication. I get some odd things: When I set Dual login to NO, it logs me in, but it does not take me back to the URL that I used initially (the course link, for example). When I set Dual login to Yes or passive, it logs me in, but then it stays on SecureAuth, rather than sending me back to Moodle. If I manually go back to Moodle, I'm logged in. I really need the Dual login, because some users are SAML2 but others are not. So now the question is: what did I do wrong? Thanks in advance for any input.",

But if the usernames don't match, you could change the individual accounts in the database (depending on how many changes you need to do) to match. If you just do a switch for the site to LDAP, then the previous accounts will still exist and new LDAP ones will be created unless the usernames overlap (I think).  Courses are tied to the moodle id value of the user so new accounts will have new moodle id values and different courses. --S",

          "Text": "Hello - I attempted to post about this issue last week in the General Help section. My question is in regards to Moodle profiles being created via LDAP . I now have a little better understanding of my environment. My organization automatically creates user accounts in Moodle via our LDAP system. We do this on Moodle via the plugin LDAP Server (Sync Plus) . Does anyone know if it's possible for users to be automatically enrolled into specific courses upon Moodle account creation, and before the user actually initially logs into Moodle? I posted on the LDAP server (Sync Plus) plugin page, but it doesn't seem like I am going to get a response there. Does anyone have any experience with user accounts created via LDAP and enrolling into courses? I am currently not able to figure anything out, and am totally stuck. If anyone has any insight I would really appreciate it. Thanks.",

When a user signed up for a course through amember4 we had the moodle plugin installed and working. The username/email/password, etc. were all passed through and the authentication was done properly in moodle to enroll them in the proper course. I am having trouble with Moodle 3.0 working properly with the plugin in Amember4 now. It is enrolling the student properly, and appears to be passing most of the information to Moodle, however it is trying to do an email-based self-registration. I've tried setting up the External Database authentication, but haven't figured out how to get that to be used by the moodle plugin. Right now the password is not being passed from Amember to Moodle for some reason. If the student does a password reset then they can log in to their course, otherwise it doesn't seem to recognize their password. Any thoughts or suggestions on where to look would be appreciated. I'm still trying to learn this 3.0 file structure/path format so I'm probably just missing something somewhere. Thanks.",

I think that what is happening here is that Moodle internals have changed quite a bit from version 1.9 to 3.0. What I am thinking is, maybe Amember4 uses Moodle's web services, and maybe some of those web services have change enough to break the integration. You may want to find out if there is an updated version of the Moodle integration plugin. It is not clear to me if there is an amember4 plugin that gets installed to Moodle or not... Or if amember4 has a plugin that gets installed. I didn't find any reference to amember in the Moodle plugins database. ....5 minutes later... Did a little more searching and found: https://www.amember.com/p/Integration/Moodle/ The readme.txt in the download file posted there only references Moodle versions 1.7 and 1.8. It also appeared that there is a Moodle side plugin for this integration. I think what I said is true, that this plugin probably is not going to work without some re-factoring to support Moodle 3. Maybe someone has done that already, but I wasn't able to find it. Sorry I am not more helpful.",

          "Title": "Re: LDAP filters (Moodle 3.6)",
          "Text": "Hi Gonzalo, The syntax for the LDAP filters is documented in RFC 4515 , using an Augmented Backus-Naur Form grammar (ABNF for short). If we deconstruct your filters using that grammar, we can see what those filters are doing, and then you can check if what the filters are doing is what you wanted them to do or not (and then build the filters that do what you want). Let's have a look at the first filter. I have arranged it slightlty differently to see what parts it's composed of, and how they compose. But appart from indentation, it's exactly the same filter you posted (except for AND filter blocks, that will appear as \"(&amp;\" instead of \"(&\", as the Moodle forum filtering is munging the syntax): \n```text\n(| \n\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = person)\n      (objectSid = *)\n      (! samAccountType: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.804: = 3)\n   )\n\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = person)\n      (! objectSid = *)\n   )\n\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = group)\n   )\n\n)\n```\n If we have a look a the RFC 4514 ABNF grammar, we can intepret the pieces. This is an \"OR\" filter block: \n```text\n(|\n    one or more \"filtercomp\" elements\n)\n```\n meaning that the filter block will match if ANY of the \"filtercomp\" elements match. This is an \"AND\" filter block: \n```text\n(&amp;\n    one or more \"filtercomp\" elements\n)\n```\n meaning that the filter block will match if ALL of the \"filtercomp\" elements match. This is a \"NOT\" filter block: \n```text\n(!\n    a \"filter\" element (i.e., a whole filter, possibly composed of AND,  OR or NOT filter blocks, etc.)\n)\n```\n meaning that the filter block will match if \"filter\" element DOESN'T match (or viceversa). Finally, there are the simple filtering elements (called `item` in the ABNF grammar). The criteria used to filter (match) based on attributes and values of the LDAP objects to filer. Your first filter includes such items as `(objectCategory = person)` , `(objectSid = *)` and `(! samAccountType: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.804: = 3)` . They respectively match if the `objectCaterory` attribute has the `person` value, the `objectSid` attribute has any value ( `*` is the wildcard value), and the if the `samAccountType` attribute DOESN'T have any of its two lower bits set. This last one is a bit tricky, as it uses `extensibleMatch` filtering rules, which are complex things. In this case, samAccountType attribute specifies if a given ActiveDirectory object is a user object, a group object, a machine object, etc. Users and groups don't have the two lower bits sets, but other kind of objects do (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-samaccounttype for details). So if we put those things together in the first filter block: \n```text\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = person)\n      (objectSid = *)\n      (! samAccountType: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.804: = 3)\n   )\n```\n we can conclude that this AND filter block will only match those LDAP objects whose objectCategory is `person` AND whose objectSid is any value, and whose samAccountType is NOT of type `machine` or `non security group` , `trust account` , etc. This basically matches any LDAP object that is considered a `person` in Active Directory. But note that Active Directory may consider objects to be of `person` category for other things besides user accounts. The second filter block: \n```text\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = person)\n      (! objectSid = *)\n   )\n```\n matches any object whose objectCategory is `person` (same as above), but whose objectSid value is NOT any value. The only way to fullfil this last criteria is by not having a value at all for the objectSid attribute at all, which I don't think is possible in Active Directory, as I think this is a mandatory attribute. If I'm right, that means this filter block will never match anything at all. The third filter block: \n```text\n   (&amp;\n      (objectCategory = group)\n   )\n```\n matches any objects whose objectCaterory is `group` , without any additional criteria. So you will probably get all the groups (both security and distribution groups) from the contexts you specified in you Moodle LDAP configuration. Moodle expects the filter to return users, not groups. So this part of the filter should be removed. Finally, if we put everything together, the filter will match any LDAP object that mathces EITHER the first filter block, OR the second filter block OR the third filter block. If we have a look at the second filter you posted (allegedly from Emma Richardson): \n```text\n(|\n\n   (&amp;\n      (objectClass = user)\n      (! (objectClass = computer))\n      (memberOf = cn = MoodleUser, ou = people, dc = yourdomain, dc = com)\n   )\n\n)\n```\n we see that it is matching if (the objectClass attribute is `user` ) AND (the objectClass IS NOT `computer` ) AND (the memberOf attribute is `cn = MoodleUser, ou = people, dc = yourdomain, dc = com` ). So basically, any object that is a user account (but not a machine account) that belongs to the group whose distinguised name is `cn=MoodleUser, ou=people, dc=yourdomain, dc=com` . You will not probably have such a group in your Active Directory domain , so the filter will not match any user at all, and Moodle will not find any user at all.",

I think it's a standard md5 hash. I don't know much about portability of md5 encryption from one system to another but you may be able to try the following: - get your system administrator to ensure the encrypted passwords being supplied are md5 encrypted. - backup your Moodle database - change line 187 of /admin/uploaduser.php shown above to not apply further encryption to the password value by editing it as follows:",

I guess it would involve decrypting the RSA first which goes against the whole reason it was encrypted in the first place. Therefor it should be very difficult to do. You will either have to get the data resupplied with MD5 encryption or ask your system administrator to do the upload for you from unencrypted data so the plain text passwords don't leave his/her control. I guess this would require you to prove that Moodle will store the passwords in a non-reversible encrypted form. Or you could import no password data and configure Moodle to authenticate with the system that holds the passwords. Many options are available for this process at \"Site Administration / Users / Authentication\".",

People from EMEA are able to login when a certain bind DN is used (like shown below) I have questioned lot of things from IT to annoy them but here's the info I have got. Looks like there are staff in the EMEA region and staff in the NA (north america) region in AD. The host URL , bind DN provided appears in the following format Host URL : ldap://xxx.emea.xx.xx.com Bind settings DN - CN=XXX,OU=XXX,OU=XXX,DC=emea,DC=XX,DC=XX,DC=com User search context - This specifies all the required OU for the EMEA, NA region - This has been checked and provided by the IT Since SSO was working I think all other settings for LDAP are correct in Moodle IT says 1) The host URL is a global catalog server so will have access to both domains (emea, na). It may be that you need to configure the URL differently though when using multiple domains – 2) Subnet IP specified covers all domains so that's not an issue 3) Moodle URL is part of the local intranet zone for everyone When SSO works the DN is in the following format Bind settings DN - CN=XXX,OU=XXX,OU=XXX,DC=emea,DC=XX,DC=XX,DC=com ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thing that I have tried but SSO does not work are ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) 1) If I include DC for na CN Bind settings DN - CN=XXX,OU=XXX,OU=XXX,DC=emea,DC=na,DC=XX,DC=XX,DC=com (NA DC included) 2) If I remove the CN and only include DC part like following DC=na,DC=emea,DC=corp,DC=xxx,DC=com -– SSO does not work 3) If I remove any part of the CN - SSO does not work ----------------------- My questions ---------------------- 1) Can we use multiple DN in the bind settings using \";\"? (Have tried that as well but SSO does not work) 2) IT has advised me to find out \"It may be that you need to configure the URL differently though when using multiple domains\" Apologies, as this is long winded. I will appreciate if anyone can put me in the right direction. I am not expecting spoon feeding but generally just give me the right direction so that I can co-ordinate with IT. Any help much appreciated. Thanks Ganesh",

When I go back to moodle on that same machine, I am automatically logged using my google / g-suite credentials.

This costs us a lot of consternation, whenever we have to create a new account for existing users, we end up with duplicate accounts and spend hrs trying to fix these duplicate accounts. There must be some plugin or code or fix for this issue. Thanks in advance. Note: This is the message we currently put on our Website to warn users about possible duplicate accounts, but it's tedious and time consuming if they don't remember or follow instructions. \" **Remember: This login may be different than your \"My Other login \" member community login. ** If you have forgotten your password, please click the \"Forgotten Your Password\" link above. If you have not received a password reset email within 30 minutes and you've checked your junk/ spam folder, you probably do not have an account in the Volunteer Learning Portal system.

Could you change your instructions to get them to email admin support if they are having problems with their password, and perhaps have a canned response something like: Please try using the forgotten password form YOURSITE>COM / login/ forgot_password.php and double-check that the password reset email doesn't end up in your spam folder. If there's still no sign of the email, let me know what you'd like your password changed to, and I will reset it for you.

When a user comes to the site because they have forgotten their passwords, they first select the \"forgot password\" link, then they enter their email.

Once validated, I output a message to create a new account since the email is not associated with any account, and then redirect the user to the signup page. If the user exist in the db, all proceeds normally according to Moodle. Why did I removed the \"Search by username\" field? It's unnecessary for our purpose and in many occasions this field is confused with the email address field. Note: The initial problem was that many users were trying to create accounts with non-existent emails and they and us thought were being sent to the SPAM folder when in fact they were not sent at all.

Basically, it provides a verification code to the student's email to allow them to sign-in. It simply adds an extra layer of security. The contribution to the Moodle Plugin Library is still pending for approval. In the meantime, I'd like to get your early feedback. Tested in 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 version. Advantages Easy settings No need for custom login form No need for extra registration form Features Send a verification code to the user email address Set the number of attempts a user has to validate the verification code to login Set how many seconds a verification code can be valid After a user reaches all attempts, you can put a penalty time before being able to log in again i.e. seeing the login page I really hope you find this plugin very useful. Please share your experiences and send me your feedback and ideas for improvements. I'm attaching the latest version in this post. Or you can download it directly from https://bitbucket.org/lmsdoctor/moodle-auth_simple2fa/downloads See the instructions here https://bitbucket.org/lmsdoctor/moodle-auth_simple2fa/src/master/README.md Thank you all!",

Line 2 is IE automatically sending the NTLM authentication for its user and being redirected to port 443 for HTTPS access with response code 303 See Other . Line 3 is IE following that redirect to the HTTPS site but since HTTPS and HTTP count as different sites it again gets rejected by IIS as authenticated with 401 Unauthorized . Line 4 is IE again sending the NTLM authentication and finally getting the Moodle home page with a 200 OK response. The Moodle documentation for NTLM single sign-on says to configure the file / auth/ldap/ntlmsso_magic.php for authenticated access but these lines indicate that access to /index.php has also been configured in this way, thus the unexpected 401 responses.

I'm no web developer, but a humble network technician in the search for the best suited VLE. I'm using moodle 1.9.9 on WinXP using the XAMP setup (its just a demo site) and the MS DC is on Server 2003. Forgive me if this question is stupid, but: I've gone through the LDAP settings checking them with ldp.exe, but when I click Save Changes it just goes to the top, I don't get any error message run at all. (I've read that cron makes LDAP run at 2am or something, but surely when I'm configuring the settings it should run the first time through to make sure it works?) Am I meant to or where would I see if moodle is even trying to connect to LDAP short of traffic capture? Where am I going wrong? When I try to log in using a domain account (not expecting it to work, but thought it was worth a go) I get: LDAP-module cannot connect to any servers: Server: 'ldap://dellserver-a.badminton-edu' Connection: 'Resource id #41' Bind result: '' Please help Thanks Guy",

I'm wondering if there is a way to get a list of users (usernames) from the database (phpmyadmin) or from the admin interface and then comparing it against our filemaker pro database that we use which would have our current employees and students.

          "Text": "There is another question behind \"deleting\" users. In Moodle 1.9 the users were not \"deleted\" from the database, they were only marked as \"deleted\". This prevented new students with the same name as someone who left our university some years ago and was supposed to be \"deleted\" to have the same eMail-Address. The same was still true, after i switched manual authorization to LDAP auth, using our active directory servers. Not to be confused with LDAP-Synchronization. With Moodle 2, I know there is a new option to only \"deactivate\" users, besides \"deleting\" users. But I am not sure if \"delete\" still means only marking as deleted or since Moodle 2 the user records are really purged out of the users table. Anyway, as we had also a lot of students coming again to take courses even after they left our university, I was able to unmark them directly in the database of Moodle 1.9 (no courses and grades were deleted, and so the account simply was revived) - but with Moodle 2 I guess that \"deleting\" will remove any courses and grades associated with the user. So everything would be lost, even if the user-account were only marked to be deleted. That's why in Moodle 2 I adopted still the behaviour to never delete users, but only suspend them. This way, if a student comes back, we will be able to activate his Moodle-account, unless we had reused the same account for another student with the same name and eMail in our Active-Directory in between. In which case we have to activate the Moodle-account after having checked if this is still the same person. If it is not the same person, we activate but unenroll from all courses before we let the student/teacher log into Moodle. And a new student/teacher with the same name as another active student/teacher gets the same name with a number added to his/her lastname, like firstname.lastname01 Rosario",

          "Text": "I never used LDAP synchronisation and course creation. I thought it too risky to manage such things in the Active Directory and have synchronisation on this. In our big university there are also too many people and too many automatic processes involved to keep a good health there. So I only used LDAP authentication. This does merely a lookup of the user and his/her password in our Active-Directory. If you need settings, I could give it here, although they should already be in the forums here more than once. For automatic course creation I wrote uploadusersandcourses.php, you can find in these forums. With that code I could reflect our real workflow (teachers can ask for courses in another web-application, including the students they want to enrol - the file gets written to a windows-share I have mounted on my Moodle linux server - a nightly cron job fires uploadusersandcourses.php which creates the courses, enrolls the given people and writes back a file with courses created with success to the same share - next day another file is written to the share containing any new courses or if something went wrong the file might also contain once again courses not created yet. As for student synchronization, I never deleted, nowadays I would suspend and activate again, preferring some hand-work to do over an automatic synchronization. LDAP-Synch should be scheduled to run once a night during the normal Moodle- Cron -Jobs. If you could speed up to synch e.g. on every hour, has to be checked in the LDAP-Synch-Module-Settings. Just not to confuse things. There is an LDAP AUTH Module, which is what I used. And there is an LDAP enrolment Module under Plugins->Plugins Overview->LDAP enrolments which is also capable of creating new courses, besides enrolling the given students and teachers. Rosario",

We are using Moodle for a reading project in Puerto Rico.  The people administering this project divided the project in 5 levels.  They want to divide the teachers and students into this 5 levels.  Is there possible in moodle to give permission or assign roles to restrict the Level 1 students and teachers to only have access to the level 1 courses?    What we want is that when level 1 (kindergarten and first grade) students & teachers log on to the system they'll only see the level 1 courses.  The same for levels 2, 3, 4, & 5. Is there a way to work this out????  If so, please help me ! Thanks a lot.",

          "Text": "Here's the setup: PHP 5.3.6, MYSQL 5.1.56, Windows Server 2008 R2, IIS7.5, Moodle 2.02+ Everything setup as per the LDAP and NTLM documents (ntlmsso_magic.php runs under windows auth) and LDAP binds fine so all users can authenticate against AD and it will create a new user within Moodle if no user exists. So the manual login page works fine for all users in the various OU's they are in. However, only users with the admin OU can log in automatically using NTLM SSO. Fails on the ntlmsso_magic.php file... (get a 503 error) After much tinkering I found it was the group permissions in AD that were having a knock-on affect on the webserver. Only those that had group membership to 'ITSTAFF' in AD and that group was present in the local administrators group on the webserver could use SSO. Obviously that's a huge security hole to put everyone in that admin group! So after a bit more tinkering I found that if I added ' Domain Users', i.e. everyone into the group IIS_IUSRS then the automatic SSO works for all users. However, I'm still not convinced about the security of this and can only assume this is something to do with the php trying run under the user trying to log in rather than the webserver? (app pool identity?) Can anyone shed any light on this or had similar experiences and managed to find a secure solution? Thanks, Gareth",

          "Text": "So after a bit more tinkering I found that if I added 'Domain Users', i.e. everyone into the group IIS_IUSRS then the automatic SSO works for all users. However, I'm still not convinced about the security of this and can only assume this is something to do with the php trying run under the user trying to log in rather than the webserver? (app pool identity?) I haven't played with IIS 7.5 yet, but up to IIS 7.0, the access to a protected page file (i.e., one configured not to allow anonymous access to) is controlled by the NTFS permissions of the file (and the permissions of the folders up in the path of the file). So as long as 'Users'[*] group (which contains both machine local users and domain-wide users, by default) has read permission and execute permission on the file that should work. [*] Replace 'Users' group with any security group you want to use to control access to that file (page). So I block permissions inheritance on that file (copying the permissions from the parent folder) and add the 'Users' group (if it's not already there) with read and execute permissions. I also completely remove IIS_IUSRS permissions on the file (only on that particular file), although I'm pretty sure there's no need for it once you remote 'Allow Anonymous Access' setting from the file in IIS settings. That should be enough (it certainly is with IIS 6.0 and 7.0). Saludos.\nIñaki.",

          "Text": "I'm testing an upgrade from Moodle 1.8.1 to 1.9.1+ (downloaded on 09/06/08) on my local pc, having restored a backup from our production server , running on Windows, PostgreSQL 8.2.3, PHP 5.2.2, Apache 2.2. The upgrade seemed to go ok, but I have a problem with user authentication. We are using the external db method (connecting to an Oracle database ). firstname, lastname and phone are set to ‘update local on every login’ and are locked, all other fields are set to ‘update local on creation’ and are unlocked. The problem I am having is that as soon as a user logs in, the user profile screen is displayed with the message “ Please tell us more about yourself”, because the firstname and lastname fields are empty, apparently having been overwritten by new values from the external db. As these fields are locked there is no opportunity to reinput them so the only way to continue is to reinsert the values in the database using pgadmin. Having tried a bit of debugging, I have got as far as the get_userinfo() function in moodle\\auth\\db\\auth.php where I found that the sql select statement is ok, and $fields_obj seems to be populated correctly, but the value of $result[$localname] returned by $textlib->convert is NULL. This line produces an entry in the error log like \" PHP Notice: Undefined property ADOFetchObj::$firstname in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\htdocs\\moodle\\auth\\db\\auth.php… \"Elsewhere in this forum it is suggested that this may be due to case mismatch between PHP ADOdb field names and Oracle column names. I’ve now reached the limit of my knowledge, so I don’t know where to check this or how to correct it. Maybe I’ve inadvertently overwritten a setting somewhere, as it all works fine in Moodle1.8.

Following https://docs.moodle.org/29/en/NTLM_authentication I'm not able to configure Samba correctly and join Active Directory. Ldap module already works.  In \"Assumptions\" section  it says \"The Server hosting your website is a member of the Active Directory Domain that your users are also members of\". Do CentOS server and Active Directory have to be in the same network and/or in the same domain?(I don't understand if this \"Assumption\" is the same of the join operation that is described in the \"Using the NTLM part of Samba for Apache on Linux\" or It is another thing). This was the first question, then I have to know how to configure Samba configuration files. The above documentation is not very detailed. Sorry but I'm a beginner. Another problem is that I haven't Administrator account in the Active Directory (Join operation seems to require this), then I have to know all steps in detail before communicating all I need to System Administrators (for example network/domain operations). We have other web applications with Active Directory Single Sign On, but they are in a Windows environment. Sorry for my english. I hope someone can help a beginner ;) Thank you!",

You want to configure your CentOS server as a Samba AD Member server. The Samba documentation on how to do this can be found at https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_a_Samba_AD_Member_Server That documentation still asumes certain familiarity with Unix and Active Directory administration though. Regarding your second question, yes, you need an Active Directory domain account with \"Add machine accounts\" privilege (it's something like that, I'm going by memory). By default Domain Administrators have that privilege, but it can be assigned to other accounts (e.g., accounts in the \"Account Operators\" group get that privilege too). So you probably want to do all this hand in hand (i.e. sitting side by side) with one of your Active Directory administrators.",

Once I'd enabled the setting and re-enrolled the student into one of his courses all of his submitted assignments and grades came back. I just need to re-enrol them on the rest of their courses. I've checked our Azure Active Directory and there were no issues with the students account, it hadn't been disabled or deleted. I'm at a loss as to why Moodle decided to delete the account, I'm just grateful that the deletion didn't ripple through Azure or it could have been a lot more serious. I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. I'm assuming it happened during the sync with Azure AD (but I could be wrong) as the deletion happened at 12:06am. The deletion was started by the Admin User and had an Origin of cli according to the logs. The process went through deleting all of the users grades, unenrolled them from all of their courses and then deleted their account.",

To resolve the issue :- In moodle\\login\\index.php around line 264 the following code /// Redirect to alternative login URL if needed if (!empty($CFG->alternateloginurl)) { $loginurl = $CFG->alternateloginurl; Was ammended to /// Redirect to alternative login URL if needed if (!empty($CFG->alternateloginurl)) { $loginurl = $CFG-> wwwroot .'/'.$CFG->alternateloginurl; Thus removing the need to specify http://myserver/moodle/ and allowing internal and external access to  function correctly.",

I've used method 1 for 1.9 and above from the moodle docs authentication page. I've restarted the server not just Apache. Moodle comes up fine, but it doesn't log you in. No single sign on going on. I've checked the Apache error logs - nothing. I've checked the moodle logs to ensure the IP is in the correct range. I don't know what to look for now.

Rather than the suggested 'rolling release upgrades' which is a boat load of work and leaves lingering older code around, i moved everything aside and simply pulled down the stable 23 branch from git and basically started from scratch - matching all the settings, etc from the 2.1.2 version this was replacing. Then, restored all the courses from backups i had performed earlier. My issue now is basically authentication. I have LDAP enabled and working - but for the pre-existing users from the other system, i simply exported them from the mdl_user table (except for the ajax column which wasnt in the 23 version of mdl_user) and then imported them into the new database . Admin can still log in, and LDAP users can still login (even though moodle sort of recreates this account so any roles tied to an LDAP user have to be redone), but for some reason manual and email based accounts are failing. I have tried to find Helen's document on this issue for moodle 18 but that has since been deleted. But i believe the gist of it was to ensure that the authentication methods were enabled and visible, which they are. Does anyone else have any other suggestions? I am unable to add a few of these key accounts to site manager role and i need to get this fixed. Thank you for any advice in advance Michael Weiner",

Now in 1.95, the completion of 1st logon involves a verification email. In a school scenario this causes a lot of inconvenience - at least a delay (in many cases students cannot access their 'home' email in school). If they don't recieve the email they are in a perpetual loop as they can never complete registration - if they manually enter their email again in their profile, another email is sent. Is this change of behaviour intentional? It makes the switch to ldap MUCH more inconvenient for our school! Any suggestions to avoid this email verification?",

We will use SSO to decide if we don't have an issue with 365 then the users can use 365 authentication, if we have an issue, then the authentication will happen using the LDAP Is this option applicable in Moodle to have a customized authentication plugin that communicates with the SSO and then allows the users to log in?",

Issue: When I attempt to get into Moodle using an LDAP user I get \"LDAP-module cannot connect to any servers: Server : 'ldaps.*********.edu', Connection: 'Resource id #88', Bind result:\".  I know for a fact it is not a networking or url or something like that since I can use another service on the same server also using LDAPS.  The issue is a certificate issue. The solution is (from research of documentation and other threads) is ignore certs or load certs, to simply state it.  I would prefer to load certificates. Ignore by adding line \"TLS_REQCERT never\" to C:\\OpenLDAP\\sysconf\\ldap.conf restart IIS .  Doesn't work for my situation, same error.  Or you can add the certs by adding line \"TLS_CACERT C:\\openldap\\sysconf\\certs.pem\"  then add a appended PEM file of certs to that folder, mine looks approximately like below, this also did not work. This may be an openssl or openldap issue on my server, c:\\OpenLDAP did not exist i had to create it?

In a forum from a couple years back ( https://invisioncommunity.com/forums/topic/359475-ipboard-password-hashing-is-no-longer-secure/ ), someone indicates that IPS uses a combination of an md5 salt + and md5 of the password, and then both of those are hashed again. I do not believe Moodle DB auth is going to inherently understand this. It would be worthwhile to find out exactly what IPS uses for password hashing in the version you are using. Once you know that, you might be able to modify Moodle db auth plugin to work with IPS password hashes.",

I can only put the IPS name into one of the two.  I cannot find a way in the site administration to remove a given name or surname requirement.  Am I missing something?  I have found topics from 4+ years ago talking about editing a php file but do not know if that is still the current way to remove that requirement.",

The user accounts are created successfully, and I've created the CSV file as per this post: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=150111 I understand that each new user should get a \"New user account\" email with their Moodle-generated temporary password as per this page: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-21321 . I am not sure if the issue may be related to the bug logged on this ticket. After creating the user accounts, I can send a message to the created user accounts via the Moodle Bulk User Actions > Send Message functionality and they will receive an email, so the issue does not seem to be SMTP or spam related. I've tested this on Moodle 1.9.7 (Build: 20091126) and Moodle 1.9.9+ (Build: 20100707). Any help would be appreciated. Thank you,",

Unfortunately the email will only be generated after the cron script has been executed 10 times (average): 20% chance to generate the new user account passwords and then 20% chance to sent the \"New user account\" email. Can we move the new user password and email generation outside of the \"if ($random100 < 20)\" section of the cron script, to reduce the random delay on the generation of new user accounts with generated password fields? Will this put a lot of stress on the system if it executes with every scheduled cron script run? Thanks, John Grobler",

However if you've already configured OpenLDAP to accept the LDAP server's certificate and your ldapsearch is working via LDAPS then I wouldn't expect this to be a problem. It's probably still worth trying, one thing I've had in the past is configuring OpenLDAP just for my user but Moodle running as Apache won't see that configuration.",

He receives no confirmation email. We can, however, see the new account in Site Administration and we can confirm it manually. We also get the same error if the user forgets the password and uses the Forgotten Password form to retrieve it. In this case also, no email is sent to the user. We did try in the Site Administration -> Server -> Email to specify custom SMTP host , username and password, but it did not help.... Any ideas why this problem and how to resolve it? We're using Moodle 1.9.7 (Build: 20091126) and PHP Version 5.3.0. Thank you a lot in advance for any suggestions...",

(Moodle 3.8) The issue I'm running into exactly matches this (closed) thread from a couple of years ago: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=370241 I've traced the issue to: moodle/lib/oauthlib.php::515 'state' => $this->returnurl->out_as_local_url(false), if I set the argument value of out_as_local_url (escaped) to TRUE it works. Basically, the core logic expects sesskey to be a query-parameter of the state request parameter, but because the argument is improperly escaped, sesskey is a param of the request. Currently, the only alternative I can find, that doesn't involve hacking core, is creating a new oauth auth-plugin to change one line in login.php to correctly encode the state request parameter.

In the case of auth_nntp, and auth_pam we are technically able to test these, but there are better methods of authentication these days and, in my opinion, these should not be promoted by core. Benefits: Reduced maintenance overhead Fewer options in the list of authentication plugin options We will be able to more easily test all of the authentication plugins in Moodle Drawbacks: They won't be included in core Is anyone actually using any of these plugins still? Are there any issues with removing these? If you have any objection to the removal of these plugins from core, please comment in the issue relating to it - MDL-50925 .

In 1.7 the table mdl_user_students dissapeared. I think this has something to do with the new role system in 1.7. Is it in 1.7 still possible to enrol the inserted students to a course? If so, which tables I need to use? Thanks! update: Or is it possible use the function 'enrol_student($user->id, $course[$i]->id);' which is used in uploaduser.php?",

I can sync the ldap users to the Linux server using the included sync_user.php in the cli folder. Now my understanding is, this php file uses the same settings that are in the ldap authentication plugin page. Or am I incorrect? When I log in to the server using a manual admin account, I can see all the new users. I however, can not log in to the same server, using the username and password I know is already supplied from the ldap server. How can I sync the users using the CLI file, but not be able to login to the server? This is possibly the most annoyed I have gotten with something in a while, so any help shining a light on the problem or how to fix it would be great. The linux server is not attached to the AD forest(test system), but it can 'see' and ping the LDAP servers. Like I said I can download and sync all the AD users and I can see them both in the database and the physical page. So I'm unsure why I can not login. Thank you for your time, Lee Kirkland",

Our database was showing more than one hundred users with confirmed = 0, deleted = 0 since our upgrade from Moodle 2.7. Unfortunately, this prevents them to create a new account, because email addresses are already registered. We have checked the code in lib/classes/task/delete_unconfirmed_users_task.php and we think we have found the bug in the SQL query that retrieves the users to be deleted: `$rs = $DB->get_recordset_sql (\"SELECT * FROM {user} WHERE confirmed = 0 AND firstaccess > 0 AND firstaccess < ? AND deleted = 0\", array($cuttime));` ($cuttime is current time - deleteunconfirmed threshold, 7 days by default.) All these unconfirmed users have firstaccess = 0 in database, because login/signup.php sets $user->firstaccess = 0 when the account is created. This way the AND condition is never matched. And this didn’t happen before upgrading because in Moodle 2.7 login/signup.php set $user->firstaccess = time(), i. e. account creation time, not zero. If you are experiencing this problem too, could you please have a look at the tracker and vote for this bug to be fixed? [MDL-54106] Delete unconfirmed users not working because firstaccess == 0",

If the given username and password are valid, Moodle creates a new user entry in its database . This module can read user attributes from LDAP and prefill wanted fields in Moodle. For following logins only the username and password are checked. LDAP server settings Host URL ldap://staff.det.win/ Specify LDAP host in URL-form like 'ldap://ldap.myorg.com/' or 'ldaps://ldap.myorg.com/' Separate multipleservers with ';' to get failover support. Version 3 The version of the LDAP protocol your server is using. LDAP encoding utf-8 Specify encoding used by LDAP server. Most probably utf-8, MS AD v2 uses default platform encoding such as cp1252, cp1250, etc. Bind settings Hide passwords Yes Select yes to prevent passwords from being stored in Moodle's DB. Distinguished Name dapqueries@western_sydney.det.win If you want to use bind-user to search users, specify it here. Something like 'cn=ldapuser,ou=public,o=org' Password ********* Password for bind-user. User lookup settings User type MS ActiveDirectoryDefault Select how users are stored in LDAP. This setting also specifies how login expiration, grace logins and user creation will work. Contexts ou=Accounts,dc=staff,dc=det,dc=win List of contexts where users are located. Separate different contexts with ';'. For example: 'ou=users,o=org; ou=others,o=org' Search subcontexts Yes Search users from subcontexts. Dereference aliases No Determines how aliases are handled during search. Select one of the following values: \"No\" (LDAP_DEREF_NEVER) or \"Yes\" (LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS) User attribute sAMAccountName Optional: Overrides the attribute used to name/search users. Usually 'cn'. Member attribute Optional: Overrides user member attribute, when users belongs to a group. Usually 'member' Member attribute uses dn Optional: Overrides handling of member attribute values, either 0 or 1 Object class Optional: Overrides objectClass used to name/search users on ldap_user_type. Usually you dont need to chage this. Force change password Force change password No Force users to change password on their first login to Moodle. Use standard Change Password Page No If the external authentication system allows password changes through Moodle, switch this to Yes. This setting overrides 'Change Password URL'. NOTE: It is recommended that you use LDAP over an SSL encrypted tunnel (ldaps://) if the LDAP server is remote. Password format Plain text Specify the format of new or changed passwords in LDAP server. Password-change URL Here you can specify a location at which your users can recover or change their username/password if they've forgotten it. This will be provided to users as a button on the login page and their user page. if you leave this blank the button will not be printed. LDAP password expiration settings. Expiration LDAP Select No to disable expired password checking or LDAP to read passwordexpiration time directly from LDAP Expiration warning Number of days before password expiration warning is issued. Expiration attribute Optional: overrides ldap-attribute that stores password expiration time Grace logins No Enable LDAP gracelogin support. After password has expired user can login until gracelogin count is 0. Enabling this setting displays grace login message if password is exprired. Grace login attribute Optional: Overrides gracelogin attribute Enable user creation Create users externally No New (anonymous) users can create user accounts on the external authentication source and confirmed via email. If you enable this , remember to also configure module-specific options for user creation. Context for new users If you enable user creation with email confirmation, specify the context where users are created. This context should be different from other users to prevent security issues. You don't need to add this context to ldap_context-variable, Moodle will search for users from this context automatically. Note! You have to modify the method user_create() in file auth/ldap/auth.php to make user creation work Course creator Creators List of groups whose members are allowed to create new courses. Separate multiple groups with ';'. Usually something like 'cn=teachers,ou=staff,o=myorg' Cron synchronization script Removed ext user Keep Internal Specify what to do with internal user account during mass synchronization when user was removed from external source. Only suspended users are automatically revived if they reappear in ext source. Data mapping First name givenName These fields are optional. You can choose to pre-fill some Moodle user fields with information from the LDAP fields that you specify here. If you leave these fields blank, then nothing will be transferred from LDAP and Moodle defaults will be used instead. In either case, the user will be able to edit all of these fields after they log in. Update local: If enabled, the field will be updated (from external auth) every time the user logs in or there is a user synchronization. Fields set to update locally should be locked. Lock value: If enabled, will prevent Moodle users and admins from editing the field directly. Use this option if you are maintaining this data in the external auth system. Update external: If enabled, the external auth will be updated when the user record is updated. Fields should be unlocked to allow edits. Note: Updating external LDAP data requires that you set binddn and bindpw to a bind-user with editing privileges to all the user records. It currently does not preserve multi-valued attributes, and will remove extra values on update.

As it stands, if I set it up for MNET, I can only allow them to login if I set MNET authentication to create new users. It will then create that account as a new user without any enrollments. I love the idea of MNET because it gives me SSO without a lot of hassle that I'm not sure I want to undertake. But I need it to check to see if the user exists, and if so, pass the username and password across to see if it can log them in. I could probably accomplish this by creating a single site that everything is funneled through, but that seems to defeat my purpose of separating the sites to make it more manageable.",

I'm in a situation where my educational service agency will soon be creating approximately 17 instances of Moodle - one for each school district. The teachers will need to be actively moving between their district Moodle and our regional Moodle. Ideally, I would prefer that they not have to log in again. I've already investigated Mnet, but unfortunately that won't work because of the duplicate accounts it creates. In my scenario, both the district Moodle and the regional Moodle authenticate against the same LDAP . At the regional level we have SSO configured for a half dozen different external applications. Now I would like some sort of SSO between instances of Moodle. I'm sure that there must be a way of doing this, I just haven't found it yet. Any thoughts would be appreciated!",

In the meantime though, I was working on another solution, and posted my findings in the following thread: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=155923#p685206 Basically, I created a block that used captured credentials and passed those on to a secondary moodle site when a form was activated by the onclick of a hyperlinked image.

What is the best way to let this anonymous access work while enabling shibboleth authentification ? We found the way to have a back door entrance that enables external users and anonymous to enter, but it is not simple for users.

Additionally, what is the attribute you have configured in the LDAP 'user attribute' setting? Last but not least, you say it doesn't work but, does it mean you get the regular login page directly (with no SSO attempt page at all) or do you get the SSO attempt page and then a message telling you that it failed and you are redirected to the regular login page? I ask this, because the root causes can be quite different in both cases. Saludos. Iñaki.",

Just to make sure, if you execute in your linux box: `wbinfo -u` do you get the list of the usernames as 'domain\\username' or just as 'username'? I'd say you'll get the latter, which is a problem for Moodle right now. Moodle expects both the domain part and the username part. If you can't change that setting (because you need it that way for other applications) you'll need to patch Moodle to work with just the username (though I'm proposing a new feature in MDL-31968 to make this configurable via the LDAP configuration settings).

Only suspended users are automatically revived if they reappear in ext source. Does this mean that when Moodle connects to LDAP it creates an internal username for the person when they log in (which i know it does since i can see usernames in the user table of my moodle database ). Therefore if you want to remove the user from the user table permanently, I should set this option to \"Full Delete Internal\". This option has nothing to do with users created manually (ie not created by ldap).",

To not do ldap lookups if the user exists and ldap updating is not set to every login, emailing the admin when failures occur. To allow for tiered failover in case the CAS load balancers are problematic, emailing admins when failures occur. The biggest changes would be the updating of phpcas to the latest version, supporting single-sign-out, and more forgiveness in case of networking failures.

          "Text": "Few question about enrollment, unenrollment, grades and other reports in Moodle 2.0. We are currently running Moodle 1.9 but are planning migration to 2.0 because of some problems with our customized scorm module. We're hoping that original SCORM module in 2.0 will work fine with content made in Articulate tools. It gave us a lot of headaches in 1.9. We're hoping for some better enrollment and scorm reporting tools in 2.0 as well. Manipulation with large user groups (hundreds of users in each group) is not an easy job if you have to enroll them, unenroll them, extend their enrollments, periodicaly generate grade reports for a lot of large groups etc... We use CSV import method to create user accounts, enroll users in courses and put them in separate groups. In Moodle 2.0 there is new option to timelimit enrollment and that's great. What happens with reports and grades after user's enrollment expires? Are user's grades reports still available to teacher after user is unenrolled? Is unenrolled user still listed in grade book? If not, will his old grades be available again after we enroll him again in the same course through CSV? Is it possible to manipulate a large group of users in a way that they can't access a course after certain date but their grades are still available after that date? In Moodle 1.9.x we used CSV importer at the end of the learning period to assign them a custom role in a course with no permission to access anything. We would like to avoid double work because we have to do the CSV importing twice: once to enroll them and once to assign them the custom role after the course learning period. will this method work in Moodle 2.0? Is it possible to extend enrollment period for group of users through the CSV or by using course groups? For example: 1000 users are enrolled for 30days in a course and are put in a separate group in that course. How to reenroll this group of users after enrollment expires? How to extend their enrollment period before their enrollment expires? is it possible to set periodic automatic emailing of grade book report to teacher? Is there any plugin for that purpose for Moodle 1.9 or 2.0? A lot of questions... I hope my English is good enogh. Regards, Z.",

I've tried calling the delete_user function defined in /lib/moodlelib.php , this seems to delete a lot of the data associated with the user, but leaves a record in the mdl_users table. This seems to be to allow 'account recovery' based upon the email address. This sounds quite unsafe for us, as we recycle email addresses when students leave. Can anyone tell me: 1) Is it safe to modify moodlelib.php to simply delete the record from mdl_user instead of modifying it? 2) What actually gets recovered (as most stuff seems to have been fully deleted) when an account is recovered.

          "Text": "I ran into a problem in setting up our instance of Moodle while trying to get the LDAP authentication module to work completely. While I had no problems pointing it to our directory server and having users authenticate, I ran into problems with the automatic granting of course creator status. Digging into the code, I found that the current LDAP authentication module expects that the user's LDAP object contains attributes that specify the groups of which a user is a member. Our directory is set up slightly differently: group objects contain attributes that list the members of the group. This is apparently a fairly common way of organizing a directory, at least to those of us that come from the Unix and NIS universe (it's exactly the same concept as the Unix /etc/passwd and /etc/group files). In order to make creator status work with our directory, I wrote a new LDAP module based on the current one, but with a significantly altered auth_iscreator() function that looks up the group objects that contain attributes listing the currently logged in user (I also added the helper function auth_ldap_get_grouplist()). As our account management is done entirely outside the scope of Moodle, I also removed the user creation, activation, and disabling functions of the original LDAP module. Rather than make these changes to the original LDAP module, I thought that the groups structure represented a fundamental enough conceptual departure to warrant a completely separate module, at least to start out. (I certainly wouldn't be adverse to folding the two back together at some point.) The new module is called ldap2307, after the RFC number that contains this directory structure specification. I consider this module to be completely functional and stable, however it has had a limited testing environment. I have tested it in Moodle v1.1.1 and the current 1.2 beta against a Sun ONE directory server, and a colleague has tested it against OpenLDAP. We've found no problems with the code as it currently stands, although it's entirely possible that you'll have a local configuration that exposes a \"gotcha\". In the attached ZIP file, there is the ldap2307 authentication module and two language files: auth.php.new and auth.php.diff. The .new is a complete version of the lang/en/auth.php file with text for this module added. The .diff file is a \"diff\" against the original lang/en/auth.php file in Moodle v1.2 beta; you can apply it to your version with the Unix \"patch\" command.",

Is there a better way? -Is it necessary for the parent to have a separate account ?  (Teacher would have a separate account and role) These questions need to be answered because the children can't login themselves and even for completing the assignment they would need the teacher and/or parent to help them.",

The teacher can create the account for the child, but when the child is at school how does the teacher help the child ? I suppose the teacher will help the child login and then help complete the activities. When the child goes home, how does the parent help the child? Option a) Parent has the credentials of the child as the teacher provides it to the parent. b) Parent has a separate account with oversight rights to the child. I am not sure whether this will allow the parent to help the child complete activities A bit confused about all this. Your suggestions/ideas would help. I think people should not be sharing credentials. If parent creates credentials then advantage is that even if the teacher or school is changed they can still access the child's work and allow other teachers to help the child.",

          "Text": "I would say that the type1 to type5 fields are for backward compatibility. Prior to Moodle 1.7, roles were fixed (Editing Teacher, Student, Non-editing teacher), so they could have numeric codes (1, 2, 3). Sarting with Moodle 1.7, the aforementioned roles were still there (they consititute \"predefined\" roles) but you could also define new roles -- in fact, an open-ended number of new roles like Parent. It would be impossible to assign universal numeric codes to such roles. Instead, he role names themselves must be used (use the roles' \"short name\"). The upload format lets you upload up to five roles for each user (role1 in course1, role2 in course2, etc.) and possibly even in a group context (role1 in group1 of course1, role2 in group2 of course2). If you have not defined any new roles and are only using the predefined roles, go ahead and use the type fields. If I were you I would experiment. Create a short sample upload file, login to demo.moodle.org as admin, upload your file and see how it works.",

The Moodle test account user@email.com is configured to use SAML2 as authent. method. user@email.com also exists in Salesforce using the same password. Part of the Salesforce configuration I have got from the other company. SAML SP Settings: Entity ID: https://..moodle.com/auth/saml2/sp/metadata.php; ACS URL : https://..moodle.com/auth/saml2/sp/saml2-acs.php/..moodle.com Issuer: https://..salesforce.com Verify Request Signatures: no value set Subject Type: Federation ID Test logging in at the Salesforce site as user@email.com : When logged in, clicking the MoodleApp opens a second tab in the web browser where the user is redirected to .. https://..moodle.com/login/index.php as expected. But the \"Username\" field is empty. Shouldn't it contain user@email.com ? Therefore, clicking on \"Login via SAML2\" results in an exception (NOSTATE), clicking \"Continue\" gives a second exception (ACSPARAMS), and third time ends in \"Secure Connection Failed\". Debugging steps: I have run both tests (using \"isPassive\" and \"isAuthenticated and login\") both with the same response from the IdP, see attached isPassive_isAuthenticated.txt file. I also captured SAML2- and Moodle- debug data. Please, see the attached error.log Tommy",

Shibboleth SP links: Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) 2.6 Installation Guide Installing Shibboleth 2.x SP on RedHat based Linux NativeSPLinuxInstall Shibboleth is installed as a standalone and no extra Moodle plugin is required to be installed, it's already integrated in Moodle, only activate it. simplesamlphp SP links: Installing a SimpleSAMLphp SP Moodle plugin (standalone simpleSAMLphp required) SAML2 Single signon links: This is the simpliest SP solution to work with, since simplesamlphp is integrated in the SAML2 plugin. I will recommend you to use this Moodle plugin. Moodle plugin (SAML2 Single sign on; simplesamlphp integrated) Hope this will give you something to start with. BR Tommy",

Recently we've decided that we would like to change the default message \" Attempting single sign on via NTLM\" displayed for users upon them automatically being logged in. I've had a look through the php files in the auth -> ldap directory and found a reference to a variable that contains this string, however I have not found the actual string itself.

She does not have a role set at the site level, if that matters.  We are using 1.7+ version of Moodle.  I am racking my brain and about ready to use an older version that I know works (like 1.6+).

The LDAP server I am trying to connect to is a Netware 6.5 SP5 server. The web server I am using for Moodle is running SLES 10. I have set up the Host URL to ldap://ldapserver_ip, Version is 3. I then set the Bind Settings to Hide Passwords and the distinguished name to cn=ldapuser,ou=tech,o=treename. I chose usertype as NovellEdirectory and setup the context where my user is located. I also made some additional optional changes, but they shouldn't have anything to do with connecting. I also checked the LDAP server and set Bind Restrictions to \"Disallow anonymous simple bind.\" I'm not sure what else I need to do. I've been searching online, but I haven't found any solutions yet. I would appreciate any help I can get. Thank you. Chris",

If the passwords don't match (but a user with that name actually exists in that ldap server ), Moodle will refuse the login saying that either the username or the password are wrong. If the user doesn't exist in the first ldap server it will try with the second and apply the same logic.

Hope that helps, Brian Edit - Rereading your question, I think you are having an issue with the bind user not accessing AD through the LDAP authentication module. In the in Distinguished Name field, you will need to put the entire tree to the bind user (i.e. CN=binduseraccount,OU=org unit,DC=domain,DC=domain). LDP.exe will give this to you by browsing to the bind user, right click and Copy DN - then paste that in the Distinguished Name field on the LDAP Auth settings page in Moodle.",

          "Title": "\"Linked Gmail Accounts\" solve the no-email address problem?",
          "Text": "Sign Me Up! The Elementary Email Solution: Linked Gmail Accounts Kim Cofino writes: One of my biggest stumbling blocks as I’ve switched gears from middle to elementary school is individual e-mail accounts for the students. Back in middle school, I could always count on every student having their own e-mail account. Even if, for some strange reason, one or two students didn’t have one, I could just ask them to sign up for one before the next class and it would be done. Alas, nothing is quite that easy at the elementary level…. In our case, for lower elementary students, we really only need each student to have an individual, permanent, e-mail address to sign up for other services (not to actually send and receive e-mail). So, in order to get our second grade class up and running with Ning accounts for our Global Village project (which, of course, require a consistent e-mail address for log in purposes - no mailenator for us), and in preparation for all of our Global Communication Center projects, I spent less than an hour today solving my problem, thanks to Gmail. Basically, Gmail allows you to create subsidiary accounts linked to an individual Gmail account. Check out this great screencast demonstrating how to create linked Gmail accounts that Alec Courosa made with Jing earlier today (I need to start getting the kids to make screencasts with Jing next - what a great way to create tutorials!). Basically, this means that one teacher can have 20 permanent e-mail accounts that are all delivered into one teacher e-mail account. Therefore, if the teacher account is teacher@gmail.com, all you have to do is add a “+studentname” before the @ symbol to make a linked account. Therefore mail sent to teacher+studentname@gmail.com will go straight to teacher@gmail.com. Of course, given that Gmail terms and conditions require users to be over 18, we did send out a permission slip to all parents to get their formal approval that we create these linked accounts.

In particular, some users are not more able to login even if the credentials (username and password) are valid. We are analyzing the problem and it seems that the problem is due to the hash algorithm used for storing the passwords. Following the use case: If the hash algorithm for the stored password is $2y$04, the user cannot login and he has to change the password (even if the password is still valid). If the hash algorithm for the stored password is $2y$10, the user correctly logs in. For the new user, there is not that problem. The user is able to change the default password (we force the password change at the first access) and the user correctly logs in. We are not setting the type of hash algorithm to be used by Moodle for the password storage and it seems that the chosen algorithm is random. Does someone know if recently some Moodle settings are changed related to the authentication? How is it possible to avoid and permanently solve that problem? Thank you for your help!",

The issue is observed only for accounts which in the past had the password hashed with fasthash, i.e. only 04 iterations and the system did not upgrade as it should do by default to 10 iterations when the user changes the password. The users which force-change the password these days have the hash correctly upgraded to 10. Why in the past this did not happen and they still have 04 after password change? Why now the system doesn't know to check the password hashed with 04 as it is correctly in the database , for the users which had change their password in time? It does only for new users, since end of March 2022, who have force-password-change flag and the new hash is done in background without any impact to the user experience. So for us the only solution is to ask the users to do Forgot password. Thank you",

We've tried setting the \"Remove ext user\" option on the LDAP settings page to both \"Suspend internal\" and \"Full delete internal\", neither of which did anything.\n\nHere's what we did:\n1. Create the test user in LDAP, and login to it in Moodle to create the account.\n2. Log out of the test user.\n3. Delete the account from LDAP.\n4. Run the cron.php script.\n5. Manually run the auth_ldap_sync_users.php script from the command line.\n\nThe end result is absolutely no change whatsoever to the user in Moodle. We're unable to log back into it, as the LDAP server rejects the login, but the account itself is still listed in the various user lists.\n\nWhat do we need to run in order to get Moodle to deal with users deleted from LDAP?",

Documentation for implementing the LDAP libraries into a compliation of PHP 1. Download Windows Binary Zip Package of PHP Version. Included in this Zip package are several folders. 2. Copy entire contets of 'dlls' to the System32 Folder 3. Make a folder entitled 'phpextensions' on the hard drive 4. Copy entire contets of 'extensions' to the 'phpextensions' folder on the hard drive 5. Open the php.ini file. It can be found in the windows base folder. 6 If GD, Scroll to step 10 7. Scroll down to a section entitled 'Paths and Directories' 8. There are two lines that read: ; Directory in which the loadable extensions (modules) reside. extension_dir = \"/extensions\" 9. Replace /extensions with 'c:\\phpextensions' (The folder we made in step 3.) 10. Scroll down to a section entitled 'Dynamic Extensions' 11. There will be a list of extensions commented out with semi-colons, directly above that, add the line '--with-ldap' This is the GD switch that tells PHP to use the GD libraries. 12. Scroll down to a line that is commented out by a semi-colon that reads: ;extension=php_ldap.dll 13. Uncomment out that line by removing the semi-colon so it reads like: extension=php_ldap.dll 14. Save file and reload phpinfo.php script. 15. Open the Zip package of the PHP compilation and copy the entire contents over the PHP root directory. Over-write all files. 16. If phpinfo.php does not exist, create a text file and put the following line in: <?php phpinfo(); ?> 17. Save file as 'phpinfo.php' and place in root directory of web server (where php scripts are hosted) 18. Open file from web browser, and scroll down to a table that is headed by 'ldap', if the table exists, the LDAP libraries have been successfully compiled.",

I am wondering if you are seeing a different version of the same bug we found with the enrollment syncing when used with Oracle. It didn't cause any error messages, but enrollment syncing didn't work due to oracle field names being cast to all caps but Moodle being coded to expect all lower case. If you don't see any errors post back and I will have someone look into the code to see if this is the same type of bug we found before.",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm using Moodle (the swiss army knife of content mangement) to set up a site for students in my kids school to select which lunches they want. Overkill, but I'm trying to convince them to use it for more than just this, so this is the nose of the camel under the tent. Since most of the kids won't have their own email, I'm assuming that parents will sign up for the kids. Some families have multiple children. Parents will probably want to associate their own email with multiple accounts. In the 1.4.3+ CVS tree, I enabled this by commenting out the line in login/signup.php that says... \n```text\n       $err->email = get_string(\"emailexists\").\" <A HREF=forgot_password.php>\".get_string(\"newpassword\").\"?</A\\\n```\n Is there a problem with doing this? This would cause multiple accounts to have the same email. The database doesn't indicate that these fields are unique, but I'm curious if there's an assumption in the code about uniqueness?",

Seems like all the users who had not logged into Moodle previously are imported. Then, I have a faculty member who is trying to add a student to her class, and that student doesn't exist in Moodle! I had our network admin check them out in LDAP, and everything is the same there as all of the other students who have been imported. That same faculty proceeded to find 5 others that weren't imported into Moodle. I'm having a hard time tracking down the problem area. I know my script ends with: User entries to add: 2 Inserted user JohnDoe id 1945 Error inserting user But that's all I can find out. JohnDoe exists in Moodle. Any idea how I might find out more info to track this problem down?

What I am not sure of is whether there is anything special about Meta Courses. However I would wonder if you are using ldap for enrollment automation why you would use Meta Courses? Meta Courses really work in the opposite fashion. If you are inrolled in a child course you are automatically enrolled in the Meta Course. I haven't ever checked to see if you get an automated enrollment in a child course using either ldap or external DB enrollment if you still end up in the meta course or not. But hasn't generally been an issue since when I do these integrations I am mapping all the course enrollments that I want to happen automatically anyway.",

This has to be done automatically without any manual intervention. Could you please provide suggestions on how this could be done? I do know that we could use APIs to do this but it would be really helpful if you could elaborate more on this. I want to know, what information does moodle exactly require from the system to register a user and get him to access the course? Many thanks in advance.",

          "Text": "Sakina, How you do this would depend on a number of factors, some of which are: the web services or other API available in the course booking system where the integration code will live - Moodle, course reg system, separate application (i.e. some form of middleware) Possible scenario: user books a course on the course booking site when they \"finish\", they are sent to the moodle site on login to Moodle, their moodle enrolments are checked against their bookings on the cousre booking site any missing enrolments are created in moodle note, this assumes that the courses have been created and are available in Moodle before they are made bookable from the booking site If you decide to write the integration code on the Moodle side, you should implement it as a plugin (or a set of plugins). At all costs, avoid hacking core code. Hacking core will cause you a lot of grief in future. If you decide to write the integration code on the external site and call Moodle's web services API to register/enrol usrers into Moodle, you'll find the API documentation at http://your.moodle.url/admin/webservice/documentation.php helpful In terms of minimum information required by Moodle to register a user, those are: username, email, firstname and lastname. In order to enrol in a course, minimum requirements are userid, the role id, and the contextid - those terms may not mean anything to you right now, but you'll become familiar with them once you start developing your integration. Hope that helps. Muyi",

For example, let this common password be \"secret\" Next create an .htaccess file in your main Moodle directory which looks something like this. \n```text\nAuthUserFile /etc/passwd\n\n\nAuthGroupFile /dev/null\n\n\nAuthName Moodle1_2d\n\n\nAuthType Basic\n```\n \n```text\n<Limit GET>\n\n\nrequire valid-user\n\n\n</Limit>\n```\n Next add the following line to your moodle/index.php: \n```text\n  require_login();\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n Finally edit login/index.php by adding the following lines: \n```text\nif ($_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']) {\n\n\n  $frm->username = $_SERVER['REMOTE_USER'];\n\n\n  $frm->password = \"secret\";\n\n\n}  else {\n\n\n  $frm = data_submitted();\n\n\n}\n```\n right after the existing lines: \n```text\n$frm = false;\n\n\nif (!empty($SESSION->wantsurl) and strstr($SESSION->wantsurl,\"username=guest\")) {\n\n\n/// Log in as guest automatically (idea from Zbigniew Fiedorowicz)\n\n\n$frm->username = \"guest\";\n\n\n$frm->password = \"guest\";\n\n\n} else {\n\n\n$frm = data_submitted();\n\n\n}\n```\n Note to Martin: I would suggest that login/index.php be modified along the above lines in version 1.2.

I installed the \"Enrollment key based self-registration\" on Moodle 3.11 and got no errors at the time of install. I activated the authentication method and selected it from the self-enrollment settings page as directed in the instructions. When trying to create a new account using the enrollment key I made, I get the following error: \"The enrolment key you have entered is invalid\" When trying to create a new account leaving the enrollment key field empty I get: \"Enrollment key required\" <-- Someting like that I turned debugging all the way up on my site and can verify that the plugin is not throwing any coding errors. So, my guess is that the auth_test.php code (or somewhere else) is not matching the existing enrollment key (password). I see the password being set correctly in the database in a self enrollment instance so that is working correctly. I understand that funding is required to get the plugin updated by the developer, which is understandable, but I don't have access to funds at the moment so I'm trying to do it the hard way. Wonder if anyone has worked on trying to update this plugin for 3.11? Regards Jason",

Our users connect to the app using Google auth, and I was able to do the same with the moodle app using the same Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID. We would like the users to be redirected from the app to the moodle lms via a link or a button without the users having to login again if they already logged in via the app. We might even embed the lms into the app via an iframe at some point too. It would be nice if we could use some query param to achieve this. Users click on the link or the button to be redirect to https://lms.mydomain.com/?token=<ACCESS_TOKEN> ; ... And that URL could simply be used as the target URL in the iframe. Or maybe there is a better solution? Many thanks for your help.",

(I'm using Windows 2000 Active Directory -which uses LDAP-; you could use Novell or others as well.)  If a student is not already registered in Moodle, the first time they 'check in' they will have to fill in the New User form; I avoid that by uploading all students into Moodle (using the Upload User feature). I see Registering students in Moodle as only the first step. We also control Enrollment in courses; we do not allow self-enrollment. To accomplish this, we first insure that we have enrolled every student in at least one course (also using the Upload User feature).  Then we don't provide a means for users to get to a Course List (don't show the Courses block, and set Site Settings -> Front Page Format to \"Show List of Courses - then they see only the courses they've been enrolled in).  We chose to not set up Enrollment Keys for (all the) courses, tho' that is probably a more reliable method to prevent self-enrollments.",

I'm assuming there's some pending verification flag set somewhere on the user's account which just needs to be cleared, so I'm looking for guidance on how I can do that. Thank you!",

Ideally they would go to the website, login in, and then click a button that will send them to Moodle along with their account information. Once they get to Moodle, Moodle will check to see if the account information already exists. If so it will login, otherwise it will create the account and login. I already have the Moodle environment set up, as well as the login site. The Moodle site is not allowed to access the database on the login site, and the users shouldn't have to enter their information again at any point. I've already spent several hours attempting to work backwards from a plugin that accomplishes something similar between Moodle and social networking sites (facebook, twitter, google+, etc) but made no progress, as well as from a plugin that linked Moodle with Joomla, and I've searched through here and other forums for anything I could find similar to what I need to accomplish to no avail. Any help would be very appreciated. Edit: I forgot to mention that the Moodle version is 2.5.4 Edit: The following will create a new user with data posted to the \"login/index.php\" page. This is currently very incomplete and probably dangerous to implement on a production server . Updated versions will be posted as I continue to work on it, suggestions are more than welcome. \n```text\n    global $CFG, $DB;\n    require_once($CFG->\ndirroot\n.'/user/profile/lib.php');\n    require_once($CFG->libdir.'/authlib.php');\n\n    $newuser = $DB->get_record('user', array('id'=>'1'));\n    $newuser->auth = 'manual';\n    $newuser->username = $frm->username;\n    $newuser->password = hash_internal_user_password($frm->password);\n\n    $newuser->username = $DB->insert_record('user', $newuser);\n\n    /// Save any custom profile field information\n    profile_save_data($newuser);\n\n    $newuser = $DB->get_record('user', array('id'=>$newuser->username));\n    events_trigger('user_created', $newuser);\n```",

As the guy who has to take care of the accounts for it, I was thrilled to learn that it can handle LDAP authentication. It works great but there's one thing I'd like to do that I can't seem to find any information on. I have six OUs within our Windows 2k AD set up to access Moodle through LDAP authentication, three of which are set as course creators. That all works exactly as it's supposed to, but I would also like to assign Moodle roles based on which OU the users are in.  Failing that, being able to assign roles based on a memberof field would serve the same function but would require a bit more work on my part as there would be a dozen groups to be assigned. Is there any way to do either of these things?",

When new users join the organisation they are created on LDAP and then when they login to Moodle for the first time a Moodle creates a new account for them. All is well... Is there a way to inform the site administrator each time a new user is created in Moodle when they login for the first time? And is there a way for the administrator to confirm the user account when it is created? Our organisation has several branches around the country. When a user moves from Branch X to Branch Y they are given a new userid on LDAP. The result is that when they login to Moodle with this new username after they have moved branches Moodle creates a new account for them. The result is a duplicate record - the original username from Branch X and the new one from Branch Y. This is not ideal for us because we want to track the students training throughout his stay at the organisation, regardless of how many times he changes branches. By allowing an administrator to \"authorise\" all new Moodle accounts we could overcome this problem. When a new account is requested in Moodle the administrator would check if the student already exists and, if he does, simply change his old Moodle username from his old LDAP username to his new LDAP username before he authorises the request. Can this be done in Moodle?",

We use a linux back bone and windows computers,Students log onto computers using Smart Logon with a generic local profile....apparently smartlogon uses the windows authentication What I want to do is have the network logon and moodle logon and passwords to be the same..and if a kid changes the logon in windows, moodle will update.  Later I may look at single logon but at the moment thats not important.  I just don't want to have to re-enter the kids logon's and then get them to set the passwords as the same *bonus question* is it possible from the students logon to get different age groups to see different main pages. ie juniors go to a junior main page once logged in, seniors to a senior page, and staff to another? Thanks in anticipation for all you help Colin Geenty",

Finally got it working, and it works well, however we are having issues with it logging us on when we don't want to! If, for instance, a user is logged on to the Workstation as Fred.Bloggs, then it will log him in fine. However, there are instances where we may want to log in as an administrator (or a training user, etc). If we set the log on type to 'manual', then the user isn't automatically logged on. However, as soon as we enter credentials either in the log on page, or on the home page, and press log on, it goes to the 'attempting NTLM authentication' page, and appears to try and use Windows details. Our server is called 'moodle', so if we call 'http://moodle/Moodle/login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1', and enter, say, the admin credentials, it will try to go via the NTLM authentication page, then give us an 'invalid login' error. This is a bit of a problem, as I can't even get on as a site admin at the moment! Any help much appreciated. Thanks Simon",

All our student and staff accounts are set to be LDAP , admin is manual and it works fine off site. We added a block to the homepage which detects if you're on a college PC and not logged in, and if you are it offers a Manual Login link (the same skipntlmsso=1 one you mention) - and it all works fine. We use the same URL for our moodle internally as externally. So I have no idea what's up with yours - if your skipntlmsso page is bust, then you might have to replace the login and auth folders for your version/build? HTH",

What my plan is to place the usernames of the users who are to use moodle into the user table (without any password). for example out of 500 staff and 1000 students, only 50 staff and 200 students username will be stored in the moodle's users table. So when the login screen is shown and the user fills in the username and password, I first check if the username is in the user table. If not then i show the re-login screen. Else i determine which ldap server to use (staff or student). I use adLDAP to authenticate the users. If the authentication is successful, i set the moodle cookies/session and let the normal process of moodle to take place. ( Setting the moodle session/cookies is the hard part for me since i dont know what to set ) Also, some users such as observers who do not have ldap accounts, will be given a username created in the users table with a password. So if the logging in user is not in ldap, we can check it in the users table to see if such an account exits. Sorry, in my first post, i wasnt that clear. I have been trying to find a way to do this but so far i hit a dead end. I read your post on \"Moodle single signon hack\" and found it very interesting and something similar to what i want to do. Please assist. I would be very great ful to you. And i will surely document this so that others can also use it if they want to do something similar. cheers",

I cannot log into moodle using the same username and password from the external database, and when I look at the database directly all the passwords for the external db users are blank. Both databases are using utf-8 encoding. The external db uses SHA-256 encryption for the passwords and i have used a patch ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=108260 ) to theoretically enable this.

Double and triple check the settings in particular the password field. Other than that can you make a small duplicate database with just a couple of test users in but no SHA-256 then point to that just to rule that out?",

          "Text": "I have a few concerns with the ldap implementation. First: the ldap bind password fields in both the authentication and enrollment pages is returned to the browser, and the enrollment page is in a text box not even a password box. Some may argue this is unimportant as you can simply use a non priviledged user for your queries.  but what if you want to provide the ability for users to update personal information and have it reflected in in ldap.  I am infinatly familiar with both active directory as well as NDS and their respective implementations of LDAP and in both cases this requires and administrative login to accomplish updates to user accounts. This poses a huge security hole for those of us using ldap.  Can someone tell me where these usernames and passwords are stored? can they be encrypted(even a syncronous hash would be better than none)?  Can the passwords be removed from the query that populates the enrollment and authentication forms(i.e. if blank dont change password)? As those passwords are easily read by viewing the soruce html. Second: in an ldap implementation the user idnumber is used to compare to group membership for the purposes of enrollment. this field is limited to 64 characters, anyone with an ldap tree more than one level deep can easily exceed 64 characters.  I increased mine to 128 and I'm not 100% sure if that is enough.  When you start adding in all the cn=, ou=,dc=, and ',' it doesnt take much to fill it up.  To make this change the database table had to be altered and two php files had to be modified.  Now I'm not one who likes to create unused space in a database but that is the advantage of varchar fields.  as for the arrays how about we dont limit them at all. and lastly who cares about temp tables they are flushed when finished.",

Unfortunatlely the work got suspended and no higher version to SSO moodle and Mambo is available now. Only when an enterprising community member contributes a code keeping pace with version changes both in Moodle and Joomla you will be happy to fulfil your wish However the need of the hour is to pprepare moodle for enterprise elearning converging with IIS , Ms SQL and Sharepoint My experience with corporate is that they like moodle for its maturity and competitive advantage.  They do not like other OSS like Apache and MySQL . Still I notice that no significant effort is put to solve the tricky problem of establishing communication bridge among MsSQL, IIS and PHP. Only problem reported in the matter of moodle installation with Win 2k3, IIS6, MsSQL even after M$ allowed the free download of MsSQL 2005 express. Nagarajan",

How could the authentication plugin code trust that \"custom\" HTTP Header to avoid anyone injecting the username in that custom HTTP Header? HTTPS being on so that only the final users could exploit the authentication and get logged in as another user? Even if you'll use the optional idnumber it will be predictable, being based on some guessable internal naming schema. Matteo",

Can most of it be hidden, set to defaults, or not required? I don't want my users to have to fill in a profile in Moodle after they've already done so in PostNuke. PostNuke's name in the table pn_users is first name and last name (like \"John Smith\"), while Moodle wants a first name and then a last name (like \"John\" and \"Smith\"). How can I have Moodle's authentication fill this in? Could Moodle just require a first name field (and not the last name field), and then fill the first name field with both the first and last name from PostNuke? Can Moodle just get the name (first and last) and the email address from PostNuke and leave the rest to default settings? Thanks for the help, Ariel",

Thanks to the OAuth2 support in Moodle 3.3 we are now giving serious consideration to switching to authenticating off Microsoft's cloud service instead - that way our entire campus can go down and our Moodle remains fully functional. We need to be able to pre-provision stub accounts within Moodle so we can pre-enrol students before their first login. When authing against AD using LDAP this was easy - we did it using moosh. Has anyone done this with OAth2 yet? Are there any pit-falls to watch out for? Also - is there a way to stop the email validation step when the user first signs on with OAuth2? I would appreciate any insights people have. Thanks, Bart.",

In the Site Admin menu, search 'guest' and anything/everything related to guest settings should appear in what should be a fairly long page. BTW , if there is anything interactive (forum/assignment, etc.) in any course setup this way guest users (ie, those not logged on ... even as guest) can participate.

Deeper inspection of what you are currently doing is needed ... example, the content that exist where no one is required to be tracked is created by whom?  single person?  multiple persons?  what type of content is it?  embedded audio/video? etc.  All that content could be served up from just about anything ... a Joomla or a WordPress, but linked from the front page of a Moodle that has front page settings for guest users to use links.  Those other systems do not require all users to be tracked and since they have fewer users it's pretty easy to tell who did what and hold them accountable. So the best advice I could give you is to step back and really take a good look ... beyond the technology and servers and apps.  Look at who is receiving - then plugin the apps/technology.

To change username when uploading, you need to use the the special field \"oldusername\" so Moodle will be able to match users. Steps could be: 1) download your user using Bulk user actions 2) edit your CSV file with new values - remember to keep the \"oldusername\" column and specify the new ones - 3) upload user updating existing accounts. When uploading, make sure you selected the option that allow usernames change. I strongly suggest to double check the procedure and results on a test server before attempting anything on your production environment.",

There are several requirements we require users not to login directly to moodle but only through the external platform. We want users to be part of a group/cohort and each group to have an admin to get reports on the group participants, therefore, we created users manually on Moodle and assign them to Cohorts/Groups. When users logs in to the external platform, an account shouldn't be created automatically on moodle but users should be logged in automatically to their related user on moodle We have found some kind of solution for new users which are not created in moodle already. But,  users who do exists on moodle will have to log in to moodle once and then click a link in their preferences to activate the SSO. Is there a better way/process to achieve that functionality?

I am running Windows 2003 and am using the Windows Moodle Quick Installer 1. I had to put the php path in my environment path variable in windows 2003. To check to see if yours works before beginning, do start, run, cmd and enter Type php -m, you should see output, if not you need to set the path To see what your path currently is, type path and hit enter To set the path on Windows 2003, go to the control panel and click on System.  Then click on the advanced tab and you should see at the bottom a button for environment variables, click that. You now have a box where you can edit several things including your path. (Keep in mind that if you use %SystemRoot% in you php path that it does NOT point to c:\\, instead to c:\\Windows\\) 2. I had to alter the PHP.ini file. Interestingly enough, I kept thinking I had done this. It turns out that at least on my system, I have two php.ini files and one php5.ini.  To find out which one your system is actually using, login to moodle as the administrator, go to the admin page and at the very bottom press the php Info button. About the seventh line down you should see something like this: Configuration File (php.ini) Path  C:\\moodle\\apache\\bin\\php.ini Open and edit that file and remove the semicolon (;) in front of the line : extension=php_ldap.dll 3. After these two things restart apache and you should no longer receive the red error message. Scott",

I have just set up a test moodle. Now how do I configure moodle to do that. Surely this has been asked before but don't see it in the docs, or does this require custom programming to do?

When the user logins from the front page of Moodle through the SSO he lands on his Moodle dashboard . But if he comes as a guest from a course enrolement page FOR example ourmoodlesite.com/enrol/index.php?id=8, he should land back to the same page after the sso through the IdP. Currently he lands back on his Moodle dashboard after successiful login. We found that the relay state should be set in the simpleSAMLphp library, but changing it there, does not affect anything. Trying manually to set the relay state in the url as part of the login works. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.",

          "Text": "After trolling through the forums on this topic and plenty of ideas I have successfully implemented a self - registration with Admin approval without altering too many core / library files and introducing any security risks(!). I thought I would share this with the community. Please note you will need to have access to the core / library files possibly through ftp . Here's how the code works: 1. Prospective user requests an account (login/signup.php) 2. User is greeted with a custom message saying their request has been sent to administrator (login/signup.php). No email is sent to the user. 3. An email is sent to administrator about the new account request. Its achieved by redirecting the email to the admin instead of the user (lib/moodlelib.php). 4. Administrator views the user (admin/user.php) and manually confirms the account. On clicking ‘confirm’ the new function send_confirmation_email_to_user gets triggered and sends an email to the user. The email only contains a message stating their account has been confirmed and no activation links are sent. Procedure: The main idea is to not send the activation links during the email exchange. So the only way to confirm someone's account is by the administrator's doing this manually (which requires admin rights). Here are the changes I made to the three files: 1. lib/moodlelib.php [changes made to send_confirmation_email($user) function] Removed activation / confirmation links from being generated - line 5939 Email sent to $supportuser instead of $user - line 5947 Made necessary changes to library files for the custom messages sent to site administrator. 2. lang/en/moodle.php - added two new strings emailconfirmation_user and emailconfirmationsubject_user on line 562 3. admin/user.php - Added a new function send_confirmation_email_to_user($user) - line 3 - changed strings emailconfirmationsubject_user and emailconfirmation_user - Added send_confirmation_email_to_user($user); line 101 to call the function when account is manually confirmed. Please do fully test this before implementing on a live server . Any suggestions to make this better would be greatly received.",

This component caches a great deal of information to speed up many operations (including access to the DB). So it may happen that as you are not doing any changes to the setting through the Moodle code, the MUC still holds the (previous) cached, value as it assumes it's still \"fresh\" (valid). And when the config screen asks for the setting value from the DB, the MUC returns that value. You can purge (invalidate) the caches by going to Administration >> Site Administration >> Development >> Purge all caches Saludos.\nIñaki.",

I have installed moodle 1.5.2 on my Windows XP, with XAMPP (Apache2, PHP 5.0.5, ) for test purposes for now. My next step was to establish an MS SQL connection for the external authentification; but I just couldn't\nmake it work. On XAMPP, there is a test-site to test database connections. With that\nthe connection to MS SQL works properly, so it can't be a PHP-side\nproblem or the MS SQL server itself. However, when I use the same data, I get the error message \"Could not connect to the specified authentication database...\" This auth_dbhost: 127.0.0.1 auth_dbtype: mssql auth_dbname: moodleTest auth_dbuser: sa auth_dbpass: ********** auth_dbtable: forMoodle auth_fielduser: login auth_fieldpass: pw auth_dbpasstype: text Using the same data on the test site I mentioned returns the correct data from the correct MS SQL-database.

Chat begins at 8pm and users get kicked out at 9pm. (Through testing we see all chats spanning across the start of any hour experience a service disruption). Error logs indicate that a dmlwriteexception occurs on the mdl_user table caused by the Chat activity. Specifically it appears that when the activity tries to update the lastaccess field in mdl_user the table is locked and the exception is thrown. Since the table is locked the users are kicked out of chat and ultimately have to re-authenticate before re-entering chat (at least they seem to re-authenticate). We're trying to decide if a my.cnf setting is to blame. We can mitigate the issue by syncing users once or twice a day rather than hourly but I'm not sure that workaround is the best option. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Aaron",

NTLM is very similar to LDAP authentication, but it allows for the browser to send the user data without sending the user to a log in screen.  See this thread about the settings for LDAP. Internet Explorer is compatible with NTLM, to make Firefox compatible you need to edit the configs.  Type about:config into the address bar in FireFox then set the value of network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris to the name of the moodle server you want to use ntlm.

Other VLE platforms have a backdoor route to the manual/system login page.  In Blackboard this is done by adding parameters to the usual login URL (?action=default_login).  In Canvas you use a specific URI (/login/canvas).  Is there an equivalent in moodle so that only the manual account login auth plugin will be used?

However, for the wiki, I don't actually have to enter a bind user. From the comments in the wiki LocalSettings.php LDAP example, what it seems to be doing is the following. If you don't specify and actual bind user, it tries to use the entered user name (person trying to authenticate) to bind. This works because our AD allows non-privileged users to bind as long as they don't try to change anything. I'm using my account credentials as the bind user in moodle (won't work without it). This is obviously not the most desirable situation. Does anyone know if there is a way to tell moodle to pass along the user's ID when binding, like the wiki does? The reason I'm asking is that our IS makes us jump through many hoops to get an AD account that is not actually connected to a person, and I've been turned down before when I initially set up moodle's LDAP.

So i corrected that and then it worked, I did come across a few things though, the error ntlmsso_iwamagicnotenabled can be set if either the ntlmsso_magic function fails or the file spacer.gif is not avilable. this does not make sense as the image file is required only if IE Fast Switch is not available.

I have also run the script successfully when logged in as admin by pointing my web browser at http://<yoursite>/auth.ldap/auth_ldap_sync_users.php although I did this before reading something saying you should not do this! If you batch upload your users you do not need to supply a password under 1.6 but your users will all be created as manual authentication users not LDAP. I have done this recently and then run a SQL query to change the auth to ldap from manual fior those selected users. The reason I had to do this was that our AD kept timing out and not synching the last 1000 or so users which were the new ones! Regards Steve",

Unless you need non-SSO people to see things without logging that might be simpler in the long run. If you change the default front page role to \"Authenticated user on frontpage (frontpage)\" and then you can just point them to the base url for the site. I think that also means that if they try and access any pages that would lead to a redirect to the frontpage they will get logged in automatically as well.",

Both of the work great, and when i navigate (internally) to our Moodle I get logged in via SSO Kerberos. If I then click the logout link I go to the \"Authentication Choice\" page and have the choice of \"CAS users\" and \"Other Users\" If I click on \"CAS users\" I get forwarded to our CAS server login page This behavour is correct and expected.  But if I click on the \"Other users\" link ( http://myserver.com/login/index.php?authCAS=NOCAS ), it goes back to the Kerberous SSO and logs me in as myself. The expected behavour as the \"Authentication Choice\" page is: http://myserver.com/login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1 Would be to be forwarded to the normal Moodle login page and skip CAS and NTLM (Kerberos). I have no way to login as admin! I have force users to login set to yes as well becuase I couldnt get Kerberos to work without this setting. I believe that I have LDAP /Kerberos first in the list of auth plugins enabled and then CAS Any help would be great, but I feel that I might have discovered a bug here Albert",

We have a stand alone authenticated system, and we've been asked to provide single sign on functions for users coming from a Moodle. In the past we've authenticated against other systems using a simple shared secret: their system uses a range of bits of info about a user and the system, combines it with a shared secret and forumlates an encrypted string. This is then passed across to our system with all the info. Our system repeats the process using our copy of the shared secret and compares the encrypted strings. If they match we pull the users password from our db based on the passed username and logs them in. As you may have guessed not really my area, we were talked through this by the tech guys from another learning platform to let them integrate. So now I need to replicate this process with Moodle. Is it possible? If so anyone kind enough to talk me through it? I can see how to pass the users information across, I just can't see how we can use that info first to build the encrypted string.",

When we switched to shibboleth and disabled the ldap authentication, I expected the configuration to more or less follow the same options - you enter name & password, hit enter and be logged in. However, by default, none of the shibboleth logins would work at that box -- I'm directed to the invalid login dialog. So, I changed the alternateloginurl to be /auth/shibboleth/index.php (the apache config had that file protected by shibboleth). Now, when people login, if they're not in the manual category, they get directed to the authentication website to login; granted, they only have to do this once per session. I'm wondering if this is the intended operation? Ideally, we would have the information from the login box directed to the shibboleth agent without being directed to a different website. And, it's not clear to me how to use shibboleth and another authentication method since we need to modify alternateloginurl to get anything to work.",

The flow I wish is when the user is connected on Moodle, to be using it's Moodle logged in state to also have him connected on the provider platform (which uses Django framework). So it is a use case of SSO from Moodle to an external provider (unlike common use cases from external provider/ database to Moodle). What I do is I get the class information from the Moodle user (json sample attached) that I post to the provider platform after the user has given his consent. In particular, in the json file that I post to the external platform, I have the logged in user dictionary as below: \"User\": { \"id\": \"10003\", \"username\": \"corbin\", \"firstname\": \"Eric\", \"lastname\": \"Corbin\", \"email\": \"***********@***********.com\", \"isConnected\": true, \"sesskey\": \"g9UjzwQGF9\", \"MoodleSession\": \"o8vvtg3id57qm24r2e3g0eqj5c\", \"token\": \"FoPx1LT8ObF9m4dkL4esCvd4jKD7e52M\", \"connected\": 1647799643",

The way I dealt with our transition was to make users aware of the issue and wherever possible alter existing accounts before the LDAP accounts were created. I wrote a script to do this more easily than drilling into individual users' accounts; taking the old username and the new LDAP username, a function made sure: there was no existing account with the 'new' username there was an existing account with the 'old' username the 'old' account did not already use LDAP! and then the new username and auth type were set in the table. This way the (now LDAP authenticated) user keeps their enrolments, activity logs, message history etc. You are welcome to a copy, but bear in mind it was written for 1.6 and has hard-coded postgresql queries that would probably need changing for mysql .",

Short name is all lower case, no spaces, no underscores, etc. I can see the field when editing a user, and can successfully manually add data to the field When I go to Site Admin -> Plugins -> Authentication -> LDAP Server , I don't see the field included in the Data Mapping section, where I can link it to the AD field in order to have the data synch over in the nightly update. Any thoughts of what I am missing or doing wrong?  Or, can I manually add this field-mapping somewhere in the database ? Thanks, Peter",

I have an external site that when a user is created in it the exact same user details are passed to Moodle to create an identical user. This is so that when the user clicks from the external site and goes into Moodle, the user is not required to log in and the external website passes its own user information to Moodle. I plan to create a web interface in Moodle for the external site to interact with. Is there a function in the Moodle code for creating a user? Or must I write the SQL code myself to create a user in the database ? Is there a function to authenticate a user, or must I write some more SQL code?",

          "Text": "Hi! I tried to go about doing a similar thing. I started by reading the following and following the steps to go about creating the basic authentication plugin. It uses my own way of authentication via checking the incoming password's hash against a secret hash key. http://docs.moodle.org/en/Authentication_FAQ Once I had done that moodle accepted my user's login details but still remained the issue of creating users who weren't already on moodle's internal database. It would prompt the user coming in to create their profile on moodle once they had logged in. Now since that is work duplication for the user(He/She has already logged in through my external site and shouldn't have to do so again), I had to think of something to avoid that and bypass the new user registration. I wanted moodle to use my user's existing credentials on the external site to be passed onto moodle and moodle should just accept those and create the user automatically. The result should be the same user being logged in as him or her in moodle home page. Once the requirements were clear I looked at the authentication API http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Authentication_API NB: By this point I had a basic auth plugin which implemented the mandatory function user_login() So moodle calls this when going through all the auth plugins and checks if the user checks out. ~Once that happens it also looks for any user information - name, email address, and other credentials to populate it's database(especially if the user does not exist on moodle yet), that it does by calling an optional function in the auth plugin called get_userinfo($username) - Refer to API above. Note that The api says auth_user_login() and auth_get_userinfo(), they have changed in moodle 1.9 to just user_login($username, $password) and get_userinfo($username). So I implemented the get_userinfo($username) in the auth plugin and in there I basically defined it in a similar way to the get_userinfo() method in the 'FC' auth plugin ( You should be able to find the existing code in your moodle install /auth/fc/auth.php.) $fname = $_REQUEST['fname']; if(isset($fname)) { $userinfo['firstname'] = $fname; //moodle db key firstname } the other moodle db keys are lastname, email, country, city, you could probably look the rest of the keys up in the moodle db itself using phpmyadmin for custom credentials. So I got the credential first name from the REQUEST Object(*) which was passed from my external site as part of the POST request as a hidden parameter alongside username and password. *Had a php script on my external site which sent the username and password to the moodle login website http://moodlecomputer/login/index.php as a POST action page for a form with input elements such as username, password, email, and other credentials needed for moodle to make the new user on its internal database. So the auth plugin picks up the information as above and when get_userinfo() is called by moodle it creaes the user with those credentials, job done!",

          "Text": "Here is the scenario. We have a hosted VPS with inmotionhosting. We've acquired root access and currently have moodle installed on one of the user cPanels. We've hired a SME to customize moodle to our liking. The problem is trying to setup LDAP /s authentication for the purposes of creating users. Since the moodle server is located on a VPS and we went the route of using our internal CA for authentication, we had to open port 636 on our firewall and allow communication from the VPS public IP. Once that was done we went about configuring the LDAP module in moodle. Here are our settings for the LDAP server (note that there is an internal host entry on the VPS for the host URL specified below): Host URL: ldaps://server.contoso.local Version: 3 Use TLS: No LDAP encoding: utf-8 Hide Passwords: Yes Dstinguished name: CN=svc-Moodle,OU=Svc,DC=contoso,DC=local Password: password User type: MS ActiveDirectory Contexts: ou=sd users,dc=contoso,dc=local Search subcontexts: Yes Dereference aliases: No From our CA, we exported our CA cert and imported it into the VPS. We used this moodle doc to then attempt to establish a link using that certificate: http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/LDAP_authentication#Enabling_LDAPS_on_your_Moodle_server From an SSH shell into the VPS, here are the exact commands we used to try and establish the secure link: cd /etc/ssl/certs openssl x509 -in <ca cert name>.cer -inform DER -out <ca cert name>.pem -outform PEM openssl x509 -in <server cert name>.cer -inform DER -out <server cert name>.pem -outform PEM c_rehash cat <ca cert name>.pem | grep 'BEGIN.* CERTIFICATE' | wc -l openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -in <ca cert name>.pem openssl x509 -noout -hash -in <ca cert name>.pem ln -s ca_drsdc3.pem `openssl x509 -hash -noout -in <ca cert name>.pem`.0 Then to verify the certs were installed correctly, we used these commands: openssl verify -verbose -CApath /etc/ssl/certs /etc/ssl/certs/<ca cert name>.pem openssl verify -verbose -CApath /etc/ssl/certs /etc/ssl/certs/<server cert name>.pem They returned an OK. The final step was to use this command to verify that we can connect and authenticate successfully with our internal CA: openssl s_client -connect server.contoso.local:636 This is where the problem lies. This is the output from this command: root@vps11666 [/etc/ssl/certs]# openssl s_client -connect drs-dc3.drsystems.local:636 CONNECTED(00000003) depth=0 CN = DRS-DC3.drsystems.local verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate verify return:1 depth=0 CN = DRS-DC3.drsystems.local read:errno=104 I'm not an openssl expert by any means, but I can see that there are verification problems when connecting to our server. Does anyone have any ideas on how to help us?",

What is the most efficient and secure way to implement this scenario and build on it when needed. I don't have much experience with moodle but my idea it to make simple html page that authenticate user and make a jwt token represents him then redirect it back to my normal site. I make external plugin that takes this jwt token and get whatever info I need about this user. what is your suggestion ?",

All 5 the moodle are setup in the same way with server settings. They all still work on the old server. I am using the latest Moodle and php 7.1. The difference from the slow moodle and the others is that it has just over 10,000 users, with about 100 that are current. It also has an external database authentication. I disabled the external database authentication to see if it would help. I is still slow. I am logging in with a manual admin account. I have tried just about every thing to try and fix this issue. Recently, I exported the database, moodledata folder, and program folder and imported into a server where I test Moodles and have several working moodle installs. It has the same problem there. I exported the moodle in maintenance mode and then logged in to disable . I turned debugging on and get the following message: Warning : my sql i_real_connect(): (HY000/2002): Connection timed out in /var/www/vhosts/smarterlearning.ca/httpdocs/novice/lib/adodb/drivers/adodb-mysqli.inc.php on line 124 Warning : is_readable(): open_basedir restriction in effect.

I was assuming that once the connection was made that all users would be automatically imported into Moodle from Active Directory but it seems that users need to first log into Moodle to be recognised and are then added. Is this the norm or is there some thing else I need to do to have the users imported into Moodle automatically? Any help is much appreciated. Regards, Simon",

          "Text": "I think this is normal behavior, our setup certainly behaves that way. The ldap lookup is after all only an authentication method, so it's merely checking the details supplied by the user against the ldap/AD database . Here a student logs into Moodle the first time and creates a Moodle profile, the ldap connection checks with AD about whether the student is allowed to login to Moodle then creates the account on Moodle, this means that Moodle doesn't have to store all the passwords etc and users have a common password for logging into the computer and using Moodle. If the password is changed in AD it changes automatically in Moodle. In practical terms if a user is in AD they can use Moodle but will still have to create a Moodle profile the first time they login. There are companies I've seen that claim they can offer a tighter level of Moodle<->AD integration where users can be imported, but I think primarily these are just a scheduled task that runs every so often and creates Moodle profiles based on the ldap account details rather than anything more. So my feeling has always been is it worth the extra cost for such integration when an AD user can login to Moodle anyway, it just takes a couple of extra minutes the first time around. John Gifford",

The only issue that I have found with this is that you cannot enroll a student in a course until after first login so that is where the csv upload comes in.  Yes, you can specify LDAP for the authentication method and so that works well.  Another step for the admin but I actually use the same file to add new users to LDAP and then Moodle. I am not sure if anyone has come up with an LDAP sync plugin yet but you might search the plugins.",

Each new academic year we automatically script new users account for all our new student, generate a password and set the account to require that the password be changed on the initial logon to the network. The issue revolves around the fact that the students cannot log into moodle until they have initially logged onto the system and changed their passwords. This is starting to become and issue as we start to branch out and come across situations where some students are distance learners and cannot make it into college easily to do this initial logon. The ldap module treats these accounts as invalid logons rather than an account where the password has expired. We have been using the ldap authentication module for a year now and have had no real problems apart from this one. Can anyone help?

BTW , in a SSO scenario what do you expect? If Moodle Session has timed out, it will automagically restore the Moodle Session based on the 3rd party IdP \"session\" if still alive, isn't it? I'd check the opposite, what happens if the Moodle Session timeout is greater than the IdP one? HTH , Matteo",

          "Text": "I'm trying to authenticate against the user db of my website (CMS based) and it uses a slightly different approach at storing hashed passwords. It uses a randomly generated salt for each user. The salt is stored in the user db along with the hashed passwords. Hence, direct field-mapped authentication (as the External DB plugin does) won't work for me. To start off, I just mirrored the DB plugin and modified the user_login() procedure to read the hashed password and the salt from the database and then hash the entered password again with the salt and match it up with the password in the database. Here's the code for my user_login() function... \n```text\nfunction user_login($username, $password) {\n\n global $CFG;\n\n $textlib = textlib_get_instance();\n $extusername = $textlib->convert(stripslashes($username), 'utf-8', $this->config->extencoding);\n $extpassword = $textlib->convert(stripslashes($password), 'utf-8', $this->config->extencoding);\n\n $authdb = $this->db_init();\n\n // normal case: use external db for passwords\n\n // Get user data\n $\nsql\n = \"SELECT\n *\n FROM {$this->config->table}\n WHERE {$this->config->fielduser} = '\".$this->ext_addslashes($extusername).\"' \";\n\n echo $sql;\n\n $authdb->SetFetchMode(ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n // No DB Connection\n if ( !$rs = $authdb->Execute( $sql ) ) {\n $authdb->Close();\n print_error('auth_dbcantconnect','auth');\n return false;\n }\n\n // No records returned\n if( $rs->EOF ) {\n $rs->Close();\n $authdb->Close();\n return false;\n }\n\n // Get password\n $db_password = $rs->fields['user_password'];\n $salt = $rs->fields['user_salt'];\n\n // Close DB Conn\n $rs->Close();\n $authdb->Close();\n\n // Return match\n return ( sha1( $extpassword . $salt ) ) == $db_password;\n\n}\n```\n But when I try to login, username / passwords corresponding to the website (CMS) database are failing. However, the password (for the same user) that was stored in Moodle earlier on (before I tried using this custom plugin) is getting me through. That means, either my authentication routine is failing or moodle's internal db based auth mechanism is taking precedence over it. I've enabled ADODB debug mode - but that isn't helping either. When I enable the debug output from Server settings, the error messages are being sent prior to the page headers. Thus the login page won't display at all. I have all other forms of authentication turned off (except for Manual which can't be turned off) and my own. Any ideas on how to solve this issue? Thanks, Sourjya",

When I try to do the sign up I can see this, but I don't receive the confirmation email An email should have been sent to your address at my personal gmail or Microsoft email It contains easy instructions to complete your registration. If you continue to have difficulty, contact the site administrator. BUT, when I try to do the same to the email under the same domain I receive the confirmation email! I can't understand what happen!

          "Text": "I am using Moodle 2.0.3+ (Build: 20110701) on Ubuntu server 11.04 w/ apache2, MySQL , and php 5.3.5. Please see http://www.rsti-training.com/moodle_external_auth_problem.zip for all mentioned attachments. I'm trying to use external db authentication from our MSSQL 2005 server. I've configured the external db auth plugin (see attachment 01_external_auth_db_settings.pdf ). I point to a configured system DSN ( sql server), which is using the FreeTDS driver (7.0), See attachment '05 - phpinfo().pdf' for php details. When I run 'sudo php /var/www/moodle/auth/db/cli/sync_users.php' from the terminal window, it appears to work, but with errors. See attachment '02 - sync_users.php_results.txt' . It finds the student ID but shows it as 'ÿþ2870', when it's really '2870' on the SQL server console. The actual table/view has 3 results, 2 of which are duplicate students. It appears to try to insert the duplicates as ?,?,?,?,?. I've seen other posts pointing to a UTF-8, UTF-16 encoding issue between MSSQL & MySQL. I thought FreeTDS was supposed to take care of UTF-8 to UTF-16 encoding problems? When I go to Moodle Site Administration > Users > Accounts > Browse List of Users, I see 1 user was added, but all fields are blank. This is the case no matter how many student records I sync (see printscreen attachment '03 - moodle_auth_blank.jpg' ). I created a php test script to make sure php is talking to MSSQL properly using the FreeTDS driver and the same DSN as Moodle (sqlserver). This works fine, see attachment '04 - php_test_results.txt '. This leads me to believe the problem is the actual insert into MySQL. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've spent way too much time, but I'm too close to quit now!!! Thanks for any help. Todd B.",
