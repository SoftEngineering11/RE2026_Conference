          "Title": "How are we supposed to use the AI Subsystem ?",
          "Text": "I have some questions about the AI subsystem. I use AI in a lot of places in my plugins. I route almost all requests to my own servers and completely bypass the AI subsystem. Partly because this process pre-dates the AI subsystem. And partly because I don't think the AI subsystem does what I need (thats what my questions will be about). But I do want to use it, and ideally I could begin the process of allowing users to route AI requests via the subsystem if they preferred to. As a representative example of a use case - in Poodll Wordcards we need pictures for the WordCards. So I wanted to use the subsystem, and I made a placement plugin so we could generate images. That worked. But then I went back to the old way. Question 1) Do we really need a placement plugin for each place we want to generate a image? (clarification: This is not about using the HTML editor.) I mean, do we need one for Poodll WordCards and one for Poodll MiniLesson and one the Moodle repository etc. Is that really the case? If not, cool. Please tell me what to do instead. If however it is the case. I don't mind coding a few lightweight plugins. I kind of mind having to maintain them on the plugins directory and through each Moodle version update. I do mind having to get my users to install new plugins for what are basically features. Perhaps my needs are some sort of edge case and the html editor is fine for most people. But how about: The file manager - of course we need image generation there. Automated generation content - Poodll has an AI lesson builder it takes a few prompts and goes off builds incredible lessons with loads of images and audio. Most mods will have something like that soon. Bulk image generation - making 10 images in series is slow. Making 10 images in parallel is fast. And that is just images. In fact text generation is a bigger issue. Basically most of my plugins will need a companion AI placement plugin. It seems too much. A hook or callback feature seems more appropriate. Question 2) How about all the other AI things we need to do? A few examples: give students feedback on their submission. give students a score on their submission modify previously generated images transcribe speech. Most of this is programmatic use of AI. Trying to know in advance what kind of AI action is required and make it available as a placement, seems like forever playing catch up. Thats partly because we don't know what we don't know. And partly because AI is advancing at such a rate new functionality is arriving regularly. The list could just get really really long. How do we get new actions into the system? I need all of those things now. Is it possible to have a catch all that allows us to effectively use the engines creds and supply our own implementation of the request and response handling? I mean, I am sure we can do that now, but I do want to play by the rules. Is that against the rules?",

          "Text": "This is a *really* interesting question Justin, and one that think many developers are struggling with. I feel that that \"placements\" function is a complex / complicated route to govern where the end-user interaction or initiation of an AI action takes place. This is probably fine in the case of *some* interactions. But I think it overall takes away from the Developer's to make good decisions (or and potentially *bad* decisions) about where and what that initiation looks like. So personally \"I\" don't like this approach... The other aspect is really the back-end consumption of AI \"services\" by a Moodle plugin. This in my mind should not need any sort of \"placement\", it really needs to be a mechanism for the developer to get back some sort of interface that will route their request to a \"relevant\" / appropriate LLM provider instance. This is of itself a complicated question if we're to allow individual system administrators to have the agency to *decide* which LLM provider they want to use, and this could conflict with some developers who don't want to afford sys-admins that flexiblity (say for instance your AI experience relies on a *very* specific model that *you're* hosting). On this front I prefer the approach the By-cs's local_ai_manager plugin has taken, in offering \"purposes\" and \"providers\" so that the systems admin can assert \"this LLM is for this purpose\", and *every* complying AI plugin that wants to \"generate an image\" will use it. It doesn't preclude a developer writing an \"I need a very specific image generation purpose\" and then requiring the admin to wire that purpose up to a very specific LLM instance... (Full disclosure, we've been playing in that very area to look at doing \"RAG\" and \"Text Embedding\" purpose for this plugin, so we sort of know that adding newer more specific purposes can be done here). But in both the Moodle system and the By-CS one there is definitely an \"arms-length-ness\" to calling an LLM, it's by no means \"direct\" (in Moodle you have go via the placement, and in the local_ai_manager you need to go via a purpose)",

The plugin provides a text area at both the block instance level as well as the plugin level where teachers or administrators can include a list of questions and answers that the AI will ingest before generating a completion; as a result, the AI is more likely to provide accurate information when a submitted query is similar to the questions it has been given direct answers to. For example, an AI that hasn't been provided any extra information may respond to the query \"What color is the car?\" with a random color, such as red.

          "Text": "Hi Richard, AL is a nickname derived from Allen from Alabama, and since the abbreviation for Alabama is, AL, the all caps nickname is what everyone called me while in the US Army. Thanks for the links. I will go check them out. Currently on my AI Pi HAT, I am using this in a terminal window, ollama run llama3.2:3b --verbose. The, --verbose, gives a nice eight line listing at the end. As to the bogus answers I mentioned elsewhere, I submit the following: `rachelsd@raspberryaipi:~ $ ollama -v` `ollama version is 0.5.11` `rachelsd@raspberryaipi:~ $ ollama run llama3.2:3b --verbose` \n```text\n>>> \nCan you tell me some of the capabilities of the Moodle plugin, MooTyper?\n```\n `MooTyper is a popular Moodle plugin that allows users to create and edit` `text with speech. Here are some of its key capabilities:` `1. Real-time speech synthesis: MooTyper uses natural-sounding voices to` `read out text in real-time, allowing students to hear their assignments or` `responses being spoken aloud.` `2. Text editing: Users can type or paste text into the MooTyper editor,` `which will then be synthesized into speech as they edit.` `3. Spell checking and grammar correction: The plugin includes built-in` `spell checking and grammar correction tools to help users ensure accuracy` `in their written work.` `4. Audio output options: Users can choose from various audio output` `options, including WAV and MP3 formats, allowing them to easily share or` \n```text\ndownload\n spoken text.\n```\n `5. Customization options: Administrators can customize the plugin's` `settings, including choosing the voice and speech rate, to suit the needs` `of their users.` `MooTyper is commonly used in educational settings to support students with` `dyslexia, ADHD, or other learning disabilities that may affect reading and` `writing abilities. It can also be a useful tool for language learners,` `writers, and individuals who want to improve their oral communication` `skills.` `total duration:       51.9507489s` `load duration:        48.828907ms` `prompt eval count:    42 token(s)` `prompt eval duration: 4.486s` `prompt eval rate:     9.36 tokens/s` `eval count:           241 token(s)` `eval duration:        47.414s` `eval rate:            5.08 tokens/s` `>>> Send a message (/? for help)` Anyone who has tried out MooTyper, knows it is a plugin for improving one's typing ability and has nothing to do with audio. I have asked that question a couple of other ways, and it does give the same basic WRONG answer each time. What it does give applies much more with what the Poodle Filter does. LOL Like you, I am actually more interested in what it can come up with for lessons and writing prompts. Maybe even evaluation of a students writing as to how well they may have followed the lesson or prompt requirements.",

          "Text": "Yesterday, I was having fun with two of my Raspberry Pi5's, comparing results of the one with the new 26 TOPS AI HAT to another with a SSD HAT. I was puzzled that both of them had almost the exact same verbose results, but I was interrupted further investigations by one of those necessary life events that butted in...had to go grocery shopping! LOL When I got back, it suddenly dawned on me why they were giving me very similar results. The Pi 5's have a new PCI Express Interface ribbon connector on the rear edge of the board. The AI HAT uses that connection for the communicating with the AI HAT, meaning the OS and memory storage all has to go on a Micro SDC memory chip. The other PI with a 1TB SSD, is running the OS and memory storage on the SSD and does not even have a Micro SDC memory chip plugged in. When I got that particular Pi 5, I had to do an initial setup using a Micro SDC memory chip and was amazed how much faster it appeared when I finished moving the OS over to the SSD. I currently have Ollama set up on it using the llama3.2:3b model which granted, is not as fast with it's answers, as those you can get elsewhere, but, as I have mentioned before, no matter how much I ask it, it will not suddenly want to start charging me for access to it. If anyone want to try it out, send me a private message with a desired user name and password so I can set it up. If anyone is interested, note that I have created an AI provider plugin like the two now included in Moodle, and hope to get the settings to work with one of my Pi's, soon. Almost forgot to mention, if you want to try AI on your OWN Raspberry Pi, try to get a 16GB version. Makes a huge difference in which models you can run/use.",

AI generation of Rubrics that can be imported as Rubric based assignments into Moodle and then also use AI to grade submissions and import the complete graded rubric and comments back into Moodle.\n\nThe application framework is Flutter/Dart and we have it available for review in Github.
