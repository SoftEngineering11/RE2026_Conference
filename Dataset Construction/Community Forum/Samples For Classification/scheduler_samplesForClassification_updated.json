And if they do not reconfirm by 48 hours in advance, the timeslot of the non-responders tot the confirmation mail need to be released so that others have the chance to attend. How could this be achieved on Moodle (even if with another activity than the scheduler, I would be happy to hear it).\n\nWe now have a very labor-intensive workaround that we have to maintain for quite a lot of schedulers (we have a lot of company visits) and we need to improve this process: 1 - When the scheduler is first published, the completion status of that activity cannot be manipulated by a student 2 - One week i advance, the reminder mail is sent out. We cannot choose the teckt of that mail 3 - On the same day, the teacher sets the completion status so that it must be set manually by a student. 4 - The teacher then also checks who is registered and sends all these students an e-mail asking them to set the completion status of the correct scheduler activity to \"completed\" 5 - 48 hours in advance, the teacher does a cross check between who is registered and who has set the completion status to \"completed\". 6 - All registered students that have not set the completion status are deemed as unconfirmed and their registration is removed so that others have the chance to register and attend 7 - An e-mail to all students who could not register is sent out that new places have opened up.",

The enrolments work fine... But I have 3 problems 1) I don't know how to \"link\" the practice phase of the main courses to go to this scheduler? is there \"something\" I can put as activity there to redirect to the scheduler in the common course? 2) Since these practice sessions are common to teachers but unique to the main course students, when a student makes a booking, it needs to show up somehow from which \"main\" course it originated. 3) Since these practice sessions are graded, the grades need to propagate to the \"activity\" at the main course, and show up in the gradebook as part of the main course.

However, we can't do that anymore, we have to delete the entire time slot, recreate it and put the remaining students back in. If you go to Schedule and view all appointment and click on a gear icon next to a slot, the appointment comes up but none of the students in that appointment are shown.  As a result you cannot remove individual students from a slot.

The groups I mentioned are student groups, which are created by themselves, and represent a set of students that work together in the course. They submit works together, as a group, and through out the course they interact with each other to accomplish the course’s tasks. I guess this organization (sets of students that work in group) is pretty common in many courses (either supported by a platform like Moodle or without any platform). So, what would be the logic of adding a teacher to a group of students? Or, for that matter, adding a teacher to all groups of students in a course? Please don’t take me wrong. I truly believe that your solution works for the Scheduler plugin. I am just trying to understand its logic, as I have this feeling that I am missing something (maybe the ideia I had about groups is just wrong). Best regards, Miguel",

If the mode for an activity is a group mode (separate or visible) and not \"No groups\", and no teacher or non-editing teacher is added to the group, then there is no one of an upper rank in that group directly assigned to book an appointment with (or to be graded by, as in assignments, or to respond to the group's forum discussions etc). Yes, a general course teacher (\"editing teacher\") can do many things, but that is because editing teachers act also like managers or moderators in the entire course (with access to all groups defined in that course). S/he can thus step in anywhere and do whatever. If there are groups in a course, and you're not in them, these are dubbed as \"groups\" simply (or \"Other groups\"), but not \"My groups\". For those groups that do not need a grader, a TA, or other dedicated \"contact\" , you might not have to add a teacher (or non-editing teacher), but for those groups that collaborate and submit things that are supposed to be graded or monitored by a teacher, that teacher should be specified - otherwise communications will often fail - forum subscriptions, assignment notifications, and also scheduler appointments. If you had 5 teachers sharing a course and teaching 5 different groups, you wouldn't want to have each of the teachers tracking all of the students all of the time, just the group they are actually teaching. Ergo - if you have at least one activity in your course that applies a separate groups or visible groups mode, then including the dedicated teacher(s) in each such group is at the very least recommended practice.",

As you guessed, my case is characterized by: 1) My course groups are \"task-groups\" and I'm the only teacher in the course. 2) These \"task-groups\" are the only groups in the course, and I would prefer not to add myself to each of them. So, I'll try your suggestions, hopping they accomplish want I intend with the Scheduler, which seemed to me pretty trivial: just set up a pool of slots that students could book, in a per group (a \"task-group\") basis, to meet me.

          "Text": "Hi, I'm using the scheduler to allow students to book time in our ceramics workshop. The bookings go live 1 week before the session and book out within a minute.  Generally the scheduler works well for managing this but we only have approximately 60% of students who successfully book a session actually turn up for their session. I believe that this is because they book 1 week in advance but are then busy with other projects, therefore they don't take the time to turn up or to manually login to Moodle and cancel their booking. What I would ideally like to see is rather than just an option to send an email notification x number of days before their slot, an additional option for an email confirmation x number of days before their slot. This confirmation would send the students a link giving the student 1 day to confirm that they still want their booking and if the student doesn't confirm their booking then Moodle automatically cancels the booking, thus opening that slot up to other students. At present I can't find any way to accomplish this, if there is a way I'd love to hear about it, otherwise I'd love to see it added as a feature in the future. Thanks James",

For example, if you (mistakenly) revoke all students, then the slot becomes unused and is purged. We can't prove this, but it could be an explanation in our case.

Different approach: When choosing \"separate groups\", the list of students that still need to make an appointment is empty unless I am also a member of the group. Well, usually, I'm not a member of my groups of students. But for just this use case, I've added myself to this particular group. Now I see the students from the group and myself in the list of students that still need to make an appointment. This is better than having all teachers from the course in this list, but still not perfect. What am I doing wrong?

I understand this may create issues like; what happens if you have a slot scheduled for 7 days from now, with reminder set to go out 2 days before, and someone reschedules the slot for 1 day from now i.e. the scheduled notification time is now in the past. Does it skip the notification? Does it force-send it then and there?",

In terms of UI, I imagine this taking the form of an additional input field in the 'students' column.

Send messages via the announcement function as soon as the conditions for activity completion are met. I'm just having trouble setting these conditions for activity completion, Moodle won't let me. Only manual marking by the participant seems to be allowed, which I don't want. To do this, the student would first have to go back to the main course page, which Moodle doesn't do either.

They did seem to work prior to the update. I've checked individual student notification settings, course settings, and global settings and have gotten to the point where I think there may be an issue with the plugin handling this since the latest moodle update.

Not least because we are migrating our own site to Moodle 3.11 soon, i had a look at the plugin now. As far as I'm aware, the latest release (i.e. 3.7.0) of Scheduler works with Moodle 3.10 and 3.11 as well, up to the following caveats: In Moodle 3.11, with debug messages switched on, you will see some warning messages about a deprecated API (user_picture::fields). These are warning messages only, and can be ignored. (They are fixed on the master branch but not on the MOODLE_37_STABLE branch, as this would make it incompatible with versions before 3.11.) Not all of the automated tests will work (this is always a challenge between Moodle releases); but as far as I can see, the underlying features do work. I have therefore marked Scheduler 3.7.0 as compatible with Moodle 3.10 and 3.11 in the plugins DB. If you find issues with Scheduler in those versions, please do file an issue on the Moodle Tracker , describing details. This is still not a major release of scheduler and has no added features (and some bugs like CONTRIB-8013 are still open). Thanks to everyone who filed bug reports or pull requests; they are not forgotten, even if I haven't gotten round to look at them. I still hope to get to that point soon, but the pandemic has put these plans on hold for some time. The major release will certainly be a 4.x release (with x=0 or x=1 being likely).

We have received teachers' request as below: \"Is it possible to add a function to the scheduler so that the list of appointments can be viewed in reverse chronological order, as well as the present chronological default. This would be a great ergonomic advantage, as the further into semester we go, the further down the slot list you have to scroll to manage latest appointments. If the most recent were at the top, it would be much better.\" Could you please advice if this could be possible to have in future update? Thank you again.

When a slot is deleted, no one gets notified. An invitation is sent, by default, to all the participants of the course and not to the students who registered for that slot.

Metalinking courses is a bad option for us, as it creates confusion with students by adding yet another course to their list of courses. If a student has 6 courses and sees 6 new meta-courses, it is a recipe for trouble. As a start to making this happen: Can you adapt the plugin where when the teacher sets up a Scheduler activity, that the teacher gets the option - that while creating it in one class - have by default set so that the particular scheduled activity is available for ANYONE with the student role in Moodle? It's not a final option, but it would at least solve the interim problem of having to create metacourses. A future iteration would then include giving the teacher a dropdown list where they could select particular courses for which he/she wants to share the same scheduled activity. What do you think?

If I create all of them as repeated slots, then they all show in my scheduler, but for the students, it shows as nothing available until mid-June.

I set up a scheduler for appointments with groups of students, thus using the \"booking in groups\" parameter. I created the slots, sent the invites. Students came back to me saying that they couldn't book a time slot (not enough place available in the slot, or something to that effect). It took me a while to realize that this is because of the default \"maximum number of students per slot\" parameter set at \"1\" by default in the slot creation parameters. So although one student makes the appointment, you need enough \"space\" in the slot to accomodate all of the students in the group. This is not intuitive (at least for me). A quick solution could be to add that information in the \"max number of student per slot\"\" parameter help bubble, i,e, something to the effect that if you do group  bookings, this parameter should disabled the parameter, or set it to number of students in your biggest groups.

There is now basic support for the completion API (when using grades) IMPORTANT: Permissions on the teacher side have changed. In particular: Teachers now strictly need the capability\n'canseeotherteachersbooking' (or 'manageallappointments') in order to\nsee the \"All appointments\" tab. There are new capabilities 'editallgrades', 'editallnotes', and\n'editallattended' which allow users without the 'manageallappointments'\ncapability to edit the grades, the teacher notes, or the attended flag\nin all appointments of all teachers, in the appointment screen only. The configuration setting 'allteachersgrading' is no longer in use. Best wishes Henning",

As we are creating multiple (60+) non-repeated dated slots for over 100 Schedulers this would have a huge impact on our ability to use the plugin as doing this manually takes hours over a number of days. We would like to, if possible, discuss possible costs to develop this and/or waiting lists if you would be open to this. Thanks again, Juli",

If this is set to \"no\", then those new slots that would create a conflict will not be created. If the switch is set to \"yes\", then existing conflicting slots will be deleted before the new slot is being created. However, Scheduler will never delete a conflicting slot if students are already booked on it, or if the slot is located outside the current scheduler activity.\" But even if \"Force when overlap\" is set to \"yes\" when adding multiple sessions, the conflicting previous sessions are deleted.

As the student may have contact with the same adviser over several years, we don't want to strip out old scheduler meeting records, so we roll-over the same activity year to year. A few staff contacted me this week as they are prepping the start of new academic session, and report that they have a group of (say 8) students, but the Scheduler is displaying eg \"4 students still need to make an appointment - send invitation - send reminder\".  The staff want to send a bulk reminder out to their entire student group for the start of the new session, but only some students are listed to contact this way. Is there a simple way to reset this so that it clears the list of who needs to make an appointment so that we can prompt all students to make an appointment each semester or year? I wondered if it was because individual staff hadn't ticked students off as seen after an appointment, but as far as I was aware that only affected students making bookings if it is set to one at a time (ours can make multiple appointments). Thanks, Gordon.",

I suppose your scheduler is set up to allow only one booking (or a fixed number of bookings) at a time. If a student has made a booking, they will no longer be listed as needing an invite / reminder since they can no longer make a booking. Only once they have been marked as attended, they can actually make another booking (and can be invited/reminded). One option would be that you mark past slots as attended, or delete them if they didn't take place. Another option would be to allow unlimited appointments to students. I hope this makes sense.

What I am wanting to do is automate the distribution of the distribution of the Outlook Calendar Invite. Our employee do not use the Moodle Calendar, just the Outlook Calendars. So I made a series of .ics files. I can put it in the comments, but it will show the supervisors the comments when they register for 1. I need them to register first before they get the file.

          "Text": "Hello, This plugin is great but it lacks certain key features that my company would like to have. We really need the following: 1) A way to make the location private, only visible to students who have booked the class. Basically, we're planning to pair each booking with a Zoom (online video conferencing software) link. However, as far I can tell, there is no way to privately notify the students of the location (the link). 2) So the second feature is a little more complicated to explain. Currently, you can send out invitations and reminders to students enrolled in a course, however, there's no way to make these invitations or reminders automatic. And there's no way to save custom messages. You always have to type out the message again or copy and paste. Ultimately, this is what I would like: The student is enrolled in a course. He goes to the Scheduler activity and says, \"I'm going to book a class at 7 pm and 8 pm, on Friday.\" The student, after booking the class, will then be sent a reminder through Moodle as well as a reminder to their email address, with the link to the Zoom channel where the class will take place. As I said, I love this plugin, it's great. It would be extremely helpful if you looked into ways to make the plugin more online-teacher oriented. Thank you.",

However, you say that this has not worked for you, giving you an error \" You can't start an empty appointment slot in the past \", is that correct? This seems like a bug to me. However, I tried to reproduce it on the latest version of Scheduler, and for me everything seemed to work out fine. You can tick the \" Delete this appointment (when saving the form) \" checkbox for one student (or more), and the appointment will in fact be deleted. The error message is shown only when you try to delete *all* appointments in the slot, thus leaving it empty, but i understand that that's not the case you're asking about. Hence the problem might have to do with the Scheduler version you are using. The edit screen has changed several times, and the method I described above should work from Scheduler 3.3.0 on. Possibly you're using an older version - which is it? Best wishes Henning",

          "Text": "Hi Henning, First thanks for a very useful plugin that has been really helpful for us with booking E-Learning webinars with a global group of E-Learners. Then on to the issue we encountered which caused us some problems last week.  When updating an instance of the scheduler we found that while we made no changes to grade settings the grading disappeared. I did some tests and diagnostics which may help identify the cause. However, first it is worth noting how we use the scheduler as this may be why we have noticed this when others have not. We use a course for multiple intakes. Each course has several scheduler instances for interactive webinar booking.  We add slots for each intake. We grade students for webinar participation. The sum of webinar grades must be above a certain percentage for course completion. Recently we changed the platform used for the interactive webinars ... so we altered the description to add the new details. After this we found in some cases the grades were no longer showing. We were able to restore the grades but as part of looking into it became aware there were some perfectly reasonable actions that were causing the underlying grading problem to recur. When I looked in more detail, I discovered this is due to an issue with the user interface for editing the Scheduler text. The following sequence of actions demonstrated this: Cycle 1 Select \"Edit settings\" for a Scheduler instance Set Grade type as \"Point\" and Maximum Grade as \"2\" (for example) Save and display NOTE: Previously entered grades are shown as expected Cycle 2 Select \"Edit settings\" again NOTE: The Grade and Maximum Grade are set as expected. Set Grade Category as  \"Webinars\" (a category in the gradebook) Save and display NOTE: Previously entered grades are NOT shown Cycle 3 Select \"Edit settings\" again NOTE: The Grade and Maximum Grade are shown as NOT set. Repeat steps from Cycle 1 above … this corrects and restores the grades The way we fixed this was to use the Gradebook editor to reassert the link to the Category rather than doing this through the scheduler editing form. In this case the problem did not occur. However, it was still reproducible if we edited the grade through the Scheduler edit for the link to the Category was broken. I appears that what is happening is that when the Scheduler for is used to updated the grade category, the link to the grader item is lost. Also I notice the Ubuntu logfile shows the following error message when this incident occurs. I am not sure if this is connected. PHP Notice:  Undefined property: stdClass::$ requiremodintro in /var/www/html/moodle/course/moodleform_mod.php on line 894, referer: https://elearning.ihtsdotools.org/course/modedit.php?update=1298&return=1 Apologies for the long posting ... it would be great if this is something that can be fixed.",

All 45 slots have 12 seats and 2 slots have 13 participants enrolled and 2 slots have 14 participants enrolled. We made all parameters verifications : group mode is to \"No Group\" value, groupe appointment is to \"No\" and seats limit is effectively active. There is a special configuration in our infrastructure that we suspect to cause the problem : our Moodle runs on 6 load-balanced servers. Is there a verification on seats limit on booking ?

So the students cannot book a suite for a whole week, we limit them to two bookings at a time.

As this scheduler is designed to run semi-autonomously and for a lot of people, this is something I cannot do. Is there a way for the scheduler to automatically mark students as seen once the booking has passed or to delete previous slots? This would save me a lot of time Thanks, James",

As I haven't had a notification from a Forum I just put a message on, I now rather think it is a more general issue between the Moodle dashboard/messages/calendar on the one side and the outlook email system the college uses on the other, and not so much the scheduler specifically??

It's not clear to me (a) how many Scheduler users would actually need this feature, and (b) what exactly would typically mean that a student has \"completed\" the scheduler. You name some alternatives and one could certainly come up with more, but what would actually be useful in practice? In particular, what about schedulers that allow more than one booking, that allow an unlimited number of bookings per student, etc.?

When a student has booked themselves in for a slot they have 'completed' the activity. This opens up quite a few possibilities e.g. It allows me to then target students who have not completed it (booked an appointment) by sending out an automated reminder email through the re-engagement plugin. Or I can send out an automated email to users who have completed it with information that they need for the meeting or class. It allows me to download a spreadsheet showing who has and hasn't completed the scheduler activity by looking at the Activity Completion report. It also allows me to restrict access to other activities on the page e.g. I don't allow students to be able to view a certain document until they have booked an appointment. Another useful completion criterion could be that the activity is 'complete' when a student has been marked as seen. Thanks, Catherine",

We're currently using the scheduler plugin in our university to allow students to book tutorials with tutors. We've been hearing that due to the limited number of tutors and slots, that students have resorted to using software to automatically book slots as soon as they become available, apparently they're using auction sniping software to do this. As a solution, how difficult would it be to add a captcha element to the scheduler plugin, probably after the \"Book Now\"? As far as I can see, one place that would need changing would be the studentview.controller.php script - however looking at the new recaptcha api it's just html/ javascript - would it still be possible to implement recaptcha into the plugin despite this? Again, please let me know if this is not something that can be done and I'll try and come up with another solution. Thanks, Chris",

          "Text": "Currently, Scheduler has a capability setting \"mod/scheduler:disengage\" which controls whether students can drop their appointments. By default, all students have this capability and they see a button \"Drop my appointments\" in the booking screen. However, admins can change the configuration and remove this capability from students (I'm not sure how often they do that in practice). In that case, students can't drop their appointments once they've booked a slot. They can only change their booking, dropping one appointment and booking another one at the same time. This seemed to make sense when students were only allowed to book one slot at a time. But since Scheduler 2.7, students can be allowed to make more than one booking, and then the concept of \"changing the booking\" is more complex (and in fact Scheduler will always allow students to drop their appointments in this configuration). With further feature requests (e.g., paging in student view, CONTRIB-5194 ), things will become even more complicated in this respect - which makes me wonder whether the feature to deny students \"dropping\" (rather than changing) their appointments is really worthwhile. In other words, I'm planning to remove the setting in future versions. Students would then always be allowed to drop their appointments, unless the appointments are within the \"guard time\". However, if you still require this feature, please reply here, and explain why you think it's required. Thanks Henning",

The most important difference to previous versions in the change in group handling ( see here ). Scheduler now distinguishes between \"Scheduling in groups\" (i.e., a student can book their entire group into a slot), and the more standard Moodle \"Group mode\" (\"Visible groups\" etc.) The effect of setting the \"group mode\" is now that students can book slots only with teachers that are members of their own groups. This is a major change from Scheduler 2.7; data will be converted accordingly when you install the update, but if you have used \"group scheduling\" before, it may be a good idea to check your data carefully on a test system before upgrading your live system. Other changes include a much improved export feature, and a redesigned student screen. Note that Scheduler 2.7 works on Moodle 2.9 as well and you can continue to use it, but I would encourage users to upgrade to the new 2.9 branch of Scheduler (MOODLE_29_STABLE on github). We've been working with Scheduler 2.9 on our own installation for a few weeks, and it seems to be working fine; but if you find any problems, please do let me know, preferably by posting a ticket on the Moodle Tracker .

Basically, what you would do is to fire up the Language customisation tool (under Site administration > Language > Language customization) , select 'scheduler.php' and then scroll down to change strings that have the word 'Teacher' in them. Obviously to do this, you'll need to login as the system administrator (or have him/her login for you). I would suggest trying out the process on a sandbox moodle site first so that you can familiarise yourself and get the correct text to appear where you need it to appear. But do start with reading through the documentation linked above. Cheers! Mark",

Over time, I have received a number of comments regarding this feature; some were confused about how it works, and others asked for it to be changed or expanded. For the upcoming release of Scheduler 3.1, I have reviewed the \"scheduling conflicts\" feature, slightly altering how it behaves (with the intent of cleaning it up); and in particular, I have documented the current behavior: https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Scheduler:_Conflicts I'd be happy to receive any comments on whether this feature is useful in the current form or should be changed.

We welcome any comments, questions, or suggestions--large or small.

You can send me comments in any form, by using this discussion, by downloading the MS Word file and adding comments to it, or by most other methods available. I do ask that any comments be specific. For example, if a comment says, \"The section about modifying a slot confuses me,\" I will want to improve that section, but I won't be sure how to. If the same comment mentions some specific headings, paragraphs, or steps that are confusing, I should be able to resolve the problem. I'm looking forward to discussing the new documentation with you and improving it. Best Regards, Steven",

The challenge is to keep the organisation simple. It is a big advantage for teachers to schedule all appointments with their students in one single tool. Being asked for a teacher might make an appointment with a student that was not offered in one of the regular slots. Here the \"volatile slots\" would come in handy. The teacher could add a single slot for the appointment and reserve it for the student. Without setting it to be cancelled after being released the slot could be registered by other students. \"Volatile slots\" also come with the option to automatically send a reminder and with the option to cancel an appointment. Another nice to have feature would be the possibility to offer more slots but set the number of possible appointments per day/week/month to a maximum (n slots : m appointments, n > m).

          "Text": "Hello Peter I'm sorry, the \"volatile slots\" are now gone for good - and in fact, since I proposed to remove them a year and a half ago, you're the first person to ask for them. I think that few people have ever made use of them (as far as they worked in the first place). From my personal experience in using Scheduler, there's a limit to the \"one single tool\" approach. There are always some special cases where I need to communicate directly by e-mail with students to make an appointment, or where I know that they need not/should not sign up for an appointment; for example, if students are ill, on a leave of absence, can't make any of the slots I offer for various reasons... I think these will always exist, and Scheduler cannot cater for all these special cases. I usually set up an appointment for these student in Scheduler once I've fixed the details with them by e-mail. Regarding more flexibility in how many appointments a student can book, that's an interesting idea; something related has been proposed before ( CONTRIB-5267 ). Feel free to add your views there, or to open a new feature request on the Tracker. I must say though that I'm not planning to implement this with priority; I'm not even sure what solution here would be best for most users. Best wishes Henning",

It will be part of an upcoming 2.9 relase.) In previous versions, when you set the \"Group mode\" of the activity to either \"Visible groups\" or \"Separate groups\", then students were able to book into slots one group at a time. This was a bit out of line with how other parts of Moodle handle group mode , where it's more like an access restriction. Now, Scheduler has two group related features which are clearly separated. Group scheduling: This means that students can make a booking for their entire group, similar to earlier versions. The feature can be switched on or off at a per-activity level, using the new \"Booking in groups\" setting. Group mode: The \"Visible groups\" / \"Separate groups\" setting will now mean that the activity is \"split in groups\" in the usual Moodle sense: students can book a slot only with a teacher who is a member of the same group. Teachers who don't have the privilege to \"access all groups\" will also see a restricted set of slots only. The configuration settings will be migrated during upgrade; that is, if before upgrade you had a scheduler in \"Visible groups\" mode, then after upgrade it will have \"Booking in groups\" set to \"yes\" and its group mode set to \"none\". Please check your data after migration.",

          "Text": "My institution has a widespread requirement for a good slot booking plugin in Moodle, and I have been evaluating Scheduler as a potential solution. I have set up the following scenario, and the results raise concerns for us about leakage of students' grades between courses: Create Course A with users Student A and Teacher A. Create Scheduler A in Course A and enable grading. Teacher A books a slot with Student A, marks the student as seen and gives the student a grade. Also create Course B, but with users Student A, Teacher A and Teacher B. Create Scheduler B in Course B. Login as Teacher B (who is not enrolled in Course A). Go to the Scheduler Overview tab and filter the view by Teacher A. Teacher B is now able to see the grade given to the student by Teacher A, in a course that Teacher B is not enrolled on and cannot enter. I would be interested in knowing whether others who are using Scheduler view this as a feature or a bug. Are there any workarounds to prevent this happening? I know that we can downgrade the Teacher role capabilities to those of a Non-editing Teacher, but this leaves Teachers unable to book slots for other Teachers. Any comments or suggestions would be very welcome.",

That might seem a little unintuitive, since Moodle's \"coursemodule instances\" are normally completely isolated from each other, and access rights are maintained on the level of individual \"coursemodules\" (eg, Schedulers). However, to my understanding it's a feature, and one that has been in Scheduler for a very long time (back to Moodle 1.9, before I took over the maintenance of Scheduler). I haven't changed it since. I'm actually not so sure how useful the \"Overview\" feature, looking across all schedulers and courses, actually is. For what I'm concerned (or our institution), we could just restrict the data to the current scheduler or course.",

This is now available on the master branch on Github, and I'm planning to release it in a 2.9 branch of Scheduler later this year. Note that it's no longer possible to export the total grade of a student directly from Scheduler - it just didn't fit the overall scheme. However, you can use a gradebook export for this purpose.

I like the Scheduler plugin for this, as students can use the same Moodle login as they are using for self-guided learning. However, I really would like the students to be able to see bookings listed that are already booked up by other students, just so they can believe the instructors are making themselves available. If they don't see any already occupied bookings, they may not believe the instructors are actively posting slots and give up on visiting the Scheduler page. I was under the impression the See other student booking on the slot permission would allow this, or is this only targeted at slots that allow multiple student bookings? I realize this function may clutter the schedule screen for some, but making it an option on the settings page (default: off most likely) would allow students to see that slots are being made available, even if they are being booked up quickly.

This should solve the original poster's problems and also the problems which arise from the fact that you can only drop yourself from a group appointment. You need the group association for dropping group appointments (to drop a group appointment for every member in a group), this could be implemented by reusing the \"Appoint for\"-dropdown menu. Basically the user selects which groups appointments to drop with the same dropdown menu and then the appointments are dropped for all members of that group, if the group appointment existed. Or maybe it would be better to add a separate dropdown menu. Are there other cases where that group association would be needed (= would it be more reasonable to add a slot-group association table)? Also it could be more user friendly to hide all slots that are already booked by some group. I can implement this if it sounds reasonable. I've chosen to use this plugin at my university, however I think that this group appointment problem needs to be solved somehow first. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice how to proceed. Should I add tickets to the issue tracker? Oh, another issue I had. Slot list pagination doesn't seem to work if the user is a student. I have a use case which requires for continous slots around the clock and without pagination the list becomes too big to use.

          "Text": "Hi Pirkka As you may have noticed reading this forum, the group scheduling process is a quite complex issue. I agree that this is an area of Scheduler which might use some review in future versions. Some of the questions involved are: Should the booking be for a group, or for the individuals that were in the group at the time of booking? Can individual members of the group drop their own appointment (or that of the group)? Who can make an appointment for the group? Should grades be given on a per-person or per-group level? Should the same scheduler contain both group and individual appointments? These are just some of the questions to which different users may have different answers, and I'd be interested to hear what is actually required out there. However, the current group scheduling feature has been around in Scheduler - almost unmodified -  for 8 years or so, and I guess that a number of users rely on the current functionality as is, so changes have to be done with care. I'd also expect that any nontrivial changes to  group scheduling will trigger quite large-scale changes to the code. In short, I'm inviting opinions on this point, to find out what requirements and typical usage patterns actually are. But I'm not planning to implement (or integrate) major changes to the group scheduling feature in the short run. Regarding paging in the student view, this in fact doesn't exist at this time. However, you may want to vote for CONTRIB-5194 . (Zero people have voted for it so far.) Best wishes Henning",

But why not start with the following ( just brain storming, I am not sure how complex to implement): In the scheduler setting  add an option to force group booking. if this option is chosen: the student will not have an option to book for himself only, the drop down will have only one option ( for the group). any one of the group members can make the appointment the time slot will be locked for any additional booking , even there are enough seats. I don't see any problem of keeping the option for the student to drop him/herself. it will be nice to give the instructor an option to revoke entire slot appointments I think this will be a good start , which can be enhanced in the future. regards wasim",

I run a non credit-bearing English language support programme for International students which I administer through moodle. I currently allow students to sign up to workshops using the scheduler module in moodle. We had previously used the 'Choice' module but scheduler simplifies things by automating reminder emails and generally providing us with slightly better overall functionality and a bit more information. Unfortunately the ideal maximum number of students per slot would be around 25, but is presently limited to 18. We can't use the 'unlimited' option as unfortunately demand for the programme exceeds what we can deliver and this would be unworkable. We once accidentally set a workshop to unlimited and had over 40 signups in two hours - the workshop had to be cancelled. The e-learning team at my institution have advised that they are not able to set a maximum number higher than 18 due to the scheduler module itself. So, my question is: Is there any kind of workaround that the team at my institution may be unaware of? Having searched this problem before I feel like I have seen people alluding to having customized this. If not, is there any other method of working or other modules which might offer similar functionality to what I need without making administration of the scheme unworkable?",

I know that he need to select his group name before saving the choice. but I don't understand what I need to do  (as a teacher) in this setting: \"Allow multiple students per slot?\" How many student should I pick, 5 or 1? If I choose 1 - will all the group members be in the slot (after one of them choose them)? If I choose 5 - then 5 differnt students from different groups can pick it parallel? What should I do?

If a teacher tries to move to a new page in the \"My Appointment\" View (either by clicking the page number or by clicking the \"Next\" link), they are instead taken to the \"All Appointments\" view. Essentially, the URL used by the page buttons: https://mymoodle.edu/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=00000&what=view&offset=1&sesskey=aaaaaaaaaa is missing the \"&subpage=myappointments\" parameter that keeps it in \"My Appointments\" view. This results in great frustration for schedulers with 100s of appoints spread across 5+ teachers, as there is no simple way to view anything beyond teh first page of appointments in the \"My Appointments\" view. I didn't see this reported in the bug tracker so I thought I'd bring it here first. Thoughts?",

Well, I've been doing some work on the master branch recently and the 2.7 version of Scheduler should be released soon, i.e., in July or August. Your help in testing would be much appreciated. Please note that the current master branch should not be used on production systems, it's for development/testing only! Wait for the \"official\" release, there will be a MOODLE_27_STABLE branch. For the changes: Although you won't see so much from the user prespective, I've been cleaning up and rewriting a lot of old code paticularly in the student and teacher views. This also included a complete rewrite of all Javascript code (now based on YUI3) and some security enhancements (sessionid checking is now used throughout). While I have fixed some old bugs in the process, I'm sure that I have introduced some new ones as well; I really rely on you to find them! Feature changes: You can now allow students to book several appointments at once. (This does not work together with group scheduling, though.) You can specify, on the activity level, a \" guard time \" to prevent late changes of slots. If, for example, the guard time is 2 days, then students will be able to book new appointments only if they are at least 2 days ahead, and they can't drop appointments if they are closer than 2 days. The \"volatile slots\" feature, on the other hand, has been removed. Also, Scheduler now supports the new logging API (Event 2). At the moment, I've added only very few events, basically when a student views the booking screen, adds or removes a booking. There are certainly dozens of other events that one might define as well, particularly on the teacher side, but I'm not sure which ones would really be useful. If you're missing any event definition / logging feature desperately, let me know. Areas that need review in the future, but that I didn't manage to cover this time, include exports ( CONTRIB-4131 ), notification messages ( CONTRIB-4647 ), and student-supplied data ( CONTRIB-4924 , CONTRIB-4690 , CONTRIB-4199 ). If you want to help in testing, please check out the master branch to a Moodle 2.7 (or 2.8dev) installation, and report any issues to the tracker ( https://tracker.moodle.org ) . Be as specific as you can regarding which version of the code you're using - it's best to mention when you last updated from github (as the code may change frequently at this point). Thanks in advance! In particular, there are some bugs listed on the tracker that I had trouble reproducing. If anyone can shed a light on whether they occur with the latest version, this would be very helpful. Best wishes",

Teachers can, at any time, create appointments for students by editing the corresponding slot (clicking \"edit\" in the list of slots) and adding the student there. However, there are also some shortcuts for the same task, namely via the \"Schedule\" and \"Mark as seen now\" buttons in the list of students. The screens used for these have changed a bit in the latest version as I have reorganized the underlying code. It seems that they can still use some fine-tuning (cf. CONTRIB-5134 ), and I have always felt that it's a bit unclear whether Scheduler does at that point what users actually want. Therefore, I wanted to do a quick opinion poll: which of the following scenarios are actually relevant in your use of Scheduler? a) The teacher selects a student, then enters date and time for a new appointment. b) The teacher selects a student, then selects an existing slot to schedule the student in this slot (without further modifications to the slot). c) The teacher selects a student, then selects an existing slot and edits the slot data (e.g., changes location, slot description, date or time).",

          "Text": "Dear Scheduler users, I'm considering to make the following non-backwards-compatible change in future versions of Scheduler. At the moment, Scheduler has a feature called \"Volatile slots\". When a slot is marked as volatile, and the student booked into the slot cancels their appointment, the slot will be deleted so that it is no longer available to other students. However, this deletion happens only if the slot is within the \"Reuse guard time\" of the current time (the \"reuse guard time\" is a setting at the scheduler level). This feature is somewhat difficult to use and in a sense incomplete (e.g., it means that students can't sign up for new individual appointments shortly before the slot, but they can cancel their appointment, or sign up for a group slot). I'm planning to remove the \"Volatile slots\" feature entirely, and replace it with the following: At the level of an individual scheduler, you will be able to configure a \"guard time\". If a slot is closer than the \"guard time\" to the current time, then students can no longer change their booking on it in any way (they can't make an appointment, or cancel an existing one). There will be no option to configure this on a per-slot level. See also CONTRIB-4862 . However, before I do that, I'd like to ask whether anyone is using the \"volatile slots\" feature at the moment, and if so, for which purpose, so that I'm not removing functionality that is actually required widely.

If so, he/she will be\nallowed to register in a new session These\nfeatures are very important for the activity we have set up and\nshould remain the same ....

For this to work, you need to set the configuration option \"Students can register 1 appointment at a time\". This means that students will be able to book a new appointment once the they have been marked as \"Seen\" in the previous one. Since I rewrote a substantial part of the code, however, it may well be that I introduced some change unintentionally, which is why I appreciate your help in testing (see below). Regarding the \"frozen\" slots, this is exactly what I intend with the new \"guard time\" feature: If you set the \"guard time\" to 2 hours, then students will not be able to book slots in the last 2 hours before the session, nor will they be able to remove their booking in the last 2 hours. Since these features are, as you say, very important to you, it would be best if you could try whether they do actually work in your particular setup. That is, you should best set up a Moodle 2.7 site (a test site, not your actual production site) and simulate exactly the steps that you need for your activity. If you encounter any errors, let me know via the Tracker. Best wishes Henning",

Maybe that's an \"abuse\" of the group feature... just as well as using \"one group per grouping \" to restrict access to only one group is in a sense an abuse of the group feature (cf. MDL-42979 , MDL-20944 ). However, my feeling is that this would involve quite a bit of changes in the code. One might also think of controlling the facility to schedule \"for a group\" with a capability, so that one could allow only certain students to schedule an appointment for their group.",

We have one-to-one lessons wich are webconferences (openmeeting） with two participants that include one teacher and one student. In general terms, each teacher has several students, each student can have one or more teachers depending on the courses he is taking, and we have also several conferencing rooms. Each pair of Teacher & student has 10, 20 or 40 lessons to be scheduled over a period of time. These sessions take place same day and same time every week. For example mondays, wednesdays and fridays from 8:00 to 9:00. Each teacher has his available time every week or for a certain period of time Is there a booking system that would allow to schedule this? So the events will appear in each one's calendar and that they will be able to access the webconferencing room. So far, we have tried: - Scheduler. Student can only register one appointment and we need to register several appointments for each student. - Face-to-face. It seems its only possible to add each session one by one without the possibility to repeat. We need to schedule 20 to 40 sessions for each student! - Bookings. It seems this one is not up to date for moodle 1.9 Thanks for all your help,",

          "Text": "Hi, I was at a meeting with one of our departments today, and they thought that Scheduler has a great deal of potential. We went through setting one up and then somebody said \"How can students tell us where they are?\" Ah. Turns out that these meetings take place at a location the student chooses - that might be in their space, or in a place where they would like to display their work, or somebody's office, or wherever. They're art students, but this would be good for students of design, performance, horticulture, anything involving site visits, etc. So I'd like to propose an extra setting which when enabled gives each slot an extra text field with a label prompting students to enter a location. Where enabled, this should be forced, so students can only save once they have completed it. Where an existing record is changed, this should trigger an email to both student and tutor. If you agree this would be helpful, please add your vote on the Moodle Tracker - CONTRIB-4199 / https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-4199 Henning, thanks for looking after this lovely module. At my last place we used a form pasted into a Wiki - Scheduler is so much slicker. Yours, Mira",

The issue we have found is that when students within a group choose an appointment slot, the 'Save my choice' button lies right next to the 'appoint for my whole group' tick box (see screenshot attached).  Alot of them don't read the information contained in the questionmark (Group appointment -Choose whether you want to make the appointment only for yourself, or for an entire group) and just tick the box.  Thus the whole group gets enrolled into the slot. Is there a way the the two items could appear separately so they are not confused.  More spaces between the two options possibly or on a separate line?  How can we edit the code exactly to achieve this and could we change the wording to make the action for explicit? Any advice would be much appreciated. with many thanks, Aleks",

The URL of the teacher : <a href=\"{$a->attendant_url}\">{$a->attendant}</a> doesn't work : when the user clicks on the link, he has the following message : \"The details of this user are not available to you\". Even if the user is supposed to see the teachers's profile. What happens is that the resulting link is : http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X While the right URL to correctly display the teacher's profile should be : http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X &course=Y How can I have this work ? I can think of 3 logical possibilities : There is a setting somewhere in Moodle enabling a user to display the profile even if the context course id isn't declared in the url (not sure whether such a setting exists) Change the definition of the \"attendant_url\" variable to include the contexted course id Create a new variable such as  \"attendant_course_url\" that would generate a link like \"http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X&course=Y\" Having no notions of PHP I cannot fathom how to do this, but I'd be glad to learn for the occasion if someone can think of a simple patch to the plugin to enable it.

I've experimented with the scheduler to let students select time slots for vivas. In order to share out the students, they're randomly assigned to a different tutor. The only way I could see for it to work was to create a group (all students assigned to tutor A), then to create a grouping (Grouping A = Group A); set up the scheduler - for tutor A (so just visible to Grouping A); set time slots & select Tutor A as the tutor. Then do the other groups. Clearly, as they're vivas it's only 1 student per slot. So, I want them to select their own time, but let the rest of the group (who haven't really got anything to do with them, other than randomly getting the same tutor!) choose their own. If you set Site Administration -> Plugins -> Activity Modules -> Scheduler -> Enable group schedulin g to 'No', as suggested, can you still attach groups to scheduler? Or, can anyone suggest an alternative solution? (The appointments were set for one person, but it seems that if someone clicks the 'group' you end up with two in the slot regardless.)",

Preferably something that integrates with Moodle. I should be able to make a course template which would include the 30 units and all the associated activities. I should be able to set the commencement date and the software should set all the deadlines for each activity as well as an alarm if deadlines are not met.

I am doing this update with a copy of our production database so that I can test out both the update process and the module behaviour with real data. Now, my understanding is that when plugin modules update if there is a change in a database table this will be taken care of by the updating process. Well, this seems to to have happended for the update I am trying to accomplish because I get the following errors: \n```text\nThis script generated 2 warnings - Scroll to the first warning\n\n\nscheduler module needs upgrading\n\n\n(\nmysql\n): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mdl_scheduler_appointment   \n\n\n(my\nsql\n): SHOW TABLES   \n\n\n(mysql): SHOW INDEX FROM mdl_scheduler_appointment   \n\n\n(mysql): CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid)   \n\n\n1072: Key column 'schedulerid' doesn't exist in table\n\n\n\n\nADOConnection._Execute(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid), false) % line  891, file: adodb.inc.php\n\n\nADOConnection.Execute(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid)) % line   89, file: dmllib.php\n\n\nexecute_sql(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid), true) % line 2364, file: dmllib.php\n\n\nexecute_sql_arr(Array[1], true, true) % line 1458, file: ddllib.php\n\n\nadd_index(Object:XMLDBTable, Object:XMLDBIndex) % line  116, file: upgrade.php\n```\n Inspecting mdl_scheduler_appointment table reveals that the field schedulerid does not indeed exist.I figured that I could create the field manually and I was told \"Look at the install. xml file in the mod/scheduler/db folder and you should see a description of it.\" Alas, the install.xml file contains no reference to 'schedulerid' in table  scheduler_appointment. So I'm not sure of where to go from here. Maybe if I dropped all the tables and had my test moodle system create them from scratch to see whether schedulerid is created in the scheduler_appointmtne table that would be a start. Then, perhaps importing the production database over the top might leave the filed where it ought to be.",

If you have two schedulers in two different courses, you create a time slot in scheduler 1, and you try to create a slot with the same date/time in scheduler 2, you will receive an error message. A different approach might be to create a metacourse that includes all your \"toolbox\" courses, and place the scheduler in the metacourse. I hope this helps Henning",

We are adjusting the clocks this weekend due to daylight savings time. Now, starting Monday, Nov. 7th, the Scheduler has added an hour to my appointments - it shows my office hours as 12 - 3.

Please note, my current goal is to develop a version of the module which: works in Moodle 2.0 upwards, does not use deprecated function calls of Moodle, integrates with most of the APIs in Moodle 2.x (in particular: gradebook, backup, internationalization). At the moment, I'm not planning to add new features. I would rather start a general refactoring of the code - which is much needed, in fact! - but these are more medium term plans. The new version includes an English language pack only. If someone would like to provide translations (or transfer them from 1.9), please contact me.",

We are new to moodle and running version 2.2. Thank you, Jim King",

Thinking that this was following the general Moodle practice of designating a point release, a la '1.97' with subsequent updates for bug fixes as '1.97+' built weekly (or, as I interpret it, the \"latest version\"), I used the \"latest version\". One idea might be to clearly label the versions in the contrib section as being designed for \"2.0\" if that's the case, rather than simply \"latest version\" which is a bit more ambiguous. Happy to say that after I quit trying to \"fix\" the latest version and just deleted it, the 1.9 version installed happily.

The Admin doesn't have rights to mod/scheduler:attend or mod/scheduler:appoint, which seems to be what the code is looking for to add users, so I am guessing there might be an issue where it isn't recognizing the site-wide role assignment and including the admin where it shouldn't.

Also is there a way to check the attendance of the students? That is , did A and B took the tutorial at slot 1 or not ? How can the scheduler module be helpful in solving the problem",

That's independent of whether the grade scale is set to 100 or otherwise. Regarding the patch: When coming across some odd behaviour with grade display within the scheduler, I discovered that it was not possible to change the grade scale to anything but 100. After fixing this bug, it turned out that with the scale turned to \"No grading\" or non-numeric scales, many other, immediately visible bugs occurred. Hence my impression that the scheduler grade funcitonality is not much tested, and should be used with care. Henning",

I'm using the same version of the scheduler plugin (Moodle reports it as 2008061700).

          "Text": "Hi, until yesterday we used scheduler with moodle 1.8.x without any bigger problems (ok, we just disabled functions not working). Now we upgraded to moodle 1.9.5+ and updated the scheduler to that version for moodle 1.9 available on the module page at moodle.org. But here my problems begin to rise. First there is a bug referencing a variable \"$displayaddbuttons\" in commands.html when viewing the scheduler page as a trainer. This bug prevents the add buttons from being shown. This variable isn't been defined in the scheduler module. After fixing that i'm getting the add buttons. But clicking on the left one (adding a session?) brings up the next error: \" Fatal error : Call to undefined function scheduler_getteachers() in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/addslotsform.html on line 78\". This function isn't been defined in the scheduler module. Maybe i'm missing something or the scheduler module is broken. Maybe this is an outdated version available for download ? Btw . using the cvs version makes things not better. After fixing the bug with \"richtext2\" mentioned in an other thread here, i'm getting the next error message: \" Fatal error : Call to a member function insert_record() on a non-object in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/lib.php on line 35\" . I would like to see those errors fixed.",

I downloaded the scheduler several times now from http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=2732&filter=1 where \"Download for Moodle 1.9\" links to http://download.moodle.org/download.php/plugins19/mod/scheduler.zip . After putting it into my testsystem (following version of moodle: Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090916)) it installs and upgrades table for scheduler. Btw. scheduler module states itself as of version \"$module->version = 2008061700\". This version does not work for my moodle 1.9 install! See picture in attached zip file. After turning on debugging, i get the following message: \"Notice: Undefined variable: displayaddbuttons in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/commands.html on line 4\". A few days before i downloaded an older version of scheduler module from http://www.ethnoinformatique.fr/course/view.php?id=122 which is named \"2008061700 - Scheduler release 11\". This one states itself also as of version \"$module->version = 2008061700\". This version seems to work for my moodle 1.9 install although it seems to be for version 1.8! Making a diff of both of those schedulers i get many differences which shouldn't be if both would be of the same version!!! I will attach a zip file containing a diff file with differences between both downloaded scheduler archives with module version as of \"$module->version = 2008061700\" and the error message when using your recommended version.

Once done, the module is ready to add within your courses. Some module do have some general parameters for tuning them globally. If they do, check that by the Modules/... menu. For the Scheduler, would you mind waiting for the release 8 that should be published tonight ?

I'm not lucky (or am too lazy) for having Mac version of browsers, working on Windows, and XML error reports on IE or Firefox are really uncomplete, quite unworkable. Yours seem much more interesting. Why you cannot see much stuff in view.php is because I organized the code using includes for isolating modules. The faulty part may not be in view.php, although it is at first loaded through a view.php call. Of course the errors you discovered could not be fixed by a simple reinstall, as they are present in the distribution. Some errors can be fixed so, specially when they are caused by old or obsolete code that has been not correctly upgraded. Anyway, this setting is too heavy just to watch an applicative error that would accept syntactic weaknesses. You were right setting it one level down, although you gave me enough information to tighen my HTML generation.

I don't know if it was supposed to copy some lang file or something else for other folder, cause if it was supposed i haven't done that. Other question, to uninstall one block or module i just need to delete the proper folder, right? So, just let put my doubts clear... i don't know if the scheduler module can fulfill all my goals, because what i need is a kind of a weekly calender, divided by hours, where the students can book the access to one computer (for example) and when this booking is done, any more student can't book to the same hour. Do you think the scheduler module still a good option? If not, do you advice me something else? Cheers, Vitor",

Modules are self-sufficiant from Moodle 1.7, that is, the distribution structure now accepts language and help files in the module's package. 2. For uninstalling a module or a block, you FIRST uninstall it logically clicking on the \"delete\" link front of the module name in admin -> Modules -> plugintype Then only will you delete the module directory. If you don't follow this exact procedure, the module still is recorded with the last known version number in Moodle. Still worse : all the instances of this module or references to these instances WILL NOT BE cleanly deleted from other parts of Moodle. 3. For you purpose, Scheduler could do the job, I think. I was thinking about offering alternative timeline views, so that easyer reference to a specific weekday could be available. The slot can of course be understood as \"a time token\" for on person, not only for a face-to-face appointment !! Valery.",

I found also a misnamed function §95 $status = scheduler_appointment s _restore_mods ($mod->id, $newid, $info, $restore); needs a 's'. Finally, in case you use other modules from ethnoinformatique.fr, you moight protect the last function declaration in locallib.php, just like this. /** * adds an error css marker in case of matching error * @param array $errors the current error set * @param string $errorkey */ if (!function_exists('print_error_class')){ function print_error_class($errors, $errorkeylist){ if ($errors){ foreach($errors as $anError){ if ($anError->on == '') continue; if (preg_match(\"/\\\\b{$anError->on}\\\\b/\" ,$errorkeylist)){ echo \" class=\\\"formerror\\\" \"; return; } } } } } this is I confess, an architectural irresolution of this module set, that used a redundant utility function in several modules, as we have no common \"third-party\" lib space that would be easily usable for making blind installs. I checked that some data actually do not restore in the scheduler. I work on it before publishing next release. I'll fix all this in release 8. I will add a little enhancement to release 8, that is, allowing to distribute grade and/or comment on all participants of the slot when grading the appointment.
