Peace - Anthony p.s. - OK, I found a previous discussion in http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=68653 and searched the tracker to find that it was related to MDL-13451 which mentions a possible fix for you by commenting out the line: case \"'\": cmd = \"indent\"; break; (to comment out a line just put a couple // at the beginning of the line). Hopefully this will help. I did try using CTRL+Right with IE 7 and Moodle 1.8 and 1.9 and was getting the indent behavior. The tracker issue mentions this will be resolved in Moodle 2.0 as we are moving to TinyMCE rather than HTMLArea for the editor.",

          "Text": "Hi Justin, We've disabled this in the core Moodle product for a number of reasons and you should be aware of these before re-enabling them. Firstly the issue you touch upon, accessibity. Colour is often, incorrectly, used to convey meaning. The old 'Green means good, red means bad'. That may be fine for a lot of users, but it's a problem for many. In the example syou give (key concepts, case studies, reflection, deadlines, warnings)... these are all conveying an important concept and colour alone should not be used for this. The other main issue is that of fitting in with themes. Again, you touch on this, but the problem is more involved. Whilst you can probably find a set of colours which fit with your current theme with _relative_ ease, TinyMCE stores colours as hex in style attributes on the element itself. Should your organisation ever change their theme, their colour palette, or even just allow users to select a different theme (e.g. for accessibility resaons), the colours will nto change and cannot be easily changed in line with the theme without modifying the content further.",

Appreciate the insight into the updating the colour palette concerns, I did have my fingers crossed that someone would mention that there is a way to install a CSS at the category level to control colours and then a way to upload html pages (developed offline) into Moodle. We aren't concerned to much about theme's and palettes matching (branding isn't as important in a college's internal LMS, if there is research that says otherwise, please share). Yet updating the palette category or site wide would be beneficial and time saving. Will take a look at MDL-76517 . We are hoping to guide instructors to better options than let them search for their own, so will continue exploring the plugin Tim mentioned.",

The other problem is that now I no longer have the HTML (<>) icon on any assignment editor box.  (I do see them above on THIS box, just not in MY Moodle).  They are all just gone.  I can not embed or use the HTML code.  Does anyone have any idea what I did? I am just a teacher, and my Adminstrator can't figure it out either.  We thought it was my Profile, and created a whole new Moodle, transfered assignemnts/kids in, created a new profile for me...with same result.  She even made a new teacher for the site and that profile has same trouble.  Other teachers in my district's Moodle work just fine.  I do not know where to go next.  I can not see the Adminstration tools, so I am in the dark on \"code\" and all that.

My question for this for this forum is ... How do I change the way moodle looks, the colors, the buttons, the interface?  Should I use the HTML editor, or can I use Photoshop or Dreamweaver?  I am not proficient in code, but I am a quick study. Before I start the onerous task of digitizing 6 levels of ESL into our moodle platform, I need to ensure it will look like we want it to look. thanks in Advance Jay",

Arial Unicode MS and Lucida Sans Unicode include IPA support and most current computers have (at least one of) these installed. More info about downloading IPA fonts for example from http://www.unc.edu/~jlsmith/ipa-fonts.html Next step could be to edit your theme css files and change the default font-family to something like font-family: \"Lucida Sans Unicode\",\"Lucida Grande\",\"Arial Unicode MS\",\"Doulos SIL\",\"Charis SIL\", \"Gentium\", \"TITUS Cyberbit Basic\", sans-serif; In moodle 1.9.9 you can also (as an administrator) modify the default settings of editor from Administration > Appearance > HTML editor and set Default font-family (in editor) and add new font-families to Font list (fonts seen in moodle 1.9.9 editor font drop-down list)...

What OS do you have? Are you saving as .docx? The various documentation pages suggest there may be limited compatibility with some combinations of those. You also may need to be very particular about how you apply the formatting in Word, for it to be interpreted the correct way in the plugin. If you are comfortable uploading an example Word document that reproduces the issue, that may provide some hints to the issue. Good luck!",

If I cut and paste a line från another page, containing a link, the buttons gets activated again, but only for that particular link. Changing back to boost template doesn't help. I have used Enlightlite before when link buttons was working and I have no clue what I may have changed to screw up the TinyMCE editor.

When it is loaded, any php that is in the page gets executed by the server on its way to the browser.  To prevent that, the string has to go through regular expression filters to take out malisous code that would execute on the server (PHP has all the system calls (such as \"rm\" any files created by the Apache user--which your ID when you get executed).   Likewise, javascript could be executed by the browser, though I only think it can only set/earse cookies.. but it could be AJAX code that... This is interesting to me for a whole other reason-this is where the image data (string w/in a string) can be located, altered into a normal image (ie jpg) and stored, and the img reference to it can can be subsituted into the string to string to create a normal web page, rather than one w/ image data in it (there is really no other way). I wrote my very last paper using the original \"composer\" that came with ncsa moasic (first graphic browswer), later netscape, etc, to Sea Monkey.  I am wondering if that is not the place to develop given all potential the security issues. Sea Monkey composer has problems, but all are with optional features that can be found in the browser itself, such as text searching and spell checking.  The major advantage is that I could paste from the clipboard, such as illustrations, or, even more useful, text directly from google books so that I could look at it while I wrote-in the material for the paper(s). I will continue with the TinyMCE browser until it has a filesystem list for all the files and a search function, then give it a rest.  I am beginning to feel that the web-connecting \"app\" route (such as on Android) makes more sense than the \"intelligent\" web page that started as CGI and became javascript.",

          "Text": "Hi there, My question has more to do with 'best-practice' approach of creating plugins for Atto, and not so much a technical query. I use an example below, but I'm more interested in discussing the best overall approach , and not in finding a solution to this particular case. Use Case: We need to be able to set the colour of font to predefined brand-specific colours. However the generic FontColor plugin, that ships with Atto, has only a few select colors to choose from (not the exact colours we want). My question: should we create a new plugin, that mimics the functionality of the existing FontColor plugin exactly, the only exception being the colors it makes available? Or should we edit the existing FontColor plugin to offer our brand-specific colours? I prefer the original approach as we then dont have to fiddle with the FontColor plugin at all, and therefore benefit from any code maintenance to that plugin moving forward. The downside being that the additional button in our toolbar is going to clutter the editor, and will suck up more of my dev time. The lazy developer in me points out that it would take only a few small changes (and not much time) to edit the plugin and make the new colours available. The downside of this approach being that we have custom changes to a plugin that may be updated in future and may conflict with our changes. Any thoughts?",

          "Text": "First I apologize if I posted this in the wrong forum - I am quite new to Moodle and I'm not 100% sure what module I am in when I am doing this. My Moodle version is \"1.9.5+ build 20091007\" but I just upgraded from 1.9.4 (today). Everything seems to be working properly except for this one thing. I had the problem with 1.9.4 and thought upgrading might help but it din't. I am in a course, and have added a web page. I'm using WYSIWYG mode but if I switch to HTML view I get the same problem. I have a block of text, and as soon as I insert the word \"from\" into it, when I try to save it I get a page cannot be displayed (404) error from my web server . It doens't matter where in the document I put the word from. If I put the word \"frop\" in instead, it saves no problem. As I said this is my ONLY problem and I can save just fine without the word from. If I put the word from in a different section it works fine, but if I create a new section with the same text and add the word from it gives me the same problem. I know... this is truly bizarre. Below is the text. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me if using this text gives them the same problem or if it's just me, and if anyone has any suggestions?? __________________________________ So now you know what web hosting is, and you need to select a web hosting package.",

I'm going to introduce you to 3 categories of web hosting that I've totally made up - Cheap, Great, and Extreme Cheap web hosting The price range for cheap web hosting is usually 5 to 10 dollars a month. It may seem strange, but the cheap web hosting plans are usually the plans that offer the most. Some careful shopping will get you a cheap web hosting package that has unlimited disk space, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited my sql databases, Fantastico and lets you host unlimited web sites. This is the type of web hosting I highly recommend to anybody who is setting up their first web site, for many reasons. First it is cheap so you're not spending a fortune while you are learning, second because once you have your first web site, it's trivial to set up a second, third fourth and more - your only cost is domain name registration. You may be asking how these companies offer such a great service at such a low price, and the answer is that they oversell http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling#Web_Hosting their capacity. When you sign up for web hosting, even though it looks like you are on your own server you are actually sharing a physical server with many other customers. The cheaper web hosting companies put more users on one server than the server is able to support, assuming that most users won't use their account to it's fullest capacity. This brings us to the drawbacks of using cheap web hosting. If one of your neighbours starts mis-behaving, your web site will get slow, or possibly be unavailable (although this kind of problem is usually dealt with quickly). There are also other, hidden limits (like inode limits or cpu usage limits), so if your web site starts to get popular/busy you will need to move it to a dedicated server. This also means if you have a sudden spike in traffic, your web site might be temporarily disabled. Even with the drawbacks, I highly recommend using a cheap web host for your first web site, because it is so flexible and cheap, and it will be a while (if ever) before you need to move to a 'great' web host. Great web hosting This is the next step up from cheap web hosting and generally costs $15 - $100 a month (Excellent companies can be found for $15 - 20). Web hosts in this class normally do not offer unlimited anything. For example, the basic Liquidweb hosting plan gives you 1GB of disk space, and 120GB of data transfer a month for $15. The difference is they do not oversell their capacity (or they oversell less) so you will get better web site performance, less downtime, and less chance of a traffic spike causing problems (as long as you stay within your bandwidth limit). The other nice thing about using a great web host is that usually the tech support is much better. When you request technical support from Liquidweb you normally get an answer within 30 minutes, and there is an actual 1800 number that you can call and talk to a person. I recommend great web hosting if you only plan on hosting one web site, or if you are building a business web site that need to be rock solid and fast, all of the time. Extreme web hosting You will know when you need extreme web hosting. When you get into hundreds of thousands of visits a month, and your hosting provider is constantly calling you, it's probably time to upgrade. With extreme web hosting (properly called dedicated server or co-location) you rent or buy a server or servers. The cost starts at 100 dollars a month and goes up very quickly. Usually it's up to you to manage the servers, but of course you can pay to have the company manage them for you. If you get to this point you will need at least one IT person, if not a whole IT team to manage your site - this is not something you want to do alone. It is highly unlikely that anybody would need to start out with a dedicated server.",

Is this in the WYSIWYG ? How do I disable this feature? I actually find this behavior quite counter-intuitive. I find relative URLs (that begin by referencing the root of the website) to be extremely flexible. Yet I see various parts of Moodle beyond just user input where resources are referenced absolutely. This adds complexity for things like running a site entirely over ssl. Granted at least that part is fairly well managed in the config file anyway. It also can be frustrating for doing things like copying around moodle instances and running them under different domain names. I'm keen to take a look at possibly taking a look at how this is done in Moodle and submitting patch proposals - but first I could really use help in finding out if I'm missing some setting for this somewhere? Thanks for the help! Cheers friends!",

I have come up with a way to do this but it needs a core patch, so would like a sanity check in case there's an easier way to do it. In the form definition: \n```text\n        $editor_toolbar = <<<EOT\n\n\ncollapse = collapse\n\n\nstyle1 = title, bold, italic\n\n\nlist = unorderedlist, orderedlist\n\n\nindent = indent\n```\n The patch just passes the atto:toolbar string from the form definition when constructing the MoodleQuickForm_editor: \n```text\n--- a/lib/form/editor.php\n\n\n+++ b/lib/form/editor.php\n\n\n@@ -99,6 +99,11 @@ class MoodleQuickForm_editor extends HTML_QuickForm_element implements templatab\n\n\n         // Note: for some reason the code using this setting does not like bools.\n\n\n         $this->_options['subdirs'] = (int)($this->_options['subdirs'] == 1);\n\n\n \n\n\n+        // Atto toolbar options.\n\n\n+        if (!empty($options['atto:toolbar'])) {\n\n\n+            $this->_options['atto:toolbar'] = $options['atto:toolbar'];\n\n\n+        }\n\n\n+\n\n\n         editors_head_setup();\n```\n If there's a way to do it without the patch - I'd love to hear it!

If I open HTMLeditor in fullscreen mode and insert an image or edit table properties (probably others, too), my server begins to run over a dozen of php.exe instances, which use the harddisk very heavy and bring the server nearly down. The insert image dialogue box has env. 4 min. to load and even after closing it, I have at least another 4 min. until the server performs as usual. Could this be a problem related on how php is installed on the server? TIA - Martin",

So it is possible instead of using \"http://lanip/moodle/urltoimage\", I put the wwwroot variable located on config.php, so when I migrate the Moodle site the images keep working, like this \"http://(wwwroot)/imageurl\"",

The wwwroot variable is used to ensure that there is one, authoritative, URL for the site. Moodle has a number of places which expect that you are accessing it via the correct address. If you are not then you will likely enter a number of weird issues such as this one. Additionally you'll see that if you don't use the correct address the files you have uploaded will be removed after approximately 4 days because they will not have been picked up by the file processor when parsing the text, and they will therefore not be moved from the draft files area. If you really want to use the internal IP address, then I suggest you set the IP in your local host file. Something like https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/ will help you find out how to do so. Andrew",

Remember moodle caching is really sticky, refresh the heck out of pages after you update. Spread the love peps - share your solutions. Thanks, - Rachel",

          "Text": "Hello everybody. Part of the tinyMCE editor checks and validates HTML, which in principle is fine. However, in some cases it's a real pain, because it strips out what it thinks are invalid tags, even though I want them to be there. For example, you can't include a <p> tag inside a <span>. Now, I know that this isn't great html, but there are good reasons why I want to do it. I also have trouble with applet tags. I'm sure that somewhere in the tinyMCE code there must be a way of switching this kind of thing off, or at least modifying it.  However, I've had a good look and I can't find it. Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks, Chris",

I don't want to nix copy and paste via TinyMCE on the site completely, but have the flexibility to turn these off for certain situations. Browser security did this with Atto (which I realise is a JavaScript-based editor ), but is there any mechanism to get the same restriction option with TinyMCE?

In other modules, it allows the user to toggle between \"plain text\", \"HTML\", etc. ...and yet in other modules, you are not given a choice whatsoever. Is there a way to change the default format to apply to ALL modules/HTML editor fields to make them selectable or default to another setting other than HTML? Telling people to not copy/paste and instead to only input text by typing directly into the editor is not really an option, neither is listing a caveat to press the Clean Word HTML button (which isn't always a fail safe).",

          "Text": "Hi, In a german forum of Moodle in higher education we recently a thread with the question about the experiences from moving to TinyMCE as the default editor. What keeps sites away from moving to Tiny at the moment? One note beforehand, in recent Moodle versions fixes and improvments were done in the TinyMCE intregration. Not all of the issues mentioned below are from Moodle 4.3. Some of the things might be resolved already in the current 4.4 release. I will here try to list various aspects and obstacles that were mentioned when the TinyMCE was in use. I just comment here without having this verified. Some of the reports are also a bit unspecific. Missing broader formatting options (other font sizes etc...) Missing plugins to format/insert object (e.g. Embeded question, Teams Link) that exist in Atto Links were inserted but mysteriously had been moved to the begining of the text/paragraph. Stripping certain tags or attributes that are otherwise usable ( MDL-80953 , MDL-76233 because I was involded there I mention these two explicitly). There are a bunch of institutions including the one where I am working at, that did not report much problems. If so, these could be solved with an additional plugin or other fix. For the worst case we recommend switch back to Atto or even use plain text. Also what is considerable from my experience: technical departments such as math, physics, chemistry, computer sciense tend to use more technical annotations (Tex, source code, chemistry formulas) that cause problems when edited with the TinyMCE. This is a filter that lists issues in the TinyMCE component that are open or in development: https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=25025 For all that are afrait of loosing functionality: If something is not working as excpected please check, who is involved (teachers only or all users). When teachers only, how big is the group? Is there a chance to provide them with a feasible workaround? In our institution the computer sience department faces the most problems but these people are also the most skilled ones. HTH in the development and in migration stategies. Stephan",

I have also made to sure to use the <> html mode with the HTML editor. This is the embedded code FormsCentral has given me: <script type=\"text/ javascript \" src=\"https://formscentral.acrobat.com/Clients/Current/FormsCentral/htmlClient/scripts/adobe.form.embed.min.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var fOqa_2a_2d6n8Te7toc0YdTCEmA = new ADOBEFORMS.EmbedForm({formId:\"Oqa*-6n8Te7toc0YdTCEmA\", server :\" https://adobeformscentral.com/ \", width:600, showHeader:false, transparent:true, widthAfterRedirect:600, heightAfterRedirect:400}); fOqa_2a_2d6n8Te7toc0YdTCEmA.display(); </script> I figured I just had to copy and paste this into the editor, but I seem to be wrong.

          "Text": "At Swansea College, all our systems use a SSO (using LDAP ).  This means that on our Moodle installation we require both an internal http://swanvle/moodle plus a https://vle.swancoll.ac.uk .  We have set Moodle up to distinguish which route access is made and defines the $CFG-> wwwroot variable in config.php as required. This works for general Moodle use, but unfortunately any internal links to resources using the HTML Editor causes issues, as Moodle automatically prefixes all relative addresses with http://swanvle/moodle . Does anybody have any ideas of any method of resolving this issue?  The links then become unavailable when Moodle is accessed externally using the https://vle.swancoll.ac.uk address. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Chris Simpson",

          "Text": "Dear Sir, I am using Moodle 3.6.1 and have successfully installed the Atto Microsoft Word import plugin. When I drag the docx file including texts and image to the Atto text editor space, it successfully converts to html and embed the text and image into the Moodle. However, if I click the word import button and select docx file to upload , it displays nothing. The texts cannot be uploaded except the image seems to be uploaded and stored in somewhere. Users may think the feature does not work since they accustom to click the button, It would be a bit imperfect. Please kindly give a hand to solve this problem. This is a wonderful tool and I really want to include this function in our newly install production Moodle. Thank you very much, Best Regards, Kelvin Ma",

          "Text": "Hello, I've been copying text content from either Word (pasting without formatting) or from a webpage (in Blackboard, where the content is simple, hand-written html code) into the editor wysiwig screen. When I do this into a web-resource page it goes fine. But when I do it into a Forum description block or the Course Summary block in Settings I get a bunch of line breaks. On very clean code where there was only a lot of text between <p> </p> tags, the line breaks show up in a weird way. They don't happen where the source browser had put them to display the text. Rather, they show up where the text line wrapped inside the wysiwig editor. We've looked inside these text fields in the database and there's not any html code there causing the breaks. The nearest thing we can figure out is that there's an ASCII carriage return that doesn't display that gets carried throughout, and that when these objects get churned into html to make up a page, the script replaces carriage returns with a <br /> tag. With a lot of messing around, deleting space at the ends lines and such, we can get rid of these, but it's not very clean. Is there anywhere in the php scripts that we can fix it? Thanks, Bill Jones",

Only the main table style is displayed when the .table ID is set. The other properties are not displayed (head, alternate row styles etc.) We are wanting our client to set the styles of pages within the Book module automatically rather than code these elements in HTML.

Every CORE theme has one. To make these work in your theme you need to add editor.css to the list of stylesheets in the config.php file in your theme. Which may looks like this... $THEME->sheets = array( 'pagelayout',   /** Must come first: Page layout **/ 'core',         /** Must come second: General styles **/ 'editor', ); Checkout MDL-35051 for a better understanding of this idea.

The answer is simple: The editor changes uppercase letters in the file paths of the style-attribute when it parses the table-code. Case sensitive servers will then not find the image anymore. I removed the uppercase letters from the directory where the images are located and voilà: table-background works!

Now I'm thinking, is it possible to make these textareas become htmlarea. what i did was to add these 2 lines above my textarea code: <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"htp://localhost/moodle/lib/editor/htmlarea.php?id=1\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"htp://localhost/moodle/lib/editor/lang/en.php\"></script> <textarea id=\"edit-message\" name=\"textarea1\" cols=\"70\" rows=\"8\" ></textarea> and some codes at the end of the file that begin with: <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" defer=\"defer\"> var config = new HTMLArea.Config(); Basically, I copied these from the forum module files. It worked in that the textarea did become htmlarea with the icons and stuffs. However, it appears that whatever I submit isn't captured. Basically, the submission is through a button: <input type=\"submit\" name=\"Submit\" value=\"Submit\" onclick='javascript:submit1(textarea1.value);/> I suspect that the textarea1.value is the problem here. After the textarea has been replaced by htmlarea, its name may be lost. I wonder whether anyone here can shed some light on how i can get the value of the htmlarea via javascript?",

          "Text": "Hi Andrew, Thanks for your reply. Maybe all of this comes down to how well the features of the TinyMCE 6 plugins have been described: Accessibility checker According to Moodle Docs ( https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/TinyMCE_editor#Accessibility_checker ), the following issues should be checked and reported: Images with empty or no ALT text --> We found that images with alt=\"\" are skipped, but images without the alt=\"\" and/or role=\"presentation\" do get noticed. Long text without proper headings gets noticed, but as soon as you'd add a few headers at the bottom of this, the 'long text, please break up with headings' notice disappears. Table issues don't get reported, at least not the way I built one: A table created in TinyMCE doesn't get reported (instead it breaks the entire report even if there are issues elsewhere in the text). Then I added an MS Word created table (3 rows, 4 columns, no data, no captions or column headers, 2 cells merged), and got a whole bunch of information. The Moodle Docs may need clarification on 'tables created with applications such as MS Word or similar'. Text contrast issues work as expected, but then one expects a user to mess up the text in an application such as MS Word (or know HTML), since text color isn't an option (yet) in Tiny 6. Other plugins - Autosave (tiny_autosave) Is there a setting we can manipulate to get autosave to work with TinyMCE 6? I went about writing some text in a mod_page that was previously saved, then quit the page using the cancel button, and returned afterwards: my last additions weren't saved, so the expected autosave version of the page wasn't restored. You'd expect a warning 'Leaving this page without saving', and a notice 'A previous version of this text has been restored'. Other plugins - Tiny link (tiny_link) We have no idea what this plugin actually does, so we checked the TinyMCE documentation on what we thought was the same plugin. What does this plugin do? Does it handle all the Moodle filter features? Or something else. In any case, documentation on this seems to be missing. If you have any insights to share with us, we'd really welcome them. That way, we can inform our users of the Tiny editor's features once we enable it in our Moodle instance.",

You'd expect a warning 'Leaving this page without saving', and a notice 'A previous version of this text has been restored'. This does work out of the box and there is no configuration required. The autosave will push changes every time TinyMCE create an undo point - that's typically whenever you press the [return] key, change focus, etc. The issue here is that by pressing the \"Cancel\" button you are clearing the form content and resetting all state. When that happens we deliberately clear the autosave content as we've done for many years with our previous editors. If you just refresh the page, then you will get both the form change detetion, and the editor autosave. We have no idea what this plugin actually does, so we checked the TinyMCE documentation on what we thought was the same plugin. What does this plugin do? Does it handle all the Moodle filter features? Or something else. In any case, documentation on this seems to be missing. This is a Moodle plugin, not the native TinyMCE plugin. It is purely used to create a link to either an external website, a Moodle page, or some content, within your text. It integrates with the Moodle repository plugin to allow you to search for, and insert, some Moodle-specific content. It also provides you with an interface to configure some additional options such as setting the link text (instead of using the URL ), and opening the link in a new window. Regarding the accessibility questions: Images with empty or no ALT text --> We found that images with alt=\"\" are skipped, but images without the alt=\"\" and/or role=\"presentation\" do get noticed. This is a valid case and the documented approach for decorative images per the W3C Accessibility Initiative , who specifically note: In these cases, a null (empty) alt text should be provided (alt=\"\") so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers. Text values for these types of images would add audible clutter to screen reader output or could distract users if the topic is different from that in adjacent text. Leaving out the alt attribute is also not an option because when it is not provided, some screen readers will announce the file name of the image instead. This is therefore a correct behaviour. Long text without proper headings gets noticed, but as soon as you'd add a few headers at the bottom of this, the 'long text, please break up with headings' notice disappears. I'm sure we can improve this detection. I'd suggest raising an issue in the Moodle Tracker to improve this. Table issues don't get reported, at least not the way I built one: A table created in TinyMCE doesn't get reported (instead it breaks the entire report even if there are issues elsewhere in the text). If you're able to, please raise an issue in the Moodle tracker with an example content that breaks for you and/or replication instructions. Then I added an MS Word created table (3 rows, 4 columns, no data, no captions or column headers, 2 cells merged), and got a whole bunch of information. The Moodle Docs may need clarification on 'tables created with applications such as MS Word or similar'. Unfortunately content from applications like Word is typically full of rubbish content which is very hard to clear. We are constantly trying to improve this. Text contrast issues work as expected, but then one expects a user to mess up the text in an application such as MS Word (or know HTML), since text color isn't an option (yet) in Tiny 6. I'm not sure I understand this question? Best wishes, Andrew",

          "Text": "Hi Andrew, Thanks for your elaborate explanations. As I understand it, the tiny_link plugin is there so one can access the 'Browse repositories' bit that is also there in ATTO (and everything that comes with it). Am I correct? On Autosave If you just refresh the page, then you will get both the form change detetion, and the editor autosave. I tested this, and found the following: When the editor is empty and you start writing, then refresh the page or close the tab/browser, the draft stage is restored once you return to it. For an editor instance that already contained text (let's say you wanted to continue writing a chapter or a paragraph), this process of refreshing / closing the tab and then returning to it causes an exception: 'tiny_autosave/id_page: Skipping draft restoration. The editor is not empty'. On accessibility and images The image without ALT text or role=\"presentation\" issue is maybe a luxury: this type of issues would only get noticed if the text containing them was created way before Moodle implemented WCAG / Accessibility solutions, or if the text was edited -> copied -> pasted outside of Moodle, for instance using MS Word (or similar) or direct HTML editing. I understand that's correct behaviour, but it seems a bit easy to accept images with alt=\"\" and role=\"presentation\" as being accessible. Not all images in text are decorative by default. Tracker issues created Regarding the long text and headings finding: I created a tracker issue: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-78985 Regarding the issue I found about the tables, I also created a tracker issue: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-78986 . I don't think this is so much a bug, but more of a potential improvement to the editor. And some remarks The last two bits of my previous post were more remarks than questions, to be honest: Moodle and the available text editors have made it virtually impossible to create unaccessible content. The only way to create low contrast text, or messed up tables, is when a user does so using a desktop publishing app such as MS Word or similar. I agree with you that Microsoft adds more rubbish to text than anyone can clean up. That's exactly why we recommend our content creators and faculty to write directly in Moodle, or use the 'paste as text' option.",

Can someone perhaps help me? For me it doesn´t make sense why the HTML Editor doen´s work with MSSQL. Thank you, Florian",

Only the DB server is running on windows 2003 and MSSQL. On the webserver there are running multiple websites and the avarage load is quite high. Therefor I want to balance the load and use our MSSQL DB Sever. The thread you mentioned covers the topic in a complete windows environment. But once again I don´t understand in which case the editor is dependend on the db Sever. That doesn´t make sense to me. I have alos developed web application which uses such an editor but that was always independent of the db which was used. Do you have another idea? Greetings, Florian",

The original problem is create a filter that given an xhtml (or html)\nfile is be able to transform some tags to another (amb the content of\nthese). For example I would like to transform \"<math>A</math>\"  into \"<img src=B>A</img>\". So, I think that a filter is a good way (because I don't want to change the original html and the filters dont' do it). To create a filter I've created a PHP file named filter.php and I've put it in the correct place to be readed from moodle admin filters. Inside this PHP code I can read all the html file. I only need, then, do the transformation here. Then, I need... IN: html file with some tags OUT: the same html file with the modified tags. To do this, I would have to parser all the html file, and capture the tags and their content to transform it.",

Checking this code suggests that it was written circa 2006, when document encodings and UTF-8 support were perhaps not as well handled as they are now. As such, I think this code should be removed - I'll open a ticket.

It may very well be a better outcome to rollback until you have been abe to more thoroughly test Microsoft's virtualizations with every Non-Microsoft product on your server .

I couldn't insert more than one hyperlink; I lost the Edit Pen on a Topic and had to find a \"back door\" through the URL to salvage things. I've had a terrible time pasting text from MS Word; and even after a \"clean-up\", fragments of HTML code would persist back in Student View. I now use Firefox exclusively for designing; but one has to test both in IE8 and Google Chrome to be sure things can pass public inspection. Results can be quite inconsistent from one Browser to the next. Although it seems \"normal\" to compose in WYSIWYG mode, I now realise the benefits of learning HTML and using the <> mode to view and edit the code itself. It's the code that is driving the effects anyway. It's not difficult to engage with HTML : check out http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp for a good education. Cheers PJ.

On each occasion, as the window loaded, there was a 'flash' of a larger window that contained the OK and Cancel buttons but the window immediately resized itself and the buttons no longer displayed so that I was unable to apply the chosen properties. This occurred on 3 different computers. If it continues, it is likely to be a problem as most of our staff use IE . At home, it was equally interesting! The first time I tried, the results were as above. However, from the 2nd attempt (and I have now tried it about a dozen times) the buttons are now displaying!

When copying and pasting formatted text from the assignment feedback to a new input form, or even copying and pasting within the SAME input form, all color formatting is lost after pasting . This is a major stumbling block to the upgrade because tutor use the \"corrections\" plugin, plus color coded comments to give feedback on student writing. Students are instructed to copy the feedback into the revision so that both they and the tutors can see it. This was not the case with Moodle 2.9. We have \"more font colors\" and \"more background colors\" installed, but I have verified the same behavior with them uninstalled. Does anyone have ideas or solutions.",

To speed up TinyMCE I tried disabling ALL the plugins in the TinyMCE editor settings from my admin account: <moodle site address>/admin/settings.php?section=editorsettingstinymce Then the editor loaded quickly. This has taken out a couple of minor functions, such as inserting emoticons, but loading speed is far more important for me than the ability to insert emoticons. Not sure if this is the best solution but I just wanted to put out something here because I couldn't find any solution on the forums that worked for me.

It means than each user can format their contents as they want, wich is very nice if every one knew a little bit about style, what is not the usual thing. To try to avoid a little this point it can be a point to include in the HTML area a button to insert html directly as a template of the contents. In that way, user that don´t kow well how to format contents, can insert a template and start including the texts. I have done this and included just 4 templates (picture on left, on right, on top and 2-columns) but I pretend to create a more complete set of templates with pre-made html for: Theme objetives list Did you know...?

Looks like this issue is a known bug ( MDL-45910 ) that hasn't been touched in nearly 3 years. I realize that TinyMCE has significantly more powerful image tools, but we'd like to stay with ATTO since it appears this is the direction Moodle wants to go. Is there a known way around this ?",

          "Text": "Hi all! I am fairly new at Moodle, working currently on moving an E-learning system from a CMS to LMS (Moodle). Looking at my options and what I need to modify to make things work out nicely, I have come to learn some limitations in the Glossary module with respect to Flash. Reading up on the issue I finally came over this bug report: bug#4540 It mentions a new HTML editor. I wonder when this new editor will come (the post was made in january), i.e. estimated time and version? I take it this new version will better support inserting a Flash movie, since right now it seems more like an \"accident\" than a feature that you are able to insert a Flash movie in a post (using an empty link). I am in particular interested in inserting Flash movies into Glossary posts (or forum posts), using varying sizes . It would also be nice to be able to send variables to the Flash movie . Another wanted feature would be support for the same parameter system that you find in the resource module. (I don't know if this can be implemented on an editor level or not). In particular the resource module supports passing of an encryption code to the resource. Not being able to do this from a Glossary (HTML) item leads to a lack of reusability (or limitted security). Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "I have just confirmed on my test Moodle 1.3 beta the following: striking the [Enter] key in Firefox /Mozilla inserts a <br> in the HTML area resulting in the 'new paragraph' appearing on the next line. [Shift][Enter] does nothing. The only way to add a <p> is to use the Toggle HTML source and insert the tag. This is actually bad behaviour; IMO [Enter] should insert a <p> </p> tag. However, even though [Enter] inserts a  <br> tag, creating new list items by hitting [Enter] also works (why, I don't know). hitting the [Enter] key in Internet Exploder inserts <p> and [Shift][Enter] inserts <br> - which we knew already. What to do: I don't think that there's any way around this. After all we are dealing with an HTML editor and not MS Word. I haven't tried many different editors - just the usual suspects - but my guess is that [Enter] inserts a <p> by default in all of them. My suggested solution would be simply to use Firefox or Mozilla instead of I.E for Moodle. This would also introduce the user to the joys of a browser that supports WC3 standards fully and allows tabbed browsing among other assets. But remember to fix the javascript issue as described in http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=7543&parent=37117.",

          "Text": "That is an issue, even for experienced writers occasionally. Best bet is to educate your teachers. Show them what you do not want them to do. 1. Create a presentation that has examples of what you do not want to see 2. Convert the presentation to a video, e.g new versions of PowerPoint can convert presentations to a wmv file. 3. If needed Convert wmv file to mp4 and put it into the Moodle - Handbrake will easily convert most formats. 5. Make your presentation at a staff meeting, so everyone gets the message, and your mp4 file is uploaded to a Staff only course on what to do, how to use the new editor. 6. Trust your teachers to mostly get it right, and those few who get it wrong, well, they can be reeducated but it can take a few tries. Colour is always an issue, so talk about the colour wheel, and talk about opposites offering high contrast, which is what text should always be. Too  much colour overwhelms the message Too little colour makes it boring and detracts from the message So the message is keep colours to a minimum, but keep them simple. One issue that is a lot more common than we think is background colour. If background colour is too light there is a risk of luminosity overwhelming the text and the message is lost. Some younger people are subject to serious problems with Irlen's Syndrome where luminosity is preventing them of following the text. They need a muted pastel colour, a blue often works, but a pastel green can be ok too, with very dark text, black on green or navy on pastel blue, not red on green. In Oz, it is an unsettling truth that many Aboriginals have Irlen's and it is rarely diagnosed adequately. It is actually even more common amongst Middle Eastern peoples I have been told. Is also not that uncommon in European and Asian populations either. It is similar to dyslexia, but can have a much deeper impact and the two are often confused. Colour blindness too is an issue, so red on green and green on red should always be avoided. Be careful of the \"signal colours\". Red, yellow and green. Reds and yellows are warning colours, so should really be avoided, muted or pastel greens can be useful in large blocks, are are better used for highlighting a line of text to draw attention to it: Greens can be used to attract attention to important notes but green text needs to be bold otherwise it is lost on this background. Brick colour, not red, can also be used to attract attention to a critical point. Again, it has to be in bold to avoid being overwhelmed by the luminosity of the background. Try these things in a word processing document, see what works what doesn't then use that to build your presentation. Good luck",

I once worked in summers painting classrooms.  The supervisor of the painting crews dropped off appropriate latex for walls and semi-gloss for trim + a direction to paint room #.  Room # was on the East side of the building ... morning sun ... and the building itself was constructed in the 1920's ... classroom on second floor and had very tall bay windows which required painters to use a ladder to paint the walls/window trim on that side of the classroom. Teacher in that room had been very critical of many things on the campus including things like facilities, AC (of which there was none - Texas), drab color of classrooms, etc. The color we were to use (had to use) ... lime green.  My painting partner and I both asked the supervisor if he was sure!!!   Supervisor who was to retired at the close of summer smiled and said 'Yep!' I didn't teach on that campus, but heard from other teachers I knew on that campus how much trouble the teacher in Room # had that year with discipline of students.

You do not need to know any HTML, PLP or MySQL skills to use Moodle, a good understanding of how to explore a new product is essential though. If you want to create courses and classes , then you can just use Moodle without any HTML or PHP or My SQL . As long as you have an idea, then you can create a course, edit and add resources you want to use in lessons to it, add in images, add in such things as Wikis, pdf files, links to other web sites, make documents online, for students to use online, there is a lot you can do. If you want to do things with the screen, like add in things that Moodle does not currently have, like change the layout you want to use, then PHP, HTML and CSS on their own will not help you too much at the beginning. If this is what you are after, then you need to start with themes. You best start here , which should give you an idea of where to go to next. You might want to create new blocks, new activities . These will take some time and planning and a really good understanding of what Moodle is and how to use it. Once you get used to it, using Moodle is actually easy, and the learning curve does not need to be too steep.",

When navigate to that file on Moodle Mobile App and press the 'Play' button on IOS devices, the audio could not be played. 3. Interest finding: seems that the build in player detected the 'tap' gesture as double tapped, so that the file played a very short period of time (may be less than 0.2s) and stopped. Please help!",

Very, very occasionally the audio can be played, but then it can't be stopped or paused. This problem occurs in all activities /resources I've tried: assignments, lessons, quizzes, pages, books and labels. It works fine in browsers (Safari, Firefox ) and Moodle Desktop (on Mac). I have tried additionally uploading alternative sound files (*.aac, *.ogg) but that doesn't make any difference.",

I edited lib/editor/tinymce.js.php and appended the appropriate rules to the valid_element setting. This now allows <ruby> tags to be reatained in a TinyMCE editing session. However, when one returns to edit the text, the <ruby> tag is stripped out. I am wondering where else I should be looking. Does Moodle have another, server -side mechanism for allowing/disallowing HTML tags? Where might I modify that white/blacklist?",

I'd like to put the button in the toolbar for the user to click on. Maybe under “ Table > Cell > Select Box ” Its options could already be registered manually in the code. I haven't been able to, and I've tried several ways, even watching the webinar on youtube about adding plugins Can anyone help me with this? P.s: edit, I found a file called plugin.js in “lib/editor/tiny/js/tinymce/plugins/table”, can I change this file to include the function?",

I've also added some of the extra plugins for colors, etc. and I'd like the users to recognize them. I saw a thread that was older talking about the pix_plugins folder, but it seemed the actual directory structure to use was not decided upon and the documentation linked to was 2.7. When I inspect current buttons, I see that some use font awesome icons. THAT would be...awesome... if I could replace a couple on our installation with icons the users will expect. Short of hacking the core (NEVER!), I'm wondering if there is a way to customize those? One I would definitely need to replace with a png or svg because the way the plugin is used on our site is very customized, so I'd like the users to recognize it. It seems that the toolbar editor would be a wonderful place to specify an override icon...but I'm happy to put them in the right place in the theme, if I can see where to put them. The thing that gave me pause is that one of the ones I want to override is font awesome. That makes me think that randomly testing the file structures suggested for the right override location might not work... Does anyone know how this is done or if it can be done?",

          "Text": "At the moment I'm working on developing a theme based on Boost for Moodle v3.4, and I'm also trying to figure out a standard way to change the icons for some of the Atto buttons. In non-boost themes, we could do this just by adding the new icons in the pix_plugins folder in the theme. In boost-based themes, using fontawesome icon system, things are a bit different. In atto plugins that add the button as (ie, using image icons): \n```text\nthis.addButton({\n\n\n    icon: 'icon',\n\n\n    iconComponent: 'atto_designelements'\n\n\n    callback: this._displayDialogue\n\n\n});\n```\n These can be overridden in the theme by adding the new icons in the pix_plugins folder or defining the icon map in a class that extends the \\core\\output\\icon_system_fontawesome class. See Essential theme for how its done. In the icon map you could do something like the following to change the button icon: \n```text\n$iconmap['\natto_designelements:icon\n'] = 'fa-font';\n```\n However, some atto plugins already use the fontawesome icons for their buttons and these can be overridden in the theme icon map, but not via the pix_plugins method. But the problem I face is that it is not consistent (at least thats what I found). Some atto plugins use the core icon set, eg: \n```text\nthis.addBasicButton({\n\n\n      exec: 'removeFormat',\n\n\n      icon: 'e/clear_formatting'\n\n\n});\n```\n In such cases, we have to do \n```text\n$iconmap['\ncore:\ne/clear_formatting\n'] = 'fa-eraser';\n```\n to update the Atto button icon but this also updates the core icon as well. The following does not work. Or am I doing something wrong??? \n```text\n$iconmap['\natto_clear:icon\n'] = 'fa-eraser';\n```\n So it becomes quite a laborious task to override atto icons, as you have to first find out which icon is used and this information is buried in several layers of folders. If there is an easier way then I would surely like to know that. Thanks, ... Rajneel",

I experimentally uninstalled TinyMCE's text editor from my platform, afterwards I installed Atto HTML editor, but I think it isn't working properly: for example when writing lengthy course content, one would have to scroll up all the time in order to access the toolbar. Also the \"show more buttons\" tab is not available, as well as the options for text alignment . Moreover, I'm unable to access the text editor settings from Site Administration/Plugins/Text Editors, because the settings button is gone. Is there any way to install TinyMCE HTML editor again or fix the Atto one? I'm currently running Moodle 2.9.1+ (Build: 20150828) Than you for your assistance in advance!",

If deleteted from the tree, then all you need do is to extract the directory from the downloaded file and copy it to the text editors directory you deleted it from. Reenter your Moodle and it should appear in the Notifications page as being an update. Otherwise, chances are that the TinyMCE editor has been deleted from the Moodle Database but remains in the Moodle directory tree If you have access to the database, then you can go to the database.mdl_config table and in the field \"texteditors\" add the tinymce to the list of atto,textarea. It should then reappear in your Manage Editors page. Just swap them about, placing TinyMCE first.",

The tags are: <link href=\"myfolder/css/special-style-sheet.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> <link href=\"https://www.mywebsite.com/css/special-style-sheet.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"> These are at the start of the code for the page.  Does anyone know what these <link> tags would be stripped out of the HTML editor when it switches to WYSIWYG ? Thanks, Rob",

Typical FF4 table code added using the table properties function <table border=\"2\" width=\"100%\" rules=\"none\" frame=\"void\" style=\"border-color: rgb(0, 0, 255); border-width: 2px; background-image: none; float: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; border-style: solid;\"><tbody> It seems to be this part, rules=\"none\" frame=\"void\" , that is causing the problem.  If I remove that, it appears okay.  That code seems to be added by the table properties button, and I'm not sure why it adds it.  If I remove it will it break in some other browser (or future browser)? Since I have many, many tables is there any easier way to fix this?  This could be very tedious.  Any insight is appreciated.",

It's not a massive issue for me, since Moodle does put them in decent spots, I was just wondering if anyone else had a solution. In a way, what Moodle is doing makes sense to me since as it doesnt require users to play around with the toolbar settings once theyve enabled Moodle specific plugins, but on the downside it does take away complete control.",

          "Title": "Shortcodes (Wordpress Style)",
          "Text": "Hello All, I wondered if anyone has ever looked at the possibility of adding support for shortcodes the way some Wordpress themes do. The better Wordpress themes add an icon to the WYSIWYG editor that gives users a menu of available codes. These can be used to insert an array of different elements like message boxes, buttons, column layouts, accordions, toggles, image backgrounds and styles. Here are two examples: http://themes.truethemes.net/Karma/features/shortcodes-demo http://dreamthemedesign.com/themes/u-design/features/shortcodes/ When a user selects a short code style from the menu the code is embedded into the editor which typically looks something like this (for a message box): `[message type=` `\"info\"` `]Your message goes here... [/message]` The user then replaces \"Your message goes here....\" with the actual message they want to display. This shields users from the complexity of the underlying css and makes editing much easier. For this to happen in Moodle I think it would require three things: A tinymce pluign to add the icon / drop down picker for styles Filters to replace the short code with the required html (js calls) Styles (js) in the theme Would that be the case or is there a better way to do it? Also, can Moodle handle filters which do more complex replacements like this one for an Accordion which has two elements for the title and the conent: \n```text\n[toggle_content title=\"Toggle Content Title...\"]\nYour content goes here...\n[/toggle_content]\n```\n Although I have mentioned javascript / accordions above I was really only hoping to be able to do something with simpler elements like buttons, message boxes, image backgrounds. Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Jez",

One bothersome problem has been enabling the TinyMCE Editor. It does not display itself in any editor for all major resources (e.g. forums, pages, etc). I have tried the following to get it to work, to no avail: - Disabled and re-enabled the editor in the settings. - Disabled the plain text editor so that only the TinyMCE editor would be enabled. - Attempted to uninstall reinstall the plug-in itself, which I cannot do because Moodle has it's own TinyMCE configuration. See here . - Looked into the scripts on Moodle pages that are supposed to contain the editor to see if the TinyMCE script is being called. As far as I can tell, it is, but I haven't explored the code further. Has anyone had this or a similar issue? Any ideas on how to resolve this? I'm hoping the Moodle community has some other developers that might help me diagnose the problem. Thanks.",

You could take a different approach, however, and get the same thing, but it would not be via the  Moodle UI.   wget and pull all files from a directory that contains the .mbz's .zip's and issued from command line while located in a file system repo for your 2 will work. One could also use scp via command line to copy from the server containing the .mbz/.zip files to a file system repo in the 2. Once you get them into the file system repo, make sure their ownerships/permissions are set for apache user or Moodle may not be able to see/use them. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

On Debian, you just do 'sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-fr' and that automatically installs aspell along with the French dictionnary. I suppose your setup is a bit different.. I'm sure there's an equivalent for RedHat, if that's what you are using. Either way, I doubt you need to manually go place the files in /usr/lib/aspell, unless you really feel like doing a manual install, in which case they would be in /usr/local/lib/aspell ... or wherever you decided to place them after compiling..",

Basically, I downloaded Aspell from: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/aspell-0.60.6.tar.gz And the English dictionary from: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html I then unzipped the Aspell package and put them it my server (the folders). I then couldn't work out where to put the dictionary folder. Perhaps I am doing something wrong? My server is a linux server... It is not my own dedicated server..I am just renting space... I tried making a folder 'dict' and puttin the dictionary files inside, but that didn't work... When the spell check button is clicked, the spell checker popup window opens, but there is an error message saying it cannot find the dictionary.",

          "Text": "Hi Ammon... I go along with a part of what you said. <FONT> is deprecated for some good reasons, in favour of CSS controls.  But CSS isn't a \"related issue\", it's the same issue... the only means of replacing <FONT> with <SPAN> or <DIV> is by using them to embed or refer to CSS controls. What is more, the biggest gain for replacing <FONT> with CSS controls is to liberate a page from its formatting, thus allowing a page or a whole site to take on almost any appearance by swapping or modifying a stylesheet.  That worthy objective isn't achieved by moving the effects applied by the <FONT> tag into the Style attribute of a <SPAN> / <DIV> tag.  Rather the <SPAN> / <DIV> tag must be given a Class and/or ID which is referenced in an external stylesheet. Little is ever cut and dry, however.  CSS controls are often not read by mobile devices which will happily read a <FONT> tag.  Ultimately all formatting, from the layout of a page to the borders around a table should be under the control of a stylesheet; but \"preserve standards compatibility\" is a slightly dangerous phrase, since the CSS controls are often less cross-browser compliant than the alternative HTML controls. In fact, Petrik, taking full advantage of styles in the HTML editor is not an easy business, because it should mean that the editor reads all the styles from CSS files and embedded within the <HEAD> section of the document, puts them into a drop-down menu of the editor for selection, and somehow applies them faithfully within the editor WYSIWYG view.  At the end of the day, <FONT> is deprecated, but I doubt it's going to exit stage left and leave us in the lurch any time soon.

We teach our students how to learn using this online tools; and when it comes to technical details we suggest them to install and run Firefox, and in the Univ. labs we will install Firefox as the default browser, as we have seen it as a more stable browser for Moodle The *potential* problem I see (only potential) is that if 80% of our users is using IE at home, there's 80% of people who could be facing problems with the HTML editor, specially when several instances of the editor are being loaded. I have never heard any complain from our students,; I say this from the opinions read here.",

          "Text": "The autosave is a feature of Atto that I believe was added in 2.8. It saves a draft copy based on context after the interval defined in the settings. If the browser window is closed prematurely, this copy is reloaded in the next page the user opens with the same context.  If the page is saved or cancelled with a button at the page bottom, the draft copies for that context are deleted so that there is a blank editor the next time. I have not notice the problem with editing questions, but I suspect that it is because the user  instead of saving is using the button \"Save and continue editing\" then checks the preview, and closes the window instead of saving the question again. This may also be a new feature. I just noticed it recently. You might encourage the save with the other button. Otherwise, a unwanted draft file can be removed from the editor with ctl-z or the undo button.",

How is this suppose to work with regards to foreign languages? I am running Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron)with Aspell v0.60.5 and Perl v5.8.8. I read Aspell's documentation, as well as Moodle's, and installed all of the necessary language packs. From what I understand the way it is suppose to work is you enter text in the html editor, you select the language from the drop down menu, and click the Spellchecker button. For every misspelled word you should have a choice as to which word you would want to replace it with. I only get choices from the en_us dictionary. I installed using the command; sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en aspell-es aspell-de aspell-it aspell-fr",

          "Text": "Hi all - - I have been having issues some major with my Moodle Html editor – I have taken over the admin of a Moodle site: http://www.buildabridge.net/university (in a voluntary capacity) The HTML editor suddenly stopped working – you could access the page but none of the icons were appearing – I researched the forums and the best solutions seemed to be to replace the lib folder. This made no difference. Coincidentally it has been decided to migrate the Moodle to another domain so I did a fresh install of Moodle on the new domain and copied over the Moodledata folder – but rather then copying over the database I simply changed the new config.php to reflect the old database i.e. the new install was located on the same server as the old so I simply placed the database values of the old install into my new config.php and here is the interesting bit – the HTML editor we was still not working. I assumed that it was something in the Moodledata folder however when I deleted any reference to the Moodledata in the config.php the editor it was still not working so the issue does not lie within the Moodledata folder – i.e. If I replace the reference to the old db with the new, blank, db, the editor works fine – As you can see I have spent a lot of time on this issue and got no answer however and here is the big question: If the problem occurs when I reference the old db, does the problem exist within the db itself? Any input on this issue is much appreciated, Kind Regards, Garrett",

          "Text": "Sorry about my first post - I pasted it from word and it obviously brought all its junk formatting - anyhow here is the question without the junk: Hi all - - I have been having issues some major with my Moodle Html editor – I have taken over the admin of a Moodle site: http://www.buildabridge.net/university (in a voluntary capacity) The HTML editor suddenly stopped working – you could access the page but none of the icons were appearing – I researched the forums and the best solutions seemed to be to replace the lib folder. This made no difference. Coincidentally it has been decided to migrate the Moodle to another domain so I did a fresh install of Moodle on the new domain and copied over the Moodledata folder – but rather then copying over the database I simply changed the new config.php to reflect the old database i.e. the new install was located on the same server as the old so I simply placed the database values of the old install into my new config.php and here is the interesting bit – the HTML editor we was still not working. I assumed that it was something in the Moodledata folder however when I deleted any reference to the Moodledata in the config.php the editor it was still not working so the issue does not lie within the Moodledata folder – i.e. If I replace the reference to the old db with the new, blank, db, the editor works fine – As you can see I have spent a lot of time on this issue and got no answer however and here is the big question: If the problem occurs when I reference the old db, does the problem exist within the db itself? Any input on this issue is much appreciated,",

We were able to access the source HTML code with MS IE 8 browser.  After the invalid code was removed, the user was able to edit and save the label.

Not only do they not like hotspots many table properties are accepted either.\n\nYou can only get round this (in my experience - others may have other solutions) by 'breaking' the page (editing the php code) or using flash or something similar. We have used both, but I'm no php programmer and someone did that for me. If no one else can help you with that perhaps I can get a colleague to explain, but you'd need to be confident in changing code. If you can produce a flash swf for this I can help you wih popping that in.",

Click on a icon to go to a category page - I created the clickable info and scrolling images there in flash, although we've also kept the normal course links. We've not used this technique to condense info/avoid scroll, rather to enhance the quality and look of the information - but it could easily be there for that purpose. Do you or a colleague have access to flash and can create a swf file menu? If so, you can simply add a swf via an iFrame (I can give you the code - v simple). Also, animated gifs can go in here. A table in a category or front page should (if I remember correctly - been a while since I tried) take an image, which you can add a URL link to within the TINYMCE editor (rather than importing an image map) but it won't do things like support background colour or Javascript in these pages.

I've not enough experience of <form> and how it works to rewrite this snippet and was hoping someone could suggest an amendment for me or refer me to some thing that might help. Here's the originals code: <form method=\"post\" name=\"ebrary\" target=\"_blank\" onsubmit=\"ebrary.action=' http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pgcc/search.action?p00='+ebrary.searchtext.value+'&search=Search+ebrary' \"> That line's littered with single quotes and it gets shortened to this after I hit \"save\" <form onsubmit=\"null\" target=\"_blank\" name=\"ebrary\" method=\"post\"> Reading around I suspect this problem has something to do with the way PHP handles things but I'm a complete newbie with PHP.

I find it's replacing all my apostrophes (') with quotations (\") which is rather annoying if I have something like - onClick=\" javascript :dostuff('sdfsdf');\" and the apostrophes get replaced with quotations- it breaks. The other problem I'm having is that moodle decides to modify my onclick functions, and replace with their own code. Which would be fine, but if you goto edit the HTML again, and save, it adds their own code AGAIN, so it's now doubled, and so on and so forth. A longer and more detailed example is below. Example- <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"openpopup('/local/licenses.php?rd=juiQoL4dIFSVHaIkZKFH', '','menubar=no,toolbar=no,width=470,height=384,resizable=no,scrollbars=no');\" title=\"sdf\"><img hspace=\"0\" height=\"374\" width=\"600\" vspace=\"0\" border=\"0\" title=\"sdfsd\" alt=\"sdfsd\" src=\"http://kjhosting.com/vid_mock.png\" /></a> Becomes-",

Maybe it is possible to access the edit screen for section summaries directly by entering the correct url into the location bar of your browser. That means you haven't lost the ability to edit the summary, just the link to click on to get to the edit screen. If there is a section summary on your site where the edit icon is still showing, you can copy the link location of that edit icon. (Right click mouse and choose: copy link location) Paste this in the location bar of your browser. It should look something like this: \n```text\nhttp://www.yoursite.com/moodle/course/editsection.php?id=295\n```\n Now, if you replace that last number, you can use this link to update other section summaries. Problem is how to find out which number your section has. If it is a recent mistake, maybe your browser's history still shows all the links you visited. Maybe you can find out which one it is this way with a little trial and error. Other way is directly editing the database .

Our first release has been submitted to the plugin repository: https://moodle.org/plugins/tiny_keylogger (pending review as of 5/24/23 with an estimated 130-day wait). The plugin captures and formats the data into a downloadable JSON file format available to editing teachers and the administrator with the right URL . The files are structured, user ID obfuscated, UNIX time-stamped streams from the writing process. The file format is compatible with a separate service we've created, so far with this data we have created ML which can verify the authorship of a single student across time (e.g. we can verify that the student remains the author accessing the online text area over time and across submissions) calculating the time and effort of the writing process, calculate editing %, character counts, writing efficiency estimate the amount of text that was entered via copy/paste provide guidance on the amount of text injected via AI extension (such as Grammarly and Google's autocomplete While the calculations are offline currently, we're developing this service further to connect the ML via API.

In that way dragmath's ability to export to any format for which an XML translation is available could be put to use for various interpreters/filters, such as asciimathml. However, I need to be able to use the dragmath initial tag to add dollarsigns and it looks like these are added via the modifications John and others have made to the htmlarea.php file. I was wondering if someone could identify where in that file the dollarsigns are added and whether a change to that file, coupled with a change to the dragmath xml files would impact anything beyond that specific usage. If this works as I expect I will be able to offer a replacement Latex xml format file that inserts the dollarsigns as well as an ASCIIMathML xml file that employs backticks (and by the way avoids the issue of square brackets in the wiki.)",

Even as an experienced Moodle user (from 1.9), it didn't click with me where I would find this setting. Thanks to Justin Hunt, I was able to set it up. I think more information needs to be added to this explanation. For example, Click on your profile icon. Choose Preferences. Click on Editor preferences. Select Plain text area from the pulldown menu. Click the save changes button. To test the feature, go to any text entry area and select Markdown format. Input your text with the Markdown.",

Somehow my user preferences were set to not use the html editor (mdle_user.htmleditor = 0). When I used SQL , UPDATE mdl_user SET htmleditor =1, then all the users then logged in can use the htmleditor. The reason why the preference for the htmleditor was turned off is because I was using a hacked version of user/edit.html, with some of the input fields commented out. But this is surprising. I have removed parts of edit.html before (last term) and when I did the values resorted, I think, to their default values in mdl_user, which is \"1.\" But for somereason it is being set to zero now. Has somethign changed? This should be in a \"user\" forum. I will try <INPUT TYPE=hidden htmleditor=\"1\"> in the edit.html file. Timothy",

          "Text": "This is in Modle 2.4, it may or may not be the same or similar for your version. From your Moodle directory go to the file /lib/editor/tinymce/lib.php Search for the line:  (single quotes included) 'searchreplace,paste,directionality,fullscreen,nonbreaking,contextmenu,' . delete \"contextmenu,\" (don't forget the comma) so the line now reads: 'searchreplace,paste,directionality,fullscreen,nonbreaking,' . Save it. That should do it. Our Moodle is on an Intranet with no outside Internet access causing the tinyMCE spell checkers to not work. I was very happy when Moodle 2.4 let you turn off spell checking. With it turned off the browser's spell checker would mark the word as bad but if you right clicked you got the tinyMCE menu. You could CTRL and right click but that's not intuitive. Hope this helps. PS: be sure that line still ends with a period character after the single quote. That's the concatenate character in php.

Is there an easy (or even a complicated) way to add a custom text style to the ATTO editor?  there doesn't seem to be a style creator.  A plugin would be great, but I guess it's possible to add  some css , though I don't know where, and the forum posts I found for editing styles were very old. As an example, I'm looking to create a style called 'Tutor's Comments\" so that feedback text looks different to the normal paragraph text. I'm using 2.8.3 Thanks for any help or pointers you can offer.",

There are some reasons styles in the Atto editor are a little sparse. It is meant to produce text that is easily read and understood on the web in various contexts and with various applications. This means that text is formated mosty with HTML tags rather than CSS.  Adding CSS classes would have to be supported both in the theme and in the editor. Text that is cut and pasted from Moodle into another application might lose the intended formating when it is transferred.",

You can see the effect better in previous versions of moodle like moodle 2.5 with for example Essential theme (and smaller buttons in tinymce toolbar/old o2k7 skin) That css wraps toolbar rows if screen (window) width is less than 600px and keeps the toolbars at 600px if screen (window) width is more than 600px. I think core moodle developers did implement some wrapping already (wrap plugin?) to tinymce before they started to develop Atto (default editor of moodle 2.7) but nobody tried to create actual responsive skins or mobile themes for tinymce since core moodle developers decided to drop support for working with tinymce.",

          "Text": "Piero, Changing the icon order is easy. Adding one is also easy, IF it is for a tool that has just been left off, such as 'Justify.' Adding a tool icon for something entirely new to the editor, such as Nanogong, is another matter entirely as you have to create the whole plugin from scratch. Read through the documentation for that. Since you did not say which Moodle editor you have, this is how you would add or re-order icons for my Moodle 2.3.1+. Open the file yourmoodle/lib/editor/tinymce/lib.php and look at lines 146 and 147. They define row one of the tools. Notice it is simple list of tool names seperated by commas and vertical bars for grouping . 146 'theme_advanced_buttons1' => \"{$fontbutton}fontsizeselect,formatselect\", 147 'theme_advanced_buttons1_add' => \"|,undo,redo,|,search,replace,|,fullscreen\", Lines 148 and 149 define the second row of tools. In line 148, right after the word justifyright, if you add a comma and the word justifyfull, you will add the missing Justify toolbutton. (If you try this, don't foget to reload your browser to make it update and show the new tool button.) 148 'theme_advanced_buttons2' => \"bold,italic,underline,strikethrough,sub,sup,|,justifyleft,justifycenter,justifyright, justifyfull \", 149 'theme_advanced_buttons2_add' => \"|,cleanup,removeformat,pastetext,pasteword,|,forecolor,backcolor,|,ltr,rtl\", Lines 150 and 151 define the third row of tools. (I left them out.) To change the order of tools, just change the order of the tool names listed in those lines. Be careful as if you forget a comma or do the _add incorrectly, your tools may not show up. Of course it would be best if you made a backup copy of the file first...just in case. Visit http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/full.php and you can see other missing tools to try out. Hope this helps, AL",

My main problem is that when I enter text in it, using Firefox , it shows up left justified, as desired, and then when I see the page in IE , the text is shows centered or right justified. This problem does not happen with forum posts. I have to then set all the text to right justified and then back to left, and then usually it fixes that page. 2. The font face, size, and style are usually not correct for selected text. And if the values shown in the face, size, or styles boxes are what I WANT the selected text to be, I have to change it to something else and then change it right back. Then it will actually set the selected text accordingly. 3. PHP code manually entered is stripped. 4. If I manually tweak the HTML, the editor usually just messes with it. Drives me up the wall. 5. The editor loves to insert <p> tags for me. How lovely. That's when I actually start hitting my head against the wall. If I can at least get #1 fixed, I would be happy.

When users check spelling from inside the HTML Editor, with Aspell, the Aspell check box displays all the HTML tags which are normally hidden.

See function cleanAttributes2 in moodle/lib/weblib.php and moodle/lib/kses.php Perhaps if you add \"$user\" to the list of globals in cleanAttributes2() then Perhaps you can test for $user->id=1 or isadmin() or isteacher() or isteacherinanycourse() so as to allow some people to insert Javascript, but this will entail a security risk. I am inclinded to think that if anyone managed to get hold of the admin password then javascript is the least of my worries but I guess that security risks compound, so it is safer this way. The other way of inserting javascript is to simply put it directly into the database using PHPMyadmin, or DB Studio. Tim",

I post a simple html message into the central news forum on the front page and the overall page design is corrupted: The right hand column of the front page including editing button now drops down below the html block and lies next to the news forum ( see picture ). Even more strange, the design returns to normal when you log out .... becomes strange again when you log in. The offending post has a 2 column table. Removal of all text in the right hand columntable returns the site to normal (even if the table itself and other text remains). The effect seems dependent on the amount of text in the table rather than the precise text.",

Specificity, backup/restore and Moodle's image handling and storage security. There may be other reasons and/or what I am suggesting is not accurate, but it is a perception. Consider if you have 250 courses. This has to be a lot of images. You may have the same image name in three or four different courses, but they may not be the same image. Relative referencing will seek to use images in the cache first, which may not be the same image as the course you are using requires. The page resides in one folder and images are stored in a completely separate folder which may not have a close relationship with the actual course folder. With backup/restore, where does the image reside within the Moodle? In v1.9 it would reside in the moodledata folder under the name of the course and in the image's name. This was not very secure so in v2.x, it was that images would be stored in folders, under an alias. The alias name would be stored in a relevant field within the database . Backups would use the real name of the file, according to the database entry. On restoration, a new alias is assigned, (I think). Without the absolute path, this would be an impossible situation to manage. Security is enhanced and backups and restorations are more accurate. I hope this outlines some of the issues inherent in Tim's statement.",

          "Text": "HI, I don't know if this is related to the htmlarea issue or not....and you’ll have to forgive me, for I know just enough about html to be dangerous, vaguely aware of php, but can follow directions. I am trying to use simplified Chinese characters in a class, from summaries and topic outline boxes, to lesson modules/branch tables. I have been using html code created in various ways: Word saved as htm, frontpage, Dreamweaver. Have installed both (zh_tw) and (zh_cn) language packs, plus have fonts loaded on the machines we work on. The first time I paste the html in, it’s fine, but if I go to edit again, change anything, the fonts go kerploey and I am left with question marks. An html box I added will sometimes display Chinese characters and sometimes question marks, depending on turning editing on and off, refresh of browser, etc. I am using both IE and Firefox . I have tried using the html editor on the “jump” buttons in the branch tables…do one, and its shows, try to add more, or try and add more than one at a time, the buttons cease to function. I am trying to do this one course using nothing but Chinese characters, but that html code gets changed somewhere after the first save. What’s the next direction to go in to try and have Chinese instead of English? And yes, I will have the language in the class forced to (zh_cn).",

Giving it one more go, if you haven't, may work ... you could've made an inadvertent mistake that caused this. brokenfile.php occurs when you attempt to link to a non-existent URL. I was able to reproduce it by manually screwing up the URL when editing. It is unclear, aside from inadvertently and manually messing up the URL, what normal process would cause this.  I haven't looked at the code, but have looked a fair bit at moodle.org, to no avail. In my experience, one cause may be session/timeout issues which prevent proper saving. There'd be other symptoms, like the improper saving itself, or being logged out \"by Moodle.\"  It likely screws up the saving process, and the target URL is never created. Copying and pasting a URL to a file from within another resource/activity/block. This likely applies to the editor URLs, with draft in them, as opposed to the post-saved URLs.  Editor-based URLs are local to whatever module you're editing. My guess is the URL isn't much help, at least not w/o really understanding the code, and even then, it may just seem random to a user. Cheers",

The TinyMCE forums have good information on the files needed to modify TinyMCE so that I may replace the /p (paragraph) tag with the /br tag. My users are really not happy with the natural double spacing that comes from the use of the /p tag when editing, and while they are using the shift+enter option to force the /br tag, I find that to be a duct tape solution. The official Tiny MCE site has good detail on modifying options for forced root block: http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:forced_root_block I apologize if this is a simple question, or if there is a previous post addressing this issue.
