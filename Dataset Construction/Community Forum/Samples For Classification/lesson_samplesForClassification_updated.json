I'm trying to set up my course so that if a student gets a correct answer he/she can move forward, but if he/she gets an incorrect answer, he/she is forced to a slide with the necessary info then allowed to retake the question/quiz. Would be nice if the student could, upon failing a question/quiz, be directed to the pertinent info then return directly to where he/she left off (i.e. the same question/quiz). In other words, I'd like it if they didn't have to go back in the course and have to go though multiple slides to return to where they were at in a series of questions/quizzes... any help is appreciated! adam my attempt can be seen at: publicadjustertraining.com/onlineclasses/ thx",

Wrong answers in a single question jump to the same Branch page with more info, which takes the student back to the question they missed. Once the student selects the correct answer, they move to the next question. What is there in the lesson could be your entire lesson or your first lesson segment. If it is a segment, you will put in a branch table at the end of the current logical order and your last question correct answer will jump here. Make it the intro to the next lesson segment, choice to continue, go to the end of lesson, go to the branch table (you don't have yet) that serves as the table of content for the lesson at the start. I also like a branch table at my end of lesson, titled End of This Lesson which has words about what they just learned and their next step. The choice takes them back to the TOC or the real end of lesson screen via the standard choice of that name.",

The original Lesson counted answers as right or wrong based on the jump.  So forward progression in the Lesson was a correct answer and staying on the current page or moving backward in the Lesson was an incorrect answer.  So, this was an \"all or nothing\" system.  When custom scoring was introduced, the all or nothing method was still being used to allow for fewer discrepancies between the two scoring systems. Another reason is that you would have to assign a score for every correct match and every incorrect match.  This might become more complicated than what most users want.",

Joseph said \"I'm afraid you want to stretch the Moodle Lesson activity to more than it can do.\" So, instead, I have sliced the image up and inserted it into a table. Now each slice can activate its own actions, such as an image swap on mouseover. Next step, I think, is to add a \"clickon\" option using the insert/edit link to generate a \"pop-up\" for each table segment, opening it as a \"New Window.\" I can make a link, say to google.com , that opens in a separate window (using popup and events), but I don't quite know how I would link this to a small text window that contained its own \"clickon\" link and I am not sure how I could control the location of the window relative to the initiating \"clickon\" from the insert/edit link.

It worked wonderfully BUT when I created a new question or a new lesson this option just does not appear. I try both with netscape and firefox . None of them allow now what was possible earlier. Does anyone has an idea of what can I do to be able to activate again the editor in answer & questions. Many thanks",

For each page in the lesson, I have navigation set up for \"Back to beginning\", \"Previous Page\", and \"Next Page\". By default, they are located at the bottom of the content. I have found that some students are having a hard time finding these because of the way we have things set up in our lessons. I would not only like to be able to move them (possibly by editing Lesson/view.php ?), but I would like to have them at both the top and bottom of the page so there is no confusion. I have found nothing in the Moodle forums or on Google. Perhaps I am doing the wrong queries. Regardless, I appreciate any help you may have to offer. I'm sure I could figure out placement of the \"branchbuttoncontainer\" class but I'd really like to change how the html element itself is rendered with php. I would like to duplicate it at the top of the page. Hope that is a reasonable question and thanks.",

The first thing to do when you get a blank page in Moodle is to go Administration / ► Server ► Debugging and to switch Debug messages to ALL: Show all reasonable PHP debug messages. Then go to your lesson again and preview it and note the error messages that you can see. Probably something went wrong when you installed your Moodle site. Joseph",

A correct answer takes the student to the next content page. If a student has seen all of the available questions, the lesson closes when the content page attempts to take them to an unseen question.

          "Text": "Kimber, I am having the exact same problem. I made a test Lesson with a cluster to figure it out. What I've learned is that it seems to behave properly when you're previewing it as a teacher (because it replaces the \"Jump to Unseen Question in Cluster\" jump with \"Next Page\" jumps). However, when you switch your role to student, and have seen all of the questions*, it dumps me to an error without showing me the last content page of the Lesson (\"Could not find lesson pages\"). If I click on Continue at this point, it dumps me to the Site Home, and the course I was just working in no longer shows up in the \"All Courses\" list. That bit is especially weird. The structure of my Lesson is: 1st content page (CP1): Jumps to \"Next Page\" which is the beginning of the Cluster Cluster: Jumps to \"Unseen quustion within a cluster\" Question Page 1 (QP1): Right answer jump: \"Unseen question within a cluster\", wrong answer jump: \"1st content page\" Question Page 2: (QP2): Right answer jump: \"Unseen question within a cluster\", wrong answer jump: \"1st content page\" End of cluster: Jumps to \"Next page\" Last content page (Jump to \"End of Lesson\") * As an example, if I deliberately answer the first QP (let's say QP1) it gives me wrong, go back to CP1 and click continue, then answer QP2 wrong, back to CP1  and click continue, it errors out (\"Could not find lesson pages.\") I can get that to happen every time. The same thing happens if I click the correct response on one of the questions, which takes me to the next question, then click the wrong answer, get taken back to CP1, then click \"Continue.\" And, oddly enough, if I get both questions correct, it completely skips the last Content Page and takes me directly to the End of Lesson page. As a side note, I'm not clear on how the Cluster \"Unseen Question\" jump is supposed to work. Does it mean actually \"seeing it\" and not \"seeing it and getting the question right\"? How do I make sure that the student has to get the questions right before moving on in a Cluster situation?",

Really, I just found a teacher who, in an effort to force Moodle to do what he wanted, had placed a content page, then a question page, then REPEATED the content page, then another question page. The first QP, if answered correctly, jumped to QP2, and if they got that one WRONG, it jumped to the repeat of the content page, so when the student pressed \"Next,\" they didn't have to answer QP1 again, just go directly into QP2. This seemed just a bit inefficient, and I thought Clusters would help me out here. Note 2: Those same people suggested that, to test out clusters, you use an actual student account instead of just changing your role to a student. I did this, and got the exact same same results as above.",

Mind you, there's usually a way of doing/solving everything in Moodle, with a bit of creativity, even if it's not the ideal method! The only import option is powerpoint (and if you are using Moodle version 1.9 or below this basically doesn't work anyway). Firstly copying straight from Word is not great as Word adds tons of extraneous code. There is a Word code stripper in the Moodle editor but this is not infallible, so it's better to copy the Word file, then past into word pad or note pad, convert to plain text and copy that before pasting into a lesson. This is likely to lose you your graphics. A quick and dirty solution is to save each pdf page (and convert your word files to pdfs too for this same purpose) as an image file and then just have that image file only within a lesson page. I've already posted some info about this in a previous thread (you'll need to read both my posts in here as I've also suggested a way to speed this process up). If you save pdfs as images and import them, you will retain the crucial formatting and image positioning. Another alternative is don't have lessons, convert the pdfs (and also save the word docs as pdfs first too) and save/share these as movie files and get the students to work through them screen by screen. Sorry it's not great; this is a common ask in here. BTW I hope you mean '= 1 lesson page' not '1 lesson' otherwise you must have humungous Word files. Lynn Scarlet",

You can also, obviously split the PDF more granularly (if that's a word?) than chapter, and some of the utilities probably have a feature to automatically split all the pages. This might be preferable to exporting as an image; the quality of the resulting small PDFs is usually higher than the same PDF exported as an image. Your PDF can be referenced by the lesson in the \"pop-to file or web page\" option, or as a URL - you obviously need to host the PDF on your moodle site. While it's true that Word adds too much cr*p formatting to be \"copied and pasted\" into Moodle directly, there is a way to create cleaner HTML out of Word and then bring the result in without the extraneous junk: Start by using Word's \"Save As Filtered HTML\" option. This had different names in different versions of Word, but basically gets rid of a lot of the Word-specific junk. Now it's actually pretty good. But you can run a utility on this to make it better. Dreamweaver has a great \"Clean up Word formatting\" option, if you have that, or google \"clean word html\" and you'll see a bunch of free tools on line. But the \"granddaddy\" of these tools is HTMLTidy. Here's a nice little blog post on using HTMLTidy options to deal with Word HTML. http://www.rogerobeid.com/2011/02/24/clean-up-microsoft-word-html/ At this point you have a really good html document as your source. If you copy and paste it You still may have to chop it up into \"chapters\", if I understand you correctly, but you could then: use the \"popup to file or web page\" for the lesson to reference that \"chapter\" (IOW host the HTML you created; see next point). add the file as a URL resource if you host what you have created (NB: do *not* forget the folder of images that is created in tandem with the HTML file) copy and paste into the Moodle editor after opening the cleaned HTML in Word or browser -- I'm pretty sure you'll have to re-insert/ upload the images, however You can also export (Save As) Word documents as PDFs, and then chunk them up and use directly as embedded resources. I would recommend this, because it will give you one process to follow for all these documents if you handle them *all* as PDFs, whatever you decide that process should be. Assuming it works for you (Moodle 2), the Import Powerpoint option in Lesson might be a great option for you. While Word doesn't have a direct \"Save As PPT/PPTX\" option, if your documents use standard header/outlining styles, Powerpoint can import the outlines. Copy and paste into Powerpoint from Word for the rest of the content after the outline is prepared is tedious but will preserve all your formatting and your \"pagination\" scheme. I personally don't have any experience with Lesson's Import Powerpoint feature, though. HTH , >L<",

I believe the end of lesson page is generated by the ../mod/lesson/view.php file.  I have time but no skill.   On lines 621, 643, 653 and 659 of my Moodle 2.9.2 view.php file I found  those buttons. For example on 659: $lessoncontent .= html_writer::link($url, get_string('viewgrades', 'lesson'), array('class' => 'centerpadded lessonbutton standardbutton')); Just guessing, but the last lines of the file seem to be the commands to output the header, content and footer.  A developer will have to tell you how to edit the code for your site. See this thread in the General Help Forum for the language strings that appear on the EOL page .  There was also some comments about css classes.  We were thinking of editing a theme's css to make some things disappear. Modifying the strings seemed easier. Hope this gives you and others some ideas.  Certainly would like to see the php code to add a line say between the content and the footer. Chris",

          "Text": "Hi I'm a MoodleCloud user. I have a lesson activity that is set up with sections of information and 2 - 4 questions that follow each of them.  If students get a question wrong they are sent back to the information page for that section to review and try again. They have to get 100% of the questions right to complete the lesson. They also have to be able to do the lesson more than once.  This is needed because the lesson content is linked to practical skills and if they make a mistake in the workplace they need to do the lesson again. I'm having issues with the grades report.  It shows me the first time they got 100% only.  I think it's because they've met the requirements. My work-around has been going to the 'reports' tab in the lesson and manually reviewing each student.  It sounds horrible but the second (or third) 100% usually stands out quite well. However - this now isn't working consistently.  I've had students email me screenshots that show they have submitted the completed lesson (the 2nd attempt) and in the report it shows up but there is no grade there.  When I look at the lesson tasks their answers to the questions, etc aren't showing either.  Yet I have the screenshot showing they completed it. Other times it shows everything correctly and I can see the attempt and how they did. Any ideas on why it sometimes isn't working? Thanks for your help Michelle",

In order to collect meaningful data the students knowledge of the topic is tested in a pre-quiz (no answers or feedback given) then they undertake a series of activities (readings and watching presentations) before they are tested again with the same questions to see if their score improves. The teacher would really like students who receive a pass mark >70% to go to a feedback page with feedback for all the questions but students who don't receive this mark to have a chance to try the questions again then procede to the feedback page if they reach the pass mark. If they are not successful a second time she would like them locked out for 24 hours before they try the lesson again. I am struggling to work out if this is possible given that there are two sets of questions in the lesson. I do want to use the lesson format, the material lends itself to this format well.

When I am not using Display Left Menu, all text is as default left-aligned in both browsers. I have (in Firefox) left-aligned text manually, but that doesn't show in IE. However, it does show if I make a manual left-alignement in IE as well (puh...). I have also changed the font-size and line shift-size for the Left Menu which looks nice in Firefox, but that doesn't show up in IE... So, I have two questions: How do I make a general left align of text when I have the Display Left Menu? How do I make the font-sise and line shift-size the same in both browsers? Erich N",

Next, add the contents class to mod/lesson/view.php. Find this chunk of code (around line #564): \n```text\n            if ($lesson->slideshow) {\n\n\n                echo format_text($page->contents);\n\n\n            } else {\n\n\n                print_simple_box(format_text($page->contents), 'center');\n\n\n            }\n```\n Change it to this: \n```text\n            if ($lesson->slideshow) {\n\n\n                echo '<div class=\"contents\">'.format_text($page->contents).'</div>';\n\n\n            } else {\n\n\n                print_simple_box('<div class=\"contents\">'.format_text($page->contents).'</div>', 'center');\n\n\n            }\n```\n If it fixes your problem, I'll add it to 1.5 cvs .

But i can't see the colour that i have set up as a background (FF9900) when i am viewing the questions - do i need to be logged in as a student to do this? Also how come there isn't a list of the colour codes in the edit lesson function - there's a nice help box, but i had to get a code from the edit question function? thanks for any help, Rebecca",

The question still works but after saving the page things go wrong. It seems that lesson module (the page edit form, only?) relies on the database ids of the answers in arranging things. The first two (with smallest ids) answers in 'mdl_lesson_answer' are the correct response and the wrong response ( btw , peculiar choice of words), the rest of the answers are the real answers pairs. The update process (from 1.4.3 to 1.5+) does not add the 'response' answers to the database and the editor form can't cope with the situation. I really do not know what to do to fix things in the database. Fortunately, there are relatively few pages with matching question in our Moodle.",

If you want to continue to use fractions though, you can switch to Short answer and it will handle the fractions with no problem. Let me know if this works out for you, Mark",

I'm sure you don't expect the volunteer community here to rush around responding to you in such a short timeframe. If you need that level of support, you could consider paying a support specialist. Anyway, you said you are working on 1 and 2.  So, point 3 \" I want that when question comes progress bar will not be increase. I mean progress bar depend upon only on content page not in question page.\" Why ?  If you had 5 content pages, and 5 question pages for example, then the progress through the Lesson would be 10 steps. Why would you want to hide this ? Or, if your 10 step Lesson had one content page, then 8 questions pages, then a final content page, under your idea the progress would be showing as 10% complete until the last page !  I am struggling to understand how this would have any educational benefit to the users ?",

They all have lots of text and images, many of which use image maps for clickable hotspots to navigate between pages. Lessons work well to show the content and I can add image maps by hand to link to pages within the lesson but its quite a manual process to code even use an image editor to draw the hotspot areas. Interestingly the hotspots show as outlines on the image in the editor once added in html view almost as if it were possible to add them in visually. Has anyone found an easy workflow to add images with hotspots to pages that link to other pages within a lesson? Any comments and suggestions welcomed! Roger",

          "Text": "Hi, Excellent question. In the past and in the current version, I will say \" no\". Moodle Lesson 1.8 module does not have the Quiz setting \"Shuffle within questions\". Thank you for the post, I changed MoodleDocs to answer this relatively common request. Hopefully, we will change it with 1.9. However, a developer will have to tell us if this feature is going to be available in the future. Currently the \"new\" Question Bank has a shuffle option property associated with individual questions (one multiple choice question's answers can be shuffled, while another multiple choice question's answers are randomized). In 1.8, only the Quiz module uses the Question Bank, but the plan is for any Moodle Module to be able to access this bank. Lesson in 1.8 does not use the Question Bank, and can only import questions that have been exported by Question Bank . The questions I have are: when will the Lesson module use the Question Bank will Lesson have an overall shuffle answer setting (like 1.8 Quiz) and if so, which shuffle setting will rule: the individual question shuffle setting or the overall Lesson setting? Your lesson author will have to wait. Hope this helps Chris",

If you want your students to answer such questions about a lesson as \"Did you find this lesson a) boring; b) OK; c) very interesting, etc.\" then you could use either the Feedback or the Questionnaire plugin (as a separate activity, to be answered after completing the lesson). Be aware, however, that these are 3rd-party plugins that do not come with standard distributions of Moodle and you'll have to install them on top of your regular installation.

Set it up so students can pause the movies, log off and come back to the same place in the movie where they left off? 3. Force them to watch all movies in order to complete the course (plus quizes). 4. Show report of all watched movies and quizzes scores on one page?

At the moment, I've come up with two options: Option #1 - At the end of the video, have it display (in the video) a number, word , etc.The lesson page that the video is placed in is then set to a question and the student MUST enter the correct answer to proceed (otherwise back to page). This won't prevent a clever student from racing to the end, but is a decent work around. Option #2 - use an external javascript or flashvars to \"hide\" the continue buttons until the video is done. Something like: http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/forum/Setup-Problems/12732/At-end-of-flash-video-show-static-picture I prefer option #2, but need to look at coding. ken",

I have confirmed that the code modification will work in Moodle 3.2. if (!$course->showgrades) { redirect(new moodle_url('/course/view.php', array('id'=>$course->id))); } I find that turning of the 'end of lesson page' is a convenient feature and improves Moodle's UI, giving students less clicks, and not providing unnecessary ones.

This is a site admin block>Front page> Front Page setting, at the bottom which says default role, set it for guest. Site Admin block>Security>site policies should also be set so a login is not required. Remember that the Front Page can be treated as a special course. If your site admin says no to that, then put some kind of encouraging welcome on the login splash screen in the right box to encourage guests. Do the same on any page that say \"to link to our Moodle for a gander, click here\". I would be thinking very hard about the long term implications of placing \"course\" resources and activities on the front page. For somethings, a Guest course(s) that links from the Front Page, might give more control and flexibility in the long run.",

The first two (with smallest ids) answers in 'mdl_lesson_answer'\nare the correct response and the wrong response ( btw , peculiar choice\nof words), the rest of the answers are the real answers pairs. This makes it very hard to correct things. All of the answers need to be re-written to the database with new ids.

You could use Question Bank and the Quiz Activity to almost get to where you want. For example, a question stored in the core that is changed, changes all the other uses of it. We don't put in flash, but I think Question Bank can handle that kind of thing. Just another idea. Well it is time to put on my work clothes and change my physical location. Ah, I see John has paid attention to this thread, excellent. Best to you both, Chris",

          "Text": "Hi Jon, You ask a very important question, and what you are trying to do makes a lot of sense. However I would use the term \"learning object\" with caution. In particular, I would not equate \"learning object\" to \"Moodle activity or resource.\" A learning object is something more fine-grained than a Moodle activity. It is a small, self-contained chunk, typically 2 to 15 minutes in length, that can be reused in multiple contexts for multiple purposes. The learning objects vision is to have a repository of learning objects tagged with metadata that can be searched by course developers, who can build things like lessons by aggregating learning objects \"on-the-fly.\" In the LMS world, I think the learning objects vision is most closely approximated by SCORM (I'm sure there will be other opinions on this!). Each learning object corresponds to a SCO, SCO's can be aggregated into a SCORM package, and the SCO's can be organized in different ways to produce complete courses or course units (SCORM 1.4 permits very flexible organization). Moodle activities , on the other hand, have an inherently monolithic design. They are self-contained and cannot share content. I do not believe you can use them for what you are trying to do, at least not in a \"natural\" way.",

In fact, a student can do all the lesson of my course in rapidly succession, but we now that in teaching it's not useful to learn a huge amount of information in a small time.

But I'm unable to find any capability that allows me to restrict the ability of guests to do the Lesson activity in courses. It seems that as long as they have the moodle/course:view permission set to allow (which needs to be set so that guests can view the courses), they are able to do the Lesson activity.

Enough complaining -- Moodle is still great. It is possible to use the Quiz Module to build something very much like lessons, as long as you don't need the 'branching' functions of the Lesson Mod.  The \"Branch Table\" page can be replaced by the \"Description\" in a Quiz.  However, this does NOT work for me because of differences in navigation, and scores being displayed, and several things that I just can't work around.  But you can look at that option... As far as copying Lesson content, you can make duplicates of a Lesson pretty easily.  If you want to copy Lesson-A and change it slightly to become Lesson-B, it goes as follows: 'Backup' Lesson-A Rename Lesson-A to Lesson-B, and change it as necessary 'Restore' Lesson-A from the backup file Hope this helps.  (And I hope sometime Lesson pages can be shared like Quiz questions...)

In my special case, users should just summerize some very few contents of the lesson before and the main purpose of this shortanswer is to push them to do it. So if there is just one correct keyword of a possible number of 5 to 10, it's still enough and the feedback will be a correct compendium anyway. Of course, the correct question-type for this would be essay, but there is no possibility for an automatical feedback. The still remaining problem is, how to give a feedback, if a user submits a blank answer to the shortquestion. Now moodle just steps forward to a page with only a forward-button and then to the next page in the lesson. Defining * with a matching feedback does just the same, without the intermediate page only. So, if you know the solution to my originally textarea-question, I would be very thankful. And for any suggestion to that blank-answer problem, too.",

In Moodle 1.9.x or the new Moodle 2.0, is there a way to easily implement \"online comic books\", which is similar to something like this: http://www.imanhua.com/comic/12/list_51447.html?p=3 So basically we would like to upload a lot of JPEG or GIF images, and \"link\" them together with a simple UI like \"Previous\" \"Next\" buttons, and maybe a pull-down menu so that users could quickly jump to a particular page.  We don't want students to \" download \" something (e.g. PowerPoint .pps) first and then open it up. We want them to be able to directly open it up and read it (comics with JPEG images) \"inside\" of Moodle with some simple navigation. I have read about the \"Lesson module\" documentation ( http://docs.moodle.org/en/Lesson ) but it doesn't seem to really fit with our needs. I haven't tried the \"Workshop module\" yet..

We previously used the Assignment module to do this, but found it a bit laborious for students to complete, and some failed to do so, so we integrated the questions into the lessons themselves. The only issue here now is that the Trainers who need to grade the essay questions no longer receive email notifications when these essay responses are submitted - is there a way to do this in the current Moodle? Our organisation is quite spread out across Australia, and Trainers are dealing with large volumes of students, so this would be really beneficial if we could do this.

I have found that I want all of my Lessons in a single course (or all of my courses, actually) to behave in the same fashion, and that it's a bit annoying to have to make sure that each Lesson has the same checks and YESs and Nos. I would rather go to one place that governs how all of the Lessons in that course operate. If you want to change one particular Lesson, then the settings in that individual Lesson could take precedence over the course level settings. 2.) Related to that, it seems like it would not be hard to create defaults for the Navigation. I've found that 95% of the time I want simple \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons for my Lesson pages (with just the \"Next\" on the first page). It seems like it would be nice to have a set of options in the Lesson settings for the text and relative pointers for those navigation buttons (So you could make yours all say \"Retreat!\" and \"Onward!\" if you want.) Then, when you're adding each page in turn, it would give you the same options as it does now, just with a checkbox that says \"Use defaults\" that you would uncheck before adding your own boxes, or adding other branches or whatever. Or it automatically knows that when you put text in those boxes, the defaults are not used... Anyway, just my two cents. If there's another place for feature requests, I'll put this there, instead.",

You can dump this code into a blank page, then the swf will be the only thing on that page. (For instance, in theory your lesson could be one page in length with just this swf on it - although I'd recommened doing something else in that case, like just putting the swf into a single web page instead, but you get the idea). Equally, you can put it into a page with other things already in it - there could be an intro paragraph that you want peope to read before they view the swf. In this case, put in all your other inclusions (text, images, whatever) then switch to HTML view and paste in the code (with your file name changes) into wherever you need it within the page. The iFrame and the swf object itself will not conflict with any other text, images or other object (eg a youTube clip) so it will fit in easily. I'm not on my own computer so I can't do a screen grab for you at the moment to show what the outcome is. If you still can't get this working, post back and I'll help further. Hope this helps?",

          "Text": "Hi Jackie, I am sort of the resident New User. I am just getting back into gear after a wonderful vacation (all too short) in Firenze. The gateway detail was interesting. I also would first point my finger at the clusters and then double check my update lesson settings. There could be a bug in the 1.7 lesson code you are using but I would not take any bets on that. You said it usually did not reach the first question. The first question is a numeric question that is placed before the cluster start in the \"logical order\" (teacher edit view mode order). This would indicate lesson setting flow control issue, not a cluster issue. But something might have gotten lost in the transcription to this forum, so here is more info. I would get my hands dirty and delete every cluster and end of cluster page in the lesson. Does it still jump around when you use a student login? Works fine, then See MoodleDocs on clusters . If it still acts weird then you probably have a lesson setting (check flow control area again) problem. See MoodleDocs on Flow Control and Lesson settings . My golden rule, \"crawl, walk, run\". Create a straight line mini lesson. KISS. Don't invest a lot of energy in it. 10 pages, start with a couple of branch pages, don't put in any jumps or descriptions. Put in MC or T/F questions , with \"right\", \"wrong\", \"real wrong\", \"wild\". Don't bother with custom scoring. Wrong answers stay on this page, the correct answer is always the first one and it goes to next page. End with a couple of branch pages. You should advance right through the lesson. Then do a backup of the lesson. Next throw in a start cluster and end cluster. If that does not work, email me (see my profile) a copy of a backup of your lesson, without students. I will throw it into one of my localhosts and give it a look. You don't appear to be doing anything complicated. It has to be something simple like you suspect. Best Chris",

Correct answers went to next page, wrong answers were set to this page. I used the Moodle defaults for the lesson settings, but allowed my student to take the lesson many times. I logged in as My student and went through the lesson without any problems. I logged in as Teacher and added a cluster after the MC Question1 page and an end cluster after MC Question4. I went back into the cluster and changed its jump to MC Question2. When I logged in as student the lesson acted just like it did before. I logged back in as teacher in Lesson settings changed Action after correct answer to show unseen question. This gave one of the results you described. I always seemed to hit the first branch page and then everything appeared in random answer. This is known in MoodleSpeak as a lesson flash card presentation (not to be confused by the flash card module). Not absolutely positive but I would look at your lesson settings. The Action after a correct answer will over ride any jumps you have assigned. I will give you another responce to talk about another issue you are having. Hope this helps. Chris",

Your question poses 2 problems to me: one technical (easily resolved) and one pedagogical. 1.- In the current Lesson questions editing interface - for the case at hand - there is indeed no way to enter a specific feedback message for a wrong choice, since there are no wrong choices! One workaround, however, is to set your whole Lesson to use \"Default feedback\": Flow control -> Display default feedback YES . Here is the online Help for that Display default feedback setting: If set to Yes , then when a response is not found for a particular question, the default response of \"That's the correct answer\" and \"That's the wrong answer\" will be used. If set to No , then when a response is not found for a particular question, then no feedback is displayed. The user taking the Lesson will automatically be directed to the next Lesson page. 2. On the pedagogical level or, more specifically on the linguistic level, the wording of your question \"Which of the following are body parts?\" presupposes that not all proposed choices are correct, only some of them . From a pedagogical perspective, I would say that asking such a question and expecting all of the choices to be selected is like \"playing a trick\" on the students. Hope that helps, Joseph",

          "Text": "Content Management in e-Learning vs. Learning Design in e -Learning e-Learning has a well developed approach to the creation and sequencing of content-based, single learner, self-paced learning objects. However, there is little understanding of how to create sequences of learning activities wh ich involve groups of learners interacting within a structured set of collaborative environments, or how teachers can make these sequences easily re-usable (making national fund of re-usable learning sequences). Given that a key dimension of Bulgarian higher education is learning which arises from interacting with teachers and peers (rather than simply interacting with content), the lack of a mature approach to sequencing of multi-learner activities is a significant blind spot in e-Learning today. This is surprising given that \"lesson planning\" – the process of determining the sequence of activities to be followed by a lecturer and learners when studying a topic – is well understood in education, but is mainly absent from e -Learning. However, there is a growing body of work addressing this topic, based on the concept of \"Learning Design\". Learning Design provides a first glimpse at the ways of describing multilearner activity sequences and the tools required to support these. Learning Design has the potentia l to revolutionize e-Learning by capturing the \"process\" of education, rather than simply content management as it in Moodle. By describing sequences of collaborative learning processes in Bulgarian universities, Learning Design offers new pedagogical approaches to re -use in e-Learning. This article describes our joint Learning Design approach, a detailed example, and its implementation.",

I'd like them to go through the whole set of pages even if someof their answers are wrong.

          "Text": "Hi Sue In the absence of a reply from any of the real experts here, I think I can safely say that unfortuntaely you can't. The questions in a Lesson cant be imported from any Question Bank questions you might have created (wish they could!!), they have to be created afresh for each Lesson. The only possible workaround is to \"duplicate\" the existing Lesson and use the duplicate as the basis for the new lesson in which you want the questions. But that will only work if youre drawing the questions from a single Lesson, since you cannot merge Lessons either. To \"duplicate\" say, Lesson X in Course Y, you need to have another (real or dummy course), Z, into which you import Lesson X, and then re-import the Lesson back to Course Y. The other (not really an) alternative is to use the Quiz module to deliver the questions, in which case you have the freedom to use the Question Bank. But of course that means students are chopping and changing from Lesson to Quiz. (Off topic: Clumsy, ay? It always stuns me that what seems to be the most used Module in the world's leading Course MS is so woefully inadequate!) Good luck! Geoff",

          "Text": "Geoff is right, there is no possibility to export question pages from the Lesson activity. It is however possible to import questions from the Quiz questions bank into a Lesson. I expect the lack of that export/import feature can be explained by the very nature of Moodle's Lesson activity, which is fundamentally different from the Quiz activity. In a Moodle Lesson, the flow of Question pages is controlled by the student's answers or choices. This means that in \"normal\" use (if there is such a thing as \"normal\" in this context ), each question derives part of its meaning from its immediate context: the question(s) preceding and the question(s) following it. When you keep this in mind, it would (\"usually\") not make much sense to draw questions from a bank, in order to import them into a Lesson activity. It would be interesting to hear from the original poster why precisely she needs to \"move\" questions from one Lesson to another. And to specify how she would \"link\" those questions one with the other in the new Lesson. Joseph",

With this in mind, lesson flow logic can make appropiate decisions to take student to one page or another, and those decisions are independent of question contents. I mean question logic can be (ant ought to be) separated from lesson flow logic. In this way teachers should be able to move questions around, and have a question bank, to reuse questions between various activities , not just quizzes. In fact I vaguely remember reading some time ago that for Moodle 2.0 rewritting question code completely was planned to separate its code from quizzes, rendering code more \"orthogonal\", to allow question usage in various parts of Moodle, a feature I think is still not possible.

However, I tend to disagree with Orestes that \" question logic can be (ant ought to be) separated from lesson flow logic \". In my pedagogy, a Lesson (and a Quiz) need to be constructed with relevant questions which follow one upon another, and certainly not questions chosen \"at random\". That's why I have no use for the \"random questions\" feature of the Quiz activity, for example. Of course I'll have to admit that there are other views in this matter. @Orestes: The feature you are alluding to has cropped up from time to time over the years in these forums but nothing has come out of it.  For quite a few years, unfortunately, the Lesson module no longer has an active maintainer, unlike the Quiz module, where Tim Hunt is very active. The Lesson module is almost an \"orphan\" in the Moodle development strategy - at the moment. Joseph",

So, we have to adapt the lesson to the new \"class\". lesson's should have a menu similar to the quiz, because we can mix the parts in another adapted way. Weel, I do it in two ways ( not completely satisfactory). I use MOODLE 1.9. Perhaps someone could share another ways to do it. 1. In one lesson, I create one deadzone with the group/endgroup option, where I keep all the parts that I don't want to use in that particular lesson. Whenever you make the backup, you can remix the parts. 2. If we use shorten lesson's, we can mix it by showing or hiding in the lesson, but this need a well defined context/documented for the lesson's; if not you just don't know why and for what type of students you use it.

Was access to the Bank a feature introduced in 2.0?

This is something Im always doing in new iterations of my course. Another BTW: Im very impressed by the prodigious and highly informed advice you give give in this forum.

In terms of changing the text to say: Not available unless \"Lesson 1” is marked\ncomplete you want to look at the Language customization tool located at: Site Administration -> Language ->Language Customization. The string you want to edit is located in the \"availability_completion\" file and the string you most likely want to edit is called \"requires_complete\"",

My problem is I can't find where to do this, I've found the display_page function and have seen from here tht the page is being written out from the display fucntion, when chekcing this fucntion I have hit a dead end finding where to look now. There are several \"display\" functions inside mod lesson. Specifically one on branch table and one for each page type, be it multichoice essay short answer or so on, yet none of these functions seem to help me get any deeper and find the html readout code that I'm looking for. Does anyone know where the html readout code is for this so that I can inject the previous attempts into the page?",

Here is what I would like to do: Allow students to explore a lesson following their interest, rather than a linear path, and still make sure they have seen every page of a lecture segment in the end. So I start with a multiple choice question page and jump to a corresponding page with each answer. From there I would like to use jumps to \"unseen questions in branch\" or \"unseen questions in cluster\" in order to insure they get to the other pages in the cluster/branch as well before moving on. Try as I may, I cannot get this to work! Attempt 1: Q1-Cluster-C1-C2-C3-End of Cluster-C4-C5... In Q1 the student chooses 1 of 3 options and jumps to C1,2 or 3 accordingly. In C1-3 the jump leads to cluster and from there to \"unseen question in cluster\". The end cluster page then jumps on to C4. Attempt 2: Q1-C1-C2-C3-End of Branch-C4-C5... C1-3 here jump to \"unseen question in branch\" and End of branch to C4. Neither works, one delivers me to the end of lecture upon my second click, the other jumps to C4 on my second click. I logged in as a course participant in order to check this. Another problem is that Moodle logs each trial and eventually my \"student\" has seen C1-C3 at the outset of starting the lecture. I tried to erase that by resetting the course (it is just a practice course to figure this out), but I cannot get this to work! Does anybody know where my mistake is here? Thanks, Rainer",

I used Moodle 2.0 and fcreated 2 questions in a quiz, a matching and a multiple choice.  I used question bank to export them as a Moodle XLM file.  I copied that file and added the code you gave to it at the end.   When I created a Lesson and imported questions, I got the same result with both files. The matching questions showed \"This page\" which is the usual default when Lesson can not find a jump. Interestingly, the multiple choice did not have any answers, nor any jumps.   I think that is a bug in 2.0. I do not think you other question types  to the next page in a lesson, only if you set it to 1 attempt.  Could be wrong. Chris",

It is perfectly normal for a lesson to have \"optional\" pages which can never be visited by the students. The important thing for a student to get a grade upon completing a lesson is that at least one page they visited has a graded question page on it . If your lessson consists only or mostly of branch pages, i.e. pages with no real question on it (multiple choice, etc.), then, even if the student \"completes\" the lesson, i.e. reaches the end of it, it will not be graded. Please tell us if that is the case with your lesson (and I'll suggest a workaround). I think this matter has already been mentioned on this Lesson forum. Joseph",

In between the content, I embed images (pictures, graphs, diagrams: *.jpg, *.png, *.gif etc) via the TinyMCE Html Editor that comes with Moodle 3.0. I want to make a background style in order to have the Image and the Textual caption (for example: Fig.1.3: here you see a ...) belong together as a distinguishable unit. So I misuse the CSS -format 'Preformatted' which comes with TinyMCE, in order to form a container in which I put the picture as well as the accompanying text. This works, but not all the time: sometimes images 'jump out' of the container, or the webpage looses the image all together (on /course/index.php?categoryid=...). How do I make a stable CSS-style and where do I publish it in my course-site for easy online editorial access? I need a stable CSS-box consisting of a border line, a different coloured background, and an adjustable font. Friendly regards, Rges Cper Moodle 3.0",

I 'baked' the following HTML-CSS code for my site, in order to try to achieve what I want: ---------- <div class=\"container-fluid\"> <ul class=\"thumbnails text-center\"> <li class=\"img-rounded\" style=\"background-color: #d5d5d5;\"><br /> <div class=\"thumbnail\"> <img src=\"http://.../draftfile.php/myImage.png\" alt=\"The Subjective Experience of Reality\" role=\"presentation\" class=\"img-responsive, img-rounded\" width=\"99%\" /> <p>Thumbnail caption...</p> </div> </li> </ul> </div> ---------- This code works fine, but has a few flaws: 1. The container is indented from the left side. I prefer the image-box to be aligned to the left, as is all the text of my lesson-content. Is there an image-class similar to thumbnails-class without indentation? If so, then I will remove the attribute 'text-center', so the caption will also become left-aligned. 2. I use a <br /> to create spacial room above the image. Is there another way to do this? 3. I put the width of the image to 99%, because the picture became too much blown-up, causing a scroll bar in a web browser (on PC). How can I avoid this properly? 4. I do not know the attribute 'role is presentation'. What is the use of  the property 'Role'? 5. I use the standard Moodle-themes (skins): More and Clean. Are the CSS-styling rules of these themes based on Bootstrap, and can I rely on this foundation (mutual cooperation) to evolve with Moodle in the future? Friendly regards, Rges Cper Moodle 3.0",

Use the Quiz settings so that 1 question appears on a page at a time and that it is pulling random questions from a question category. This is what I am seeing on your link that uses html pages. The Lesson module is always set up so that there is one button to submit the answer on a single page. Based upon the answer the student selected and the jump the teacher set, the student will go to the page the teacher wants. For example, in a question about color hue, all the wrong answers might gets a different response, then go to a branch table page that gives more information about color hue. On this page, one of the buttons at the bottom might send the student back for another unseen question in a cluster, and another to the end of lesson where the student sees their grade.",

When viewing as a student the answers come up in random orders but obviously I'm keen for them to remain in the order outlined above. I have gone into the quiz settings in course administration but this obviously doesn't have an impact on a LESSON plug in. Any ideas or suggestions please? Thanks.",

My purpose is that my students get 0 for not taking Lessons and 1 if the lesson is completed. I would like to make all this with my flash movies (evaluation with flash movies in quizzes is working with JSON .as and FlashQuestion.as files). I.e. I make a lesson with 10 flash movies inside. For each movie, student gets 1 point, if it answers inside of input text fields, which are built in flash movie. Exercises are made in a way that lesson is a way of learning so student can repeat them as long as he wants. Inside of flash movie is \"check\" button, which purpose is that student can check his answers if they are true of false. They click on \"next\" button when all of their input fields are \"true\" and moodle should check for true/false answers and submit the value of 1 if they are really true. How should I convince moodle that he should check for true/false answers in lesson and inside of flash movies. Feedback is that students actually do some of their assingments during the school year and not only on the end of the course. Any suggestions?",

Suggestions appreciated! -- Art Art: As promised, a summary of the MOODLE session with my CP kids today. I had the students working through the 2 tutorials on nomenclature in my Help Lessons course.  I had only checked navigation on the WRITING FORMULAS FROM NAMES lesson, and I had to make some changes before the kids went into the attack.  I didn't see, until after we had started, that the other lesson, NAMING COMPOUNDS AND ACIDS, had similar mine fields in it. The system would not accept parentheses.  If the correct formula was iron(III) nitrate, it would only accept ironIII nitrate as correct.  If the students included the (), it rejected the answer.  If the correct answer was Mg(OH)2, it would only accept MgOH2.  I can accept that we cannot write subscripts in the answers.  No problem.  But leaving out the () makes a whole different animal. I also noticed two other problems.  The system did not appear to be case-sensitive, which is bad.  If the correct formula was KMnO4, it would accept KMNO4.  This is very different.  Mn is manganese, while MN is an element which, if you discovered it, would get you a Nobel prize.  (N is nitrogen, and there is no element M.)  It also refused to accept one correct answer in the Naming Compounds lesson.  The formula H2CO3 is carbonic acid, which I entered for the short-answer response.  When I typed carbonic acid in the answer space, it rejected it.  And I thought it was supposed to give up after 5 tries.  This one just kept kicking me back to the question.  There was no escape.  I was doomed! AAAAAAHHHHHGGGGHHHHHH !!!  (Sorry.  I got carried away.)  Anyway, any light you can shed on this would help.  I think I can work around some of it, but it would be nice if I didn't have to. Thanks, Dave ChemMaster Smith",

If you have a solution to this I would love to hear it. Thanks Tom ---------- The lesson is one of the most powerful tools in Moodle, and in my training I hear some great ideas. While I know that using only content pages does not register or record a score or grade for completing it, someone suggested a scenario where they would like the final page of a lesson (without having to use a quiz in the lesson) to return a score for the ending up at the decision they had. The example was for students making decisions on medical issues, and having a few out comes to the path they take. For instance the student may go down path \"A\" which is following the correct procedure so they would finally score 100%. However if they make a mistake at one point and end up at result \"B\" they are still providing the correct and same out come as \"A\" but actually have got the right result almost by accident so would score 50%, then a final incorrect path would score 0%. A tiered grading system depending on your decisions but without having to build in question pages, as the learning is more about why they make the choices than testing the book learned knowledge.",

The only time the feedback is seen is if a correct answer without a wildcard is entered. So, for example: If the answer option is *limate, and the student enters climate, no feedback appears. If the answer option is Organism*, and the student enters Organisms, no feedback appears. If the answer option is Vegetation, and the student enters Vegetation, feedback appears. If the answer option is Vegetation, and the student enters vegetation, no feedback appears. Does anyone have any answers that will make this work properly (and ignore case)?

In other cases, we want one of the following instead: Progress bar represents the position of the current page within the lesson, rather than a completion percentage. For example, page 2 of 10, rather than 20%. Resetting the progress bar isn't an issue in this case. Progress bar represents a completion percentage, but it resets when the user restarts the lesson. This may not be as important, because in this case, what we really want is probably the position, not the percentage. Are either of these possible without custom code? Ideally, the behavior of the progress bar would be configurable within the UI. Instead of just turning it on or off, the course designer would specify its behavior. In the meantime, can an admin configure it, either at the course or site level? Thanks!",

My question/problem is that if the student only tries 1 question, gets it correct and then \"Ends Lesson\" the grade is shown as 100% instead of 1/9 I'm sure it's because I'm not understanding how the grading works or is it something to do with the \"End Lesson\" ? I would have thought with the parameters above whatever happens the grade should not be more than 1/9?",

So, lesson looks at what the user actually attempted, scores those, and then scales it to the max grade setting. I believe this is for when Custom scoring is turned On. I think what you are looking for is when Custom Scoring is turned Off. With this setting turned Off, each question answered correctly equates to 1 and then the minimum number of questions attempted can be enforced. Hope this helps, cheers, Mark",

For some reason, Moodle likes multiple choice items, short answer items, and matching items because there is an answer and a real point value assigned to the answer and it is checked. Essays are not checked until the instructor marks them. That seems to be where Moodle get confused and doesn't \"mark\" the part of the lesson the student is on when they exit. If you have a lesson where there are multiple choice items after the essay questions and the student makes it to the multiple choice portion, then Moodle \"marks\" the lesson and saves where the student left off. Currently from my investigation there isn't a fix for this problem. I have created a workaround for this and shared it on a forum here on Moodle, I just can't remember where. I also shared this on the Oakland Schools website. I will duplicate my workaround for you here, and hopefully it will work for you, it has worked quite well for my students.",

          "Text": "Our lessons have several multi-choice / multi-answer questions throughout. We use activity locks /completion check marks for each module/lesson. I wondered if anyone had input regarding a situation where a student checks the two correct answers, in addition to an incorrect one. The results are: The student is able to progress to the next question as if it was completely correct. At the end of the lesson, 11.11% is taken off the score for the incorrect answer in the multi-answer question. Consequently, since the activity locks were set, the student was unable to progress to the next lesson, or return to the completed one as the green check mark is only activated after a complete score of 100%. The scoring on all muli-choice / multi-answer questions are set to jump to the \"next page\" on correct answers, and stay on \"this page\" for incorrect answers (earn 1 point for correct answers). I changed the scoring setting for the second attempt to be \"maximum\" not \"mean\" so eventually they were able to progress...Not an ideal set up though as the student was able to progress with an incorrect answer, not knowing which one they got wrong. Is there a way to change the settings to ensure against this happening again? I am not sure how to ignore the incorrect answers and to avoid a negative score.I bet there is a simple solution.

In particular, I would like the option to see all the responses that students have entered to an essay question in a Moodle Lesson on one page , rather than having to click on each individual's response and open it in a new page. I would also like the option of grading all essay responses one after the other on the page, like I can if I manually grade an essay question in a Moodle Quiz. Even if I ask a Lesson essay question that is not graded, it would be handy to be able to run my eyes down the list of responses to gauge where students are at. When you have a course of 400 students, that's just not possible with the Lesson the way it's structured currently.",

It if is another Moodle system that is roughly the same version you don't need a plug in, there are too many ways to bring in a quiz and/or its questions. You could use a backup process in one Moodle site/course and then restore it to your course. Within a same Moodle site, there is the Import function, where you can import any activity from another course you teach. It is possible to create a file with questions from a question category in Moodle, save that and import that into another site. I would be looking at MoodleDocs , Quiz module , Question bank especially the Import questions and Export questions links. It is possible to export questions from question bank in a file type, then import/insert that file into a lesson. See Adding a question page and the import question section. Hope this helps Chris",

For example in my current browser, in the first line of this post, \"lesson\" is underlined with a red line. This is glossary at work. If you were really clever, you could use the HTML editor linking tool in any content area. Perhaps you wanted some definition about the Moors Murders , today;s feature page in wikipedia. When you scroll over the text there is my summary and a click takes you to the page. Or you want to know the answer to absolutely everything . In this last example I put 42 in the HTML link and my title to explain it (essentially a broken link a bad form but what the heck).",

          "Text": "Further to these discussions Prerequisite Lesson vs Conditional activities and the second question asked by Wendi in that other discussion: Timer . 1.- Like the Quiz activity, the Lesson activity features a timer. This is used to limit the time spent in a Lesson to a certain number of minutes. The Lesson timer is not as sophisticated as the Quiz timer, as it will only refresh upon student submit action. 2.- In a Lesson's prerequisite features, a lesson (B) can be set to be made available to a student only spent a required number of minutes in another lesson (A). However, there is nothing to tell a student how much time they have spent in a lesson so far (while taking the lesson) nor how much time they have spent in a lesson (when they have reached the end of the lesson). In order to avoid confusion with the original Timer feature, I suggest this would called \"Stop watch\" or \"Chronometer\". I agree with Wendi's suggestion that such a feature would be useful in this case. This might be a similar \"widget\" to the so-called \"Progress bar\". Each time a student has submitted an answer/changed pages, a message could be displayed along these lines: \"You have already spent xx minutes in this lesson (A). You need to spend a minimum of yy minutes here in order to access Lesson B.\" A more sophisticated feature might even display a progress bar showing the target time and time spent, similar to the progress bar.

Your host basically told you that in Lesson settings there is \"display default feedback\" which was set to \"yes\" and they set it to \"no\".  They did not tell you that there is a string (bit of text) that the site administrator can edit to change those silly words.   They did not tell you that \"feedback\" under lesson settings and \"response\" in a lesson question refer to the same thing.

          "Text": "short version : I want to know if there are ways to edit lesson content pages other than the standard interface. If I edit page content by directly updating the database , will that break anything? ----- Hi! I'm a novice moodler. Right now I'm trying to use it to put together an online emotion skills course that we're using in some research, and another version of the course that's being used in my institution's wellness program. In our current system, the most current version of the course content is stored in a shared text document that my collaborators and I are editing. When I want to update the moodle course, I have to go page-by-page through each lesson in the two courses, inserting changes from the text document. Then, if everything works on the development server , I have to do the whole thing twice more on the production server.* It's a painful process -- even with a fast connection, the hundreds of page loads really add up. I'd like to know if there's any way to edit lesson content pages other than loading each page in moodle and editing them one-by-one. What I'd really like to do is to keep the HTML for the entire course in a single master document, and use a script to update the moodle database to be consistent with that. So, I have two questions: 1) Is there anything that does that, or anything like it? 2) It looks like all page content is stored in one database field, mdl_lesson_pages.contents. If I have a master document that contains each page's ID and the latest version of its content (in HTML), can I just write a script that generates MySQL queries and update the lesson content that way? Or are there other things in the database that I might have to change as well? (again, assuming that I only edit pages that already exist, and that I don't make changes to answer options or anything else). Thanks much, - Michael * I know I could export the courses from one server to the other, but doing that seems to mess up the accounts of users who exist on both servers (not a very helpful description of the problem, but I haven't explored it in detail yet).",

Those id's are probably assigned when the course was created and the numbering system is related to the entire site. If you had moved section 5 to section 2, the id would remain the same, but it might have taken you a bit longer to find the correct id.

ChrisLogic believes you are right, there has to be a size limit but that is for a skilled developer to answer in a different forum. Best Chris",

          "Text": "Hi I've configured 4 lessons in one of my courses. I configured the 1st one to link to the 2nd lesson when finished. Similarly, I configured the activity link of the 2nd lesson to start lesson 3 at the end, and 3rd lesson to 4th lesson. And the activity link of the 4th lesson is connected to a web page as a resource in the same course. The moodle I use is 1.72+. I run the backup of the course and check the 4 lessons and the web page resource but without user folders. After successful backup, I tried to restore the file into a new course with every boxes of options checked. In the new course, I try to enter the setup page of each lesson, but I discovered that all the \"activity links\" of the last options of lessons are removed without any path to neither 2nd, 3rd nor 4th lesson, nor to the web page resource. However, all pictures and paths are working properly. Has anyone raised similar questions before? Has anyone tried to backup and restore consecutive linked lessons before and found out the same results? I wonder if anyone has the idea of how to solve this problem as it has been a great inconvenience to me to restore all the links when I have to work on more than 500 courses. Really looking forward to a solution. Thanks in advance. Cheers James",

          "Text": "Before when we were using 1.3.4 we used the lesson activity to build our courseware. This is exactly what we did. We created a series of eight lessons where we utilized the form element in the \"lesson\" to paste in some additional html. This html contained a series of html form elements, which included pull-down, text fields, radio buttons and some swf elements. Additionally, we wrote some additional php which we put inside the \"view\".php file to extract the data from the embedded html forms and then stored it in an external database . After some tinkering this worked great. All is good right. Well it was until we downloaded and installed the new version 1.4.1. Now it seems that we can no longer use the paste-in-html inside the \"lesson''s \" built-in form feature to replicate what we did in 1.3.4. The reason being is the lesson refuses to \"see\" the html...It simply returns the html as text. The \"html tags\" were ignored. ???????? So my questions are: 1. Is it no longer possible to use the lesson's form to paste in html tags? 2. Our course had 120 pages broken out into 8 lessons, so using the resource option would makes us have 120 links inside our course page. This is not acceptable..Anyone have any other ideas. We really don't want to go back to 1.3.4 3. Is there another way to format html inside the text box in the lessons?",

When I demonstrate the features of this lesson in live-seminars I would like to show it as students would see it. Can I set a lesson so that students can work through only once, but administrators or teachers can do so repeatedly?

This is fine and works as far as getting a report export that I need. However, the users don't want that grade to be displayed since everyone will simply get 100% for answering the last question.

Here's an example: What are the symptoms? a) No power b) No sound c) LED doesn't turn on If person selects \"a\" then they would be taken directly to \"no power\" page without seeing \"That's correct!\" and \"CONTINUE\".

A quick fix to your problem is to open up mod/lesson/locallib.php and go to about line 1152 (which is very near to the end of the file). Next find this line: if ($form = data_submitted()) { ABOVE  if ($form = data_submitted()) {  put this line: return data_submitted();",

I there any way to execute the End of Lesson function hidden in a link? All that needs to happen is for the student to go to the end of the lesson.  This can be done with a jump that goes to End of Lesson or the last page of the lesson goes to Next Page . Cheers, Mark",

          "Text": "I'm trying to develop lessons (using Moodle version 1.9).  I want the students to do the questions at staged points through a lecture, so my first question is a \"numerical\" question with a four digit number that I will give when  I want the students to attempt the first question. Here are my settings: Page Contents: \"Enter the code given in class to see question 1\" Answer 1: 4949 Response 1: Correct.  Proceed to question 1. Jump to: Next Page  Score 1: 0 Answer 2: blank Response 2: Blank Jump to: This page  Score 2: 0 All the rest are blank. It is my expectation that if I put in the correct pass number, the program should give my response 1 and go on to the next question. If any other answer is given, it should give a default response or no response, and repose the question 1. What in fact happens is this: If the correct answer is put in, the response is: Not quite. Would you like to try again? It provides two buttons: \"Yes, I'd like to try again.\" and \"No, I just want to continue to next question.\" If I click on the first, it reposes the question.  If I click on the second, it takes me to the 2nd question. If I put in a wrong number the response is exactly the same as above.  The only difference between the button responses is if you click the one that says I'd like to continue, it does not go on to the next question, but reposes the first question. Now it is doing what it should but the responses don't seem to correspond with how the program should work.  Any suggestions? Note: in the main lesson settings, I have the setting for \"display default feedback\" set to \"no.\"  For what it's worth, I've had it set to yes and I get the same results.",

          "Text": "Hello. Sorry if I am wrong since I am brand new in this Moodle world, but this is something I have been looking for but haven't been able to solve. I use lesson for \"tactic drilling scenarios\" and I only want to be shown with the response feedback if my answer is wrong, but want to keep to the next question (and save a mouse click) if I am right. I have been looking through the different documentation, but haven't been able to get this behavior, although while writing the questions I have randomly got the desired behavior, I don't really know how. This has been asked before in How can I remove feedback after questions? : https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=48404 but apparently there's no workaround for this, although this thread is quite old. Any new hints on this? Thanks!",

Currently the buttons read \"Yes, I'd like to try again\" and \"No, I just want to go to the next question\". Is there a way to change the text of these buttons? I am currently using the Adaptable theme but there doesn't seem to be an option there to change the text (just the look of the buttons - which makes sense for the theme settings page). I did try searching for reviewquestioncontinue in Language customization as per an old post on this forum (from 2015), but that didn't seem to exist anymore. Has it been renamed to something else? Or is the another way to change what the text for these buttons reads? Thanks for any advice you can provide!",

Then I returned. I was at the start of the lesson with no yes/no prompt. After I clicked through the first two pages of the lesson, I left. Then I returned. I was asked the yes/no question. Just tested on another lesson. Clearly, Lesson is recording when you click the continue button and is tracking your progress. If you click in and click out without touching the continue button, nothing is recorded. That doesn't help you much. I do know (because I was part of the discussion years ago) that you can copy the URL of a lesson page and paste it somewhere else (for example, at the end of a quiz) and the link will return you to the page you left.",

The prompt for bringing you back to the previous page uses the information stored in the database for pages that you performed an action (like answering a question or choosing a branch) on the current lesson attempt.  I believe that just dropping into a lesson by accessing the page via the URL doesn't actually leave any trail showing that you were in the lesson. In either case, could you please file a bug report in the tracker about this inconsistent behavior. Thanks.",

However, I often develop the lesson at home off-line and then copy it back to the production server later.  In that case, of course, the url is wrong, because my system at home does not have the same address as the production server,  and the system can no longer find the content. Does anyone have a work-around for this, or is there a way to dive directly into the code and do a search and replace?  If so, where does this lesson code reside?  Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thanks, K.",

          "Text": "Hi Keith, I'm trying to understand your problem, by re-phrasing all the various phases. 1. Inserting a link to an image into the text of a lesson \" When I am creating a lesson, I use the link tab to link to a file on the local system. \" I suppose you mean that, when creating the various lesson pages (questions, answers, etc.) you would like e.g. to insert a link to an image file and thus you click on the Insert Image button (I don't see a \"link tab \" there). If so, then the image you want to insert is either: already present in your My Files directory (or an Image sub-directory of My Files ) on your local Moodle Course; residing somewhere on your local computer, then you first have to upload it to a My Files directory before selecting its link. 2. Copying your lesson to the production server How do you do this? The only way I know to \"copy\" a lesson is to backup your course - including only the lessons - and restore it to your production server course. Then, the link to the images you inserted into your lesson text is automatically re-written to point to the proper My Files directory on your online course. Of course, correct linking assumes that the structure of My Files in both courses (online & local) is the same and... that the various images present on your local My Files/Images directory have also been uploaded some way onto your distant My Files/Images site directory! I hope that helps, Joseph",

Then, when you restore the course, let's say to the ip of 192.168.0.8,  (the link in this case would look like \" http://192.168.0.8/moodle/file.php/2/Topic1.pdf \") but the lesson cannot find the file, because it is still looking for 172.27.200.252. ( http://172.27.200.252/moodle/file.php/2/Topic1.pdf , which doesn't exist on this server). I've temporarily solved the problem by assigning a domain name to the ip, and then, when I work at home, temporarily assign that domain to the computer that I'm working on (assuming that I'm not online). I believe that moodle works this way because it sits \"on top\" of apache, and needs either the ip or domain to identify the server that it is getting the content from -- (localhost would work, UNTIL you tried to access the site from a remote computer, in which case it will look to itself [the local computer] to find the content -- I know, I've already tried . . .) Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks, K.",

I never used lesson much before (I always seemed to break it!) but am going to have a play with it again as everything seems fixed now I have reinstalled it! As I understand it, the cdc version is going to be the standard lesson in 1.5. Is that correct? I understand that there may be a few differences between the current and 1.5 version. If I do a load of lessons now using the cdc version in contrib, will they be compatible with lesson 1.5? I suspect the answers will be yes and yes but I just want to make sure before I spend a lot of time on it. Thanks in advance",

          "Text": "that seems like a little bit of a roundabout way of doing this, why not try http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Media_Player or, if you are in a commerical environment and don't want to shell out for a license, the html5 video tag? I just set this up on our page (moodle 2.2) and it is a very easy, future-proof method. 1 go to the page you want the video to be on and use the \"moodle Media\" button (on the formatting toolbar, next to the emoticon button) to upload the video file (not the .lnk file but the video file itself, you may need to use something like miro video converter to make it an mp4 or ogg video first for compatibility reasons). 2 this will put a link on the page (something like http://your.server/moodle/draftfile.php/#/user/draft/ #######/video.ogv) 3 click the HTML button (on the formatting toolbar, next to the spellcheck button) to bring up the HTML Editor. 4 in the editor your link will show up like <a href=\"http://your.server/moodle/draftfile.php/#/user/draft/#######/video.ogv\"></a>. Before the start of the <a href=... copy in the following <video><source src=> and after the </a> copy in </video> 5 copy just the url of the video from the <a> tag and paste it in between '<source src=' and '>' 6 you should now have something that looks like this - <video><source src=\"http://your.server/moodle/draftfile.php/#/user/draft/#######/video.ogv\"><a href=\"http://your.server/moodle/draftfile.php/#/user/draft/#######/video.ogv></a></video> When the user gets to the page, one of two things will happen. If they have a compatible browser they will see a box on the page with basic controls like play, pause, etc. They can play the video in their browser much like they would a youtube or TED.com video. The immediate upside here is that they do not need macromedia flash, java or anything other than their browser to accomplish this, meaning that the video can be played without any nasty, user-experience breaking prompts to install plugins. They do not have to have windows media player, quicktime or whatever other media application on their computer either. If they do not have a compatible browser (Internet explorer pre version 9 is a good example, and encompasses a good 34% of the internet last I saw) they will just see the link to the video file itself, allowing them to download and play it on their computer if they have the relevant media player. A few addendums to this - Depending on what browser your userbase is on, you may want to vary what format you use. because half of our userbase is on IE and the other half on firefox , we actually include two <source> tags, the result being that the browser displays whichever video it is compatible with. Wikipedia has some very useful info on what browsers support what and what else you can do with the tag, including removing the controls, setting it to autoplay when loaded or setting it to loop. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video I mentioned miro video converter. There's lots out there and I haven't been using it long enough to give a serious endorsement either way, but it's worked so far for me (being open source and free was enough to convince me) http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/ if I skimmed over anything or explained it badly, let me know. Moodle is still very much a mystery to me, so I have to come to these forums often searching for help, but HTML is something I am far more familiar with, so I jump at the chance to be on this side of the helping equation for once :D.",

B1, B2, B3, Q1, B4, B5, Q2, B6, B7, Q3 is Alternative 1 B1, B2, B3, Q1, Q2, B4, B5, Q3, Q4, B6, B7, Q5 etc. is Alternative 2 I see two problems. However, one solution might be to change lesson settings so that they only can answer a question once (Flow Control, max number of attempts set to 1). That may not be acceptable to you but it is a solution for both alternatives. The other potential problem you did not mention is that after being sent back then the students have to review all the pages. For example: If a students misses Q2 and is sent back to B3. The navigation order for B3 will still be in place. If you change the lesson setting to 1 attempt, then they will jump to B4, then go to B5 etc. In Alternative 1 this could be a lot of material. This falls under lesson planning. In Alternative 1, if an answer in Q3 indicates they missed the content of B2, then you might send them to another page which explains the concept differently. Then send them back to Q3 (which of course they answered) so they will automatically go to the next page (generally speaking). This can start to create lots of loops for a teacher to remember. Hope this assists you. Chris",

          "Text": "I call these user the speed clickers. I agree with your wife, make them pay in what they value - \"time\". I am not aware of any lesson delay for speed clicker. I have two basic suggestions. 1. We send them back in the logical order when they miss a question. \"They need review if they missed that one\" is the official policy. As the Behaviorist implies, the speed clickers want to zip through our branch and question pages. It doesn't take our adult trainees long to realize it takes less time to read the questions we scatter about than randomly guess the answers. You might need to be clever about this. Don't do every question the same way for wrong answers. When they miss \"the answer\", send them back to the \"this page\" some times, send them forward as if they got it correct, send them back 10 pages at other times. Insert a page in the logical order that is intentionally skipped but guesses will hit it. Speed clickers will figure out the back browser button to skip the review and answer the question correctly, so random really makes them pay attention because of the cost of being lazy or non-motivated. I have varied my standards from lesson to lesson (hey I am lazy too) just to keep them guessing about the pattern. Also remember, some of these students will not realize they just answered 500 questions and only needed to answer 50 questions. Just like they might not realize you sent them to a time out area for 5 minutes (boring is boring). So you may have to tell them what you are doing a couple of times early on in the lesson. Not only in the intro, but as feed back \"Sorry you missed this question, please review this material\". Can you find a reward that a student has to find? Puzzle pieces, build a magic phrase that allows them to draw a prize (a credit for a book report? an apple for the teacher?) . 2. Install Activity Locking in 1.6.5 or upgrade to 1.8 and use the built in Lesson dependency settings. One of the contingencies in either of these is time spent in another activity/lesson. Note: there maybe a problem with time because in the past it was not cumulative for all attempts of the lesson, just the current attempt or most recent attempt.",

          "Text": "Hi, In MoodleSpeak, I think you mean \"courses\" not \"lessons\". I made the same mistake when I first studied Moodle. I may move your question out of this forum but let me try to answer your question first. In Moodle language, a Moodle site has courses. One course can be placed in a group of courses which is called a category. Students can enroll in (subscribe to) a course. Here is some more information about site course categories . Inside each course are activities modules, resources and blocks. Activities and resources are placed in sections (groups). These sections can be called \"topics\" or \"weeks\". A Lesson Module is an Activity module. Each Lesson can have a password. It is possible to make a student take the first lesson before taking the second lesson. You are not talking about this kind of lesson. I think in Moodle language you are asking, \"Can a student enroll in a category of courses? I do not want them to have to enroll in each course in a category, just enroll 1 time.\" I think the answer is \"yes\", when you set up some \" Metacourse\" (please follow the link to Moodle documentation for more words). People say it can be tricky to set up a Metacourse the first time for a new Moodle users. In theory here is how a Metacourse works. A Meta course allows a student to enroll in one course and then automatically enrolled in other courses. This is what you want.",

I'm now able to create and modify a Branch Table with no problem. However the problem recurs when trying to add an \"End of Branch\" page. Specifically the error encountered is; \"Add end of branch: answer record not inserted\". I assume this is related in some way to my earlier problem, but not being a database practitioner I'm not sure. Does anyone know if this issue is related to the open bug tracker ticket at, http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-8196 ? I'm not so paralyzed as Michael K. is in that we can still add Lessons and build onto them. But I am at a loss about creating non-linear lessons. Thanks for your attention. Steve",

Example: You are a firefighter and you get a call that a warehouse is on fire. What should you take to fight the fire? (a) Fire extinguisher, (b) Water buffalo, (c) Fire truck. Okay, so you pick fire truck. Looks like the fire is coming from an oil tank. What should you use? (a) Water, (b) CO2, (c) Foam. You chose water. Okay, here's what happens: fire out of control! Better choose something else. Etc. You can take the learner down each path as far as you want. Hypercard did something similar, and you could link web pages or Powerpoint slides to one another. But I love the lesson module b/c it's so easy to set up and use, and it allows an instructor to track student progress (by way of scores). Hope this helps. - Peter",

I've not experimented much with Cloze, short-answer, and other types of questions in the lesson module. What I find most challenging about creating a credible scenario is supplying answers without leading the student. In other words, once I mention a choice, the student knows the issue is possibly important, just by my calling attention to it. The real trick is to lay out all of the cues in a situation without calling attention to any one of them. That's how most authentic performance situations work, in my experience. - Peter",

I would like to use the lesson module to create case studies where the students are given a scenario along with relevant diagnostic data (i.e. radiographs, video, ECGs etc.). I have manged to upload the diagnostic data as resources, and they show up with the corresponding grey labels in the lesson text (this is just the kind of integration that Blackboard won't do!). However, when the student clicks to view the resource, the lesson is replaced by the resources module. Is there a way to get the reources to open in a new window on top of the lesson to allow the students alternate between the two or to have a Back button with the resource to return to the lesson. Otherwise the only way back is to use the Browser's Back button which is not a great way of doing things. Perhaps this question belongs in the Resources forum... Thanks in advance, Richard",

However, there also are a couple of hundred members registered with different status, courses and groups. That I would also have to backup, because manually re-entering those would be beyond me. 2. I do not know if it is possible, but there are also backups from my provider. If the problem is caused by corrupted files I could restore entire folders from the backup. However, that would not restore the database accordingly. So I do not know if this would be feasible. 3. Finally, I would have to know what might have caused that problem to begin with. If there is a good chance that if I take off a month from my regular job to recreate those courses (and it would take me about that long) and I stand in the same place a year down the road I might just have to give up on the idea of online-teaching alltogether. Which would be hard. Is there a way to figure out what the php error messages mean? Thanks for your help, Joseph!",

When I restore it erasing the course first, I get the following message: Notice : Undefined offset: 80 in /home/www/academy/lib/accesslib.php on line 2371 I just wished I knew what that meant! Next, I will restore it into an entirely different course, with little hope for success. Finally, I will try to restore it with a manual backup from last year, the only other one I have (shame on me!) since I trusted the automatic backup w/o checking it! I am still wondering if this is all due to a problem serverside, or some glitch in Moodle (or the installation, even though the install log had come back as flawless), or if someone is possibly trying to hack something, since we have had some funky registrations, supposedly from Afghanistan, lately!

It is more praticle and fast for those who wanna see his progress. Students sometimes tell me that they feel lonely and boring when they attempt a lesson module as they don't know how far it will ends and his progress, especially teachers set more than 5 question pages. So how about printed a distinct progress bar top or bottom to show his track? I've tried the similar function in livemocha.com, it sounds fabulous.",

We have a series of lessons in a course that have two completion criteria set: student must reach end of lesson and student must be engaged with lesson a certain length of time. We also have one quiz question that becomes unlocked at the end of the course when students register completion with each lesson within the course. I have noticed a few students are able to reach the end quiz question with their profile outline completion report showing that a few lessons have been started but not yet complete. The Activity Completion report within the course shows that the student did complete the activity with a check mark in the table with the listings of other students. The majority of students it appears to work and report as intended that completion is registered in both locations - the course's activity completion report and the student's profile outline report. I assumed that the student would need to both be engaged in the lesson for x amount of time and reach the end of the lesson. Can you only have one completion criteria set for a lesson? I do not have student must view the activity to complete as that is already covered if you have it open a certain length of time. Our lesson consists of a content page, followed by a page with a video, then the end of lesson. I did not want students to be on the content page for the entire time allotted for the lesson and not reach the video, thus I added they must also reach the end of lesson. Might there be a better way to achieve this? SCORM activities are not an option for us. thank you Sandy",

When a student gets a short answer correct in a lesson, the correct feedback is displayed, and the designated jump is executed as expected. However, no points are added to the total score. In addition, the lesson score is recorded as 100% upon quitting the lesson after correctly answering only the first question (as long as it is not a short answer question) even if the minimum number of questions is set to 18 for a lesson that contains 18 questions. This bug has just appeared in the last day or two, and no changes have been made to the installation in that time. I have tried upgrading the entire installation to this week's latest version, and I've repaired and optimized all database tables without solution. The problem occurs even in a new lesson that freshly created. This is obviously a serious issue for us! Does anyone have any insight into this problem?",

However, while we wait for the issue to be addressed, we are mitigating the problem by changing the settings of affected lessons. We found that the problem only occurs in lesson that do not have custom grading turned on (i.e. lessons that work only via \"Jump to next page\" as a way of grading). If you turn on custom grading in the lesson settings and you give e.g. a 1 point score for the correct alternatives in the short answer questions (and in the correct answers to other questions!), the lesson grading will work. It is probably possible to do this for all lessons via an SQL query in the database, but I have not yet determined the exact syntax of such a query and, then again, you may not want to turn all lessons to custom grading. I think there would have to be two SQL queries: One to turn custom grading on in all lessons One to turn the score to 1 for all lesson answers in which jumpto is -1 and score is 0. Someone with better knowledge of MySQL could probably churn out the correct queries. Rgrds, Paul.",

As I said in my previous post (probably a bit tersely), in Moodle 1.9 we had pages called \"Branch Tables\", which have been re-named to \"Content Pages\" in Moodle 2. See this discussion . So, in Moodle 1.9, if you want to create a page which is not a question but contains information content, you must create a Branch Table page . In Moodle 2, you'll create a Content Page . In Moodle 1.9 it was indeed possible to create a Question page (of the Multiple Choice type) without any answer . That page would sort of behave like a \"Branch Table\", i.e. it would provide a \"Continue\" button which, upon being clicked, would jump to the next page in the lesson. It was in fact quite illogical to have a \"Question without answers\", and using this feature instead of using the \"Branch Table\" feature led to the problem described by Karen when upgrading to Moodle 2. So my advice to the original poster (and anyone still using moodle 1.9) is to use Branch Table pages, not a MCQ question page with no answers, in order to avoid problems when upgrading to Moodle 2.

If I run mouse over the name of an image the field underneath behaves odd and it blinks but if I use SHIFT R I prompt for a single picture and it appears.

          "Text": "Hi Paul, What appears as a bug here is due to the way the Moodle calendar interprets the period of time during which a \"lesson\" is open as compared to current date. Example: Today is Nov. 6th Case 1 (normal behavior) in lesson settings, a lesson is set to be available from Nov. 7th until Nov. 10th In the calendar the only highlighted date is Nov. 7th, and dates 8th through 10th are \"boxed\" (i.e. they display a top and bottom border). In the calendar, if you click on Nov. 7th, it takes you to the calendar day view, where you can see the details of lesson opening and closing. Case 2 (the buggy situation) in lesson settings, a lesson is set to be available from Nov. 1st until Nov. 10th In the calendar the only highlighted date is Nov. 10th, in which we can see the double message you mention: Lesson opens; lesson closes... twice Obviously, Case2 should be considered as a bug since when a lesson's opening date is overdue we shoud not get the doubly double message in the due date box. What we should really see is a single message saying \"lesson closes\" that's all. I have posted bug report #4279 Joseph",

I'm sorry I have no solution for you, but really wanted to share to stop you spending time looking for a solution - I've spent days on this myself and some while ago I gave up trying. You say you are trying to embed them - the import PPTs to lessons is not embedding: it's converting the PPTs to lesson pages.   Embedding you can do - but this means saving as a movie and showing it in an AV filter. Is there another way you will be satisfied with showing the content or does it have to be lesson format? Unless you want to include in-page questions, why not consider this? It would save you duplicating your work into a lesson. If you only want lesson pages I really think it's not good news - it means recreating the slides again within the lesson. Perhaps someone else has recently found an alternative, but I don't expect so as those people that are clever enough to develop are moving on to concentrate on 2.0. Sorry.",

If I have a response for a correct answer, that is displayed, but that is pretty useless, since I don't normally put responses on correct answers.  The response is normally an explanation of why an answer is wrong.  For me, that is far more valuable than an explanation of why one is right. It seems to me that previous versions correctly displayed my custom response, although I may be misremembering.  Is there a way to get this custom response to appear?",

In a lesson module, a student answers an essay question and that should be counted as a \"post\". A teacher responds to a student essay and that should be counted as a \"post\". In the Assignment activity, A student responds to an online text assignment and that answer to the question posited in the activity should be counted as a post. If a teacher responds back to the students answer, with a comment, that should be counted as a post. The point is, if we are to measure activity in the course by views and posts, everything that is considered a \"post\" to the course, ought to be counted. Otherwise, it is very difficult to \"administer\" the course and understand either student or teacher activity. This is yet another piece of the puzzle that both Instructure and Brain Honey have solved, that inspire confidence in people who are making decisions about which LMS to use. I am getting to the point, where it seems like Moodle Statistics must be considered as unimportant. What is it replaced with?",

The first is I always try to copy a line break past the end of the text I'm copying.  For some reason, this seems to help keep the formatting in the last paragraph once it's pasted into the lesson page. If the formatting is lost, I often find that just resizing the text won't have any effect, but that if I change the entire block to something like Courier New first, then back to my desired font, I can change other attributes correctly. I hope this works for you - it sounds as though we're doing similar things! Regards, Matthew.",

They are then allowed to try again: Question 1 (second time): Student gets the correct answer. Raw Score: 1/2 (Even though there is only one question.)

          "Text": "Hi Drew, For the sake of discussion, my understanding is that Lesson resets itself with each lesson attempt by a student. Lesson setting has a setting for how the lesson's grade will be calculated in gradebook for a retake. The Lesson activity is not a Quiz activity. Quiz has a penalty feature with each question and some other features that might meet some of your needs. Quiz does not have a jump feature. I suppose you could use the jump feature to achieve the result you want. However, you have to realize that what you the teacher knows and sees is different that what the student sees (and is clueless about). And it requires the teacher understand all the potential paths the student can take. There is not a global lesson setting to do what you want (unless you tweak the code, of course). Thus if it is important to you, you will have to plan and devote some time to it. Here is how I would do it in a Lesson. For example, imagine you had 2 pairs of identical questions in your lesson. Q1a, Q1b, Q2a, Q2b. The student who answers Q1a correctly, goes to Q2a. The student who misses Q1a, goes to Q1b via the wrong answer jumps. Any answer in Q1b will go to Q2a. We could keep repeating this with Q2, Q3 etc. The next thing is to consider your custom scores for each answer in the identical pair of questions. Say you gave a 2 for the right answer in Q1a and a zero for wrong answers. In Q1b you could give 1 point for the correct answer and zero for the wrong answers. This reaches the goal you described. Since the student is only taking the lesson once, in lesson settings I would set the max attempts at 1. Now the question becomes if you want them to take this lesson again and what have you set for the retake setting. Chris",

I was misled by your use of \" embedded into a lesson\". I thought you were using the Embed questions filter plugin... You are actually referring to the standard Multichoice question page in a Lesson activity. And you are right, a multiple-choice, multi-answers question works as an \"all or nothing\" question. This cannot be changed. You must realize that the Moodle Lesson activity is not really suited for assessment. The number of question types it recognizes is very limited and the options within each type are very limited as well. If you want a better assessment tool, then the Quiz activity offers plenty of question types and plenty of settings. In my experience the Lesson activity is a great tool for branching scenarios and as a learning tool, not so much as a testing tool.",

That's why I have every wrong answer jump set to \"this page\".  That's also why I set the \"Provide option to try a question again\" to \"no\" because then the student merely sees the Moodle feedback about trying again for the \"sheer love of learning\", not my wrong answer feedback.

This may also be something for a different forum, such as Gradebook here. Here is what I did. I played in demo.moodle.org ( currently 1.9 Beta 4 ). I added a Lesson in section 8 as teacher with 1 question. Student took it and indeed I did not see it. When the teacher clicked on Lessons it was there but not in grades. This seemed to duplicate your problem. ( FYI : Somebody had changed the theme to blue and added another course that the student could not see.) I went in as admin and looked at Grades setting in the course admin block, even assigned the teacher as the teacher to the new lesson. No help, so I went off to MoodleDocs . When I returned to demo.moodle a new hour had started. In my second attempt, the theme was a standard white. I added a Lesson above the first section with a question. The student took the lesson and missed the question. The student saw the grade (0%) on the last row, much to my surprise! They took the lesson again and answered the question correctly and got a 50% (the mean, as I had set it up). The teacher saw the grade in the last column on the right. I added a second 1 question lesson. The student got this one correct. This lesson appeared at the bottom of the grades icon list. So at least in demo.moodle I conclude that student's that get a zero on a lesson will see 0%, which is their score. Students who do not attempt a lesson will see a - , as in the lesson which was in section 8 which they did not attempt. I wonder if I set the max score under lesson settings for the demo lesson in section 8 to say 10 (instead of zero), what would happen in the grade book.",

Here is my problem: In our Moodle 3.1, we use Lessons quite a bit, a mix of content and question pages.  Students receive their Lesson score based on how they do on the question pages.  But some students work through the Lesson until the final page, where they click to get to the END LESSON jump.  Once there, they close out their browser window, and are given a \"not completed\" in the Results page. But doing that allows them to see all the questions, try out answers, and then leave without getting a grade in the Gradebook.  As far as I can tell, their score is not \"locked in\" until they do the final jump of the \"end Lesson\" sequence. My question: Is there a way to assign a minimum grade to any Lesson attempt that is categorized finally as \"not completed\"?  For example, any student starting a Lesson but not completing it would receive a 0 for their first score attempt for the Lesson (we allow multiple attempts, keeping the average score of all attempts). Thanks for any help you can offer!",

However, in the Lesson module, the question page is giving me a default feedback and is not using the one I typed in. How can I fix this so it will give me my customized feedback? 2) If I use regular expressions, can I use * as a catch-all if a student answer does not have any of the preceding answers I've coded in?

I guess that it would be better to embed the sections below in a conditional statement (e.g. if ($lesson->timed)) instead of commenting but I didn’t have the time to try it.

The documentation says \"A typical use of this feature is to \"daisy chain\" a series of Lessons to make sure the students take the lessons in order.\" This does not imply forcing them to accomplish each lesson in one sitting, and so the code should not have been written to require it. Surely the code requiring it was an error and should be fixed - as shown below. The only change needed to fix the error is to initialize $duration and to sum it (+=), not replace it. (=) change lines 100-102 in mod/lesson/view.php (in versions 1.9.9 through 2.0.2 at least; earlier versions are only off by a few lines) From: // go through all the times and test to see if any of them satisfy the condition foreach($attempttimes as $attempttime) { $duration = $attempttime->lessontime - $attempttime->starttime; To: $duration=0; // go through all the times to see if the total satisfies the condition foreach($attempttimes as $attempttime) { $duration += $attempttime->lessontime - $attempttime->starttime; (We made this correction perhaps 2 years ago, tested it, and it has fixed the problem for us ever since.)

My version of 1.6.3 on my homemachine did not duplicate your problem on a multiple choice question. Should not be an issue but did you also hit the refresh on your browser, maybe it is holding the old image. One of my dumb tricks in 1.5.4 was to copy the HTML code from an area that had a HTML tool to one that did not. For example, I would add a picture to the content area of a multiple choice question, then cut and paste the text HTML code to an answer. This does not work in 1.6.3 because the Unicode or something has changed the format of the html code. And the HTML edit tool is all over the place now. However, I think some HTML code can be entered as text and will be recognized in preview or a student view. How to do that needs somebody with more experience. It would be a lot easier to figure out why the HTML editor is not turning on.",

Have you tried inserting it into say a quiz module multiple choice question or even a quiz module label question type? If it works there then it is a Lesson module issue.",

There are 3 possible criterion time, completion and minimum score that can be used in combinations if desired. l See MoodleDocs access control There are some non standard modules for conditional activities : Activity locking or Score Lock. These are a little bit more complex, alter the Moodle database and allow most activities or sections to be dependent upon meeting certain conditions. Last I looked, these have not been updated for 1.7. Of course you can open and close lessons by dates to establish a sequence but that does not ensure a student has taken the lesson.

In that case I have just found out that the student's attempt is *not recorded* in their Activity Report, where the lesson is marked as \"no attempt\"! The only workaround I have found is to place a Question page on page 1 or the last page, with a \"dummy\" MCQ question, e.g. do you want to continue YES / NO. But unfortunately, this gives the students a grade! I do not want those lessons to be graded at all. And anyway, I do not understand why lessons set as \"practice lessons\" still get a grade displayed and still appear in the gradebook. They shouldn't. What I want is for those lessons consisting of Branch pages and no Question pages to allow the students to make their way to the end, not get any grade displayed, but be marked as ATTEMPTED in their Activity Report.

I would like the feedback to show up at the top of the page. I am not very concerned that the lesson page show up as well on feedback, but if it is there, I would prefer it to show up BELOW the feedback. On a related note, it would be nice if a continue button were also at the top of the feedback page. Scrolling the page just to find a continue button when you have already read a page is really not good design. Any thoughts? Can I accomplish this with a small CSS hack? Thanks in advance.",

I am not very concerned that the lesson page show up as well on feedback, but if it is there, I would prefer it to show up BELOW the feedback. The problem is that the Lesson module is versatile and can be used for all kind of activities, unlike the Quiz module, which is clearly aimed at asking questions and - optionally - providing feedback. A few years ago the standard behavior of the Questions pages in Lesson was in fact what you wish. The sequence was: Question page (with question text and choices etc.). Next screen showing feedback on its own. If correct response, move on to next page; if incorrect go back to question page with text. As I use the Lesson module mainly for very brief material presentation and self-assessment questions, and as feedback is all important for me, I found it anti-pedagogic to display the feedback on its own, so that the student could no longer see the question text and their selected choice. This is why I insisted that feedback should be displayed on the same page as the question text and question choices . For the same reason I would find it strange to have the display you suggest: FEEDBACK QUESTION TEXT QUESTIONS & STUDENT'S RESPONSE It is not logical to have FEEDBACK displayed before QUESTION TEXT and RESPONSES. I quite understand your point of view. You apparently display a lot of text on question pages, and then ask a question at the bottom, etc. As I said at the beginning, because in the Lesson module you can use Question pages for a variety of uses, there is no display which will fit all types of activity.

          "Text": "Hello Michael, The cluster jump should be set to \"Unseen questions within a cluster\", this is the default when you create a cluster page and you should not change it or the cluster will not work. It is true that cluster only work for questions page not for content pages and to my best knowledge it has always been like that even in Moodle 1.9. Even more if you put  a content page between the cluster ad end of cluster pages it will alter the cluster working, this is because content page mark the beginning of a subcluster (see https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Lesson_clusters#Sub-Clusters ) so you should not do that if you don't want to use subclusters. As I said to Mary the intended purpose of a cluster is to present a group of question pages in a random order to all students. No more no less And I can add that the subcluster intended purpose is to present only one question page in a group of question pages to the student So for instance if you have Q1, C1 , Q2, Q3, B1 , Q4, Q5, Q6, EB1 , Q7, EC1 , Q8 (this example is extracted from the documentation) where C means cluster, B means content page (that were named branch tables in Moodle 1.9), EB means end of branch and EC means end of cluster all student will see Q1 as first question and Q8 as last question all students will see Q2, Q3 and Q7 but we don't know in which order each student will see only one question picked at random among Q4, Q5 and Q6 and we don't know at what moment it will be shown to them between Q1 and Q8 All students will see exactly 6 questions neither C1, B1, EB1 and EC1 will be displayed to student (Yes the content page B1 will not be displayed !) Last thing, unfortunately in Moodle 2.8.4+, your problem when editing a cluster page that the jump is changed to \"Next page\" and the cluster is broken is still not fixed (it is already fixed in the future Moodle 2.9) but hopefully it will be fixed this week or next one because the fix is currently in integration (you can look at MDL-48897 to follow the integration process and know when it is closed). Note to all Moodle users: if you are interested in using clusters and subclusters in your lessons it is mandatory that you upgrade your Moodle to a very very recent release because I found numerous bugs while working on them.",

Here's the situation I have run into: A student came to me and said that he had entered the correct answer, but Moodle didn't accept it.  Since the first time he attempted the question, he gave a wrong answer, that is the only answer I could see.  I couldn't see his other answers to be able to evaluate what he was doing wrong and, therefore, I couldn't explain to him why Moodle said it was wrong, while he was adamant that he had answered it correctly.  In the quiz module, I can see every attempted answer.  Lesson only the first one or the correct one - none in between.",

Don't forget links to other Moodle activities and resources via an HTML link in a page's content. Q1) Some of these have edit features, Q2) some don't. This includes files that students normally are not able to see in the course's file structure . In some versions of Moodle, it is possible to link to resources/activities located in other courses the student is enrolled in via an HTML link. Hopes this helps a little, Chris",

Authentication refers to the process which allows a user to enter a Moodle site. The key word you are looking for is Enrolment in a course. Like Authentication, there is a lot to say. I suggest you click on the MoodleDocs links I provided for both these terms. In a Lesson you should review the Access control Lesson settings . You could add code that the student would have to type in order to enter the Lesson for the first time. You can also set a time frame by date but not by duration in a Lesson. You can only set the duration a student stays in the course via the course Enrolment settings . Hope this helps, Chris",

There is no problem in the Grader book when students have submitted both essays, however, when students only submit one, lets say the one that is worth 30 points, the grade is calculated based on a raw score (e.g 25/30 and NOT 25/40). This is unfair for the students that submitted both answers. So, how can I set it up so that un-submitted essay questions within a lesson are counted as zero (when the lesson is \"closed\")? I have tried many ways and nothing seems to work.... Thank you for any help that you can give me.",

          "Text": "Hello, Why should some students getting all the correct answers in a Lesson be stuck on a 44.44% total score. I have created two simple Lesson activities in my Moodle system (version 1.6.2+). They are 'simple' because there are no branches; both Lessons contain 8 questions, and when student get questions right they are taken to the next question in order, and if wrong, back to the question they got wrong. Students can do the Lessons as many times as they want. Now that some 80 students have done both these lessons, I notice that there is a problem with the scoring for Lesson 2: many students get 100%, however some students appear to have all the answers correct but are only getting 44.44%. All the questions are equally weighted (i.e. custom scoring has not been used). Lesson 1 contains only 'Multiple Choice - Multianswer' type questions, whereas the Lesson with the total score problem contains one 'Multiple Choice' and one Matching type question, and six 'Multiple Choice - Multianswer' type questions. Another difference difference between the two lessons is that one of the 'Multiple Choice - Multianswer' type questions in Lesson 2 has no incorrect answer. My intention was that students have to recognise that all 7 of the choices are correct, and so select all 7 of the choices in order to move to the next question. Could the lack of a wrong choice in this question be the cause? Or could there be another reason why some students getting all the questions right, are only getting 44.44%? And yes, students that are not getting all the questions right are getting correspondingly varied and expected scores.",

Following up on Dr.'s question and point, if your Lesson setting \"handling of retakes\" is set to mean instead of max, then a student who re entered the lesson could never get 100%, if they missed a question on one of their earlier attempts. Oh yes, I have quickly glanced at the logs and assumed that the student took it once. Then realized that while I had correctly set the max attempts at any question to 1 and allowed retakes, my site default is to use the mean and....I forgot to switch it to max. My spreadsheet says 4/9 or 8/18 = 44.44% which might also have me looking at my lesson settings, perhaps max score combined with the mean might give a student a 44%. Then there is the back arrow on the browser that some of my students love to use. That is why I only give them one attempt on an important set of lesson questions. Our message: 'you don't pass the lesson, that is OK but you take the whole lesson over again, so give each question some careful thought the first time, thank you very much.' As soon as they record their answer and leave that screen, Moodle records it. Don't know if that helps or not. Best",

And while there are not a lot of pages, they do some interesting things. Much to my surprise, the branches are the Oh My. My working assumption is when an End of Branch (EB) is used in the logical order, it creates what I call a classic branch. The classic branch ends at the End of Branch. Where it starts actually depends upon several factors that are not clear to me. (There is no equal to the Start Cluster.) Add to the start confusion, my obvious ignorance of how the jumps should be set to achieve a consistent result. I think I am going to have to KISS and use two examples of the classic branch. One using Questions and the other using Branch Tables. How to turn a simple branch, into a classic branch that will select an unseen question.

Result: fatal php error about timing (ok, catched) and another fatal error about availibilty of said lesson, also catched. I could test the lesson if it is online. That doesn't make sense: testing for production must be offline for students. 2) may be I'm wrong: adding up the points given in questions is not correct. For example: 2 questions, both 1 --> shown is plus 1 to students 3) There is no hint to the total amount auf points, this may be related to 2) 4) some times there is a HTML editor, some times not. Page layout follows the same rules: after 2-3 times editing there is a paragraph i.e. <p> visible in the output, otherwise answers will stick directly to the checkbox. 5) the advance shown in lessons to students doesn't make any sense for me. Starting with 28% on sheet 1/20? Going to 33% on sheet 2 ?? 6) no more Regular Expressions at all. Good, doesn't work in 2.3. Maybe I'm just a bit spoiled by the excellent work in quiz / tests.

This may have some indirect impacts on Lesson. While I am not into the Moodle code, I found it interesting. For the adventuresome, take a look at the OpenMark (Open University) link he put in to show some adaptive feedbacks potentials. This is somewhat different from the adaptive model used by Lesson, which is similar to an adaptive (testing) process . The OpenMark example has different feedbacks based upon the student choice and the number of the attempt. Lesson can give different feedbacks based upon the choice made in a question. Lesson's adaptive nature comes from the jumps, that can send the student to another page after they receive feedback. Hard to say, but it looks like this does not happen in the OpenMark example. In short, I do not think it is going to replace Lesson. Best Chris",

So far I have this command : SELECT instance, lessonid, title, course, prevpageid, nextpageid FROM mdl_course_modules JOIN mdl_lesson_pages ON mdl_course_modules.instance = mdl_lesson_pages.lessonid WHERE (`contents` LIKE '%/AsbAware_files/%') ORDER BY course LIMIT 0 , 300 this outputs the following : instance lessonid title course prevpageid nextpageid 1374 1374 1.3 The three main types of asbestos 60 60521 60523 1375 1375 2.1.2.4 The Asbestos legacy IS a Major Problem! 60 60526 60528 1375 1375 2.2    Medical Examinations 60 60527 60529 1375 1375 2.4 What are the risks? 60 60529 60531 1376 1376 3.1 examples of asbestos in buildings 60 60532 60534 1376 1376 3.2 Examples of Asbestos-Containing Materials 60 60533 60535 1377 1377 4.0 What to do if you uncover Asbestos 60 0 60537 1377 1377 4.2 Example Asbestos Management Policy (Cont.) 60 60537 60539 1378 1378 5.4 Preventing or reducing exposure (regulation 11... 60 60543 60545 1378 1378 6.1 Supporting Guidance 60 60546 60548 1378 1378 6.2 Further Examples of Asbestos (Cont.) 60 60547 60549 1378 1378 6.2 Further Examples of Asbestos (Cont.) 60 60548 60550 1378 1378 6.2 Further Examples of Asbestos (Cont.) 60 60549 60551 1378 1378 6.2 Further Examples of Asbestos (Cont.) 60 60550 60552 1378 1378 6.2 Further Examples of Asbestos (Cont.) 60 60551 60553 But as you can see this doesn't output the ID from the mdl_lesson_pages table. I can't quite work out how to output the ID field (from either table as they are ambiguous) I was hoping some kind sole would help me out here, this is driving me barmy! I have hundreds of pages where I need to locate certain strings, to do this manually is a knightmare with the lesson module as the ID's don't corresponde. The lessonid & instance are the matching fields from the two tables. Much appreciated for any assistance!! P.S. Why the lesson module built this way I will never know, doesn't make much sense to me...

There is a feature of web pages that is frequently imposed upon the html code although I think it can be implemented in html as well, that allows one to display an image (not just part of it) in a web page and impose a map, that is, a partitioning of it, such that the viewer can move his/her mouse over the image and click, and depending on which part of the image is clicked, a different link is activated. I suspect that's what he's talking about. Just some food for thought while we wait for his response. RLE",

When a student misses Q1 they go to B5 for a review then back to Q1. When they get Q1 right, they move to next page . Similar with Q2, which jumps to B6. The B4 is the navigational end of the lesson. It's one jump goes to end of lesson. I logged into the lesson as a student. I missed the q1 4 times and got caught in a loop.

The course consists of a lesson with an essay question. In the original location (also 1.9.7), users have responded to this question and the instructor has provided them with feedback and a score. The backup should contain this data. After restoring the course to the new server , the scores are listed but not the users' resopnses or the instructor's feedback. I have tried the following: Restoring the original backup to a different course ID Backing up just the lesson on the original server and restoring it to the course on the new instance Backing up the question on the new instance and restoring it to the same course None of these seem to bring over the responses and feedback. Whats also strange is that the original backups seem to contain the feedback - it is just not getting restored properly. I can see the feedback in the \"moodle. xml \" file. My guess is that there is a problem with one of the submissions that is interfering with the restore process. There are some %'s in the responses, but I would think Moodle could figure that out. Does anyone have anything to share about this problem? Thank you",

          "Text": "I have an update to this that might be useful. I checked into the database and verified that the data was carried over, but it was not getting displayed in Moodle for some reason. This may only apply to essay questions, but I think I found 2 things that could have been causing this. Specifically, I was looking at the \"useranswer\" field in the \"lesson_attempts\" table. I understand this field is created by nesting a call to PHP's \"serialize\" function inside the \"addslashes\" function. For essay questions, the object that gets serialized includes both the student's reponse and the instructors feedback. First, I noticed that the serialized form looks something like this: s:X:\"RESPONSE HERE\" Where (I'm guessing that) \"s:\" indicates a string data type, \"X:\" is the length of the string, and RESPONSE HERE is whatever the user typed. I could not determine if X is based on bytes or characters, but I verified that for a simple string like \"test\", X needs to be exactly 4. More or less and none of the text gets rendered into Moodle. Later, I noticed that some of the text brought over from the old system had EOL's encoded as \"\\n\" and others as \"\\r\\n\". I also noticed that those encoded as \"\\n\" were the ones not getting displayed properly. To fix this, I did a search and replace in these rows for \"\\n\", replacing with \"\\r\\n\". Now everything is fine. What I am not sure about is why this happened. Both the old and new servers are running in Linux, so I don't think this has to do with Windows newlines. I suspect it is related to the way PHP is serializing this data and then adding slashes. Could it be that this is messing up the \"X\" number in the serialized form? Does anyone have any insight to this - or how to prevent it from happening? Apparently, the versions of our two Moodle instances are different. This backup came from Moodle 1.9.5 and was restored to 1.9.7. I don't know if that makes a difference. Anyway, my problem is solved, but I would be curious if anyone knows why this happened in case it comes up again.",

Unfortunately the lesson overview report (and also the lesson detailed report) suffer from some bugs and depending if the lesson is made only of content pages, of a content/question pages mix or only of question pages, the behavior of this report is very different and in some cases nothing is displayed. This is a bug (see MDL-49429 , MDL-48881 , MDL-35396 , MDL-27554 , for various issues affecting lesson reports). Additionally lesson reports are completely unaware of the activity completion system, IMHO this is not a bug, quiz reports also don't show the completion status of students attempts. But if you can give precise examples where you think the completion status is incorrectly reported (reported not completed and in fact it should show completed for instance) please post additional details so that I can investigate the problem.",

It looks like the issues you listed (particularly https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-48881 and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-49429 ) are the issues I'm facing. With 'content-only' Lessons. I agree, it's not a bug if the Activity Completion reports are not aware of the Lesson specific overview. I will wait until we've done the upgrade, see if anything changes and, if not, put a couple of questions in my Lesson to see if that does the trick! Thanks again. Catherine",

I have a very annoying problem with getting answers from students in either essays or short answer fields. Some of the questions, either essays or short answers require students to type code. Let's take C++ as an example. It uses << insertion, and >> extraction operators. I could ask a question to a student tha requires him/her to type something like: cout << \"Hello, World\"; The problem is that somehow the HTML editor fiters the user input and recognizes the << as an unfinished tag. As a result, the student answer would be truncated as: cout Is there any setting I can use to turn off HTML filtering from the student's answers so that anything they type is not changed?",

I looked into the code of mod/lesson/actions/continue.php and found that it uses a the deprecated PARAM_CLEAN, so I changed it to PARAM_RAW. That solves the problem, but only half way. The students are now able to write the insertion operator (i.e., << ) in the answers and see it display in the response window, but they are not saved in the database because when the teacher tries to grade the essays all of the students answers have dissappeared. I wish I had a UML diagram or something where I could see the Moodle code and what it is doing instead of having to guess and hack my own code.

          "Text": "I'd like to use an iframe to display an html5 presentation created in iSpring 8.0. We are using Moodle 3.2, adaptable theme. Publishing as HTML5 creates a folder of files, setting the main file to the index makes the presentation display fine on a file resource activity in Moodle. However, I'd like to have students view it in a Lesson so that we can time their involvement for completion. I tried using the file activity URL however, I get the entire website page. Would it work to find the index page in the repository and link to that URL? Other ideas? I've seen mention of adding a block to the page, but I am unclear which block. There are services available to host the files elsewhere, which generates an embed code --- but I thought there might be a way to do it within Moodle itself. Right now Scorm is not an option for us as it produces error messages for some users that the internet connection is lost. Thank you.",

The reason for limiting the new features is because the code needed a chance to mature.  Also, there is a planned overhaul detailed here: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Adding_question_types_to_lesson .  This overhaul will essentially require the module to be rewritten from the ground up.  So, to make this process easier, I'm limiting the number of new features and I'm improving the code base to make it easier to upgrade. These recent changes are rather large so please test the Lesson code in 1.7 so we can have a smooth release.  Moodle 1.7 has a planned release date of October 9th and I'm planning to spend time on my weekends to help stabilize the code. If you find bugs, please post them in the bug tracker.  I created a filter to view all open Lesson bugs to make it easier to help.  You can view the filter here: http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10076 Cheers and happy Moodling, Mark",

First, a hearty thanks for this very nifty module!  I've been developing some math related content with it and I make quite a bit of use of the \"numeric\" question format.  I ran into some difficulties with using answer ranges and finally figured out the problem.  The html editor is introducing html into my numeric responses.  Thus when I think I've put in something like \"1.3:1.4\" I've really put in \"<p>1.3:1.4</p>\"  PHP evaluates <p>1.3 as 0 (rather than 1.3) when converting to a float.  I've introduced the strip_tags function in my lessson.php file to resolve the issue: case LESSON_NUMERICAL : // set defaults $response = ''; $newpageid = 0; if (!$useranswer = floatval(strip_tags($_POST['answer']))) { $noanswer = true; break; } and just below: foreach ($answers as $answer) { if (strpos($answer->answer, ':')) { // there's a pairs of values list($min, $max) = explode(':', strip_tags($answer->answer)); $minimum = floatval($min); $maximum = floatval($max); } else { --Rudy",

Then I can provide different feedback in text if score is 10 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30. Am trying to replicate like a personality test you can do. So depending on answers  the person will be of different character I need to tell them what they are like. Hope you know what I mean.

          "Text": "Hi Laurie, So for example, like personality tests, ask questions that answers have\nscore of 1, 2 or 3. If there were 10 questions you would score minimum\n10 or maximum 30. Then I can provide different feedback in text if\nscore is 10 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30. This is more advanced conditional branching than what the Lesson module can offer at this point.  An idea is to have branching based on points earned or by reaching specific pages.  This way one could structure Lessons like adventure stories or like your example, personality tests. a) Remove the confirmation page after answering a question (this is pointless) This is becoming a more and more requested feature.  Perhaps once HEAD settles down a bit we can get a few new Lesson features in there. Cheers, Mark",

          "Text": "Hi Mark Thanks for the reply. In fact I think what you think I meant is more advanced that what I actually am after. At the moment, a user can answer lesson questions, each with different points. Then at the end it displays the users score. But in addition to the score It would be good if it could display some pre-entered text for the result. At the moment I can only acheive this with a HTML page following the lesson displaying the score ranges and what they mean, but it would be good if instead of that the system would know which set of results the user socred in and display only that feedback. So basically its like the feedback you get at the end of every question, but instead of here you have it at the end of the lesson, and the feedback varies depending upon the final score. I would have thought it quite a common/useful requirement to have an automated feedback at end of test. P.S. I can even make the HTML page after the lesson appear automatically after the lesson finishes. Ther user has to click on the next HTML page. I would have thought the system should proceed to the next resource automatically! Thanks Laurie",

Having a message after a lesson, so an 75% score on questions might say, \"Well you technically passed, but I suggest you hit the  suggested reading books because this area could be a problem for you on THE FINAL\". Mark tends to be a forward thinker.  What is that called Mark, conditional learning?  If you score 100% on Lesson 1 or PreQuiz, you skip the basics review in the next 3 topics, and get right to the new material. Then there is the personality testing kind of scoring.  50 matching questions with 4 answers (most, least, not selected, not selected).  That gives me a headache just thinking about it, but not Mark!",

When students left a lesson early, it consistently returned them to the first page of the lesson, even though they wanted to see the last page they had seen AND had entered correct answers.  I tested this myself.  They lost all of their work every time unless they worked through to completion. 2.  In grading, even though the lesson has several ungraded essays, it shows that everyone has 100%.  It saved my comments but not the score. When I go back in, it shows as 0. 3.  In 1.9, when i graded an essay it would turn from red to green in the list, this doesn't show any difference. I have it set as a grade of 20, custom scoring, not a practice lesson, no student review, no retakes.  I've played with other settings, allowing student review, allowing progress bar,e tc, but nothing made a difference when i tested it with my student account.",

Background: We have set up a number of \"self-paced\" lessons that a students must work through in a course.  For example, the lesson may be several imported PPT slides, then a 2 short answer questions, more slides, then 3 more questions. The questions are \"auto-graded\" (i.e. we have the accepted answer as *), so that when a student completes this lesson (assuming they provided something), they get 100% (5/5, etc.).   Students are \"truly\" assessed on other work, this is just a way of making sure they complete the lessons. Issue: Need a way to automatically email these 5 questions (question + what student wrote) to the instructor once the student completes each lesson. The format I need actually is EXACTLY what student's receive in \"email student responses\" if an an instructor grades an essay question (in a Lesson) and elects to email the results to students. Anyway to get that flipped to emailing instructors once a student completes a lesson?",

The result should be a htm file and a folder with all of the slides converted to web pages. ZIP THE FOLDER only. 3. Go to your moodle site and add a new lesson. 4. After saving the lesson settings you should see four options under \"What would you like to do first?\" Click on \"Import PowerPoint\" 5. Use to the \"Browse...\" button to find your zip file from step 2. Then click on \"Upload this file\". 6. If everything worked, the next screen should just display a continue button. Notes: 1.Complicated presentations with animations, transitions and graphic effects can not be imported correctly. Text presentations with simple graphic images works best. Alternatively, converting your PowerPoint presentation to Flash with SCORM /AICC compliance and then upload the lesson to Moodle would be a good way. It can keep the animations, transitions of the PowerPoint. There are some PowerPoint to Flash converters could help you, such as Adobe Presenter, Articulate Presenter and Wondershare PPT2Flash Professional . Hope it helps!",

I can fix this by going into the last page in each lesson, editing the lesson, and adding text for the button into \"Description*\" under \"Content 1\" and changing the dropdown menu to \"End of Lesson\" or \"Next page.\" However, I do not want to do this for 30 some lessons in one course alone! In Moodle 1.9, if you didn't write anything in the equivalent of the \"Description*\" box, it assumed that the button should say \"Continue\" and it should go to \"Next Page.\" Why has this assumption been removed? It was perfectly reasonable. Now I have to go through every page in every lesson and change them to \"Next Page\" and label the button \"Continue\"? And in the process change the formatting of every page from what I want to some random formatting (See the second forum link above)? Oi! 1.- If your lesson does not end in a Question Page, what kind of page does it end with, then? I suppose it ends in a Content page. What did you put in the Jump field of that last page? If it's the last page of your lesson, you should put Jump:  \" End of Lesson \". Can you please check and report? 2.- The \"More information about this error\" links in Moodle are a pretty new feature, and a large number of links have not been written in the Documentation Wiki yet. 3.- I agree that the migration process should automatically fill in the Description field with \"Continue\" and its Jump field with \"Next page\". That has been overlooked in the migration scripts somewhere. After further testing and confirmation by other people in this forum, I will post to the bug tracker the necessary information. Joseph",

However, we have both agreed that if no selection is made in the jump field of a content page that \"Next Page\" is a safe assumption, with button text as \"Continue.\" A linear path through a lesson, I would think, would be the rule rather than the exception. Furthermore, the error that's arisen here is fixed by either changing the jump field to \"Next Page\" OR \"End of Lesson.\" That tells me that Moodle STILL looks for a \"next page\" and if it doesn't find one, takes you to \"End of Lesson.\" In other words, if the 'next page as default' assumption --which, again, we've agreed is a good thing -- is returned, then this end of lesson problem will be fixed as well. That is, provided the updater / installer will adjust all of my lessons for me. If not, then I'm stuck changing them manually ANYWAY. I still think it's annoying enough that it should be fixed, whether it's just for new lessons or all of them. (What I mean by that is the default in the pull down menu for the first jump field (the required one), right now, is \"This Page.\" Why would that be the default? And why would I have to type \"Continue\" into every page to fill that button? If I never saw it any other way, maybe I wouldn't complain, but the functionality WAS there, you know?)",

          "Text": "Hi Dane, Excellent post. I think one of the issues with Lesson is the purpose of a Lesson or that it's mission needs to be tightened. My sense is that due to popular demand, many things were added to Lesson at a time when Moodle was not as robust. I also believe that Lesson is used in many sites for different purposes, which at times means cross purposes. To sort the cross purposes (for example, I want to see Question titles on left along with Branch table titles, or I want to see some but not all page titles on the left), means changing settings and adding more variables to the module, or dividing the module up into similiar but different ones. Lesson can present pages in a adaptive manner. I suspect this is why the first standard module to have a conditional dependency built in was Lesson. In Version 2, when conditional dependency starts to become a Moodle feature in many/all standard modules, we may start to see a change in Lesson. Lessons may become shorter and perhaps more numerous with Moodle conditional dependency. First conditional dependency of modules and resources within a course, will probably build demand for site dependencies of the nested if, then type conditions. Now we are really talking about adaptive (and complex) learning. I think one of the next logical development steps in Lesson is to be able to export and import any Lesson page(s). First to be able to import specific pages into another lesson, then to be able to import specific pages into other modules and import pages from other modules into Lesson. Just one example concerns Lesson being able to have access to the Question Bank. Exciting stuff, in short Lesson has a lot of different possible looks. Perhaps Lesson needs to be broken up into more specific modules. Right now, there is nothing else like a Lesson :} Best Chris",

I think I was expecting a lesson to fulfill all my course needs but obviously it doesn't (yet). So, I have decided not to use the lesson format at all now and will use a combination of web pages and quizzes. I'm also looking into Hot Potato quizzes which look very interesting and can easily (it seems) be used in Moodle. I'm also developing self contained mini websites that can be part of a web page with (hopefully) a Hot pot(s) below it. See how this goes. Anyway, thanks again - very interesting. Cheers - Dane",

A1, A2 and A3 would be branch pages liking to C1 ... as appropriate. The question is, when people have looked at their first relevant concept, how do they get back to their correct page A1, 2 or 3? They should not be concerned with concepts their areas do not cover. I'm sure there is a simple answer!

Even if the duplicate pages have exactly the same content, I give them similar but different page titles. Alternatively, you can always put multiple jumps at the end of the end of a concept in a branch table with different lables. Such as \"Go to A1\", \"Go to A2\", \"Go to Concept 3\", \"End the Lesson\", \"Go to TOC (1st page)\" or what ever. Here you let your students use their intelligence to get to where they want. As stated elsewhere it is always a good idea to give the student a way to start all over again without exiting the lesson. My tip would be one I recently relearned from an old pro: draw it out on paper with boxes and lines. You do not need to create a box for each page, but (in your example) create one for each area and one for each concept. Draw lines to connect them and one way arrows to indicate jumps. Chris",

I would like to know if I have missed something with the following, which have been fed back to me from the tutor: It is difficult for students to see their results at the end of the lesson before the page redirects. When they go to the gradebook to review their score they cannot review attempts. Clicking the score takes you to a new attempt not the overview of the previous attempt. When custom scoring is set to yes I can set individual question scores but not a maximum score so I end up with a score of 11 out of 0, which returns 0% instead of 100%. Reverting to non-custom scoring I get 9 out of 9, which returns the correct percentage. I have set each question to return to the same question page if the student guesses the wrong answer, so that they must try again until they get it right. However, scoring only records the first guess so that if you got a question right on the 2nd attempt it would receive a 0 score, instead of 1 for correct, which we would prefer. Yours James",

          "Text": "Hey everyone, I have burned some brain cells on this off and on for the last few days. Although Moodle has a built in player, I wanted my traditional player, the FLV Player . Due to the Tiny editor, my code would always get messed up, and in a week I will not be the guy who would be doing these lessons. So I had to be able to give this program over to a person that has minimal experience with Moodles use. It has to be close to cut and paste. I am far from a Moodle expert! It suddenly hit me, if the editor is messing up the FLV's call to the swfobject.js file, then put that line of code outside the editor. So I dumped it into the header.php file in my theme directory. In the root directory (with the moodle directory list) I created a js directory. In there I put swfobject.js and player.swf. More for neatness then necessity. As an example... \n```text\nedit header.php and put this script line in above the closing </head>\n...\n<script type=\"text/\njavascript\n\" src=\"js/swfobject.js\"></script>\n...\n\nThen anywhere in the page I wanted the mp3 player, I opened the HTML view and pasted my actual code.\n\n<embed\nwidth=\"300\"\nheight=\"20\"\nsrc=\"js/player.swf\"\nallowscriptaccess=\"always\"\nallowfullscreen=\"true\"\nflashvars=\"file=/audio/yourMP3file.mp3&autostart=true\"\n/>\n```\n This will work for flash movies or mp3. For movies you will have to change the height to at least 300 =-). I tried a number of the other players and I just really like the FLV Player and it's community. My company has a licence with the FLV developers but they do have a watermarked free version. There are some issues, if you run multiple players on a single page you will have to head over to the documentation and again the editor may cause some heartache. When you load the page with all the lessons on it, and you have the player set to autoplay, the page will take a while to load. To remove the auto play feature remove \"&autostart=true\".",

The Lesson tool is working very well for this and we are getting very positive student feedback (so, thanks!) The student responses are mostly Essays, which are graded by volunteer tutors. We have 30 tutors, each with approx 12 students' work to mark. The Grade Essay page shows the student submissions in date order, earliest to latest. This is causing problems for our tutors as they are having to pick out their students from a very long list. Is it possible to change the sorting order to be alphabetical by student surname, so that the tutors could more quickly find their students from within the list? Also just wondered if there is a reason for not being able to use groups - it would be handy in this case but the above would be nearly as good. Many thanks for any help you can give,",

The page works by building an array of links - so it seemed easiest to just sort that before displaying it to the page. The hack is shown below - it looks at the link and extracts the last word in it which it assumes to be the surname - then sorts by that. As I said - it's a last minute hack. I'm still kind of new to Moodle - so there may be a nicer Moodle way to do it with existing library functions - in which case I welcome your input - but as a quick and dirty fix this certainly works. It goes around line 300 or so just before print_table. /* * hack - two functions to process the $data array in the $table to allow sorting by lastname */ function ucl_stripname($n) { // this extracts the lastname from the link string $la=explode('</a>',$n); $fullname=trim($la[1]); $fa=explode(' ',$fullname); $nc = count($fa); if ($fa[$nc-1]<>'') { $lastname=$fa[$nc-1]; } else { $lastname=$fullname; //just in case there's no space in their name } return $lastname; } function ucl_compare_lastname($a, $b) { // custom sort return strnatcmp(ucl_stripname($a[0]), ucl_stripname($b[0])); } # sort alphabetically by lastname usort($table->data, 'ucl_compare_lastname'); /* * end of hack! */ Hope this is of use.

I see that one way to get around this is to make each of my topics a separate \"course.\"  But conceptually, they aren't really courses, they're just part of one course. So what I'm wondering is how to do one of the following? 1) Put a glossary inside of a topic instead of making it it's own. or 2) Customize the numbering so that, for example, the glossary can be \"topic 2a\" and then the next topic would be \"topic 2b\" so that the one after that comes out as topic \"3\" instead of being \"4.\" PS - If I go ahead and make my topics into separate \"courses\" but use the automatic linking feature in the glossary, presumably that won't work, right?  ... As I would expect that the glossary's automatic linking of terms would only work within the course....",

I know that users can use the breadcrumb, but I avoid it if all possible, and I can also just add the link myself, but I think it would look really nice to be able to add a branchpage with two options, return (to course page) and continue. The scenario is that I have users work through the first part of a lesson, then they return to the course homepage to do other things (post to discussion, take a quiz, do an offline type of assignment etc.). Then, they return to the lesson and continue with questions regarding what they have done. Thanks much--the Lesson Module has come a long way thanks to you Humboldt guys.",

Two options: Well, in case of the MOODLE 1.9, in the lesson there is a dependency option where you can define what you want. You can use it if you set all the 4 essay subsections as 4 different lessons, each dependent on the former grade lesson. The other option is to set the menu to show only if the grade is better than a value (you can do this in the lesson configuration), and the essay will appear only in the menu (see note 1). Of course you have to choose the path of your lesson in order that the student doesn't found the essay with the buttons. I suggest that you use a map to design your lesson: cmap tools can help. I hope this is helpfull. Good work. António note 1: you must notice that the essay questions doesn't appear in the menu, but if you put a branch table called \"essay question\" and choose the button to go to that question...",

This should - of course - be communicated back to moodle. It should be usable and evaluateable just like e.g. a multiple choice question in Lesson (and maybe test). The question is: Where to start? Any recommendation which question-type I could use as a sort of \"template\"? So far (i just started this morning) my plan is as following: Change one of the not needed old question-types (probably easier than creating a new one, or?). Make it supply div/canvas and include libraries for image manipulation/animation etc.. Then write a Javascript function that communicates back to moodle, when the task has been finished or timed out or whatever. The actual individual script for each of these tasks could be just written in a textfield. As I am not yet really into all of this, any feedback is very welcome. What is already possible? Similar Attempts? Limitations? Ideas?",

Duplicating a Lesson in a course can be done. The standard trick I use is to do a backup of just the lesson, then restore it and move it to where I want in my course. There is also the import function in the course admin block which does something similar (I am old Moodle so I don't use this feature that cuts out a few steps). You probably don't want student info nor course files, but that is a decision you will make. If I knew I would be using several copies of a lesson format, I would create a template from an existing lesson, so I didn't have to delete lots of lesson specific content. I would check out placing these in a hidden course, or saving the backups on my local computer. Hope this helps. Chris",

Which stylesheet do I edit, and what is the correct \nCSS\n code to change the colors?\nI'd like to use #007EBA (blue) for Correct, and #CC3300 (red) for incorrect, as per the theme I have.\n\nI am hoping that stylesheets will be a big time saver, vis a vis marking up each response in the editor.\n\nI am running Moodle 1.9.7 with the afterburner theme.\n```\n Thanks, Will",

          "Title": "Lesson activity questions so limited for teaching languages",
          "Text": "Hello Recently I have started to make lessons for teaching English language. Using lesson activity, I have come to notice that I can only add a single question in a separate page after I have presented some material first as content pages. This is a huge limitation in itself for teaching English language. I mean, teaching languages often requires introducing new subjects (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation ,etc)  by constantly engaging learners with short questions (especially in form of cloze tests) which can appear everywhere during a lesson and not necessarily at the end. You simply do not feed your students with some content first and test their understanding of it later at the end with a reading passage and questions of some type related to it. Of course, that's not the only problem. When, for instance, we speak of the short answer question type which is somehow similar to a cloze test - a format available in quizzes but not so in lesson activity - we have to provide a question of a certain length first with one \"short answer\" for the whole question. This can probably be good for such fields of study as Mathematics, Physics, and so on, but not for teaching languages, where you might provide a passage with several blanks which have to be filled up by students. And sometimes, you provide several of such questions in the same page which is again not possible to do so in a lesson activity question page (i.e. you can have one question per page). I really would like to use Moodle for language teaching especially due to its various other powerful user-friendly capabilities, but I am somehow at my wit's end in coping with the above-mentioned problem. Please do let me know if I have overlooked a feature already available in Moodle which does the same thing in a lesson activity or if you have overcome this shortcoming one way or another. I would really appreciate it. Regards",

          "Text": "Hi Saeed, For the scenario you are describing, you could actually use a quiz to overcome the lesson shortcomings, if you set it up right. Set the quiz up so that it does NOT shuffle the question order. It IS okay for multiple choice questions to shuffle their answers, though. Place all of your newly introduced information in Descriptions. They are listed under OTHER when choosing a question type to add/create. Follow each of the \"Description\" questions with as many regular quiz questions as you need, on a page of the quiz. Start another page in your quiz with another \"Description.\" Follow with more questions. Manually insert descriptions and questions in the order you need, with page breaks when needed. Repeat until you have covered the \"Lesson.\" Like the Lesson module, doing it this way, everything except essay type questions will be automatically graded when the student submits for grading at the end of the quiz. Doing it this way has the advantage of letting you use ALL of the types of questions available for the quiz module, including addon questions types, such as the PoodLL one that is capable of audio or video or whiteboard, plus others such as gap- fill, drag and drop, etc. They are great  for teaching correct grammar and punctuation. To me, the only downside I see when doing a \"Lesson\" this way, is you will have to put up with question numbers, which you would not normally see when using the Lesson activity, but students soon get used to them and ignore them. Another point that may or may not apply to your situation, is that you can also set the quiz navigation up so that they cannot skip ahead or go back, if you so desire. Using the quiz this way, you can actually set up a small question bank of various questions to go along with ONE \"Description\", then create a a quiz that has the \"Description\" first, then is followed by a few randomly selected questions to reinforce the material presented in the \"Description.\" Each student gets a different experience each time they do the quiz.

It seems I do not have any luck with lessons activity then, so I have to opt for the quiz solution and design my lessons the way you have kindly explained. The limitation is saddening, though, to me. I wonder if there is a chance we can witness more flexibility in respect with lesson question types in future Moodle versions. Do you know where we can request this? Regards Saeed",

When i check the lesson as administrator this works fine. As i login as guest, it also works fine. But when i login with my student-account, every jump is to the next page, no matter if my answer is right or wrong. I could not find this as a known problem. (for what my searching is worth). I do not tend to believe it is a problem with my installation/ server . Is this problem known to be fixed in 1.6, or are there other workarounds known ? Rob (rgra)",
