Virtualbox , works with both Windows and Mac. I recall it was fairly easy to use (for me) and it could run in a modest harware VMWare , which might be intimidating for a newbee Hyper-V , which is a Microsoft package, is Windows only.

It is called 'Mountain Moot', which was held for three days in July 2025. Emma Richardson , a Moodle administrator and trainer from a school district in Colorado, has invited Joe Thibault and Claire Kruse to present with her about the “Best of Mountain Moot\". This is not a webinar, so turn your cameras on, bring a smile, and join in the active discussion. We will have three discussions, after each presenter. It is not being recorded, so don’t miss the actual face-to-face event. BBB Meeting Link: https://moodle.org/mod/bigbluebuttonbn/view.php?id=8821 Opens ten minutes before 1:00pm UTC. All are welcome, but you may need to enroll in Moodle.org first. And mark your calendars for the future community meetings on the fourth Tuesday of the month. The Third Community Meeting will be hosted by Thomas Neidemeier or Marcus Green. Organized by Harald Schnurbusch, Don Hinkelman, Thomas Neidemeier, Marcus Green, Paul Raper, and Moodle community members across the globe.  This meeting will be in English, but we are open to organizing meetings in other languages as well. ————————————",

          "Text": "Hi Guys Spent time this evening trying to overcome this issue. On the notification page when clicking on check for available updates causes this error:- Unable to fetch available updates data - unexpected HTTP response code. I have checked with the host for any DNS issues and they have checked (Hostinger my provider) and they have said that updates.moodle.org is down. They even ran a check at the following and confirmed it was down:- https://testlocal.ly/tests/687034773ef2e183790fbedc However, just wanted to check if this is actually down or is it something that I am seeing only. They have assured me that it is moodle's website and that is why I am getting this error. I have never known Moodle to be down. I even created a php file in my root for a Curltest with the following:- `<?php` `$urls = [` \n```text\n    '\nhttps://download.moodle.org\n',\n```\n \n```text\n    '\nhttps://updates.moodle.org\n'\n```\n `];` `foreach ($urls as $url) {` `echo \"Testing $url ...<br>\";` `$ch = curl_init($url);` `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);` `curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10);` `curl_exec($ch);` `if(curl_errno($ch)) {` `echo \"❌ cURL error: \" . curl_error($ch) . \"<br>\";` `} else {` This then returns the following:- Testing https://download.moodle.org ... ✅ Connection successful Testing https://updates.moodle.org ... ❌ cURL error: Could not resolve host: updates.moodle.org Am i missing something or is moodle updates link down, did try searching but nothing to confirm. I have just updated to Moodle 5.0.1+ (Build: 20250706) but had to manually upload each update as none of the install links would work as part of the upgrade. If anyone can shed any light on this it would be appreciated. Thanks again.",

Found them too (can't remember how): Re: Off-the-grid Moodle sites which are capable of syncing with the mother-site?

          "Text": "Hi Mary Thanks for immediate response - here and the Moodle Academy forum! In fact, the specific case was no so important. Two out of the three enquiries I've answered myself. You answered the third one in negation. But that one is a misunderstanding, I'm afraid. I was looking for the course template, that was shown in the second quarter of the presentation, not a full course. It demonstrated the use of the onetopic format, Font Awesome and some CSS . Just for a slow look, I will done my content from scratch anyway. But don't trouble the presenter, I can recreate them in very short time, when needed. Still I made it a point to enroll for a course on UIL's Learning Hub. The course Digital Competencies for Literacy Educators is somehow not open for self-enrollment. Applied for that. The general, more important, question was whether the Moodle Academy courses are actively monitored, guided. I was surprised that the answer was No. In our community courses we accompany them a long time.. not only it gives the participants time to really understand but also all sorts of collaborations outside the course itself happen. But again, we have a local, limited crowd, you have global, unlimited crowd. Thus, understandable.",

Is the website not able to connect to the Moodle site registration servers? SELECT * FROM mdl_registration_hubs returns one row with a token and secret and with the confirmed column = 1. When I go to the Registration page in Site Administration in my site I can see my existing site registration details. Pressing the Update Registration button throws another error: \"An error occurred during registration update (hub/errorconnect)\" My Moodle site is in a DMZ and it's internet facing. I use links in my courses to other sites like youtube.com and none of those sites are blocked. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=428318 suggests registering and unregistering my site, but the hub/errorconnect error prevents that. What does the \\core\\task\\registration_cron_task Scheduled task do? Does it check my Moodle site version every time it runs? Lastly, could it be my firewall that's blocking the connection to the Moodle registration server ?",

I've always struggled with viewing the daily digest emails on the iPhone default email program if there are images in the threads, or if a user has too many badges (though way to go for users with multiple badges haha). Even in Gmail on the iPhone, forum digests don't look so good -- all the text is super tiny as if I'm looking at the digest up from up top a ladder... I did however find it easy to use the forums (well, the Moodle.org forums anyways) since there have been many style updates to prevent the threads from getting so narrow & long, and the multiple badges don't take up half the screen width anymore. Though, forums with deep-level threads still get very narrow eventually and sometimes I find swiping down the screen ends up really shifting the screen left/right as if there is some invisible scrolling, but I tossed that up to being an iphone safari quirk, but maybe it's a design issue consideration..",

Some of them I'm finding more challenging then others, and would love a breakdown of how to complete. This would also help link ideas/implicit connections. For example, the task \"Read the input parameter value\" feels very difficult to do in Moodle (compared to vanilla html/php) because it seems to require using the forms API, which is not covered in the course at this point...

I went through the three documents (if one counts /en/XX/ as one) again and fundamentally agree on your stand. To be specific: 1. Site administration > Development > Make test course Yes, this is independent of JMeter. Therefore the right document is https://docs.moodle.org/en/Test_course_generator . I will _move_ the content of https://docs.moodle.org/dev/JMeter#Make_test_course to https://docs.moodle.org/en/Test_course_generator and will link https://docs.moodle.org/dev/JMeter#Make_test_course to https://docs.moodle.org/en/Test_course_generator . 2. Site administration > Development > Make JMeter test plan P.S. Since we are at this topic, could you have a look at this enquiry: How are JMeter test courses and test plans are related? https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=423923#p1707636 . Now I know, those to are not directly related. Still the test course generator creates courses with (1, 100, 1 000, 10 000, 50 000, 100 000) users enrolled. The JMeter test plan generator generates plans for courses of (1, 30, 100, 1 000, 5 000, 10 000) users.",

It is a great course and the fact that I can get a free certificate at the end of the course is even more awesome. I am also enrolled in Moodle Admin basics and Moodle Teaching basics. However, the certification is not free. I have sat in the week one Bluebutton session where it was explained that the course for Moodle 3.9 after this Teaching will also go to the same as Moodle Admin basics and Moodle Teaching in the case of the certification. Which is fine I am confident I will complete in time to get the certification. I would like to get the certification for the other two also. Will there be another teaching on those subjects where then the certification will be free? And If so when will the classes be and how can I be notified about them. Then we are a Health and Safety company started to use Moodle for our online learning. If it is possible can you advise how to get ready for an online learning course? For example, I know I should set the course duration. But what other things should be taken into consideration or be done before starting a course? Also during the course what should be checked and monitored or be done as an administrator? Thank You",

Since very few people in the community at large will have an experience with Workplace, mostly these go unanswered. And even for those of us who do work with Workplace, since we do that through a partner, and all the question posters also are getting some sort of partner support, answering a public question can be a bit tricky. I suggest adding a forum for this, similar to the Moodle Cloud forum, so we could at least direct these posters to a place more likely to get some response. And partner support staff will be able to see these as well and respond or direct users to the proper support channels. As always, thanks! Randy",

When a new version of Moodle comes out the documentation is redirected to the lastest version, so now if you simply type docs.moodle.org/en/Teamup, (with no version number) you will be taken to the latest version which is 3.7. The good news is that, if you add your page to the 3.7 documentation it will be copied over to future versions so you won't need to do it again.)

For documentation of the site plugin configuration, I suggest you do the same as for other messaging output plugins with settings. For example, the Jabber settings page admin/settings.php?section=messagesettingjabber has a ' Moodle Docs for this page link' to http://docs.moodle.org/33/en/admin/setting/messagesettingjabber . The docs page admin/setting/messagesettingjabber then redirects to a docs page with a nice title. For message_slack documentation, you could redirect to docs.moodle.org/en/Slack_message_processor or similar. Any documentation about user preference settings could also be added to docs.moodle.org/en/Slack_message_processor. I'd recommend though that you try to make the user preference settings as intuitive as possible with clear setting names and setting descriptions in the UI, so that users don't feel the need to check the documentation. If all the docs redirecting sounds a bit complicated, please feel free to create a page named the same as your messaging output plugin and start writing documentation there. If you then message me, I'd be happy to sort out the redirects.",

These are based on providing more quality information for each plugin in ways that make it easier for the community to make decisions on the reliability of the plugin. There are essentially two ideas here: 1) Create more automated testing tools for developers to run their plugins through, so that each upload can display those results. 2) Tie functional reviews to the plugin itself rather than the upload, and provide more standardized review sections and categorizations. For the automated tools, we have been expanding out the test features provided by the moodle-plugin-ci plugin. Ideally the results of these tests (or something similar if it exists), could be linked to from each plugin download version. This would require every plugin to go through this process. For the standardized review process, it would be good if we could all agree on standardized sections and meta-data categories. Doing so would enable more future enhancements, including better searching for appropriate plugins. I am providing a link of a brief overview of what we are thinking of, and would love to begin discussions if anyone is interested. mike",

No need for the badges then as it could be safely assumed that before being made available on the plugins database , the tests are passed. Currently I believe only the original submission is tested in this way, so getting every version tested would be a plus. 2. Functionality can sometimes change considerably between versions - so I am not sure at all that moving the reviews to a plugin level rather than for the version is a good idea. More importantly, getting respected reviewers in place to have more reviews available on a wider range of plugins would (for me) be a greater priority than adding to the formality of those reviews - which would appear to be detrimental to getting people to complete reviews in the first place. Could you point out some of the reviews with what you consider good standardized sections and categories that have been contributed to the plugins database? Mike, for the sake of clarity, could you say who 'we' is in relation to this as I notice your membership on the MUA is as an individual member, but you seem to be putting this forward as part of an organisation?",

All the Travis or Jenkins or Behat or PHP Unit or any continuous testing tools are only as useful as the actual underlying unit test assertions and feature files. Without them, we can only perform syntax checks (lint) and eventually how is the plugin code following the Moodle coding style. Both these are good to have. But they themselves say nothing about whether or not the plugin works with particular version of Moodle, database engine or PHP version. For these things, the plugin maintainer / author has to developer good PHP Unit tests and Behat scenarios. And by good I mean tests with good coverage of the functionality, range of use cases, input parameters combinations etc. Let us not overestimate nice green \"build passes\" badges. It is easy to write trivial test that never fails and be proud of \"all greens\" on my plugin page. Said that, my +1 to have this area of the plugins directory improved indeed.",

They test for various code rules and structure, and we're working on improving them further. The tests in there do tests for various versions of Moodle, PHP and database engines. With respect to unit testing and Behat testing, you are correct. The validity of the tests are only as good as the tests themselves. Showing the reports will help plugin users determine how much faith they put in them. I think you're point on badges is a good one, and I think showing the test results for each version is a better choice. As part of my ongoing work, we're going to choose the plugins that are important to the POET members first, and help improve the unit and Behat tests with the developers. As we move forward, hopefully we can increase the number of plugins we help. And I think having some record of reporting will help encourage developers to improve their code and tests, and hopefully get more community involved with that help. We're also looking at what can be done to validate the coverage of the existing tests, although that is a controversial measurement. Is there some way I can help define, design and implement these suggestions beyond this? Mike",

But, currently that is not the case, and will take time to make them all go through that. So if there was \"proof\" of some sort, that would be better. I think the links to the direct output of the Travis CI tests would be best, as it would show what was tested and how it fared. For functionality, while function does change, it usually does not - at least not as frequently as the version uploads. I think there is value in knowing which specific version was used when the review was carried out. And it would be great if there was a mechanism to notify the reviewer when a new version was available so the reviewer could validate/update their review. I think there is value in coming up with some standard methods, but I agree that may be too constricting. Our group is going to continue our work to a common format we'll use, and I'll be able to describe that soon. \"We\" is POET. You can see the details in my profile. Regards, Mike",

I assumed the site's primary navigation is in the black top menu bar - Home, documentation, downloads all seem to be pretty core web site content. The internal distinction between who owns or manages what content is not likely important to the public user's site navigation. Perhaps I am just to jaded by ads everywhere, but I assume banner type pictures or slide shows are not important (typically temporary promotional material) and I usually don't even notice what they say.  They don't grab my focus when I am trying to find the most important\nlink on a web site - using a full web browser. This is probably becoming a less effective strategy with the move to mobile menu design - but that still does not justify the removal of the item from the traditional menu IA structure.  Also the design of that busy orange image is not very easy\nto scan and identify the link.

Anyway, to put the question in more general terms: Let's say there is a discussion thread in moodle.org, which has this tree structure once in drop down at the top \"Display replies in nested form\" is selected. Let's also say, person A starts reply to the last post in that tree and submits it at t=T. A person B has also started replying to a post at the middle of the tree and submits it at t=T+1. Then person A saw a typo and edited his post and submitted it at t=T+1. The question: Which post would you expect to be shown at the last post in the forum overview? I would say the post by person A.

The wiki includes a new page, New features , which provides screenshots and a quick overview of features of interest to teachers, students and administrators, complementing the more technical Moodle 2.5 release notes . There's also a German Moodle Docs 2.5 , which Gisela is working on (many thanks). Help with the docs is always welcome - just log in with your moodle.org username and password to edit pages.

You know my efforts to get a few ( IMO ) basic functionalities into Moodle core over the years - my first e-mail to you was over four years ago I believe.  In many cases (most cases), no joy, and the official word from MoodleHQ is plugins is the way to go, and the new plugins database, and the option to install without server access.  (BRING IT ON!!) This I can live with.  I now will very rarely work with a Moodle hosting provider who does not offer the chance to install plugins for a reasonable cost.  My preference is like the R-L approach here: http://www.remote-learner.co.uk/content/approved-moodle-modules-and-plugins like a whitelist.  Took me a while to find some providers who were proactive in this respect. We choose plugins with care.  Is there likely to be a LONG wait for an upgrade to a new version of Moodle?  Are they likely to go bust?  Are they likely to remove functionality (which has happened) or ignore minor bugs?  Do they answer questions?  Are they well designed? Plugin communuication is spread across many areas: docs, forums, tracker and plugin database, blogs, GIT , PM, email.  If I have some level or responsibility for a site with plugins then I want to know everything that is going on.  So along comes a channel I cannot monitor (the plugins database).  Very frustrating.  I ask a question, how do I know if there is an answer?  Someone else asks a question I know the answer to - How do I know?  Comment from the maintainer - how do I know? A few other items: Comments threaded view? I can handle NOT having threaded views. No WYSIWYG or image insertion. Would be better with this. Reviews. Not really worried about this at the moment.  The discussion around this is unfinished.  (I asked questions about the purpose of reviews etc and I got a sort of answer about who is trusted to write.)  This may be an experiment that failed from my point of view, but it could change. Stats. Cool Documentation. I can live with what is there.  No documentation: I will either write some or e-mail the writer of the plugin or something and if no response I just won't bother with the plugin . . .  This is almost never an issue, even with comments and notes a bit scattered. That's just my case.  The ecosystem around Plugins then has become important to me.  I would like to be able to subscribe to the forums in the plugins database to save having to go back there a lot .  .  . -Derek",

Séverin, you're right that the scroll of death does have some advantages. If it seems that the one section per page course layout isn't working out, we can switch back, or perhaps make use of a new course format. Also, don't worry, it won't look like the clone site! Up to now we've just used the clone site for testing various bits of code; it's not yet been set up with the new design. Apologies for running way behind the schedule announced by Martin. I'll post to let you all know when the site is ready for feedback. One improvement I'm looking forward to being implemented is having forum posts rated as useful being displayed on the front page of moodle.org in a visitor's own language, together with a link to the community discussion course in that language. Thus, visitors should easily be able to find help in their own language, and not need to hunt through dropdown menus.",

If you don't like scroll of death (stupid term), well, you will still have it with the Plugins and other components, but then other bits are hidden. I don't understand why you have banished Comparison & Advocacy to Other stuff, it is one of the more interesting forums. It belongs in getting started at least as much as teaching with Moodle and Partners. Acutally, I would move everything from Other stuff to getting stared, except closed discussions, which you can hide at the bottom of the developers section, and you have a simpler structure. If you are going to hide useful stuff behind unnecessary mouse clicks, then I think you have to split the monster section, which does split naturally into Activity modules and Other components.",

This site is experiencing technical difficulties. Try waiting a few minutes and reloading. (Cannot contact the database server : Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 110) This message tells me that there may be an issue with PHP and My SQL . I will also get the occasional message that tells me that my browser is not using cookies. I am using Windows 7 and Firefox , but even if I use Internet Exploder it returns the same error. I hunted the error message and got a hit for an error 111, but not for a 110. The resolution of that, resetting the hosts file, did not hep at all - made no difference. The only thing that has changed has been an upgrade to Java , anti-virus definitions and I use manual Windows updates and I have not updated anything else between the last time I accessed Moodle Docs and now. Not Firefox or Thunderbird for that matter. a) Will a Java update interfere with cookies? Or cookie settings in a browser? Never known it to happen, but there is a first time for everything. b) I have reset the browser to \"Remember History\", thereby accepting cookies, but I have turned \"tracking cookies\" to \"deny\" (if that is the right way to put it), but I doubt these things have anything to do with it. So far, Moodle Docs is the ony site this is affecting, everything else works. I really need to get into Moodle Docs, for editing... and I will appreciate any assistance here at all.",

In any case, what I wanted to know is the status of this article which belongs to the category \"Performance\"? I don't see any useful information in those few lines. I left a comment to that effect in the talk page on 18 Nov 2010, nobody replied.",

I expect that page would mostly link to other places that already exist (like how to help with translating Moodle), but it would be nice to provide a single welcome page to summarise all the options, and make it easy to get started.

With only 10 concurrent threads I can see how there is not so much potentially going on to justify the effort of breaking it apart.  But, I was thinking along the lines of ease of searching through older posts to see if a question had already been answered.  Or could 'tagging' be introduced to make this functionality easier? The Moodle Documents has a wealth of information, however, what you want is sometimes not there and often the question is very specific to a technology, therefore categorisation would enable better targetting of questions to the persons in the technical subject area who understand it the most. Cheers, Gareth",

I have a topic based course - 40 topics - and want to create a pdf of the front page (the 40 topic summaries) so that a student can download it and view it to see the summaries of each topic. Using a html to pdf converter works ok - but the pagination is awful - the whole thing, all 40 topics, is treated as one continuous page. What I would like is one topic summary per page in the pdf (and incidentally any prints of the summary page our students do) So my question is - is there anything I can add to the summaries ( a piece of clever html, or a control code) that will make any converter think \"Here lies a new page\" ? I currently use bulldog pdf printer - but suspect the problem is sort of generic. Any help appreciated. Adrian",

The debate about creating seperate M2 pages has come up before in earlier versions.  Usually in the context of a module undergoing a complete function and interface change.  Usually the older stuff after 6 months to a year  gets dropped to the bottom of the page, collapsed so h2s become h3s.  However, I agree with you that in some pages they are easier to create M2 pages because things are so different. Excellent post.  We do need to talk about how to transition things to the \"latest\" version, while respecting the elder ones. After all, I am still officially working with 1.5.3 (until Feb 11) and just fielded a query from someone who had just converted a 1.3 to a 1.9.9  !! Best wishs   Chris",

Subpages off my profile page tend to have format and tips to myself which I use every once in a while. I use subpages off a \"regular\" page for drafting major changes and sometimes ask for comments. I try to delete these pages when this process is over. Currently, I put links on a page to the subpages. But if I forget to put the link, I have to dive back into history to see what I called it, then immediate put the link in the parent page. Chris",

The problem with subpages is, that they are \"invisible\" by default, i.e. not automatically linked from their parent page. That's the reason extensions like the one mentioned are necessary.

(Of course, some people was hesitate to call that a relational database.) Since then, some things have been improved, but the key outstanding issue is that Moodle does not use foreign key constraints. (However, if you look at the database definitions, which are stored in a database neutral way in in files called install. xml in each plugin, you will see that foreign key relations are defined there.) My view is that we should make the effort to deal with this some time. That is, create all the foreign keys, and then fix all the error messages we get as a result. However, I am still in a minority there. (Search for other threads about foreign keys to see the past discussions.) There are also some weird relations in some of the older tables, like the links between couse, course_modules, course_sections, etc. Again this is historical, and probably too painful to change now.",

I subscribe to various forums from time to time and I have a rule in my email that places them in a specific folder. I'd like to keep subscribing to more than one forum to keep up-to-date on issues, learn new things and as well to potentially help answer questions if I can. I think it would be very advantageous to keep each forum subscription separate and to do that I would need a more definite subject line to specify what goes where. Not sure if anyone else would find this useful, or how difficult it would be to implement? Thanks for considering... Susan",

It is also possible to add Certificate to achieve the minimum time function and an overall grade condition. Speed clickers are an issue. There are several ways to deal with them. The basic concept is to break your two hours up into instructional periods, ask questions and make them repeat the instructional period if they don't get a high percentage right. You can use a series of Lesson modules . Example: each lesson has 8 pages of content and 6 question pages. The question pages should reinforce the lesson plan's instructional points. The Lesson module has a conditional dependency built in. It is possible to say that before the trainee enters Lesson 2, they must stay 15 minutes in Lesson 1 and answer 100% of the questions correctly. That in theory makes the regulators happy. Alternatives. Certificate (contributed code) has a time spent and several score conditions before it can be printed. A version of Activity locking module (contributed code) in 1.6 to 1.9 might give you more flexibility in stringing different kinds of modules together with conditions. The time conditions are not in all flavors of Activity Locking. Moodle 2.0 will have Conditional activities built in . I do not think it has a time spent parameter.",

(i.e. that upon the entry of the track item there will be overwhelming demand via cast votes for implementation..... LOL) I would be willing to flesh this out a bit in a Development: wiki page if there was a page name that would be most appropriate?? To provide some detail: Structurally there would be a data directory (I think xml would be grand) that would be used for the look-ups. I think it would be nice to provide non-production access to the data directory for the purpose of contributing (which would presuppose a mechanism for online manipulation which would be opened to developers, PHMs, etc. as experience with the tool dictates.....). In the interim, I see something along the lines of a wiki where folks can recommend terms and doc references. The current post feature would be altered to include the active search so that suggestions for solutions would be provided as the query is entered (and it might even more helpful to ask in this post page for the user to enter some possible key words - both for use by the live search and for indexing of the query should it actually get posted.) The post page will require a user to acknowledge that he has in fact reviewed the recommended solutions - misrepresentation on thsi matter resulting in being identified with a yahoo avatar. A separate post feature may be maintained for old farts who are just being chatty (not to say that I know of anyone indictable on such an offense) or are providing responses to queries and don't need the look-up.",

          "Text": "Well, if someone can get some noise going something might change, but I didn;t see any real interest from developers in pursuing this...... Couple of problems with just search plugins: Getting users to search first - You know how often a user will ask a question before they have looked at all. Beauty of the tool I was suggesting is that it essentially force the search, thereby arguably short circuiting needless forum postings on questions for which answers appear in the docs Appropriate search results (often results to narrow or to broad to0 be useful) - docs are poorly searched except by title, and users are most likely to get inserted into the middle of some forum discussion in which they don;t belong. An active search allows US to build a directory based on the user's most likely needs as seen from search terms. Also will ensure that user sees appropriate doc materials While plugins may be a nice shortcut for those the more sophisticated, for those most likely to be searching for answers ( new users ) I don't think it offers a solution (nor relief for those here who doggedly answer the same questions daily. with my concept for active search, If a new user wants to ask about how Moodle is funded, in typing their inquiry they would be directed first to the docs explaining want they are asking about..... and should they indicate that the suggestions did not answer their question, it would be posted - helps guide the user to the doc, and helps the doc developer address how to get users to the answers they want. seems like a no brainer to me..... but I am obviously not a maintstream guy ;=}",

I'm not opposed to a knowledge-base search (of Moodle Docs) in the forums here to try and prevent some people posting (by directing them to related pages in the docs first). It's a good idea in principle. It's just not cheap to implement. Firstly we'd have to hack Moodle forums with extra AJAX or an extra step in posting (between submit and post). And we'd have to develop some sort of API for MediaWiki for this code to talk to, and we'd have to implement all kinds of relevance algorithms to make it anywhere near effective. Secondly we'd have to maintain this hack over time and make sure we had enough hardware resources to support the constant searches every time someone wanted to post here. Right now we're already pretty short-staffed just working on Moodle 2.0 and 1.9.x so this sort of thing is kinda low on our priority list, especially since we have a global site search already ...",

Perhaps the diff is that I am thinking of something much less sophisticated. Yes, I would link the current Add a New Discussion button to the ajax for the active search, but only provide access to the actual submission form after the activesearch process had been completed. The activesearch would be external to mediawiki so no API issues. The db would have to be created - trained if you will, which would require a bit of work and would be subject to modification over time as pages moved, were added etc. but I am talking about a human engineered index, not a machine engineered index.",

Suggestion The documentation found by clicking on the help button next to \"Format\" - [/help.php?module=moodle&file=textformat.html&forcelang=] when posting to a forum for example - should explain how to access text input formats other than HTML. The fact that this is done by accessing your user profile and changing the text input preference is not very obvious. Thus it can be confusing for users who read this documentation which explains the different input formats, but then wonder why the don't have access to them. I suggest adding a line at the top or bottom of the documentation page, explaining how to access the other text input formats. Question Does the moodle documentation on the website correspond to the moodle documentation in the distribution? For example, if I edit http://docs.moodle.org/en/Formatting_options on the website, does it edit the future [/help.php?module=moodle&file=textformat.html&forcelang=] in the distribution?",

While trying to find help, keywords don't match what is in the database , which doesn't help; and within the documents there are references to do something, however no steps in which to do them or how to find where to go to do them. It would be great if there could be a glossary somewhere to help with the various terms. More support for installation would be useful.  It took me hours and hours to no avail; finally had to pay a specialist $300.00 to get the darn thing installed and running (and he gave me 50% off).  I am worried when there are upgrades that would really be helpful and I can't do them myself-I cannot afford to keep paying someone to do these. I'm a tad stressed since I'll need to take the current course I have now and start it over for the next grading period and I have no idea how to do this beyond registering new students and dropping the previous students.  Since I have had so many issues, I am seriously afraid to do anything. I want to reiterate that the majority of folks using this are teachers, and we do not have the time it takes to search for solutions and try to get them to work.  Most of us are on our own with no tech support from our schools, so when something doesn't work or it is a pain, we are stuck.  In addition, I will be the teacher training other teachers on all this, and I feel clueless myself! I realize that this is all put together by the \"community\" but it seems like there could be some financial support from sponsors so that those of you who are the main people could hire someone to restructure the help documents and forums to be more user-friendly. Maybe that is asking too much, I don't know... I appreciate you allowing me to state my feelings, regardless of their relevance!=)",

And one pro, in my opinion, beats all the cons is access to the developers and a community of developers at all times. Simply just address the issue, you will get support, most of the time, with easy steps to follow. We are dealing with public school system and it is..nightmare but if moodle could handle public school system, it could handle almost anything. For the items you need, if you could be definite about the terms you need, your answer could pop up in a faster way, here and could be documented sooner. PS: our teachers literally afraid of the keyboard, but I have full faiththat , once they break the \"fear barrier\", we will see colorful and effective classes(may be even some teachers could start coding) Also I hope Helen could look at my question, or I could create a mess of my own.",

          "Text": "No, it is not asking too much Kelly, and you echo concerns that have been bouncing around Moodle forums for quite a while. A number of solutions have been argued and I finally added the one I think might be most effective here: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLSITE-552 Additionally, there has also been some discussion of the need to have a more comprehensive QA process that ensures that any new development is usable before it is deployed, a process that would include testing out new code on users not affiliated with the new developments while recording so that usability issues can be shared as well as tutorials framed based on user mis-steps. I also have to argue that you have fallen victim to what I see as unrealistic evangelizing. On the other side of the coin I have seen quite a few people who claim that they are tech savvy demonstrate that they are largely clueless about how even a browser works..... But, to be fair, I did look at your prior postings and found nothing posted by you on installation issues, and there are quite a few folks like RE and others who spend long hours helping folks get installs up and running. There is also ample information about backing up courses without user data and restoring (the way in which you will likely offer your course again.) Now, as to your argument about the \"majority of folks\".... I don't have realistic data on who's who in the Moodle world, but I have made the argument that teachers do not have the resources to effectively manage and use a Moodle. While this assertion was hotly debated, there are a number of doc pages that outline the kinds of human resources that may be necesary to make effective use of Moodle, and that list extends far beyond the lone teacher. The upshot is that while a teacher may wish to experiment, it behooves such persons to do so on a webhost where installation is simplified (I have recommended DH for this in the past but there are certainly other web hosts who make initial install very very easy.) I am not going to argue with your consultant over fees, but since anyone here could have talked you through an install on any of a number of web hosts in a few minutes I am really curious as far as how you ended up down that path (as there is no obvious electronic trail on moodle.org) especially as you would benefit from a review of the profile spam discussion. As Kamehameha has Moodle up and running I would have thought someone there would have been willing to lend a hand (I am assuming that the issues you describe are with respect to Maui Kinesiology, not Kamehameha Schools, since the latter has Moodles up for multiple campuses.) The most recent argument over Moodle security and profile spam resulted in some Moodlers working on trying to do something along the lines you suggest, i.e. provide some more guidance for newbees. However, though you are self-described as a techy I am afraid that your understanding of how this juggernaut is managed, funded, etc. is a bit naive.",

          "Text": "Marc, For those of you who are not a part of this, I apologize for the waste of space this has taken, but I could not just sit ideally by and say nothing. I may sound a tad touchy in my response; however after reading your post repeatedly, I have become perturbed by the inflection of tone (of your post), the innuendo, and the accusations.  I thought these forums were for folks to seek out advice and share their experiences?  I did not realize if you are not a Moodle expert, you would be slammed and torn apart.  I guess I learned a valuable lesson here, which is to not post anything unless you already know the answer to your question! Here are the answers to your questions: I'm not associated with Kamehameha Schools so not sure why that came up in the discussion; I certainly did not state I was a part of that school!  I work for a public school, who has their own server , but unable to install Moodle for a variety of reasons.  This forced me to install it with my service provider, so I could get the course up and running.  In addition, the course is linked to a URL I have never posted here, and it is not in respect to Maui Kinesiology. I'm curious to know why you would state that the \"lone teacher\" should not attempt to use Moodle?  I think it is awesome when teachers reach to create a better learning environment for their students, even if that means they have to stretch themesleves.  If not for these teachers, where would education be today?  Still teaching the way it was 30 years ago, 50 years ago?  Educators need to meet the needs of all learners and the current generation.  These students are tech-savy, they are growing up with technology as an every day thing, so if we don't find a way to engage them, we will lose them.  Students engage when technology is involved, so teachers try to use technology as a tool to assist in the learning process.  There is a growing number of virtual students, for a variety of reasons, therefore using Moodle to address these demands is critical to our ever-growing student populations.  Yes, there are virtual schools and curriculum you can purchase, but they are extremely expensive and most schools cannot afford to purchase them, nor would spend the money if one of their own can develop an online course. Basically there were several issues: the download did not function properly therefore creating missing files; the service provider had restrictions on the server so I could not get the database and Moodle to talk to one another; the support information did not match my issues, nor did the steps to install; and I am not a database person no matter how many times I have tried to wrap my brain around it. I did consider using a Moodle service provider to host the courses, but I cannot afford the fees; they are really expensive and would be coming out of my own pocket , not a school budget.  Because the school IT department could not install Moodle on the school server, my only option was to have it installed within my service contract, which is my personal business account.  I had to purchase a separate domain name for it as well.  Incidentally, I paid the consultant out of my own pocket! I'm not sure what you meant by \"unrealistic evangelizing\" so I am not sure how to respond or if I should be offended by that remark, so I'm going to have to let that go. I did say I was a techy, however that does not mean that I know everything about technology-nobody does. The more you know, the more you know you don't know .  I have a small home-based web design firm on the side and do fairly well with that; spend a lot of time educating and re-educating myself in this field.  I have been able to fix pretty much everything that has come up on clients' computers from a physical issue to software issues.  I have spent a lot time educating other adults and children in the use of computers, programs, etc.  I do have my web certification from a college, along with a lot of the MS certifications.  Plus, I have built 5 computers on my own.  So yeah, I do think of myself as a techy, but again, that does not mean I know everything about technology.  So I have not \"fallen victim\" nor am \"clueless\" about technology, but this is not the place. I was able to find the documentation about backing up the course and renaming it, which I have already completed. Moodle's security...???  Spam Profile...???  At this point these are not a concern for me. I do understand how the financial side and OpenSource works; all I was saying is that it will be a pain to reorganize the forum topics and maybe paying someone to do it would be more efficient and effective. Below is the background on the installation issues: I first installed a local copy, after reading all the documentation and the three books I purchased (which I had to special order).  Everything stated that it would be easy to move the local copy to the web-based version; which was not the case.  The download was incomplete with each attempt, so I had to search for the missing files and download them separately-it was a pain.  I even did the whole rename this and rename that thing, still... When it was time to move it to the server/web-based version, I created the database on the server just fine; uploaded all the files, etc.  but the site did not work.  I spent hours reading the forums, user documents, and books.  I tried everything possible, still could not get it to function.  I did do some posts, which is how I found several Moodle specialists, who would consult for a fee.  The person I finally was able to work with was great.  He continued to send me information on what step to take next; even sat on the phone with me to do some of it, but it still did not work. I then contacted the service provider, who would not help with the Moodle installation, but would do what I requested them to do on the database.  Not real helpful if I don't know what to tell them to do in the first place.  With each new step, I had to contact the service provider, who sometimes fixed the problem and sometimes made it worse.  I begged them to allow the consultant access to the server to fix the issues; would only take a short time if that could happen; no could do. Eventually the consultant used my personal information (I provided it) to contact the service provider, and resolve the problems.  The consultant took over 4 hours to get it up and running.  This was after I probably spent 60-80 hours on my own and with the support mentioned earlier.  I am appreciative of what they did for me, and if they did not help me the course would never have been open for students.

          "Text": "The State of Hawaii shows that you were recently associated with the school I mentioned and the school runs extensive Moodles..... In a place as small as Maui I merely noted that I thought someone there would be helpful..... and since you are associated with a Moodle (and had provided no detail about the Moodle you were inquiring about) I looked at the MK site, and mentioned the open enrollment issue (since it has been a scourge and you SHOULD be concerned.) Reflecting back at the balance of my post it seems rather sympathetic to the new user (I in fact start off by indicating you have every right to complain about some issues.) I was a bit confused when you suggested you had complaints about installation support though I found no evidence of prior posts regarding installation. You indicate that you did post, but Moodle.org shows nothing from you in the installation or general problem forums regarding other than gradebook issues, hence my conclusion. There are quite a few folks whom I think might well be eligible for sainthood in this community who answer the same questions day after day gettings folks off the ground with Moodle, unpaid volunteers mind you.... It seems you take the greatest umbrage at my suggestion that Moodle installation is not for the average teacher. As I mentioned, if one spends time researching web hosts and has the necessary tools at hand, there are quite a few web hosts on which Moodle can be completely set up in just a few minutes for a few dollars a month. A huge amount of bandwidth is expended trying to support installations where someone has no access to mail, no shell access, or even no ftp access..... I am hopeful that the docs will soon expanded to try and steer folks clear of the myriad pitfalls that Moodle installation can present, but I still hold that without sysadmin skills Moodle installs can not only be troublesome and frustrating, they can become an embarrasment and a violation of student rights. Additionally, one of the issues I have been concerned with is the situation where \"rogue\" teachers create school or district Moodles without or in spite of their IT Dept. While I celebrate that drive and creativity this creates friction, suspicion and potential future nightmares (and I do have some experience with this on both sides of the equation, as a sysadmin and as a rogue.....) I dont think it is inappropriate to argue that persons doing Moodle installs for the purposes of serving institutional needs should collaborate with the institutions IT department.... so I am glad ot hear that you did collaborate, though I would have to argue that if the IT dept. couldn't or wouldn''t address the nominal fees to place Moodle on a web host, then that makes a dramatic statement about the schools priorities.",

Thought we had a cron issue, but then somebody else reported to her that they received a copy of a post to the forum that was made 2 days ago. Thanks for the tips. I would think that a popup blocker would not impact email, even if it was something like gmail (google mail) and was web based. Blocks what is in the email but not the email itself. So I better do some digging on her computer(s), maybe yahoo is dumping it in her spam ! Oh joy! Best Chris",

The zips are created with a parent directory that has no relation to the moodle infrastructure. This means that one can not unzip from the root and thereby complete an install, which means that directions for install are unnecessarily complex or the maintainer needs to bypass this nice moodle feature and build and maintain the zip somewhere other than the moodle (which seems to hbe contrary to the spirit of things, as it were....) Hey! Is this the reason that it sems that everyone has a moodle directory in their moodle! So, the question I have is where there might be documentation on the scripts/utilities that create these zips automagically and whether there would be an issue with fiddling that so that zips are not archived with the added directory because a) it is unnecessary (anyone who wants the added infrastructure is free to make it), b) is it inconvenient (while you can easily unzip in any directory to wish) you can't unzip from an archival subdirectory, and c) it makwes installation a pain If there are no specific reasons against such a move I will create a tracker item and look into fiddling the scripts...",

          "Text": "The problem is that as noodle starts offering \"packages\" in the sense that Anthony uses it here: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLSITE-411 the functionality you describe is no longer universal. unzip will create a parent directory if a parent directory is included in the archive and there is no way around that. I have argued your position before (i.e. don't tell people to unzip unless you have details of where and how because it could in fact overwrite files) not because unzipping is bad (as opposed to manually renaming old files and copying new files) but because there were inadequate instructions in some cases (especially where something was not in the format you describe - i.e. a mod that needed to be unzipped to the mod's directory....) but... It would seem that each zip could have specific instructions as to how to install the zip.... so if one wanted to install for example some of the work Mauro is doing on editors, one could do that with a zip (though I have suggested that a facility like cpan or yast would be sweet!) without having to to move anything about.... and.... the dependency risk is always there, there are disclaimers (as has been pointed out to me before), and hopefully code maintainers will be responsible in their code and warnings..... Much of this discussion is in a sense a mirror of the discussion that took place among Anthony, John and I regarding Dragmath integration (the lawyer in me argued your position actually....) and you could condisder the Dragmatn integration as the strawman for this argument, the Maunos work on editor integration will I think make this a very real issue very soon.... What I meant about moodle directories is that while some of us do not have a moodle directory, it appears that most who do a zip install do.... I have never done a moodle install from a zip, but based upon the discussion I am assuming that most end up with a parent moodle directory because that is how it is zipped. If one were to create a moodle directory in which to install moodle from a zip, my guess is that one would subsequently discover that one's code is in /moodle/moodle, no??",

It seems to me to be a good strategy for folks to unzip to a temporary directory. Then we can tell folks to copy the files from /{mytemp}/{zipfilename}/* (be it moodle or dragmath, etc.) to /myproductionsite . Just to clarify what you mean about moodle directory you are referring to the /moodle directory created in the zip files like moodle-weekly-19.zip. When I wanted to unzip the file on a hosted site it was initially not clear to me that I would need to unzip to temp directory and then move the files. But unzipping to a temporary location gives folks a chance to ensure that they are installing what they think they are installing. In other words, they can browse and make sure that things care correct. Peace - Anthony",

I provided some simple comprehensive instructions and passed on the money when things were quickly fixed.... the instructions the person was trying to follow were fine for someone who knew what they were doing, but totally unacceptable for someone who didn't..... so if we expect all kinds a people to be playing with this we need to provide detailed comprehensive instructions or post anything a monkey can't do with a big skull and cross bones that says geeks only ;=} So, if that is how we are going to go then I will update docs.",

Typical issues such as choosing between Categories>>Courses, MetaCourses>>Courses and Courses>>Groups; Ways of adding students to courses (every type of institution has different methods of enrollment); dealing with different levels of visibility and access; etc, etc. IMHO that would be a really hany Doc/FAQ for new users and one I'd like to see added for future users.

We recently posted our results to a page on Moodle Docs : http://docs.moodle.org/en/Student_documentation_examples . We hope that teachers and others will find the list of example resources useful as they look for content and formatting ideas when creating documentation for their own students. We look forward to feedback on the list and hope that others will contribute.",

I've just started a few days ago Moodle development and have in hands the task of developing a gradebook with a few changes, specific of evaluation methods in Portugal. I think is a harsh way to start with, but since I have some experience in PHP and MySQL , I started studying the Moodle structure and philosophy and I think I'm ready to begin the task. I'm having some trouble with documentation, as I understand that there is a big focus on version 1.9 (very different from 1.8). My approach is to try to emulate gradebook in a module and add the extra features I need. Specifically, I need to develop module to calculate the weighted average of the activities . Something like: First Activity (grade between 0-20) - 30% of final grade Second Activity (grade between 0-20) - 30% of final grade Third Activity (grade between 0-20) - 40% of final grade Final grade result (grade between 0-20) = FA*0.30 + SA*0.3 + TA*0.40 Apologies for the long run, but I'm still struggling to dive in Moodle world and I'm getting all the help I can get.

Then learned as Helen pointed out, they do not follow the same file structure. Sigh. Two wild ideas sprung into my little and very old brain. Both require lots of setup work. Here is a cryptic summary of them: # Create a batch file that copies each HTML file to the correct spot in a file structure. Point docroot there. #Create a MediaWiki, figure out all the pages you want in your custom IvanDocsWiki, and use the Special pages Export and Import functions. Looks like you might be able to create one or more batch files for this as well. However not something to put on a thumb drive. Either of those might not be too much work if you limited the pages available to specific topics such as those relating to Quiz or Lesson . Somebody who wanted general page information on Moodle Docs or Roles might be out of luck. Best - Chris",

My name is Zuzana Bizonova and I am a PhD student in University of Zilina, Slovakia in co-direction with Institut National des Telecommunications Evry, France. I am currently working on my PhD thesis which topic is: Integration of LMS via Model Driven Architecture. I have chosen three LMS systems for my research: OLAT, Moodle and .LRN – mostly because of diversity of their architecture, technologies used for their implementations, their different approaches to the same problems, but also because of their popularity among universities. I am currently working with the data that I found on Internet. I’ve been trying to do my best to find up-to-date information that I can use for building up the correct integrated model, however I have some hesitations, if my information is good. Therefore I would like to ask you for a friendly help in my research. Could you please send me up-to-date information about your system’s architecture, if it is possible – object architecture, if not – database architecture with some explanations? Could you support me with a current documentation for developers? I am very thankful for your help – I would like my thesis to be really useful for you and others that’s why I would like to provide the right information to the readers. My research is only at the beginning and in this phase I am still free to do changes at my model. Thank you very much Yours sincerely Zuzana Bizonova",

          "Text": "We (why not we) add a bracket with administrator or teacher in a page title. I call this context . Initially it seemed like a good idea to establish context or a frame of reference in the title or in a sub heading. Sometimes the line between admin and teacher gets blurred and is not clear for many reasons. For example \"Logs\" and \"Reports\". First MoodleLanguage is switching from the techie's word \"Logs\" to the educator's word \"Reports\". A site administration report page has a single form, while a teacher's course report page has an additional form added at the bottom. Do we have a page called something like Reports (administrator) and another called Reports (teacher) ? Another example might be \"Multiple choice question\". Back in 1.6, we only had a Multiple choice in a Quiz and another in a Lesson context. And now with Question bank, we are going to have a 3rd context. *Do we create a Disambiguation page to split the different context. *Merge the pages into one and state context in headings, or perhaps with a distinctive icon when is specifically and only relates to admin, teacher or student. **What about pages that may belong in two different templates (handy box menus on the upper right). Can bald guys remember which template they jumped from? *Do we live with the strange URLs *Will some clever Moodler come up with a different perspective? I confess, I like to see the ( context) in the page title. Always a newbie, I don't like to wade through stuff that does not apply to me.

However for starters, I would copy all the moodle\\lang\\en_utf8\\help directory to moodle\\lang\\he_uf8\\help, being sure not to replace the 23 files! Then let the student select their language preference or force them via admin settings. I am not sure if you have to change the admin block help path to switch it from the moodle.org files to your server files. Todo. I wanted to test to see if both sets of help instructions on my server became the official help files for my site, when I changed the path. I hope the path is something like c:\\moodle\\lang not c:\\moodle\\lang\\en_utf8\\help . Todo. Check MoodleDocs to see what it says about a second or third language in help files. If you have already figured this out, please help me with a post. Best Chris",

As we get further along, I am sure we will need more support from Moodle Forums and be able add value with our experiences. Jeff",

It is over the 500K upload limit so you can find it by clicking on the COURSE button at www.abernet.org.uk , selecting the MOODLE course, and downloading the tutorial. Part of my job as an ICT Development Officer in Aberdeen (Scotland) is to support school staff to make best use of ICT. One of the things I do is provide training to teachers. This tutorial is aimed specifically at teachers in Aberdeen who will be using the version of MOODLE which is hosted on our website. At the moment, I've installed the most current development version of 1.2 (4 November 2003). There are a couple of minor bugs but it seems to be stable. This is NOT a generic manual but is meant to be a guide to getting going with MOODLE for teachers with limited ICT skills. I have not attempted to cover all aspects of MOODLE. I've tried to provide enough support so that teachers can create a simple course and then I hope that they'll go on themselves to look at what else MOODLE has to offer. The tutorial is part of a simple online course available at www.abernet.org.uk . this course has guest access. This is a first draft which needs to be worked through by teachers before a final version is written. I'd welcome any comments or suggestions for improvement and anyone is welcome to use/adapt anything if it is of use.",

This standard is a common industrial standard and doesn't include communication between students. Yes, you can add a link to a forum or include a frame in a SCORM page, but what you can't do is to integrate it in SCORM. Thats not a modle module problem, but a SCORM standard problem. If you try to it, there will be lots of problems with use of the SCORM package in other LMS. I think you should try to look on Learning Design standard. http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=44 moodle is going to Learning Design support. This standard integrates interactions between students as part of a learning setting. Did you see LAMS http://lamscommunity.org? LAMS creates learning processes for groups and could be used in several LMS, including moodle. Ralf",

          "Text": "Greetings! My name is Robert Mungo, and I've been using Moodle as a student for 3 years now. About a year ago, D.I. von Briesen mentioned the possiblity of a web slideshow here on moodle.org and asked me to create a slideshow using Eric Meyer's S5 Method as a student project. For those that are not familiar, S5 is a web standards based slideshow format. It's built with XHTML , CSS , and just a little Javascript . This makes it extremely lightweight, easily configurable, and viewable in nearly any browser without the need for plugins or installing software. More info is available on Eric Meyer's site. I've created this slideshow using the S5 method and it weighs in at less than 300KB total. The main index file weighs in at 20KB. This means that, reusing the images & CSS, you could have dozens of languages available in the same space that the English Powerpoint Presentation takes. I'm looking for suggestions, opinions, or problems with the slideshow. If there is any information that needs to be updated, please let me know that as well. I'm also looking for great images of the current version of Moodle in action to round out the slideshow. Hopefully when we get some feedback and images, we'll be able to officially submit the slideshow to Moodle Docs . Please view the slideshow here: http://www.robertmungo.com/s5/ , a zip file of the slide show is located here: http://www.robertmungo.com/s5/MoodleS5.zip . Thanks in advance!",

I was reeeeally dreading sitting at the computer and reading up on the system through the online help pages (or printing them out one at a time, although the \"printable version\" link is a nice touch), so I can't tell you how delighted I was when I discovered that the entire set of docs were available in pdf. I can now make a cup of coffee, sit in a comfortable chair, prop up my bunny slippered feet and read to my heart's content. Of course, now that I've downloaded them, I can't find the link on the site again to give proper credit to whoever assembled this into a book. So, I'll just say it here - thanks, folks! And also to all of you tech writers who slaved away on this 200 page critter I'm about to dig into - nicely done!

Instead of version control, what you have got is quite detailed logging, and that will tell you roughly what has been changed, it just won't let you get back to a previous state.",

Should we have a more organised collaborative approach to developing Moodle documentation?  There are many non-programmers (or unwilling programmers like myself) who would be willing to contribute to such an effort. What techniques should we use for such a collaborative process?  (I'm intrigued by the ideas of wikis, but have not had time to look at these). I could summarise my position by the simple question: Is there something I'm missing? Looking forward to a response. Brian.",

I will also be able to help Mitsu translate Tutorials into Japanese. I will be using screen capture videos, demonstrating the stages in setting up a Moodle course and adding some forums, quizzes, and word/htlm resources in the very near future. I plan to get to work on this as soon as Moodle 1.2 comes out. Tools SNAGIT I plan to use Snagit which is a good product especially designed for making tutorials, for example to explain the use of software. Snagit has a variety of capture modes and a a fairly usable web page creation tool into which it will automatically embed the various types of screen capture (particularly screen capture images and videos). Snagit costs $25 for an academic, one-user licence. In order to purchase the academic version you have to get in touch by email and send credit card details as an attachement (perhaps even a password protected word file for those that are wary of this method) since their online purchasing pages only allow purchase at the slightly higher non-academic price. Here is an example of a page using Snagit in Japanese. Here is one of the screen capture movies that it created . You do not need Japanese on your computer to install the latter. BLOG Who needs a blog when you have Moodle? Alas Moodle does not yet have quite the same accessability as a Blog (having the requirement to login , which I guess puts off many) so I may be adding a tips and tricsk page to my existing blog or perhaps create a moodle blog using either Movable Type or Nucleus . But perhaps this is just a winge to encourage a more bloggish feel to moodle. You know they say that a majority of surfers do not bother to view a page if it takes more than X seconds to load. How many more surfers will not bother with a page if it includes a requirement to log in, especially in a language with with they are not familiar, and even in one which they are. SWISH I can also use SWISH for creating FLASH presentations. I have SWISH2, which seems to work fine. I am not sure of the advantages of their new product SWISHmax. Japanese Forums I will continue posting to the Japanese forums here and also to the ones that have been set up in more detail by Professor Joji Kariya at my Yamaguchi University.",

Quoting the FAQ: \"If you don't see anything on your user profile pages to let you upload user image s then it's usually because GD is not enabled on your server. GD is a library that allows image processing. Make sure GD has been included in your PHP installation. You can check this by going into the Admin -> Configuration -> Variables page and looking for the gdversion setting. This\nsetting is chosen automatically every time you visit that page. If it\nshows GD version 1 or version 2 then everything should be fine. Save that configuration page and go back to your user profile. If\nMoodle thinks GD is not installed, then you will need to install it. On\nWindows this is usually a matter of \"turning on\" the module in PHP (see\nthe installation instructions for help). On Unix you may need to re-compile PHP with arguments something like this (note the ones in bold ): Remember to re-visit the Moodle configuration page after making any changes to PHP so it can pick up the correct version of GD.\"",

I have a question about this sentence in the Introduction : \"You are allowed to copy, use and modify Moodle provided that you agree to: provide the source to others ; not modify or remove the original license and copyrights , and apply this same license to any derivative work .\" The first thing agreed to is offset with a semicolon, but the other two are separated by a comma. Am I missing something? I can understanding choosing either a comma or a semicolon, but I think it would flow better if one or the other was used in both places. 2. A general note about the font - perhaps it is just my system, but I noticed that the difference between bolded text and regular text is vanishingly small and quite difficult to detect. I can barely see it, and I think the distinction might be lost on users with less than perfect vision. This may be a limitation of the font itself, however, so I am not sure if anything can really be done besides choosing another font. I am curious if others see the same issue. 3. On the Features page , I noticed that some listed features end with a period, and some do not. I think it would flow more smoothly if the choice were made one way or the other, and used consistently throughout the document. -Beth",

From the front page, this tries to save file.php not the actually file; from a directory resource, it saves the actual file. For lots of files, especially pdf, it's normally quicker to download and open, rather than open in a browser window. Actually it's really that I get fed up with the time it takes acrobat reader to open files and it's quicker to download and open with Foxit pdf reader (windows) or xpdf (linux) Actually, anyone else wonder how acrobat reader became bloatware. It's purpose in life - render .pdf files to screen. Why does it take so long to start? Andy D",

Some of my students found the explaination of the steps for new account creation difficult to understand, because they have so little experience with computers or the internet. While most of the editing was simplifying and clarifying the Japanese, I made a structural change that may be helpful for the English too. Seven seperate steps were too many for my students to conceptualize, so I broke it down into the three main steps . This may be helpful for English speakers as well, so I tried to adapt the simplified version from Japanese back into English: Hi! For full access to courses you'll need to take a minute to create a new account for yourself on this web site. A course may also have a one-time \"enrolment key.\" Here are the steps: 1. Create Account Fill out the New Account form with your details. 2. Confirm Account An email will be immediately sent to your email address. Read your email, and click on the web link it contains. Your account will be confirmed and you will be logged in. 3. Enrol in Course Select the course you want to participate in. If you are prompted for an \"enrolment key,\" use the one given by your teacher. This will \"enrol\" you in the course. This will enrol you in the course, so can now access the full course.

Obviously it becomes a burden on the .org admins to deal with versions, updates, typos, etc.. .and not practical for them to give teacher rights to every person who puts together a nice little piece of documentation or supporting material. At the same time, hosting locally has its drawbacks- especially when you consider server rights, movement of faculty, and that sort of thing. So could we get a new forum here that is specifically for such things (either as attachments, or hyperlinks to pages/files)?  This particular forum could allow for larger attachments, and then follow-ups (like notifications of typos, suggestions, etc...) could easily be replies to the corresponding post.

The number of errors is the proporcional sum of the items that aren't in the assignemet.

          "Text": "Hello Sean Thanks for your response. I'll try to answer your question as best I can. First of all - this forum is for the development of a tutorial for teachers so they can learn to use Moodle, primarily as a technical platform - and that will then logically lead to using the platform pedagogically. So I think your question belongs e g in the Moodle forum for teaching strategies. To my experience one difficulty (amongst many) when you want to study or evaluate online education is getting access. In many cases you would have to enroll as a student in order to find out what's 'inside' so to speak. With a scientific approach you might be allowed to do research having access to key persons behind the education and then you could reach a deeper understanding of content, structure, didactic strategies etc. Personally I think that education should be planned, not as standardized and for mass distribution, but rather as adapted to the context , the current situation, well-defined goals and unique target groups. The teacher/educator/coach etc under such circumstances needs to be one of the main course developers together with a network of colleagues and people with various kinds of expertise. This is a huge undertaking for which you need a lot of (pedagogical) knowledge and experience, time and a flexible platform for distribution of education. In my opinion Moodle fills many of the requirements for such a platform. Within the Moodle community some people have suggested the exchange of courses, content of courses, parts of courses and perhaps the mutual development of courses. That is to say not just Open Source but Open Course as well. Why not? The Moodle community is still a young one though so it will probably take some time before we get there, provided people want to go in that direction. Down below here I have collected some web addresses that should be relevant for your needs but I have not checked all of them myself very thoroughly. The first one is to the IT-center of Stockholm. http://itc.edu.stockholm.se/flex/ They offer the kind of courses you describe. The site is in Swedish but you can, if you like, log in as a guest 'gäst', choose a course 'kurs' e g English A 'engelska A' , and then go to course 'till kurs'. From there you can study how the course is organized. Choose part of course 'Välj kursavsnitt'. From then on they communicate in English as well. I think they have a good standard structure for their courses. How it works in practice I don't know. In the case of Stockholm they have created their own platform and they have their own servers and all. Another municipality in Sweden used a commercial platform. When their supplier went bankrupt they became aware of the problem of dependency Here are some more adresses, the first three are general, the others more specific.

I've not looked at the db struct/code of moodle yet but if the help pages used code that allowed the help pages to be edited it would make the documentation process  more accessible to those who may not feel comfortable in digging around in directories and html to make the necessary changes.

Click DB Management (beside PHPMyAdmin). EasyPHP also gives the option of providing some pages in English. Presumably other languages will be available soon. Perhaps this point could be inserted before point 7. http://www.easyphp.org/telechargements/dn.php?F=indexUS_1.7 gives the download of a small zipped folder which gives English versions of www and home folder in the EasyPHP1-7 folder.
