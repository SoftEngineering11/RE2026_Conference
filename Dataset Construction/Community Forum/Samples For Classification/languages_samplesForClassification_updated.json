          "Text": "Dear Moodlers, There are 212 language packs available for Moodle. Translating the Moodle interface is done on a voluntary basis by Moodle community members, Moodle partners, Moodle enthusiasts etc. The lead of every language pack is the language pack maintainer, who checks every contribution to the language pack and releases it to the world. Very often, language pack maintainers do a lot if not most of the translation work themselves. This year I have tried to contact language pack maintainers who seemed to have left. This is normal - people move on with their lives, interests and things to spend time on change. But it's nice if it is clear for everyone if a language pack is not maintained any more. So it's clear now. Check your language on https://lang.moodle.org/local/amos/credits.php . If it is not maintained, read https://docs.moodle.org/en/Maintaining_a_language_pack and if you feel like it is something you would like to do, send me a message and improve the translation you need. Kind regards Koen",

We are currently maintaining several languages, and the customizable translations offered through the language packs have been working great so far. The issue at hand was found by looking at the following three - Norwegian (nb), English (en) and New Norwegian (nn). When changing a certain string (core -> nocourses), the translation loads as expected in NB and EN, but in NN it does not change. I understand that NN is considered a child language by Moodle, and this may explain this mentioned behaviour. I tried searching the docs, code and admin possibilities to change this behaviour but wasnt able to. My question then becomes - how can I make a chlid language (like nn) accept changes to every string?",

Enable Language Auto-Detection: In Site administration &gt; General &gt; Language settings, enable the \"Language autodetect\" option. This will attempt to detect the user's preferred language based on their browser settings. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 2.

Install and Configure Language Packs: Ensure that the desired language packs are installed and configured in Moodle. [1, 1, 6, 6] 4. Consider Guest Access: If you want to allow users to access some content without logging in, ensure that guest access is enabled and that language selection is available for guests as well.

It's another to display content applicable to them in their language. I am not sure how you would do that if you have separate courses in French and English. You can use the Multi-language content filter to translate content in the same course so that users will automatically see the content in their chosen language. On Moodle.Academy we use the content translation plugin, so if a course has been translated from the original English (not all have, as we rely on volunteers) then you get the same effect.",

These are not just translations of the same content — each course has its own structure, activities , quizzes, badges, and certificates tailored to its language. My objective is to find a way to display only the relevant course to each user, based on the language they select during registration: English-speaking users should see the English course, and French-speaking users should see the French one. I understand the advantages of the multi-language content filter and the content translation plugin when using a single course, but in my case, I specifically need to manage access and visibility between two distinct courses. I’m open to any suggestions — plugins, scripts, or theme customizations — that could help achieve this. Thanks again for your support!",

          "Text": "Hi Abir - assuming I have understood your details correctly, then.... The crux here, is people are not initially enrolled onto the courses, but have to select the course they want and enrol onto it by either self enrolment or payment (or something else). And the key challenge for you is to show the English people the English course and the French people the French course. The way I would go about this, is I would create my own 'Course catalogue page' which would be used to advertise the courses to the users, and I would have 2 versions of this - one for English, and one for French. If you use the Filtercodes plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes you could use a combination of {coursecards} or {coursecards id} or {coursecard id} to show what you want as cards. What you then do is use the multilanguage plugin - https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_multilang2 and use this to set up a differentiated menu item pointing to the 2 pages you have set up e.g. {mlang other}<a href=\" URL of English page\">Available courses</a>{mlang}{mlang fr}<a href=\"URL of French page\">Cours disponibles</a>{mlang} With this the users would be directed to the relevant course catalogue based on their language selection. Obviously they could still access the other language catalogue page, or the other language courses directly - (if they follow a direct link to it), which we cannot avoid, but hopefully this would get most people to the right place. ---- If your courses are 'self enrolment' then an alternative approach would be to use Cohorts - what you are wanting is to have dynamic cohorts set up so the English people are in a cohort called 'English' and the French people are in a cohort called 'French'. Once you have people in the right cohorts, you can set the self enrolment mechanism up in each of the courses so people can only self enrol if they are in a certain cohort. I don't think we can dynamically create the cohorts based on the user's language setting, but if you add a user profile field called 'preferred language' where they chose either English or French, you could then use either https://moodle.org/plugins/local_cnw_smartcohort or https://moodle.org/plugins/local_profilecohort to dynamically manage the cohorts for you. Obviously, by using a profile field to select language rather than the proper language preference is going to have other downsides, so not as keen on this suggestion. Or - (not sure who hosts your Moodle, and whether they do this or not), but I don't think it would be much work for someone to develop a plugin that dynamically puts people into a cohort based on their language preference (either by forking one of the above, or creating from scratch), so similar to the above, but keeping the use of the preferred language option.",

Install a plugin to enroll users based on a profile field and choose the appropriate menu option for the course. To allow users to enroll themselves.

The only way I was able to show the original version was to add a translation for german and ticking the \"same as original\" option. Do I always have to define a \"translation\" for the original version to show up? I hope this isn't a duplicate, but I wasn't able to figure out if this is the intended behavior using the manual/google. Thank you!",

If you're looking to kind of create your own special message (instead of modifying an existing language string), consider if the Filter Codes plugin would work for what you're aiming to do. If you want a list of all placeholders available in your language pack, you can search for it (Site Admin - Language Customization) by selecting all possible strings and typing $a-> into the \"only strings containing\" field, then click Show strings. You get a list of maybe 18 pages where place holders are used. However, place holders aren't necessarily able to be used in 'any' language string or outside of the \"Language Customization\" admin page -- I think they are specific to the particular language strings in which they were created for use in (but I'm not a developer, so I'm just guessing here). For example, I wanted to add a place holder into the daily forum email notices - This placeholder works fine in a different language string, but when I pasted it into one of the forum's language strings it unfortunately did not work there in that forum language string (the email just displayed the placeholder). I've never tried to use it elsewhere, such as in a course custom field.",

The same text, but with the Multi-Language Content (v2) tags works as expected. (shown under the black horizontal rule...) I note that the new TinyMCE editor has a nasty habit of inserting characters to sanitize HTML which further complicates troubleshooting the standard moodle language content tag, and have disabled it on my site for now. I have largely been using the standard moodle language content tag thinking it should always just \"work\" as it is part of moodle, and so  not dependent on the Multi-Language Content (v2) plugin being updated. But is it time to bite the bullet and switch? It would allow less technical editors to make updates to the site... I use Cloze questions extensively but I believe Cloze questions do not work with the Multi-Language Content (v2) plugin? Are there any other gotcha's that I should be aware of? Should I just be looking at switching completely to the Multi-Language Content (v2) plugin, except for Cloze questions (for now)? Are there plans to make the Multi-Language Content (v2) plugin work with cloze questions? Are there plans to make the Multi-Language Content (v2) plugin part of standard moodle?

Upgrade the moodle 3.9 site to 4.1.9+ version is not an option because I need to apply the 3.9 language pack to a brand new 4.1.9+ moodle in order to test everything BEFORE upgtrading the old 3.9 to the new version. I can access the moodle directory and the moodledata too if necessary. Can anyone help? Many thanks to everyone",

I then copy the entire moodle/lang folder to MoodleData/lang. Is any of this redundant or unnecessary? What brought this to my attention was I just did a compare from our files to a new download of Moodle itself and all relevant extra plugins, and we keep many more files in moodle/lang/en.

I've looked through the language customization area a bit, but there are so many options there and I don't seem to be finding it.

So far, I've been putting the KANJI names (Lastname and Firstname) in their profiles and their ROMAJI names in the \"Lastnamephonetic and Firstnamephonetic\" fields. I can get all 4 of these fields to display by using the \"Fullname\" settings in Moodle and specifying those names. However, is it possible to have the Lastname and Firstname (in KANJI) display when the user's LANG settings are Japanese, and conversely display the Lastnamephonetic and Firstnamephonetic when the user's LANG settings are English? So far I don't see an easy way to implement this... but if anyone has a suggestion I would be most appreciative. Thanks, -Thom EDIT: For the record, using \"{mlang ja}ローソン{mlang}{mlang other}RAWSON{mlang}\" (Multilang v2 filter), works for displaying but ruins other things like \"online users\" block and downloading CSV etc.",

I think that there is some cron job, that sends this notifications, and because method get_string is used by cron, not by logged in user, it gets default language (PL in my case).

If you have no database access, then you will need to go to someone who does and fix the table. And also fix all such tables that do not have full unicode support.

          "Text": "Hi Larvi, This is the method that I use to find any string in Moodle's English language pack: If you don't already have, download a copy of the Moodle application files to your computer. You can get this from https://github.com/moodle/moodle . You don't need to install it. For best results, use the same version that you are using on your Moodle site. Use a file search tool such as the free version of FileLocator Pro for Windows, or a command line tool such as grep for Linux/MacOS, or even a code editor such as VS Code, to search all of the .php files for a common part of the English version of the string of text which appears in the email. This will enable you to locate the component name and string ID. Do not edit the language files directly as these get overwritten each time you update Moodle or the language pack. Instead, customize the string using Moodle's language customization tool in the instance of your live Moodle site. Feel free to ask if you need help locating a search tool for your operating system. Just let us know which operating system you are using and whether you prefer to use a command line tool or one that is graphical based. Hope you find this helpful. Best regards, Michael Milette",

          "Text": "Hi Gopi, In order to show a course in multiple languages: You must have language packs installed for each language. You must have the appropriate multi-language filter installed and enabled. I recommend the Multi-Language Content v2 plugin as it is easier to work with the plain text {mlang} tags but\nyou could use the one bundled with Moodle which uses HTML span tags. The course content must be tagged for each language. The content is not automatically translated for you when you switch language. In cases where you cannot use language filter tags, you can use the Restriction by language plugin. This is useful for things like files, folders and URL type activities where\nyou cannot use language tagging. Force language should NOT be used unless your course is only available in one language on a muti-language enable Moodle site. This feature does not forces the language of the course but the language of the Moodle user interface which in turn can\nalso display the course in the same language. Assuming you have your Moodle site and your course already setup for multi-language support, switching Moodle's UI language should also change the language of the content of your course. You can force the language of Moodle by adding a lang=xx (where xx is a supported language on your Moodle site) to the URL of your course. This can be useful if you want to give someone a direct link to your course in a specific language. Hope you find something helpful in all of this. Best regards, Michael",

          "Text": "Hi Marini, The capability it is looking for is tool/customlang:view The first thing I would try is to log into Moodle as an Administrator and use the Purge All Cache option in Moodle. You can do this by going to Site Administration > Development > Purge All  Caches. Then clear the cache and cookies in your web browser. Sometimes these  steps can help. Next, ensure that your web hosting is properly configured and meets Moodle's system requirements. You can easily do this by going to Site Administration > Server > Environment. Ensure that there are no warnings or errors and address any that show up. Make sure that your hosting platform has at least 1-2 CPUs, 1-2 GB of memory if running on a Linux server or 6-8 GB if running on Windows, and 20 GB of free disk space. Ensure that you have a swap file setup. I know a lot of providers hosting on SSD drives don't like this but it will save your site if it runs out of memory. Nobody likes running out of memory or disk space. Check with your hosting service provider to confirm all this. Note that you will need more than this depending on the number of concurrent active users you have and the number and size of your courses. However, if it is just you  and up to about 20 other people right now, you should be fine with the minimum. Next, make sure cron is working and is set to run every 1 minute. You can check this by going to Site Administration > Notifications. If cron is not running regularly, a warning will be displayed on this page. If you don't see anything about cron on that page, it is likely configured and working just fine. If your problem persists, something likely went wrong during or since your Moodle 3.9.3 installation. Did you modify any roles or install any 3rd party plugins? This section of the Moodle code has not changed in 5 years and I use it regularly, so I know it works. If someone installed Moodle for you or you are using a different version of Moodle such as MoodleCloud, Moodle Workplace, Totara or IOMAD, the language editing functionality may be restricted by your hosting service provider. Assuming you installed the regular Moodle 3.9.3 yourself, as a Moodle Administrator, you could try to fix the capabilities yourself by editing/resetting the system roles. If you cannot do this either, I suspect that this may not be the only problem on your site and continuing with it could result in other problems being uncovered down the road which may not be so easy to fix by then. Unless you can determine what caused the problem, as a last resort, you might want to consider simply deleting your recently created site and starting over. Hope you found something useful in all of this. Best regards, Michael Milette",

I discover that about 30% of my target language has been translated and contributed to the moodle community, so I downloaded this language pack and start from there. (this language pack has 192 files) After finishing the translation, I added 319 more files to the language pack, which in total there are 511 files in this newly-translated language pack. I purge the language cache and everything seems to work just fine. And there comes my problem I often check the site once a day and every time I check, the total language files have been reduced to 192 files (to the original language pack from Moodle Community). I not really sure what happens to the rest of the files and why Moodle keeps resetting the language pack to the original 192 files I store the language file in the moodledata/lang/{{language_code}} folder. Can anyone help me in this situation? Thank you in advance",

You can also find a good explanation at: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=203557#p888288 Important note: You must group your menu items by language.

Do you mean core language strings changed and in a way that they are now wrong in the translation? -> in that case the best approach is to change them on https://lang.moodle.org . That way all users of your language benefit from your work and you don't have to maintain it. Do you mean that the wording in the language pack is not according to your needs? -> In that case make the changes locally, using the language tool in your Moodle installation. The changes will survive upgrades of your site and you can move them to other installations too - they are in the moodledata/lang/xx_local folder.",

Each choice has been given the language <span> tag to translate it between english and chinese. Eg <span lang=\"en\" class=\"multilang\">Employee</span><span lang=\"zh_cn\" class=\"multilang\">员工</span> <span lang=\"en\" class=\"multilang\">Customer</span><span lang=\"zh_cn\" class=\"multilang\">终端用户</span> When I upload a new user via CSV file I have a column called 'profile_field_UserType' in my CSV which contains the value: <span lang=\"en\" class=\"multilang\">Employee</span><span lang=\"zh_cn\" class=\"multilang\">员工</span> When I upload the users preview page says 'Invalid user field: UserType'. I debugged the code and found that the problem is happening in the function convert_external_data() in /user/profile/field/menu/field.class.php - it is returning each menu option by stripping out the <span> tags. This means that the upload routine\nis comparing: <span lang=\"en\" class=\"multilang\">Employee</span><span lang=\"zh_cn\" class=\"multilang\">员工</span> with Employee员工 so it's always returning false and not allowing the user to be added. My question is, how do we get around uploading new users, with custom profile fields which contain multi-language span tags, into the LMS without doing some major re-coding? My current Moodle version is 3.3.9 Build 20181112 I hope I have given enough information. Thanks Julie",

I mean that they don't care at all - they just want to visit site (platform) and do what they are asked. So, steps should be clearly defined without any dependence of the software language.

It works very fine and I have adapted all my workflow to it, exporting headers and contents from Filemaker already with the {mlang en}xxxxxxxx{mlang}{mlang pt_br}xxxxxxxxxx{mlang} code.\nIt would be perfect without some failing filter situations. Those are: 1) the header of Glossary dont work with auto-link feature; 2) Competencies and activities display on both admin and user side without filtering. I mean without filtering that display like:\n{mlang en}Competency{mlang}{mlang pt_br}Competência{mlang}\nThis happens on both languages and I really need to find a solution. I dont know if is a configuration problem or if is a script limitation, because the filter is activated and on both header and content.\nWhat is strange for me is that in the Administration, where Competencies are created with the mlang code, everything shows fine changing the text properly when I switch language, but on the site side is a disaster, when I open Competencies or Learning plan.

If I search any word in latin letters there is no problem with the search. Any idea how to make the glossary search for Chinese characters?",

The English (en) is implicit parent of all language packs in Moodle (so if a string is not translated, the English original is used). In most places in the code, if the parent language is reported to be English (en), it is actually interpreted as if there was no parent language. And I believe this is what is happening here. The code here https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.1.1/filter/multilang/filter.php#L101-L108 finds that there is no \"en_us\" multilang part defined and it does not use the \"en\" part as expected, but it uses the first one on the list. As a solution, I would recommend to use the English part as the first one in the multilang block.",

As I written in above post I already solved and succeed to display Months in Arabic but after check I knew that all strings are wrong so I just change that Arabic string nothing else but it display as it is as I modified last. So Helen we can convert Months name using str_replace(); function in moodlelib.php as I done. But My problem is something else. I don't know whether its cache or coming from else? Even I searched in my whole project the string 'January' its only in lib/moodlelib.php which is mine. Still facing same problem !!!",

Secondly, is there a chance that the old hardcoded arabic string got actually saved into the database ? Where exactly are you seeing it? If it is somehow stored in the database and displayed from it, it would explain why you still see the old text even after reverting the code. I am not aware of any cache that might affect this. But again, it depends on how many hacks like this are actually there on the site. Can't help much here, sorry.",

Ideally the strings could all be exported in a format, such as XML , sent out for translation and then imported for a second language. Short of that - at least a way to export the text content and some sensible way to bring it back into the course either as a new course in a different language or contained within language tags. Or is there a better solution?",

I made a small hack to the language filter to allow it to apply to whole <div>s surrounding entire blocks of content which I recently presented at the OER15 conference and will be talking about at MoodleMoot UK/ IE in May. The hack can be found at https://github.com/roelmann/moodle-filter_multilang When we did this ourselves we simply copied the content text out into a word processor to send off to external translation and then brought it back in to the editor and wrapped it in the appropriate language div as required. Besides the technical issues, you may have more difficulty finding a translation service that will be happy to deal with an xml file rather than a basic word processed one, so you may end up converting back and for anyway.",

The XML (also smaller parts like question bank  or glossaries) can be converted into XLIFF using the Rainbow/Okapi tools The XLIFF can be translated with professional ( & free & opensource) translation tools tools like OmegaT The output goes via Okapi back into a moodle backup file This can be imported into moodle with restore. Don't start, if it is one Course. It will take you some hours to understand the software, but if you have 3 languages or more, and if new courses are coming up again and again, this would be the workflow. Translation Agencies know XLIFF - its their standard.

          "Text": "Hi Deborah, We use the filter_multilangsecond by Vanyo Georgiev to manage multilingual courses. It supports inline filtering like the original multilang plugin but, like Richard's solution above, it also supports blocks. However, unlike the HTML syntax used in those filters, multilangsecond optionally supports a non-HTML tag syntax. It looks like this in inline: {mlang en}English{mlang}{mlang fr}French{mlang} or like this to encompass entire blocks with any kind of content similar to what Richard is doing: {mlang en} English {mlang}{mlang fr} French {mlang} What our course creators really like about this is the fact that 1) it is a simpler and shorter syntax, 2) they can actually see where the tags are in the editor and 3) they don't need to know HTML. It is so simple that you can sometimes even get translators to add the tags for you. Iñaki Arenaza recently released a demo video of his efforts to take this approach one step further by adding editor integration so that his {multilang en} tags can actually be added using the editor's toolbar. Hope this helps. Best regards, Michael Milette",

Sometimes soon I'll update the site to M 2.7.3, and in a few months from now I'll upgrade it to M 2.8.x Is there an easy way to list the differences between two Moodle versions for a given language pack ('fr' in my case), so that I learn which are the strings that are new, that are dropped, that are changed ... ie which possibly need some work from me on the language personalisation ? Thanks in advance for your suggestions, -michel",

          "Text": "Hi Michel, Between the point versions of Moodle (2.7.1, 2.7.2, ...) there is no versioning done: The language pack evolves on the pace of the modifications of Moodle in that version and the time the language pack maintainer and contributors have to spend on improving the language pack. Those changes can be significant, eg if the language pack was not complete at release time. I don't see any way to know what is changed between point releases, except by checking the logs of the translation portal ( http://lang.moodle.org - login, contribute, logs) or download and keep the snapshots of the language pack and use some diff tool on them. For what is changed between releases (2.7, 2.8) , there is a tool on the language portal to see the current differences for a given language ( http://lang.moodle.org - login, contribute, stage, compare strings at two branches) It's a long time ago since I used the tool for local language pack modification. Doesn't it have a search tool to look for a word in a string? If not, the language portal has one ( http://lang.moodle.org - login, contribute, translator).",

I figured that I could: download the zip file for my version locate the files to which he made changes (very clearly identified on his github page) Re-zip the files Install using the new zip file. Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple.  I ended up getting two errors: File version.php not found Missing English language folder BOTH of these DO, in fact, exist in my new zip file, so I'm confused. What am I missing? Thanks for your time and consideration.",

I want to add some custom language strings to a site - specifically, I want to add some country codes not present in \"countries.php\". I thought this would be as easy as creating a new custom language pack containing nothing more than a \"countries.php\" file with the new strings. But, no matter what I do, none of the new strings will show up. I can change existing ones this way with no problem. Is there a correct way to add additional language strings into a language pack?

But countries.php are handled in a special way. The file acts as a list of known countries, too. And because no language pack (be it a translation or a language customization) is allowed to provide extra strings (i.e. those not defined in the master 'en'), adding more countries into customized countries.php won't work. The cleanest hack coming to my mind is to either customize `core_string_manager_standard::get_list_of_countries()` (as Tim suggests) or to add extra countries to lang/en/countries.php. In either case, you will need to change standard Moodle file.",

We translate, review old strings, proofreading thounsand of strings... and it's mandatory for us perform some cycles of stash and stages until we reach 100 % of compliance. It's necessary for us an active coordination and this must be reflected by credits, which is not the case actually. @Ramón Parada Hi Ramon, All my respectfull but if you have not actually the time or interest for coordinate the galician effort, can you left the coordination in the hads which is now working in it?

          "Text": "I'm having a problem using the multi-lang filter in the site news on the front page (moodle 2.4.3). I created a post with site news, used the span class=\"multilang\" lang=\"xx\" syntax. The problem is that the site news is abbreviated on the front page with a link to \"read the rest of this topic.\" But the truncation appears to be done before the multi-lang filter is applied, so the last paragraph for one language is displayed in the language of the first language, regardless of which language is selected. Let me explain that in more detail.  My site news post has two paragraphs and I'm displaying in three languages.  If I put the languages in the order of english, spanish, french of each paragraph, then it looks right in english and spanish.  If I switch to french then the last paragraph appears in english.  If I change the order of languages in the post, the language affected changes.  My conclusion is that the post is truncated before the second paragraph's text in french, so when the filter is applied it doesn't see the translation, and defaults to the first language.  If I click on \"read the rest...\" then all of it appears in the correct language. I could fall back to using just an html block instead of site news on the front page, as the information won't be changing very rapidly, but I was hoping to use the site news to make it a bit easier to manage.",

The expected result is that when the user change to another page, he/she can always see the HTML block, where the language switching suffix does not change but only the filepath, filename and itemid.

When I installed Russian or German it is the same - all the strings are translated except the date which is displayed in English. I turned on language debugging.

So, I could make it resistant to this sort of bugs but I would rather prefer if that line was removed from the block code (and thanks to Jürg's report, we now know the source of the problem is there).

Im working with the latest version of Moodle and Im very interrested to try different plugins. A lot of the Swedish language package are missing translations which is not so strange. I know how to use customization tool and I have also registred at lang.moodle.org. My idea: It would be very nice if language translations could be uploaded and downloaded direct from/to Moodle. Now its easier to fix missing strings locally  than to collaborate with others. It could be so \"easy\" that you are asked to contribute after you made some translations. In the other way it might be possible to see different translations in the customization view that you could choose from. This might be a hard thing to do",

The language thing is a bit obscure to me so I'd like some help understanding this. I use moodle 2.2.2+. The plugin I have added adds a button within the TinyMCE editor. This button has a tooltip that I believe should be provided by the corresponding plugin's language file. Now, which one is that ? I have tried entering the tooltip values in: the plugins own lang file: lib/editor/tinymce/tiny_mce/3.4.9/plugins/paintweb/langs/en.js in the TinyMCE's lang file: lib/editor/tinymce/lang/en/editor_tinymce.php in the editor's lang file: lang/en/editor.php None of these seem to make a difference. Here is what I entered: in the js file: tinyMCE.addI18n('en.paintweb',{toolbarButton: 'Some text'}); in the php files: $string['paintweb:toolbarButton'] = 'Some text'; In the editor the tooltip value displayed for the button remains: paintweb.toolbarButton Could you please help me understand where I should enter these values and how to have moodle reflect the changes ?I'm pretty sure I updated the page and was not looking a cached page. Thanks in advance, Patrick Juhl",

Anyway, this xml file could be too complex to be translated, because translators would find fields that should be translated and other fields that should not be modified. I think it would be a great idea to develope an export/import utility with only the data to be managed by translators. Meanwhile, it could be easier to translate files from the elements of the course with export/import utilities.

          "Text": "We see more and more Moodle systems that are using Moodle courses mostly or partially for communities. The terminology 'course' and' teacher' can create confusion. Koen prepared a new language pack for German this week (thanks) and we started with the adaption. The package Deutsch community (de_comm) is a subpackage for de_du which is a subpackage for de.  Its available in the language system, and can be used in each Moodle system now. What did we change: English German standard German Community Course Kurs Raum Teacher Trainer/in Moderator/in Topic Themenbereich Arbeitsbereich Changes are done only for elements that are visible for students only. Activities that are typically used in teaching/learning situations are not changed. I.e. quiz, assignment, grades. Totally we changed  +260 strings. I think we will have overseen some strings. This will be corrected continously if you send us an information or we see it while using the package. How did we work with this package translation? We opened AMOS language system in two browser windows. In the first window we searched for the term 'kurs' in de-package. In the second window we searched for 'course' in the de_comm package. We had to search  for the english term because the package was empty. Then we worked through all strings and copied the required elements from de to de_comm and changed them or wrote short strings directly into de_comm window. We made this process file by file for core (moodle.php)  and core_admin. In the next step we searched in de_comm for missing strings with 'course' for all standard lang files. As result we got more than 800 strings, but only ~ 100 were relevant. Finally we installed the new language package on a Moodle system and checked several pages. We found a dozen more strings we had to change. The total amount of time for an experencied translator was around 6 -7 hours. For German language we have now four lang packages: Standard German: de = using the formal 'Sie' (you) Deutsch du: de_du = using the informal 'du' (you) Deutsch community: de_comm = using Raum (course) and (Moderator (teacher) and du (you) Deutsch kids: de_kids: simple German for primary schools and students learning German as a second language",

The upgrade process just renames the directory with your local modifications of the language pack but you have to prepare the correct syntax for the local string files for 2.x manually (alternatively you can re-edit them via the inbuilt tool that saves them in correct syntax). Note there are several differences in how strings are formatted in 1.x and 2.x, most notably in the $a placeholders handling (must be wrapped in curly braces in 2.x) and no more exceptions for the percentual sign (no more need to have %% in 2.x to display %).

The translation tool then works with the strings in the database and the customized strings can be then written back to the files in the local language folders. The initial checkout when there are no strings registered yet in the database may take a longer time. Later checkouts are usually shorter as only the new and modified strings are updated. At all sites I tested the new tool at, the initial checkout took reasonable amount of time - up to twenty seconds or so. At your machine, the script was not able to finish the complete checkout within the maximum execution time defined in your php.ini. The fact it took so long at your machine may indicate that your database performance is not very good and you should consider some performance tweaking. Sure, there could be a progress bar or something to indicate what is going on. And the script could even try to detect the upcoming maximum execution time deadline. Anyway, please try to just re-run the checkout several times. If you have access to your database, try to get the count of already checked-out strings using \n```text\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM mdl_report_customlang;\n```\n You should see the increasing number of records after each run of the checkout and you need to reach almost 16000 records before the translation tool can be launched.

In English the text is: \"API logging is on\", but in Dutch is reads: \"API loggen staat uit\", which means exactly the opposite. You can click this line of information to toggle the API Debugger. When you do this, in English it reads \"-->API logging is off\". In Dutch it reads \"--> Cursus\", which means \"Course\". I have at least one other spot that I have the impression the information displayed in Dutch contains a placeholder that shouldn't be there.

I ask this because in Moodle 2.0 each core theme is capable of holding language strings in the lang/en/theme_themename.php. So in a core theme like Splash for instance, which has a custom Login, all the language strings associated with the Login can be found in splash/lang/en/theme_splash.php. Also, which may or my not be relevant as I am not sure how knowledgeable you are about Moodle and how Language packs work especially if you have been editing them, but like all files they need refreshing so to speak. You do this in the same why you add a Language pack, except you choose update language packs. But as I said at the start this is probably something you may/or may not have done already. HTH Mary",

I have now grepped all the files in both the domain and the database directories and my \"string\" that I want to edit does not exist in ANY of the files. Here's what's really got me stumped: When I view the page source for the login page, I SEE THE TEXT I want to change. When I edit index.php, the text is NOT THERE. This leads me to assume index.php calls another file where this string resides but I cannot find that file. See grepping efforts above. If I knew PHP well enough, maybe I could sleuth it out... Incidentally, the text doesn't seem to be assigned to a string identifier; it's just text tagged with <span>. So it seems I don't actually have a language customization question after all (?).",

Do I have to ftp it to the lang directory? Now, having focus on that file brings up some more questions: 2. The string 'firstdayofweek', what is that for? It must be something different from the calendar settings here: moodle.webroot/admin/settings.php?section=calendar 3. Can I find a list with the codes somewhere? I would like to know how the month code is, what is the code for month number, shortened & full? 4. What is %p used for? 5. The string called 'listsep', what is the purpose with that? I ask because I get confused when I want to enrol users uploading a comma separated text file. Moodle (1.9) suggest I use ';' as separator, but it only works if I use ','.  And actually in 1.9's langconfig.php ',' is translated to ';'. This translation is in Moodle 2.0 too, I think it was just imported from 1.9, but maybe it is adviceable that I change this string in AMOS ?",

I hope you will understand my problem... I have displayed the languages menu on all the pages of the site but I have problems with the display of the language chosen on pages others than the homepage. I specify that I have this problem only in not connected mode (when users are logged-in they can see without any problem all pages in the language set in their profile). Pb n°1 - When I change the language since an internal page, I return automatically to the homepage. What do I have to modify in the code to have the current/active page simply translated in the chosen language? (Without return in the homepage) It Is possible? Pb n°2 - When I'm logged-off and choose a language since the homepage, the homepage turns without pb into the chosen language, but if I click a link of my menu (which corresponds to a resource html common page), the page switch-back to the website's default language (english) and not in the language chosen in homepage. Why ? May I (and can I) deactivate the default language ? When users are logged-in, no pb. But how can anonymous users read any public page in the language they have chosen ? Thank you for your help.

To my disappointment, there were just several translated phrases in Bulgarian translation, so I set out and translated about 10% of all strings, related to the everyday use of the system (Users, Courses, Blogs, Forums, News and Calendar etc.) which suited the needs of my department fine. I wish to complete the translation though. So I want to ask several things: 1. How to find the person(s) working on it and how to contribute my part of the translated strings? 2. Is there any tool (or process) to merge translations if there are two intersecting sets of translations. 3. Should I contribute my translation now or should I wait several more weeks to get even more full translation?",

After updating language files in 2.0 only english help files are used even if in AMOS a old translation is avaialble. If new strings in AMOS are committed by us as official language translators when are they available for checking in a system via update of language pack? Or should we upload them manually now? If two translators are working in AMOS at the same time they can't see the stages from the other translator. Is this correct? \"Once the collaborating tool is ready, language pack maintainers will be able to review work from contributors before adding it to their language pack.\" (from ' http://docs.moodle.org/en/Translation_2.0#Using_the_AMOS_translation_tool' ) Is this just implemented?

For each language $string (meaning one word, or a group of words) you can create your own custom language file for each language you need for your courses. So you would need to compile these custom php files containing all the strings. And all you would need to do in the page you are working on would be to instead of a span would be <?php get_string('a sentence','mylangfile.php'): ?> where the completed language file 'mylangfile.php' is stored in your Moodledata file in each the relevant lang folder, or in the relevant lang folder of your theme when you come to use Moodle.2.0. Creating the individual files will be the big job, but the beauty of this is you are only having to write your original in English so the $string stays the same, all you need to change is it's equivalent in the language you need to have it displayed in but once created you can update them in a text editor like notepad and upload them to your Moodle site via Site Admin in Moodle 1.9x or upload them to your Theme folder in Moodle 2.0. as and when you need to. It actually works in a similar way to how I got my theme to handle menu titles, se my It's all Greek to me! post in the forum. Hope this helps. Mary",

          "Text": "Dear Ravishankar, I agree that Moodle is a learning environment that can and is being used in various educational and business setting. However, as a training professional, I am aware of the differences between adult learning and children learning, and the different roles expected from adult in the learning process, and from the ones that serve the role of instructors or facilitators. Furthermore, I do not only refer to adult vs. children learning. I also refer to differences between academic and business learning environments. Students in universities are called \"Students\" because their major interest in that context is learning. However, in a business setting, learning is not an activity on its own, it is one important activity related to the empolyee's goals, skills, etc. As I see Moodle gaining more strength and possibilites in the business world, I thought it might be a good step towards getting Moodle to be more relevant for commercial as well as non-profit organizations. Language is indeed just an \"external\" characteristic of an application such as Moodle, but still appearance and language do matter and do establish perceptions of such an application. I do think that to include Business-Oriented language packs, would make more organizations willing to consider Moodle as a platform to support business training - either for employees or clients/partners. Obviously, not just external features such as language (and more professional themes for that matter), need to be considered but also more features that support business oriented needs. These can include a more robust integration of online and instructor-led learning (blended learning). Face-to-Face module does provide some of these but I would like to see it and other business relevant modules grow and become more established, and integrated into core. Other examples can include a stronger personal learning plan, stronger report system, and other. It seems some will be addressed by Moodle 2.0. As I am not a programmer, I cannot help with the plug-ins and features. As for the language - I will look at what I have done so far and see if I can take out our specific-company translations and upload it for review if it makes any sense to others. Other opinions on the matter will be welcome...",

And I wonder how international business English is. Would we need an en_bus_utf8 and an en_us_bus_utf8 (or whatever we decide to call these). Anyway, my suggestion would be to have the discussion you started in the Moodle for Business Users forum, and actually start making the language pack.

Specially in a lot of description in moodle.php we think it will be better to describe some terms in an other way and to give a little more orientation. The process started very slow over the last weeks.",

It's all working fine, except that I just cant set it to work with Brazilian portuguese, or any other language beyond english, which is the default. I'm able to navigate to Language -> Language editing -> Current language and then change it to pt_br. Everything gets updated, but when I log out, everything becomes English again. I read on the docs and they say that could be related to eAccelerator. I have disabled it but still got no luck on this. Is anyone aware of a way to solve this? best regards, - Breno",

Well, that was the situation in Moodle 1.9. However, looking in CVS , only Vietnamese includes a styles.php file (last modified in 2005), and that only says \n```text\nbody,td,tr,li {\n font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;\n}\n```\n Which looks very similar to the CSS in the standard theme: \n```text\nbody, table, td, th, li {\n font-family:Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n}\n```\n I can't work out why this was introduced. ( http://cvs.moodle.org/moodle/theme/standard/config.php?r1=1.13&r2=1.14 does not help much.) The one thing that might need it is right-to-left languages. However, these days we have a better way to handle that, using an optional rtl.css file in the theme folder. So, I am proposing to remove this functionality from Moodle 2.0. If anyone objects to that, please explain why ASAP. Thanks.",

But the menu items are specified in a php file which is part of the theme and is not susceptible to the <multilanguage> tag. So ideally we need a theme switcher which installs a different menubar (ie in French) when French is selected as a language. Or is there a simple workaround I have missed?",

I have Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build 20090603) installed in my server . The installed languages are English and Spanish. I only use Spanish but, of course, English package can not be uninstalled. Spanish is the default language and I have the Automatic detection of language from the browser not actived. My problem is that when a user registers for the first time, his profile is created with English language by default so he sees everything in English. Anyone has any idea of what is it happening or what could I do to make Spanish the default language of new users? Thank you very much!",

If the internal emailing works under English, you probably have an SMTP server running at localhost (127.0.0.1). I have never heard about language specific problems with emailing.

Basically 300+ students have been added to a test language pack I was using and not the en language as specified in my enrollment file. I know that is a separate issue and one I will be looking into. In the meantime, what happens if I delete a language that users have selected in their profile as their preffered language ? Will it switch the site default of English or will I have to change every users preferences to remove the unwanted language ? I hope that makes some sort of sense. Any help is greatly appreciated.

At the San Francisco Moot I raised the following issue to Martin: since Moodle 2.0 breaks e.g. the php 4 compatibility and can be a really new start for a lot of things, why not break the backwards compatibility of the language packs too, do a search of all not used string, help files etc. and make the packs smaller for translators from new languages who start translating from 2.0 onwards (see MDL-15252 ).",

The fonts directory has as only purpose to give a home for fonts if Moodle has to generate text on a graph, e.g. in a survey. The display of the texts in Moodle is done client side by the browser. You set the preferred font via the Moodle theme, as described in my previous post, but the computer of the client needs to have that font installed on it. You can't install it through a web application like Moodle. It's great to see Moodle being used to maintain the use of languages with a very small number of speakers, but you will have to make your users install the right fonts, since there is, as far as I know, no general UTF8 font that contains all existing UTF8 characters.",

Note there are two folders named \"lang\" in Moodle: The first lang is a subdirectory of the Moodle application root (i.e. the folder where the Moodle source code is installed). This is called Moodle dirroot and is defined in Moodle config.php. The content of this directory should be: /admin /auth ... /iplookup /lang /en /en_utf8 README.txt /lib /login ... You should NOT put any additional language packs into the $CFG->dirroot/lang. Only /en and /en_utf8 are supposed to be there Additional lang packs should be installed into so called dataroot (also defined in config.php). You should see directories like /cache /groups /lang /ru_utf8 /sessions /temp ... there. The $CFG->dataroot/lang is the place you have to unpack downloaded ZIP files into. After this, Russian should be offered as preffered language in your user profiles. Also, you can select it as a default language for your site.",

Is there a list of files in order that they should preferably be translated? Thanks! Samuel Murray",

The solution to this problem is to navigate to the user folder in moodle and search out the edit_form.php and editadvanced_form.php files. You will need to remove the portions of the script that deal with validation of the email characters. Remember to backup these files so you can restore them if you make a mistake. The portion of the script that deals with checking to see if an email address already exists or not can be left as it is. This, of course, is not the best solution to the problem, but it is something I can recommend as a temporary solution.",

For various reasons the no_NO package will not be deleted, but it will no longer be maintained. The switch to nb_NO poses a few problems: 1. Moodle installations running on servers that still use the obsolete no_NO for the Norwegian - bokmål locale (FreeBSD?) will not be able to show a calendar with the correct date formats, names of days and months etc. for Norwegian - bokmål (Actually, this change has already taken place.) 2. Text tagged as \"no\" with the multilang tag, will not be recognised as Norwegian bokmål. Today the problem is that you can use two kinds of tags for the same language. Quite confusing I'd say.

Unfortunately the only solution here is to provide the input method (e.g. keyboard layout) to your users.

Better work that you can do will be to create a seperate language branch for Srilankan Tamil having a branch like ta_sl  I did some advise to your country for introducing School level content.  What we had in Indian Tamil was not suitable to Tamils in Srilanka. It will be easy for you to modify the existing Tamil translation to suit to Srilankan Tamil. I will be able to help you and you will be able to help in Tamil translation for India.

What are the charsets on the individual tables within the Moodle database? If I were you, I would create a experimental Moodle site somewhere, for example on your own PC. Create a brand new Moodle 1.8 and try entering Hebrew into that. If it works, then you can start thinking about what is different between the system that works and the system that doesn't. For your information, I use Japanese alot on my Moodle sites, and have had similar problems with \"????\" appearing were I want Japanese. By creating experimental sites as I suggested above, I have usually been able to find out what I have to do to get the Japanese to display on my live site. good luck Gordon",

If I migrate to UTF-8 with 1.6.3+ and after this I upgrade to 1.7.1+ all is perfect (but the Nwikis that not understand the UTF and crash). But (in the same environment, the same BD and the same moodle data folder) If I upgrade first to 1.7.1+ When I try to migrate to UTF I get an \"unknown context \" error and before this I get many \"unknown lang pack\" error for my custom language pack (only one). Probably you are asking yourself Why I am posting this if I could solve the problem migrating UTF previous and upgrading to 1.7 after? Well, the problem is the Nwiki module (If I migrate to UTF the Nwiki of my courses crashes). I have to wait to migrate to UTF until the Nwiki support it, but I want to upgrade to 1.7.1+ now to use the new functionalities... And I want to migrate to UTF as soon as possible (to avoid problems in the future)... How could upgrade to 1.7.1+ and preserving the possibility to migrate in the future to utf without errors?",

You need to convert from the old codepage to utf8 and import the zip file with modified moodle.xml. However, if the structure between 1.5 and some newer version would change substantially, this might not be guaranteed to succeed. official way seems to be to keep a copy of 1.5 portal and to upgrade it along with all needed courses to 1.6. Then, these can be backuped and transferred as usual to another 1.6 portal. It is a pity, but it seems to me that officially, backups between 1.5 and 1.6 in foreign languages are incompatible.

          "Text": "I am working in Spanish as well as Greek, and when we updated from 1.5 to 1.6 we experienced several problems: 1. Curved quotation marks turned into little boxes in all my courses! 2. Links to graphics were lost and had to be reconnected. 3. The editing menus disappeared! 4. Test questions that had Greek fonts mixed the Greek and Spanish fonts, which was a nightmare to correct. Below is my solution I found for that. I quote from another forum entry I made. I am not an expert in this, but I think I found two problems. First, there seems to be some incompatibility between some versions of Internet Explorer and Moodle version 1.6. (This problem did not occur when we were using an earlier version of Moodle, neither does it occur when we used Moodle 1.6 with Firefox .) Secondly, the formatting code also seems to be pretty stubborn sometimes and hard to modify. On Moodle tests, IE seems to pick up the font format from the last of one question and applies it to the beginning of the next question. So when I end one question with a Greek font, the first part of the next question is also in Greek, even if I formatted it in English or Spanish. This included even the work “marks” or “points” for the question. I began to wonder about this when I noticed two things: a. The first questions of all the tests were ok. That is, Greek was Greek and Spanish was Spanish, as it was supposed to be. b. When I looked at any question by itself, clicking the icon of the little magnifying glass, it also looked ok. So what I needed to do was basically clean up the htm code for formatting and make sure the font at the end of each question is not Greek. The best way to clean things up was as follows: a. open the question for editing, b. highlight all the text of the whole question, c. cut it (with shift/delete), d. switch to htm editing mode ( <>), e. delete any formatting code that might still be in the box. f. paste the question back in (still in htm mode), g. switch out of htm editing, h. highlight the words or letters I wanted in Greek, i. change the font to Greek, j. make sure there were at least one or two spaces at the very end that still had the default font (Trebuchet in my case), and k. save the changes.",

The groups feature could be used as well, me thinks, but you would need to manually assign students to be either in English or in Chinese group. If students are free to switch languages, then the multi-lang filter is indeed your solution. You would create not two but a single assignment and have two language blocks inside, one English and another Chinese. Then, depending on the language selection, a given user would see one or the other. If you are talking about downloadable files, then things are more complicated because, nfortunately, multilang filter does not act on file paths and you need a workabout. I would enter the assignment as web page and manually specify links to proper files within each language block. You could enter this as a request in bugtracker. I don't think it would be difficult to add this as a feature to the File and Folder resources (at least File since one can manually edit the file path).",

Also, it may take me some time to get all the strings in the right file, so you may want to wait until I have finished all my changes before you copy them into your own languages, rather than copying each little change I make one at a time. I'll post here again when I have finished. Thank you all for your work. I cannot believe how many different languages Moodle is available in!",

There would be some place in the database where Moodle stores this information, because I tried: backup database before doing utfdbmigration do utfdbmigration (now the link to utfdbmigration disappears and I can install the language packs) restore database as of point 1 I cannon install language packs anymore and the link to utfdbmigration is still visible.

When\na student types the answer in cyrillic, the answer is correct (assuming\nthat they've put in the right one).  However, when they miss the answer\nand the review is turned on to show them what the correct answer should\nbe (in the short answer type questions), it appears as something like: \" &\\#1087;&\\#1088;&\\#1086;&\\#1074;&\\#1072;&\\#1083;&\\#1080;&\\#1090;&\\#1100;&\\#1089;&\\#1103;\" . Any suggestions for fixing this or displaying the answer in cyrillic?  The default language for the site is ISO-8859-1 (English) and the instructors are not forcing the language to Russian for that particular course as they have exercises in both Russian and English. Thanks, Robert",

It seems that the session language is not set unless I explicitely select some language from the menu. So I either have to patch Moodle to always set the session language upon login or change the language setting for all users in the database .

Having both in the list would be counterproductive. Unfortunately, Moodle acts dumb in this situation. I thought I fixed it by patching the string recall function by forcing it to use my custom language in place of de if stored as default. However, I just ran into a new but related problem. If I still have de as default and edit my profile without setting new preferred langauge, the stored default is set to the first language on the list whatever that happens to be (this bypasses my patch).

          "Text": "Hi language moodlers, Happily, the Korean language pack has recently seen a flurry of translation and it nearing 100% completion (in the strings, not the help files unfortunately). However, I just noticed that the graphs in Moodle, such as in activity reports and survey results, didn't show Korean text properly. In its place was just boxes. After some searching I found the solution - placing a ttf file in the fonts subdirectory of the language pack. I had a look and there are several languages which have included such files there - but none of them are more than 1MB in size. I noticed that for other multi-byte languages such as Chinese and Japanese there was a README file giving instructions where to download the file from, presumably because these files are quite large. Indeed, the smallest Korean .ttf file I could find which looked acceptable is 3MB in size. Do you think that this is too large too include in the language pack? I would ordinarily have no hesitation in just adding a README with download instructions, but the Korean fonts are very hard to find. Opinions welcomed, Tim.",

Though, have made the following observations concerning the different kind of questions within the lessons and the quiz. I have attached a backup of a testcourse I made to show my observations. Lessons Short Answer questions does not accept the correct answer as correct (see testlesson003) Matching questions shows the text in both languages and does not accept correct matches as correct (see testlesson005) Quizzes Multiple Choice questions works correct - but the question text is limited to 255 characters. As the language codes <lang lang=\"en_US\" format=\"auto\"></lang> is 40 characters for each language, this soon limits the number of languages. (see question 1 in the quiz) True/False questions works correct - but it seems that the \"True/False\" labels are chosen from the last of the stated languages. (see question 2 in the quiz) Short Answer questions works correct if the answer is the same in the different languages, but if the answer is different in the various languages, it does not work (see questions 3 and 4 in the quiz) Matching questions show both languages at the same time in the matches (see question 5 in the quiz) Embedded Answers shows the correct language, but miscounts the results. With 2 languages each language is worth 1 point, but you only get credit for the one you answer in the language chosen. This completes my observations. Would it be an idea to connect the language to the lessons and quizzes instead of the questions within these modules? Kind regards John Raj",

To Americans, the entire effort receives a 'mark' or 'grade' but the individual items adding up to the total grade are 'points' not 'marks'. Most Americans are probably unaware of the British/Australian usage of the term. Since the total evaluation in both Am. E and Br. E can be called 'Marks' it doesn't seem strange when it is the label of a column in a summary. It's only in cases when we are talking about the total number of marks/points that a specific item should receive that the distinction is important. I vote for replacing the definition in lang/en_us/quiz.php: $string['marks'] = 'Points'; This will still work in Am. E as a column heading.",

The only adverse effect of remarking out those two lines I can see is that there isn't a box with the a picture and information about the person who created the scheduler object at the top of the scheduler view.  This wasn't required functionality for me, so I also decided to remark it out. If it is desired for someone else, I think a little hacking in of current code from the weblib.php and moodlelib.php from the nightly build (namely print_user(..), fullname(..),get_list_of_countries(...)), and adding the countries.php to the lang directory would probably get it working. --Rudy",

There may be some more minor ones in the former Soviet Republics that border the Arabic script-using countries to the south.  Chinese is no longer written RTL, nor is Japanese.
