An example of one of my queries is below. \n```text\nSELECT prefix_page.name as PageName, prefix_page.content as PageContent, \n  prefix_course.id as courseID, prefix_course.shortname as CourseName\n\nFROM prefix_page\n\nINNER JOIN prefix_course ON (prefix_course.id = prefix_page.course)\n\nWHERE 1=1 %%FILTER_SEARCHTEXT:prefix_page.content:~%%\n```\n Prior to upgrading to 4.5 and TinyMCE, I was able to download a JSON format file which delivered the raw html source, but this workaround does not appear to be working on all content anymore. Plus it was a clunky approach and I am hopeful there is a more simple way to do this! Best case scenario is to be able to download a csv containing the source code so I can pull the url content out directly. Sam",

          "Text": "Hi I was wondering if anyone has a suggestion for the following query: I want to build a report to display the average score of each question in the question bank (these questions are used in separate courses). My main problem seems to be the number of rows in the question_attempt_steps table (over 10 million!) due to the large number of questions (several thousand) and the large number of attempts (more than several thousand ...). As a result, the query I've designed never finishes and keeps running without any results. Is there perhaps a better way of constructing such a query? Thanks for your input.

However, there are very few questions that have been created in course categories due to incorrect permissions, which can be problematic in our case. Due to the large number of categories and courses, a manual search is very time-consuming. I have therefore thought about a DB query ( MariaDB ) via configrable reports plugin. However, my DB knowledge is not so good. Has anyone already carried out such a query and can post the SQL query here? Basically, I just need the ID of the course category in which the questions are located. There is a similar query: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=370896 , maybe that will help as a starting point. The context level would probably be 40 (course category context level), but as I said, my DB knowledge is not so good to find a useful result. many thanks best regards Anton",

          "Text": "Hi - We had similar issues. The simple fix is to get more RAM on the server for database operations - Configurable reports have a tendency to hit tipping point where intermediate steps in your query produce virtual tables that are too big to be held in RAM and the result is a sudden massive slowdown. Of course the better solution is to examine your query and work out what is the root cause. Most likely you are starting off joining tables together in a way that produces a huge number of virtual rows, much better to start with a limited table. EG don't join all users onto all course enrolments, start with course enrolments on the course you want and link users in later. If you are using phpmyadmin to run the query on the server directly then you can use \"explain sql \" to give you a clue where the problem is.

Example for 2 attempts. cmi.interactions_1.id > Scene1_Slide2_MultiResponse_0_0 cmi.interactions_2.id > Scene1_Slide3_MultiResponse_0_0 cmi.interactions_3.id > Scene1_Slide1_MultiResponse_0_0 cmi.interactions_1.id > Scene1_Slide1_MultiResponse_0_0 cmi.interactions_2.id > Scene1_Slide2_MultiResponse_0_0 cmi.interactions_3.id > Scene1_Slide3_MultiResponse_0_0 Desired report: course scorm module name scorm_element.element scorm_scoes_value.value scorm_scoes_value.value (.student_response) count Test course Demo Module cmi.interactions_0.correct_responses_0.pattern Monday, Tuesday Test course Demo Module .student_response Scene1_Slide1_MultiChoice_0_0 Monday, Tuesday 4 Test course Demo Module .student_response Scene1_Slide1_MultiResponse_0_0 Wednesday 1 Test course Demo Module .student_response Scene1_Slide1_MultiResponse_0_0 Monday, Friday 10 Does anyone have any idea whether this query is even possible?",

( FYI , Moodle Workplace also is perfect for this as it doesn't require you to enroll your Managers into courses with the students, you can make these connections as the site level.)",

To get the course final grade you will need to join to it the table grade_items and grade_grades and course (at least). The total time connected to course is not really doable in my humble point of view. Define Online progress, start date and end date. If it is the start and end date of the course, you have in the course table. If it is the date when the student started the course, then you will need to join the logs table, and God help you with that. If you go in a roundabout way, you could consider start and end date, the completion date of two certain activities , for example. That will require you to join also several more tables. I don't think you can get all this in just one query. I wouldn't try, really. Best,",

I think this block has no options in its dropdown menus to achieve this. I understand that perhaps I could achieve it through a user field (for example \"assigned inspector\"): if I put the same user field for the students and the one who views the report (assigned inspector: inspector 1); is there any way to get it? I have tried to do it by putting a condition of type inspector assigned=CURRENTUSER, and I have tried with like%%, but I can't; The condition that I intend to set is that the report only shows users that the value of the \"Assigned Inspector\" user field matches the value of that field of the user who is viewing the report.

I think using the configurable reports block will be easier, but you probably have another reason to use PHP with SQL. General speaking you need three main tables to do that, the Course table, the course_module table and the activity or resource table to get the course and activity/resources/module details. So in your code above you probably have a reason why you separate the SQL code but they need to be connected to get the right data. I hope that's help Motasem",

I'm thinking about something like this: 1) At the beginning of the query I would write something like this: constant role_id = 14 2) If I would want to use the constant in a line/staement, I would write: WHERE ra.roleid = role_id Is it possible somehow?",

I've found a solution, using CTE (Common Table Expression) ; this is available since MySql 8.0 (in 2018) or since MariaDB 10.2 (in 2017). You can look at MySQL's help page and MariaDB's help page . So, the application for my use is: at the begining of SQL, i add some lines to define my values at the begining of tables, i had my values table in my query, i use my values table An example, going from this : \n```text\nSELECT\n  cc.path,cc.name,c.fullname,FROM_UNIXTIME(c.startdate)\n\nFROM prefix_course            AS c\nJOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc   ON cc.id   = c.category\n\nWHERE c.shortname LIKE '%law%'        -- To filter courses\n  AND cc.path     LIKE \"%/1055/1057%\" -- To filter category\n# AND cc.path     LIKE '%/1055%'      -- To filter category\n```\n To this : \n```text\n-- Define values to use in query (since \nMySql\n 8.0 or \nMariaDB\n 10.2)\nWITH my AS ( SELECT\n  '%law%'        AS Course -- To filter courses\n ,'%/1055/1057%' AS Cat    -- To filter category\n#,'%/1055%'      AS Cat    -- To filter category (replace line upper)\n)\n\n-- Main query (no need to modify values)\nSELECT\n  cc.path,cc.name,c.fullname,FROM_UNIXTIME(c.startdate)\n\nFROM my                       -- To be able to use my values\nJOIN prefix_course            AS c\nJOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc   ON cc.id   = c.category\n\nWHERE c.shortname LIKE my.Course\n  AND cc.path     LIKE my.Cat\n```\n The main gain is to have personnalised values defined at the beginning of the query , and not inside it. Not visible with thie example, but with big long queries, it's more useful. Séverin",

For example, an institute has 3000 courses, and 20,000 students and each course has 5 to 10 activities on average, if you just talk about the summative activities, the number will be 7 to 10 digits. No ad-hoc neither Configruble report block will be able to handle that. Maria, If you want to know the activity completion settings in each course as a course facilitator or teacher, then you can navigate to the Gear button in that course, then course completion, then navigate to the Bulk edit activity completion tab, you will see a list of the activity in that course with the current completion configuration and you can edit the configuration for one activity or for bulk.

          "Text": "Motasem, Well, my thoughts are this is one of the things in Moodle where a whole bunch of data that should be normalized into columns is blobbed into a string for the PHP code to parse as an array. So I don't see any other way of getting that other than parse the string with things like SUB, etc. There are some key things to help: \"custom sql \" tells you it is a a sql report not a standard report \"querysql\" indicates the code is starting \"s:132\" or \"s:\" plus some number indicates the length of the data (which could be very useful for parsing) the fields are always in the same order It's going to be a fair amount of parsing. I wonder if it might be easier to just take the export xml file and parse that with some tool locally if is has some sort of xml to csv converter, for example?",

But I would like to share with you this example that has been shared by Randy in the ad-hoc contributed reports. If you reconstruct the tables after FROM to identify the group id first based on the userid for the student who explore the report, that would make it easier and you need to notice that in some stage probably you do not need to use the INNER JOIN. For example in Randy's syntax \"FROM (SELECT groupid FROM prefix_groups_members WHERE userid = %%USERID%%) AS GRU\" in this line we used the variable %%USERID%% to get the user who explore the report, but in this line of code \"JOIN prefix_groups g ON g.id = GRU.groupid\" we idintified the group id based on the userid that he/she explore the report. Then we joined the other tables that we need to use to get the data from in your case the completion and user tables. If you looking to get this report for the course that this report open in you need also to use the course variable \" %%COURSEID%%\". Here the list of all the variables and filters that you can use in Config reports block. I hope that's help in some how and thanks for sharing. Regards Mo",

New problem, that I don't know if can be sorted or not: The numbers you have used in your post, I take these as a score... rather than a percentage. I tested this by adding a line for a grade that is technically Honors (in our system) with a dummy name and it now shows. Is there a way to make it use percentages rather than a score value, i.e. 100% = Distinction, 90 to 99 = Honors etc? Or is that now falling into the realm of the complex scenario you mentioned? Basically our system is (as set at the Site Admin level for ALL courses/exam activity results: 100 = Distinction 90-99 = Honours 70-89 = Pass 0-69 = no grade the just have to take it again. However, how each course is set is not consistent, i.e. some areas use grades out of 100, others use a set grade system, i.e. out of 20 (but it is not then scaled, its just out of 20). While Moodle can for the most part work out what 70, 90% of things are, I know some areas it doesn't or at least uses score over scale/percentage. The current coding is now: SELECT u.lastname AS \"Lastname\", u.firstname AS \"Firstname\", u.idnumber AS \"SCC\", c.fullname AS \"Course\", gg.finalgrade AS \"Grade\", DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(gg.timemodified), '%d %M %Y') AS \"Date Completed\", CASE WHEN gg.finalgrade IS NULL THEN '' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)=100.00 THEN 'Distinction' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=90.00 THEN 'Honors' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=70.00 THEN 'Pass' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=19.00 THEN 'TEST' ELSE '-' END AS \"Grade\" FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'course' # students only role id is 5 AND ra.roleid = 5 %%FILTER_STARTTIME:c.startdate:>%% %%FILTER_ENDTIME:c.enddate:<%% ORDER BY Course, Lastname Jayden",

The row for the submission then shows up on the next page refresh.

It seems inconsistent, especially if you start looking at the time stamps for those. I suspect cron is involved, but I am not sure. I have seen rows in that table with no grader (-1) or grade (also -1) with no real submissions at all yet but sometimes no rows at all until a submission has been actually graded. It's a mystery I haven't fully looked into yet.",

Site administration > Reports > Ad-hoc database queries Is this possible, where can I find documentation? Inquiry 2 : Plugin Option? Plugin made for allowing emails to be specified instead of forcing users to be selected Is there a plugin for this? I have been searching for weeks and have had no luck Inquiry 3 : Base Code editing Edit the base code to enable emails to be typed rather than forcing a selection Is it possible to eit the base coding to allow this?

As John Gall says, \"All complex systems that work can be shown to come from simpler systems that work.\" - Study some queries that are similar to what you need if not exact and get those running first: do those above queries on completion and the ones on groups run and work on your site?

          "Text": "Hi, I'm hoping someone with better SQL skills than I can help me with this (previoulsy posted this to the dev community - I forgot there's this specific CR forum!) We're wanting to download the Feedback File a tutor provides for a student for each assignment into our central SIS or at least for now just make it available via Configurable reports, but I'm struggling to create a relationship between the tutor's feedback file and the grade item for the student which the file was uploaded for. It's complicated a little by us having multiple tutors within each course with their own private student groups, so not all feedback in a course belongs to one tutor, although I'm hoping there's a way of matching a feedback file against the tutor who uploaded it/graded the student. We have a separate report that lists links to a student's assignment submission (which contains the report file) against the marking tutor, but we need to be bringing the report files into the same report as the grades.

          "Text": "Hi, I'm looking to install Moodle 3.11 and many sites recommend this plugin; however, I see this plugin has yet to create a release compatible for 3.11 and instead supports up to 3.10 of Moodle.  I reviewed the issue tracker for any impacts against 3.11 and saw no reported issues. As of today, less than 300 users are running this plugin on 3.11 which is 10% of the user base on Moodle 3.10 with this plugin. To those 300, have you seen any issues or is it working out of the box? To the developers, not sure how often you release new updates or what the timeframe is for the next release, but do you think the current version of Configurable Reports will do fine on 3.11 or should us end users wait for a new release officially supporting 3.11? Thank you for your time in coding and maintaining this plugin. As you might be able to tel, I am very excited to implement it on my Moodle installation. Warm regards, Michael",

Actually we insist that the students disconnect \"the right way\" so we do the emargement correctly and they are responding to this demand at a pretty high rate. I don't mind if in rare occasions someone miss it, we can then check manually the logs for the latest action. BUT, if missing logout time can compromise the query (errors), i'll go with your advice for latest action before latest login (latest action time + 30 minutes can be ideal since we have long review activities at the end of the course). For the second point, I actually need the first login and the last logout on course days (lets drop the week criteria, after rethinking it I don't find it very pertinent). I think there is a setting within the plugin to run the query everyday at night, that should be ok. Thanks for your time again, really appreciate it !",

The issue is the cm.module=22 - the Assignment cm seems to vary between installations, but removing this condition seems to fix things, and have removed the  : \n```text\nJOIN prefix_course c ON c.id = a.course AND c.id = %%COURSEID%%\n```\n line to make the report work site-wide, which is what we're after. However, I'm trying to now display only the ungraded items for a teacher, where they're in the same course group as the student, but can't work out where to start on this. We use separate groups for each of our courses as we can have a dozen or more teachers per course, each with their own students.  Can anyone give any pointers for this? Many thanks, Paul",

I am looking for a way to get an email sent to me every monday morning that contains a list of all the employees (students) that have any courses that are INCOMPLETE.  I think 'Configurable Reports Block' might be the answer to my needs but still trying to figure out how to make it to do it. Because the LMS that I am building training program, I don't have due dates like a typical classroom.  Instead, I need to know any active employees that have outstanding assignments or courses so I can follow up with them to get it completed.  I have employees that start at all different times. I am sure I can click into the courses and find this information but my training program will likely have 300 small courses before it is fully built.  I don't want to have to click through every course to figure out who is done and who still has work to do. Any help would be much appreciated. I am working with Moodle 3.10 installed on my own server .",

Having read on this forum I got to understand it's a bad idea to directly edit or create extra tables in the Moodle database . I have read that I can customize my report using this plugin and that I can connect to an external database using configurable reports. My questions are: 1. Can I connect to an external database using the report and at the same time connect to the Moodle database so that I can generate a single report using both databases? 2. Can I create more tables using this plugin in the Moodle database  and it'll not affect the future upgrade? 2. Can this plugin consume an external API? Thanks. hoping to hear from the experts.

So what your boss thinks is \"an active user\" may vary from course to course. If you mean that a user account as a whole is active or not, that is shown in the mdl_user table in the suspended column, where 1 = true and 0 = false, meaning active. So active users will have a 0 there. \n```text\nWHERE u.suspended = 0\n```\n means all active users, leaving out suspended accounts.",

I'm trying to generate a custom report within each course that gives us a list of users including the group they belong to, how they enrolled, and when they completed.

How can I tweak my query to include all users, whether they belong to a group or not? I'd ideally like the query to return a full list of all active students, and if the don;t belong to a group, have the group field left blank or return \"No Groups\" like the participant page in Moodle does.

You don't say who the emails must be sent to, so that needs further clarification too. What log history do you want to include? Moodle logs can get pretty large! So, in addition, it would probably be wise to build in some logic that checks the size of the .csv files and restricts them to some maximum size, to prevent trying to send really large .csv file attachments via email that could \"crash\" your email server or exceed any \"maximum attachment file size\" limitations that your email service may impose.

          "Text": "Hi Moodle mates, I am having trouble with Configurable Reports. Maybe I have just not installed it correctly? Maybe my LMS is botched? Maybe it was just Monday; whatever the case, I could use a hand with understanding why my LMS goes to a white screen when I attempt to configure  a report. Sometimes it does this even before I click Update or Add, etc. I just choose an option, and bam, white screen of...nada. Here is my workflow for someone to try and repeat: I choose\nto create a new Users Report. I choose 10 for Pagination, the Javascript ordering tick, and export to csv. On the\nnext page, I choose User statistics, then \"logins in the platform\". I\nname the column Col001, then hit Add. White screen of death. Another scenario is the same as above but on the\nnext page choose only \"User course completion status\". The screen\nimmediately jumps to the white blank before I can even hit Update. Please help.",

          "Text": "Is this a new problem or has this always been a problem on your Moodle site? Did you recently upgrade Moodle or the Configurable Reports plugin? If you recently did an upgrade was the Configurable Report working before the upgrade? Moodle and PHP have debugging options that enable Moodle to display extra information when a problem like this occurs and record the problem details in a log file. When the debugging options are not enabled (they aren't by default) Moodle just displays that \"white screen\" (because it was not able to recover from the error). Have a look at https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Debugging#Enabling_debugging and then enable the Debugging options in Moodle. Then try to reproduce the problem again in Moodle so that details of the problem can be displayed. You should then see an error message in Moodle (or in the PHP log file) when the problem is triggered again. Share those error details here so we can try to decode it. What version of Moodle and PHP are you using?",

Fields returned are: As our modules are split in to multiple moodle courses, each person has multiple rows with a different module name and the percentage attended next to it. How would i then be able to take that result set and return a total attendance for each student\nusing an average of their module attendance percentages? something like: I understand i should probably be using a subquery but i'm a bit stumped as this would be my first jump in to that level of sql . Custom SQL Query is the following: SELECT u.firstname AS 'Name' , u.lastname AS 'Surname', c.fullname AS 'Module', cc.name AS 'Course', gi.itemname AS 'Item Name', ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) AS Percentage_attended, IF (ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) > 79,'Yes' , 'No') AS Acceptable FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid JOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE  gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemmodule = 'attendance' ORDER BY    Name    ASC, Surname ASC",

The Moodle and the PHP versions are both 3.4, the Moodle database is MariaDB and the operating system of the Moodle server is linux (CentOS). Curently the company is using the configurable reports plugin for the creation of various other reports.

If there is no prefix on the tables then the config.php setting should say something like $CFG->prefix = ''; and so the variable in the code for this should basically be empty. The code for this in CR which handles the prefix_ in the query and replaces it with the actual one on the site is: \n```text\n$\nsql\n = preg_replace('/\\bprefix_(?=\\w+)/i', $CFG->prefix, $\nsql\n);\n```\n So, it replaces prefix_ with what the prefix setting has. If your Moodle instance is working with an empty prefix already, then CR should work too.",

I set an enrolment duration period for a self enrolled course, after the enrolment period ended, I can no longer see in reports ( scorm modules are used )  that the student has completed the scorm modules. For example there is a separate scorm module for the exam, but I cant see that person's ( who has exceeded the enrolment period ) exam result  ? However when I check the individuals reports by name I can see it. Is that how it works with setting enrolment periods ? Do the individual subject/course reports not provide data on individual persons who have exceeded their enrolment period ? Thanks Moodle 3.1.6 (Build: 20170508)",

Add this WHERE clause at the end to only show those without any grades at all. You can test this by creating a new course with nothing in it. \n```text\nWHERE gi.courseid IS NULL\n```\n Hope this starts you out with what you need to do, which may be different depending on the grade category structures, whether they are missing entirely (ie are NULLs) or have entries with zeros or blank spaces; you can never tell how it was coded until you take a look at it. In the above for grade items we are checking for something that does not exist at all, as there is no row for it.",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm using moodle 3.6.3 and configurable reports latest version as well. We use SCORM based courses (each has a minimum of 5 modules) and with the help of this plugin i created a custom sql reports showing (name, course name, module name, progress percentage, time spent, last access date..) along with filters, however when trying to retrieve large number of rows for all users for example, the browser takes a lot of time and even crashes sometimes. My question: is there that we can use the filter fields as a first step and once clicking apply depending on the fields of course a report would be previewed instead of showing all the values of the query and then filter? meaning choosing the filter criteria before showing the report table not vice versa or maybe choosing default values so that onload the report would show according to the default values. If not, then can i detect that the rows or the report is too huge to be previewed so only leave the download report button and give a message like (report too big to be previewed please download to view) so i can download and check the values without previewing the report onscreen since its either taking a longgg time or crashing? I know i can always divide the report into several reports but imagine 5000 users that means the number of rows would be a lot greater than 5000, dividing the report into 10 or 20 reports isn't practical at all. Thanks in advance for your help. Regards,",

          "Text": "Forum Members, a very good morning to you, My colleague and I are working in Moodle v3.5 soon to be v3.6. We have to create multiple courses and digital content ahead of the NHS Patient Electronic Health Record software deployment project; which is scheduled for delivery in autumn of this year going live.   The impacted audience size is a little over 7,000 staff members across multiple hospitals sites in the UK Kent region, and the training team is tasked with delivering the training strategy and all subsequent reporting. We have created 10 courses, where each course has a module of eLearning in SCORM 1.2, a Confidence Report Choice Activity (Pre and Post Course), PDF Activities and other references materials, including processes and workflow maps which define patient pathways and treatment plans as links to reference materials. The problem we are experiencing is, when running reports, our exported data is not giving us all of the information we so desperately need.    We can produce multiple reports that have the data which, is stored in different parts of the LMS database and we have made arrangements so that we can connect our Excel App to the ODBC LMS Databases on the server directly.  However, when connecting to the database and having access to all of the tables, we struggle to source the information and data we need, to create the desired report. Therefore, we are calling upon the good will of the Moodle community and those who wish to receive and take credit for helping us in our plight, to assist us in creating a Single SQL report which collates the data from all courses and user profiles in addition to data from the Category, Course and Learner reports.    If it pulled just one record we could figure the rest out for ourselves but we really are struggling as none of us are SQL coders. Your reward for helping us, would be recognition both locally and nationally across the UK NHS Trust community via all social media outlets promoting your professional services, helping you to generate future business. I know this is somewhat of an unorthodox request but we have exhausted all avenues available to us and only have until the 16th April to get the matter resolved before it starts to impact the projects delivery data as all Ward Managers and Team Leaders are going to need this reporting to track and follow their staff progress. My sincerest thanks in advance for any contribution you can make.

It seems like the Configurable Reports plugin can probably do this, but I can't see an obvious way from within the existing available selection options. Which leads me to believe it would require some SQL knowledge to extract this information, and unfortunately I'm not a SQL person.

If you have a bunch of courses you need this in, you could create a bulk upload for group creation (not population) and that makes the group creation super fast (I used to have 12 groups I used and I just dropped in the group upload when I first created the course, if I wasn't copying it--it takes about 15 seconds once you have your file created).",

Juan, the developer, now heads up the Moodle Mobile team at the Moodle office in Spain and it seems he doesn't have time to update the plugin... You can get the latest official version from https://moodle.org/plugins/block_configurable_reports . Download the .zip file from there and then extract it to the Moodle folder on your server . Some people say it still works - but with some issues. It depends on what functionality you are using... If you have any major problems with it, try the forks that have been released by other developers who depend on Configurable Reports but couldn't wait two years and five Moodle versions for an official release. Example: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-block_configurablereports . Look in the Moodle Tracker for issues relating to reporting in Moodle and you'll find issues like: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-63233 https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-62080 Read the comments in those MDL issues for interesting suggestions. If you don't want to rely on hacky fixes to unmaintained plugins then consider joining the Moodle Users Association ( MUA ) and vote for the Customizable Report Builder proposal. If you can't afford the risks of using an unsupported version of Configurable Reports and you can't wait for any unconfirmed solutions from the MUA then try the Ad-Hoc Database Queries (custom sql ) plugin from the Open University. It does roughly the same thing as Configurable Reports (lets you run your own sql queries) and has been around for a long time.",

And at least, as you wrote, give an answer! I find nothing more frustrating than knowing someone is connected on Moodle, certainly knows the problem, but gives no answer at all. Reading the Plugin adoption program , and knowing that no answer as been given, even at private message on Moodle, i think this plugin could be considered as abandonned.

Further tests: uninstall and reinstall Configurable Reports: the errors persisted. change theme: I purged the theme cache, then deactivated Adaptable and activated the Clean theme: the errors persisted, only replacing the word \"adaptable\" with \"clean\". change browser: the same errors were shown in Chrome, Firefox , Opera and Safari. created the folders \n```text\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/adaptable/blocks/configurable_reports/js/\n```\n and loaded the missing stylesheets in the appropriate subfolders: the errors persisted. Hence I conclude it is not a browser-related issue, neither a theme-related one. My question is - how to fix the problem? I would like to see the report as it was designed by its author and then possibly customize it to the look and feel of the entire site. Thank you.",

We continue to see intermittent issues when we migrate a site from one server environment to another - where the configurable report instances make it over, but when you click on the SQL tab, there is nothing there. When we look at the Moodle database table for configurable reports, we can see the sql logic is there - and we can manually send it through an HTML converter to get the logic out and then put it back into the SQL tab, but that sure is a lot of work. Doesn't seem to be isolated to a particular Moodle version.  I would say Moodle 3.2 or greater. Do you have any thoughts as to why this would happen? Thanks in advance. Kristin",

          "Text": "Hi all.  I'm using meta course enrolments for many courses and I want to report on these.  The very excellent progress report from the ad-hoc contributed reports does a great job of showing progress in all courses by user, but if that user is enrolled in a course via a meta course, they are not included in the report. I've spent some time playing with the report and trying to work out why it only shows manual enrolments, but I have to admit defeat.  I'm just not familiar enough with the Moodle schema to work it out. I'm hoping someone can look at the query and pinpoint where it excludes meta-course enrolments.  If that can be done then hopefully a tiny change to the report will be all that is needed. Very appreciative of any help on this.

          "Text": "Hi Abu A 500 Internal Server Error on your own website requires a completely different course of action. As I mentioned above, most 500 errors are server-side errors, meaning it's likely your problem to fix if it's your website. There are lots of reasons why your site might be serving a 500 Error to your users, but two are most common: A Permissions Error. In most cases, a 500 Internal Server Error is due to an incorrect permission on one or more files or folders. In most of those cases, an incorrect permission on a PHP and CGI script is to blame. These should usually be set at 0775 (-rwxr-xr-x). A PHP Timeout. If your script connects to external resources and those resources timeout, an HTTP 500 error can occur. Timeout rules, or better error handling in your script, should help if this is the cause of the 500 error. A Coding Error in .htaccess. While not as common, be sure to check that your site's .htaccess file is properly structured. If you're running WordPress , Joomla , or another content management or CMS system, be sure to search their support centers for more specific help troubleshooting a 500 Internal Server Error. If you're not using an off-the-shelf content management tool, your web hosting provider , like InMotion , Dreamhost , Bluehost , 1&1 , etc., probably has some 500 Error help that might be more specific to your situation.",

I want to provide a \"special\" user in a course the ability to run ad-hoc reports queries. Therefore I need the ad-hoc queries to dynamically use information from the \"special\" user's profile (i.e. their institution). For example, the ad-hoc report I want to create would let the special user see all students from their institution in a course (and their respective grade). Problem is, unless I hard code the institution it doesn't seem to dynamically assign based on the special user logged in. \n```text\nSELECT u.firstname AS 'Name' , u.lastname AS 'Surname', c.fullname AS 'Course'\n\n\nFROM prefix_course AS c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user AS u\n\n\nWHERE u.institution='%%USERID%%'\n\n\nORDER BY `Name` ASC\n```\n The above query, when run by the \"special\" user will not show any report results. If I hard-code an institution value, then I get users from that institution; but I want it to be dynamic since I have special users from multiple institutions. I'm sure what I'm failing to do is fairly simple, but it's been a while since I've written in MySQL (and I do realize the above query would not give me grades, I'm just trying to get it to pull the correct users first).",

          "Text": "Roshan, Are you doing this in Configurable Reports block? If so, you can use the Start and End time filter to do this if you need to pick the dates. There are two steps: 1) Add the filter placeholders to your SQL code. See this query for an example: https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports#SCORM_Usage_by_Course_Start_Date , where you'll see near the end: \n```text\nWHERE\n1\n \n%%FILTER_STARTTIME:c.startdate:>%%\n%%FILTER_ENDTIME:c.startdate:<%%\n```\n You should replace c.startdate in that example to the column in your own query that holds the date time you want.  Since you're using the log table in your query, put whatever column in the log the timestamp is in. (Aside: the WHERE 1 (or as some do it WHERE 1=1) statement is a peculiarity of the filters in Config reports: if you don't have a WHERE statement in your query already, then you must add this dummy WHERE to keep the statement valid.) Save that code. Then: 2) In the Filters tab for the Report, add the \"Start / End date filter\" to your filter list. When you run the report, it will now show you two pull downs that you can pick for start and end dates for the query. This is a good solution for an interactive picking of dates. If you have fixed dates that won't change, then as Stuart mentioned, you could use a BETWEEN operator on the dates, or math on the dates, or any number of date functions in a WHERE clause.",

          "Text": "Currently, your report shows the grade each student received to any \"grade item\" they attempted to complete. Grade items are anything in the Moodle which can assign a user a grade, most notably, quizzes (exams), and assignments. Your report shows you the results of both quizzes and assignment, currently - which makes displaying the relevant dates a bit tricky: Assignments have three defined dates: 'Allow submissions from' date - before this date the assignment will be unavailable to students 'Due' date - after this date passes, any submissions made to this assignment are considered \"late\" 'Cut-off' date - After this date the assignment will be unavailable to students My guess is, for assignments, you'll be interested in the due date. Now - for quizzes, you have just two dates to worry about: 'open the quiz' date and 'close the quiz' date, which determine the time period in which the students will be able to attempt the quiz. Because of this difference, the dates for a grade item aren't stored in the prefix_grade_items table, but rather separately in the prefix_assign and prefix_quiz tables. Now - to your question, my suggestion is: SELECT CONCAT(u.lastname , ' ' , u.firstname) 'DisplayName', u.idnumber AS 'sztsz', u.address AS 'cim', u.institution AS 'osztaly', u.department AS 'beosztas', u.email, u.lastip AS 'IP cim', cc.name AS 'Kategoria', c.fullname AS 'Kurzus', CASE WHEN qz.timeclose>assignment.duedate THEN FROM_UNIXTIME(qz.timeclose) ELSE FROM_UNIXTIME(assignment.duedate) END AS 'Date', CASE WHEN gi.itemtype = 'Course' THEN c.fullname + ' Course Total' ELSE gi.itemname END AS 'Vizsga', ROUND(gg.rawgrademax,0) AS elerheto, ROUND(gg.finalgrade,0) AS elert, ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) AS szazalek, IF (ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) > 79,'Sikeres' , 'Sikertelen') AS Eredmeny FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid LEFT JOIN prefix_quiz AS qz ON qz.id=gi.iteminstance LEFT JOIN prefix_assign AS assignment ON assignment.id=gi.iteminstance JOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemname != 'Attendance' AND c.id =  %%COURSEID%% ORDER BY 'Name' ASC This should add a \"date\" column to your report, which shows the close date for the grade item if it is a quiz, and the due date for the item if it is an assignment. You will occasionally see the date 1.1.1970 - this signifies that no date was set for that activity. You might also see on some occasions that the date field is empty, this means that that row contains a grade for a grade item that isn't a quiz, nor an assignment. I might have completely misunderstood you - maybe you meant you want the completion date for the quiz and the submission date for assignments, rather than the closing and due date respectively. Let me know if this is the case, or better yet, try adjusting the query yourself - you may find this helpful: http://www.examulator.com/er/ Good luck!",

The main issue I have is that despite the fact that I feel I am a pretty capable Moodle administrator, I don't feel I have the knowledge of the database tables in Moodle for which I might be able to write custom SQL . That being said, I'd like to request your advice (and possibly hire you) on designing a very special configurable report. I'm working on a virtual exchange project connecting students in Japan with students in other countries. We use Moodle Forum for online discussions. The students and teachers from these countries are grouped in 20~40 student groups for any given forum in the course -- currently, there are 5 forums. There are hundreds of threads and discussions happening at any given time because this project has over 1000 students enrolled and continues to grow. What we are looking for is a way for instructors to get an overview report for a group of students including statistics like: For each forum for each student: number of initiated discussions (originated posts?) number of replies to all posts in the forum total word count per reply last access date/time to the forum",

All this could be done though in basic reports that could be emailed out. A lot depends on who you think would be seeing these reports and how often they need them. Getting the data is not so hard, so if you are flexible with being able to download some of that into spreadsheets instead of online then getting all the info is doable.",

When I try to place it in Configurable report it will not work due to \"colum mdl_course_categories.name\" is invalid in the select list because it not contained in either an agregate function or the group by clause. To be fair... I think I am causing conflicts at one point. Though I am working on this for about 2hours now and this is the closes I got. Is there anyone who can help me out, or has some tips?

However, you want to know which students don't have a BADGE, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled in a course, so checking course completions isn't going to give you the information you want. You should be looking at the info in the mdl_badge_issued and mdl_badge tables. Presumably, any mdl_user.id who does not have a record in the mdl_badge_issued table should show in your report. So you could do something like: \n```text\nSELECT id, firstname, lastname\n\n\nFROM mdl_user\n\n\nWHERE mdl_user.id NOT IN (SELECT userid FROM mdl_badge_issued)\n```\n And maybe include the mdl_badge_issued.dateexpire column in the WHERE clause to give you just the badges that have not expired.",

What I can not figure out is how to integrate filters with my custom SQL? Let's say I'm writing a custom report that reads data from a table I've added to Moodle. This isn't a built-in Moodle table, but it is added to the same database as our Moodle instance. The report works fine and reads the new table's data. For example, the new table has a field called \"Variable\". How do I add a filter to my SQL to query this field? Thanks! Roger J.",

The output report is expected to have the following fields : |firstname|surname|quizname|grade|sumitted|graded| The fields submitted and graded can either have the date of submission or grade or be empty I started with the following code SELECT u.firstname AS 'Name' , u.lastname AS 'Surname', q.name as 'quizname', qg.grade AS 'grade', DATE_FORMAT( FROM_UNIXTIME( qa.timefinish ) , '%d-%m-%Y' ) AS submitted, DATE_FORMAT( FROM_UNIXTIME( qg.timemodified ) , '%d-%m-%Y' ) AS graded FROM prefix_quiz_grades AS qg JOIN prefix_user AS u ON qg.userid=u.id JOIN prefix_quiz AS q ON q.id= qg.quiz JOIN prefix_quiz_attempts AS qa ON qa.attempt=1 WHERE q.course=14 the main issue here is the submit date.

If a plugin is in the official Moodle plugins database then it has been run against various coding tests and should work for a given version of Moodle - there is no guarantee it will work for the next version of Moodle or if it will be maintained in the future or even it won't conflict with another 3rd party plugin you may have installed. It would be highly unlikely any plugin was \"tested in hospitals\" specifically unless it was written by someone working for a hospital. Re RTL and QA, you really should set up a test server and as part of your workflow, test any and all updates/new plugins on the test server prior to implementing on your live server. Probably not the answer you want ... but it's reality. Regards H",

The problem is that I need a new query with the same information only with the grade comments added to the report. This information is stored in the prefix_assignfeedback_comments table but I cannot, for the life of me, relate from prefix_ grade_items to the prefix_assignfeedback_comments.commenttext field. Can anyone help me with this? Thank you Casey",

The longer version: I would like to delete the automated course backups from our Moodle installation. After installing the Configurable Reports block I’ve identified almost 48 GB of these automated backup files.

There is no telling what type of issues you might create deleting files you do not really know (all) the purposes for. You wrote, The report returned 47.5625 ( space taken by backup files\nin GB, right?) I will also guess that is MB not GB, in my opinion........ 48 MB is not a huge amount of space on a server. I do database related work all the time. I would not think a report is going to have delete rights to the database files. A report generally would only have read rights. If you really want to see the actual file sizes, have the database admin give you read only access to the actual database and write a query to bring the file data you want back, then you can really see file size and etc..... If I mis-understand your reasoning.........just ignore. haha",

          "Text": "﻿ Rick, Thanks for the rapid response. I’m wanting to remove them for a couple of reasons. I would like to start directing the backups to a location outside of Moodle, but I would like to try to “reset” the pickup process, if possible. We have a few hundred courses that are not being backed up correctly - “Error”, “Unfinished”, or “Automated backup pending”. Or, even if I am not given a new directory location, I’d still like to restart the backup process. I know that the automated course backups are not the thing for disaster recovery, but they seem convenient for the scenario where a teacher has a problem that can only be solved by turning the dial back on her course to the previous day. I have tried backing up some of the affected courses manually, through the Administration block backup option - with debugging turned on - and get the following (on all courses I've tried, not just the problem ones), but I believe that I’ve read that this is not a problem (although it does have the word, “warning”) The backup file was successfully created. Technical information and warnings setting controller status to 700 saving controller to db calculating controller checksum 9a81a46157dab1d2605466f56e7d923e loading controller from db setting controller status to 800 setting controller status to 1000 saving controller to db I think the 47.5625 is GB. We have over 3000 courses and the report script includes 1024*1024*1024. I thought the same as you about a report - that it would only “report”, not make changes/deletions - even with the report listed on the Ad-hoc Contributed Reports page as “Delete all the automated backup files”. But I am noticing something. As I visit courses and click on \"Restore\" in the course admin settings,  there is no longer an Automatic Backups section at the bottom of the page. This has been true for every course I’ve examined - but only 6 or so at this point. There is no discernible change, however, in the size of the /filedir directory. Maybe this is one of those one- or four-day processes and Moodle will clean the files out over time? I did disable automatic backups so that new backups would not be created, but I don’t think that would eliminate the Automated backups section in individual courses. Thanks, again for the reply!

The information returned would be a list of their specific Group of participants and the Date of Completion for the courses that each of them have taken. Further, the structure of the platform that I have inherited are set up as metacourses (group of courses from the Master List) or \"Course Tracks\" ... where Student A may be in Course Track 1 taking courses Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Student B make take courses Alpha, Beta and Epsilon from Course Track 2. But in our reporting, we need to see both Student A and Student B on the same report, even though they are in different Course Tracks. There are so many elements to use in Moodle, I need some suggestions for the best way to create this report. I see it much like the Course Completion Report, only that it would gather all Course Completion Dates from courses site-wide for a specific Group from a pull-down menu at the top of the page. Does the fact that it exists in a Metacourse mean anything to the reporting function? Can I set up an independent, site-wide report that can be accessed (with permissions) by others? And keep in mind, courses have already started for the year so I don't want anything that will damage the integrity of the existing data. Any help of direction would be appreciated. Thank you!",

          "Text": "Hi all, During these last days I've been thinking about the future of the plugin. As you may know, Moodle 2.8 will come with a new report builder based on Totara Report Builder. (See https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-30193 for more info) When the news came out my first thought was to discontinue/deprecate the plugin and create a final version including a tool for migrating reports to the new system. The last comments in the previous tracker link has raise some new points to consider: - The new report builder will NOT support SQL reports - There is a lot of people using Configurable Reports (CR) with lots of reports created/contributed - It seems that the new report builder tool will not suit all the user needs in its first version Also, my personal and professional position has changed. Until now, I was able to \"maintain\" the plugin thanks to projects in my former employee and spending some spare/free time but now I don't have time for that. I was toying with the idea of starting a crowd-funding project to guarantee the maintenance of the plugin during the following year, including upgrades to Moodle 2.8, Moodle 2.9 and bug fixes. I was thinking rewards like fixing bugs pointed out by the contributors. The estimate for a complete year maintenance project is around 3000€ ($3800 approx.) What do you think? would you be willing to fund it?",

I think the whole area of logs and reporting is not yet right, but maybe it will get better over the next few releases. If enough people feel that CF is able to offer something valuable, and it can do things better or different to the basic functionality of the in-built report builder, then HRDNZ might consider sponsoring the ongoing development of this - as long as we can clearly show our sponsorship.

I'd agree with what Stuart said: it will cover what most people ask for in reports and do a fine job, even if not all the advanced features it has will make it to core at first. It's already a rich and mature tool. Clearly people who are now using CR for the user/course/category type reports will be able to replicate those in the new Report builder, if not right away, then eventually by rebuilding them. I think a bridge converter from CR to Report builder\nwould be very useful thing , but those who do have a lot\nof standard reports now in CR should raise their voices to be heard on\nthis issue if they want to continue CR for a while until they can\nconvert over. Since the OU Ad-Hoc plugin handles only SQL and already has good scheduling abilities, it can continue to fill in that gap which the Report builder will not have. Though I work a lot in CR, I happily use AD when I need the scheduling and email notices.  Almost all my client reporting work, though, is with direct SQL, not the standard type reports. So, although I really enjoy CR and have promoted it whenever I can, if it was discontinued, AD would continue to serve most of my SQL reporting needs.  (I suspect I am not in the majority situation though.)

Overall, the ability to control access to the reports by role (beyond just the single \"Report user\" role that grants access to all reports) is critical. CR provides some interesting ways for users to build reports using a form-based interface, but we don't use that as much, and I suppose the solution that will eventually be included in Core may take over that functionality. CR provides its own display block, but that's probably not critical, since everyone gets the Administration block in some form or another. The other feature I appreciate in CR is the ability to import contributed reports from a repository. If we were going to make Ad-Hoc Reporting a more general-purpose tool, this could be a helpful addition.",

I've got most of the data I need, but there's one column that I can't work out how to calculate. We need the percentage of the course that each user has completed. I must admit that I'm far from an expert in this area, I've basically cobbled together the SQL from the list of useful queries in the ad-hoc custom reports documentation. Here's the SQL I'm using: \n```text\nSELECT u.firstname, u.lastname, c.shortname, \n\n\nDATE_FORMAT(DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(ue.timestart)), '%d/%m/%Y') start_date,\n\n\nSEC_TO_TIME(SUM( TIME_TO_SEC( t.value ) ) ) total_time,\n\n\nROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) AS final_grade\n\n\nFROM prefix_course c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_context ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_role_assignments ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = ra.userid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_grade_grades gg ON gg.userid = u.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_grade_items gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course_categories cc ON cc.id = c.category\n```\n My question is, is it possible to extract / calculate the percentage of the course that's been completed for each user? I've been looking around the query examples and the database schema but I'm a bit lost... if anyone can help me and point me in the right direction it'll be greatly appreciated! Many thanks Dave",

          "Text": "We are running Configurable Reports version 2.3.2 build 2011040110 and Moodle 2.5.4+. We are seeing issues with time tracking on all configurable reports in our various Moodle courses. There are many users who have 0 as their recorded time spent, although they have received certificates in the course and completed all modules. I have a report that I can share with you that shows several examples of this.  The report also has a separate sheet where I've pulled all the users with 0 time showing incorrectly on the report. Looking at the code from the configurable_reports block (/public_html/moodle/blocks/configurable_reports/components/columns/userstats/plugin.class.php), it looks like it should be summing the time differences between consecutive records for a user in the mdl_log table and excluding any that exceed 30 minutes. I've simulated that logic in the attached \"Moodle Log Times\" spreadsheet with data for userID 201 and course 38 (CA: Pre-K -> Contra Costa). It seems like it should be showing 2.8 hours of time for the user, but instead it is showing 0. You can see the database query I used in the second worksheet of that spreadsheet. From just inspecting the code, I can't see why it would be returning 0 for this user, so perhaps this is a bug?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Morgan",

The other courses should be simply providing the enrollment information that syncs to the main course. You don't normally enroll users in the main meta course directly: that's what the children are for. (That's the basic scenario; there are variations.) So, running the report should do just that: give you completion for that main, meta course. So it is working properly. So if you enroled everyone in the meta course but not in any of the 20 child courses, then there was no point in making it a meta course because it has its own enrolments directly and not via synching from the child courses. You are not going to get an activity completion report in one course to know about anything in other courses. You'd have to do a custom report in something like Configurable reports to do that.",

Now, I need this report to see all courses but only 1 course at a time. What I would like to be able to do is click on the report, they query does not run until I select a course from the dropdown list and click Apply. I hope this makes even an ounce of sense. TIA G!",

I've installed 2.6 for Moodle 2.4+ (2014020700) of this plugin and still seem to have issues when we allow report/customsql:view to another role. A similar issue was mentioned earlier ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=177111#p867509 ). The only way we can get another role to access the Custom SQL reports is by allowing the report/customsql:view capability in Authenticated user role. Then other roles can also access the reports (Custom SQL report link is added to under Site Administration in the Administration block). However, the undesirable effect of this is that everyone gets access to this. When this capability is removed from Authenticated user, then nobody can access the report, even though it is allowed in other roles. Accessing via direct URL gives a \"You do not have permission error\". Is it possible to have the Custom SQL reports accessible only to teachers in courses? This would be super useful. Does the current plugin allow for this? I couldn't get it to work. I played with the code (view.php) a bit and checked for course context instead of system context. This allowed a teacher to access the report via direct URL. Is code changes the only option? I would be grateful for any advice to guide me on the next step. Thanks, ...RT",

The main difference with the contributed one is that it start with role_assignments, not user_enrollments.  The reason is that user_enrollments doesn't have the actual role.  It has a like to an enrol record for the plugin instance which shows the current default role, but that could have changed, or could be overridden depending on the plugin. Caveat: it's certainly possible that I don't fully understand the structure of some of these tables.  In particular if a student was enrolled in a via more than one enrollment plugin, with overlapping dates, it probably double counts that student. We use the enrol_apply plugin for enrollment, and it seems to work fine with that. Anyone is welcome to use these: Total students in a course (uses role assignments, not the user enrollments table, so I think it's more accurate) select count(ra.userid) as \"Total Students\", c.fullname as \"Course Name\" from role_assignments ra, prefix_context ctx, prefix_course c where ra.contextid = ctx.id and ctx.contextlevel = 50 and c.id = ctx.instanceid and ra.roleid = 5 and c.visible=1 group by ctx.id Current students in a course (links back to the user_enrollment, which as far as I can see is the only place with the date range for the enrollment): select count(ra.userid) as \"Current Students\", c.fullname as \"Course Name\" from role_assignments ra, prefix_context ctx, prefix_course c, prefix_enrol e, prefix_user_enrolments ue where ra.contextid = ctx.id and ctx.contextlevel = 50 and c.id = ctx.instanceid and ra.roleid = 5 Feel free to give any comments, suggestions, or if it doesn't work properly with your configuration I will try to improve or fix it.",

          "Text": "At first glance, it seems that the inner joins are building the desired result table but the Left join is stacking two separate tables into the result table that is not related to the previous joins. For e.g. student john smith has a record in the enrolments table, match his record in the enrol table based on the enrolments table, then match his course he's taking in the enrolments table to the courses in the courses table,) this is where I believe the query breaks down -> then match anyone with a last access to  anyone that has a userid limiting the result set to the where clause. To prove the thought remove the where clause and you may have duplicate entries for everybody who has a userid and last access. As Tim mentioned you may be able to union the two queries or what I have found success in is creating views. Create a view of all users enrolled in the SCORM courses then run a query against the view limiting to the date ranges you have specified.  There is also the approach of creating a temporary table to hold the result set from the inner joins and then running a second query all in the same script that filters the table by date. Hope that helps. Phil Templeton",

In case this helps, my intent is to list all users that have been enrolled into a course but within a given timeframe, have not logged into the system, accessed the course or, finally, have not completed the SCORM activity in the course. So the logic I am looking for is: If the user has not logged in within 60 days - display name If logged in but has not accessed the course within 60 days - display name If logged in and has accessed the course but has not completed the course activity- display name Query A does list all users that started the activity but have not completed within 60 days. Query B does list all users that have not logged in or accessed the course within 60 days or at least it appears that way.  The problem with Query A was that it also lists users that started the SCORM activity but are no longer enrolled in the course. Query C did correct the problem with Query A and did exclude those users that did not complete and were unenrolled.",

Siempre me ha funcionado a la perfección, sin embargo, y sin ser un error del plugin, me está fallando últimamente con ciertas conexiones en las que no se está guardando correctamente el tiempo de actividad del usuario (aparecen tiempos en los que es imposible que hayan acabado todo un curso o no aparece nada). Comprendo que es realmente moodle el que almacena la información, pero me preguntaba si alguna vez alguien se hubiera encontrado con este problema antes y si puede ser debido a algún tipo de filtro, proxy o similar. El único dato que no se almacena correctamente es el tiempo de conexión. Muchas gracias por todo y un saludo.",

After installing this plugin (first plugin I've ever installed and first installed on the site, I am new to Moodle), when editing is enabled while viewing a course subsequent page loads takes several minutes and usually fail to load.  When it appears there are often broken images, and also some UI features stop working. Some things about this moodle: The database is on a separate server (but same network) - this is because our hosting didn't have the right MySQL version (but the other one didn't have the right PHP version) Slash arguments have been disabled due to lack of support on host (GoDaddy) We're using the default stock theme I've only created one topic-style course and a couple empty activities in one of its topics. Including the URL tripped the spam detector.  Not sure how to show the moodle to you guys. Any suggestions appreciated. Roger",

Currently the STUDENT ACTIVITY LOG only records \"start times\" when they click on that lesson (even if they don't watch the video immediately).  We need to calculate \"end times\" when they click on the next lesson, time out, or log out. [1] The REPORT must list the calculated time spent in the course (the State of Texas requires minimum contact hours). Subsequent client requests (separate topics?) include: [2] auto-generated \"Pass/Fail\" for each lesson based on whether the student's calculated time is < or is >= to instructor-set minimum time for that lesson. [3] Ideally the report could GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY and be EMAILED TO THE INSTRUCTOR when the student clicks \"SUBMIT\" on a \"course completion form\" we've placed as the final section of the navigation tree. I am attaching a PDF of what I think the report might look like (created in Excel), providing the instructor with a complete summary of a student's course participation. [4] There is also a State of TX requirement that the student's IDENTITY be periodically verified by correctly entering the same answer to a randomly-pulled PROFILE QUESTION as they had entered during the registration process.  The REPORT would need to access that \"pass/fail\" table as well. I have two subcontractors collaborating on this solution and awaiting your insights.  Thank you.",

Ability to change the limit on the number of rows returned.

I have created a USERS report for a course that contains several lesson modules.  I can get the usernames, ID, course name etc in my report, and I can get the results, however in the results column, there is no date. I have done the same with other courses that have Quizzes and I do get the date...but with the lesson modules I only get results with no dates. I am an admin, however I have no access to the server , hence why I am making reports through this add-on. Any ideas on how to get the date?

          "Text": "Hi Juan, First, thank you for Configurable Reports! It's an essential tool for anyone tailoring Moodle for a particular situation. Configurable Reports as it stood did not completely fill our needs so I modified the code. We would like to share these features with the community. If you believe any of these changes could be useful to other users I'd be very happy to assist in integrating them to the plugin's main branch! Here is the patch in diff format: http://pastebin.com/csgh3fQk If I can share this in any other form which would be more pratical to you, don't hesitate to say so. We've added the following features: We had Configurable Reports translated to French! I modified the User Field filter so that it may be used in custom SQL reports. I would particularly appreciate your review of that change. I added a User Field Search Box filter which behaves similarly to the User Field filter, except that the value is entered in a text field instead of being chosen from a select box. We built that to search for a particular user by username in a database bound to eventually contain thousands of users. I modified viewreport.php so that redirection does not happen after output has started. In custom SQL reports, I added support for a %%WWWROOT%% keyword, which is subsituted for $CFG-> wwwroot . In custom SQL reports also, I added string replacements on SQL queries so that \"?\" does not break the query (necessary to allow for hyperlinks as column values). I modified the button label that applies a filter to a report to \"Apply\" and the first option for the selection menu to \"All\". These may be somewhat debatable changes but we found more natural to \"apply\" a filter to a report since \"add\" sounds like we are adding data. Similarly, choosing the first option in a filter's select box displays all data, so we preferred \"all\". The following changes are nitpicking application of some good practices I thought relevant: Defining SomeClass::__construct() and SomeClass::SomeClass() issues notices. I removed all SomeClass::SomeClass() constructors. Some StdClass objects were used without declaration, which issues notices. I added declarations when appropriate. I removed ?> from the end of all PHP files so that response headers aren't sent when they aren't supposed to.

I need this report (desperately!) as coursewise reports are cumbersome to take out, and an overall progress report is needed.. Something like: Course 1         Course 2    C3   C4    Total Student1         70                  50           60     40    220 Student 2         90                    0          80    20     190 I have made a report using the sitewide code in the configurable report plug in, and have got a listing of the course totals in the first column, and can also restrict the users to a particular category, but am unable to put the various courses across the columns. I could export this to excel, but would prefer to have a single report here itself, without any external processing. i am not well versed with SQL or PHP and am struggling to get this report up...any ideas or help would be highly appreciated!! regards",

One thing we found was that when we exported a report to an XLS file, cells that we thought should have been formatted as numbers in Excel, were treated as text instead. To fix this issue, we made one small change to the /configurable_reports/export/xls/export.php file around line 60, changing the line from: $myxls->write_string($ri,$ci,$cv); to: $myxls->write($ri,$ci,$cv); This allows the Moodle library's Worksheet class to determine the data type itself.

Since students don't truly \"log in\" to a course, they only login to the entire Moodle system, I need to write a SQL query that will approximate the \"course logins\" for me. One approach that comes to mind would be to count the number of times a student has entered a course starting from a page not within that same course. In other words, when a student views a main course page by navigating from a different course or from the MyMoodle page. I can count the number of times a student has viewed a main course page by writing something like SELECT COUNT(log.id) AS 'Session Count', c.fullname AS 'Course', u.lastname AS 'User' FROM prefix_log AS log JOIN prefix_course AS c ON c.id=log.course JOIN prefix_enrol AS e ON e.courseid=c.id JOIN prefix_user_enrolments AS ue ON ue.enrolid=e.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id=ue.userid WHERE log.action='view' AND log.module='course' AND log.userid=u.id GROUP BY u.lastname but that includes all the times a student has returned to the main course page from an activity in the same course. Does anyone have any idea how I can specify that the original link to the course has to come from outside the course itself? I hope I've been clear enough. I'll be happy to clarify anything.",

Probably not the right place to ask, but could somehow maybe summarise the difference between Configurable Reports and Tim Hun'ts Custom Admin Reports? I understand that they are different in that the the one is a SQL builder.

          "Text": "Hello, I am using an updated Moodle installation from the git repository-- MOODLE_23_STABLE tracking the weekly updates.  I have a bunch of contributed plugins installed as well, most from git, but a few from mercurial and CVS , and one installed by hand because there is no RCS link. I understand this plugin has a downloadable version and a version in the Moodle CVS repository, but not git. I have successfully checked out the configruable_reports plugin (not the whole contrib section) and can update it to the MOODLE_23_STABLE tag using the command  cvs update -dP -r MOODLE_23_STABLE.  Using cvs status to check tells me that everything is up to date using that tag.  However, the version.php file lists an old version 2007101509, and as such moodle is complaining when I try to update plugins... keeps telling me a new version is available.  If I download the plugin manually, the version.php file is indeed different-- on the updated version. Is the version.php file missing the MOODLE_23_STABLE tag in the CVS repository? The age of the file in the ViewCVS is 17 months.  Is CVS being updated at all anymore?  I can't find a git repository link. I would rather not download and install plugins by hand-- 100% git would be the goal, but I am currently stuck managing 3 different repository systems. Thanks in advance.",

          "Title": "GRADES SQL: Trouble with extracting grades! Any help appreciated",
          "Text": "Hi; I'm using CR to extract grades to roll-up into an MS Access DB that we've constructed, but some grades are not being shown. I think this is due to grades that have been manually entered by teachers , so I'm assuming that I'm missing a CASE statement for another table, etc.?? Here's the SQL I'm trying: SELECT DISTINCT u.firstname AS 'FirstName', u.lastname AS 'LastName', u.idnumber AS 'EmployeeID', gi.ID AS 'CompID', gi.ItemName AS 'Component', ROUND(gg.finalgrade,1) AS 'finalgrade', FROM_UNIXTIME(gg.timemodified) AS 'DateModified' FROM prefix_user u JOIN prefix_role_assignments ra ON ra.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_context ct ON ct.id = ra.contextid AND ct.contextlevel = 50 JOIN prefix_course c ON c.id = ct.instanceid JOIN prefix_role r ON r.id = ra.roleid JOIN prefix_course_categories cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE r.id =5 AND ct.instanceid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'mod' AND gg.rawgrade > 0 AND u.idnumber <> '' AND u.deleted = 0 AND ct.contextlevel = 50 ORDER BY c.sortorder, u.username, gi.itemname, gg.timemodified Any help, of course, greatly appreciated. Thanks, Gerald",

          "Text": "This may not be of any help, but I remember looking at the tables to figure out why every time I changed the grading method of the gradebook (from average to highest, or highest to median, etc), uploaded grades disappeared and only grades produced as the result of a SCORM attempt stayed in the gradebook. I noticed there was nothing in the \"rawgrade\" column of the table for uploaded grades... they only appeared in the \"finalgrade.\"  When I changed the grading method, it seemed to remove anything that was in final grade and replace it with whatever was in rawgrade. Maybe gg.rawgrade > 0 is keeping your uploaded grades from showing, as an uploaded grade of \"100\" would show \"0\" in gg.rawgrade, but \"100\" in gg.finalgrade -Mark",

          "Text": "Here's how we do something similar. I'm using Windows with IIS and MySQL database . The default prefix we use is \"mdl_\". 1. On the server should be a folder \"C:\\Program Files\\My SQL \\MySQL Server 5.5\\bin\" 2. Take the SQL commands you have written and copy-and-paste them to a text file in this folder called 'XPORT.SQL' (make sure to change \"prefix_\" to \"mdl_\" in the file) 3. Create a batch file in that folder called 'XPORT.BAT' with the following command: mysql.exe -- host =HOSTNAME --user=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --database=moodle19 < XPORT.SQL > OUTPUT.DAT Where: HOSTNAME is the servername (or could be 'localhost') USERNAME is the name of the user of the database PASSWORD is the password of the above-named user moodle19 is the name of the database (yours could be different) XPORT.SQL is the file you created above with your SQL commands OUTPUT.DAT is the TAB-DELIMITED file to be created (it will still open in Excel) 4. Execute XPORT.BAT at the command line. This will create OUTPUT.DAT 5. Once you have the OUTPUT.DAT created you can create an FTP command file. It will have the commands needed to send the file to the recipient. You only need to create this file once. It should look something like this: OPEN ftp.whatever.com USER username PASS password HASH BINARY SEND OUTPUT.DAT (other commands necessary) CLOSE BYE Where: OPEN <site> - makes the connection to the recipients server USER <username> - the username they probably gave you to login PASS <password> - the password for the account HASH - will show \"#\" characters as each block is sent (this line is optional) BINARY - indicates to the recipients FTP server that the file you are sending is binary SEND <filename> - this command tells the receiving FTP server that you are sending a file (use GET if this is a file you are getting from them) CLOSE - disconnectes from the remote server BYE - quits the local FTP program 6. You then execute this file by using the following command at the command line: FTP -S:XPORT.TXT This can be added to the end of the XPORT.BAT file, if you like. I'm unsure of your general skill level so if you have problems with any of this, let me know.",

I'm rewritting and refactoring some parts of the code, this is why: - Since Moodle 2.2 there is a new type of plugin called \"report\" that integrates very well in the curren Moodle course and user navigation. So I'm going to change from a block to this new type of plugin - I'm cleaning and refactoring some parts of the code in order to follow the Moodle codelines style guide. My objective is a 100% compliant code - There is a big issue that prevents this plugin to work with Oracle , it will be solved - I'm adding new types of columns and reports (cohorts, rubrics) - Moodle 2.3 will include (hopefully) support for multi-tenancy (multi sites), so I wan be sure that this plugin will be able to work cross-site for building reports with aggregated data I will commit in my github account the new development version in a few days",

I have upload a new version of the plugin to the CVS , in a few hours download the plugin again, try to replace the components/filters/fuserfield files with the zip ones and check if it works fine for you.
