I like it very much.  Now I am trying to construct some exercises for testing the convergence of improper integrals and infinite series. The problem is can I make maxima return to stack  a value or a string  \"true\" if the improper integral ( or infinite series )  is convergent and \"false\" if it is divergent.  Thank you very much.",

          "Text": "Thanks for your kind comments about STACK . I think this is a Maxima question, rather than a STACK one, but I'll do my best. In Maxima the following happens \n```text\nintegrate(1/x,x,1,inf);\n\n\ndefint: integral is divergent.\n```\n So the problem is that you want to catch an error. What we need is a function like the following in this file: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/stackmaxima.mac \n```text\nintegrablep(ex,v,a,b):=block([res], \n\n\n  res:errcatch(integrate(ex,v,a,b)),\n\n\n  print(\"STACK: ignore previous error.\"),\n\n\n  if is(res=[]) then return(false),\n\n\n  return(true)\n\n\n)$\n```\n However, this relies on Maxima's integrate function.  I don't know how reliable this would be. Lastly, when I come up against this kind of issue, I generally solve the problem by very careful randomisation rather than leaving this to chance.  Is there a reason why you can't start with known integrable/non-integrable things? Also, do you have a list of more specific test cases? Chris",

In the next generation of my quiz questions I would like to ask my students to type in vector equations (e.g equation of force equilibrium). These equations can contain scalars and vectors, too. I would be happy if the students could see the vectors as bold characters in the validation field similar to official publications. For example: \\( $$ {\\bf{F}} = m \\cdot {\\bf{a}}$$ \\) I've read the documentation of Matrix.md and Numbers.md and I'm able to format the vectors in the question text and feedback fields, but still unable to get it right in the validation field, which is generated by the plugin.

Suppose we ask the student to give\nthe coordinates of any point that lies on the graph fx = 2*x+1, how do we\ncheck the answer in Stack?

I have tried to manipulate the student's input [x1,y1] in the feedback variables by putting sa: 2*ans1[0]+1 -ans1[1] ( and also sa: subst (x=ans1[0], fx) - ans1[1]) and setting the teacher's answer as 0, but it does not work.

Two, testing results became messy in general comparisons, also time consuming, so again used more generic tests for different learning groups. Three, student attitudes were somewhat negative, initially, to this approach. We are on a national curriculum so I had to be very careful to remain within that format and learning structure. When I started using videos, in a flipped learning manner, students became far more responsive. Added to that, the more obviously work related mathematics I pitched to them were quickly accepted and became successful. For example, I understand diesel mechanics use trigonometry, so I pitched a couple of problems to each group about calculating the stroke of a piston, using trig to solve the length of a stroke. Then I stepped back and showed them the trig theory behind it. None of this would have been possible, let alone successful, without the resources being easily available within the Moodle. In some parts I used Groups, in others I used meta courses, took a bit of work to set it up, but I had one former student complain to me recently about him still remembering trig! And btw , more recent investigations have revealed that a lot of education psychology is essentially a dud, that it still comes down to classroom management and engagement.

          "Text": "I met TeX while working on an old 286 with 2 floppy's and i still use fragments of the old files i wrote in those days. And still faithfull after all these years.... Moodle is new to me, but what an excitement to see TeX-possibilities in Moodle. I used it with my students (17 years) and after 1,5 hours of instruction and excercising, they make beautiful formula's (including matrices, integrals and so on) on there forums. Here are some bugs I want to report: 1. It's impossible to use < or > symbols. Propably a conflict with the html-tags? 2. When you want to correct an array-environment, the double backslashes  (to separate multiple rows)  are replaced by single ones. 3. It's impossible to separate the input of a formula over multiple lines. That's a problem for novices to TeX while writing matrices, etc. friendly yours Hugo Troch Belgium",

          "Text": "First of all you must understand that mimeTeX which we use to typeset TeX expressions is not a full implementation of TeX.  You certainly would not want to use it to publish your mathematics Ph.D. thesis on the web.  Please visit the mimeTeX home page at http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html for some idea about what it can or can not do. As to inequalities, I don't see any problem in typing them within HTML Editor. Enter $$$ x<2 $$$ to get $$x<2$$ and $$$ x>2 $$$ to get $$x>2$$ .  If you are entering inequalities without HTML Editor or in source mode within HTML Editor, you have to encode them like this &lt; for < and &gt; for >. As to arrays, double backslashes, and multiline inputs and so on, you need to enter them in source mode within HTML Editor.  Otherwise HTML Editor inserts unwanted html tags like <p> and </p> inside the TeX expression. Here's an example of an array entered in source mode: $$A=\\(\\array{3,c.cccBCCC$ &1&2&3\\\\\\hdash~1&a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\\\ 2&a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\\\ 3&a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}}\\)$$ I had some discussion with Janne about making HTML Editor more compatible with math. expressions here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=4921",

          "Text": "For question 1, this suggests that there may be an installation problem with jsMath. Can you check your web server 's error log to see if there are requests for jsMath.js that are not being served? If so, the URL that is failing may give you a clue about what is going wrong (e.g., looking in the wrong directory). If that doesn't help, I will take a look at it if you would give me guest access to your site. (You can send the URL and access information via email or Moodle's message system if you prefer.) For 2, it looks like the \"envy\" theme uses the window.onload event handler, which is also used by jsMath. One possible solution is to edit the moodle/theme/envy/styleswitcher.js file and replace the window.onload function (near the bottom) with \n```text\n    var old_onload = window.onload;\n    window.onload = function(e) {\n      var cookie = readCookie(\"style\");\n      var title = cookie ? cookie : getPreferredStyleSheet();\n      setActiveStyleSheet(title);\n      if (old_onload) {old_onload(e)}\n    }\n```\n This will save the old onload handler (jsMath's one) and has the new onload handler call the old one after it's done. That should cause jsMath to run. (Note that I'm not able to check this, since I don't have the envy theme, or version 1.9 of Moodle, so it may take a little adjustment, but it's the right idea.)

          "Text": "I wish to ask a question on a quiz in which the answer is a set. STACK works fine using at recognizing whether the answer is correct or not using AlgEquiv to compare the teacher's set with the student's set. Checking the answer gives some information about what is missing from the student's set. But I want to give partial credit if the student's set is missing only a few members, or has just a few too many members. So, I tried defining as feedback variables, the number correct as, Nc:cardinality(intersection(ta,ans)); and the number missing as, Nm:cardinality(setdifference(ta,ans)) and use this to generate a score, and give different values for the mark for different values of the score using a multinode response tree. However, although it correctly recognizes correct and incorrect sets, the partial credit part does not seem to work, and I get the following error: Response summary: Seed: 1; ans1: {root,3.1,4.4} [score]; ans2: W [score]; prt1: [RUNTIME_FV_ERROR] # = 0 | \"$cardinality\": argument must be a set; found: setdiffence({2.1,3.1,3.3,4.1,4.2,4.3,4.4},{3.1,4.4,root})|\"$cardinality\": argument must be a set; found: setdiffence({3.1,4.4,root},{2.1,3.1,3.3,4.1,4.2,4.3,4.4}) | ATSet_wrongsz. | prt1-1-F; prt2: # = 1 | prt2-1-T Could anyone please tell me how I should be doing this.

In fact some stuff, such as \\line and \\mbox, are blacklisted in Moodle, and to get them to work, you have to go and remove them from the  $tex_blacklist in yourmoodle\\filter\\tex\\lib.php down around line 73 in most Moodle versions. These may or may not, work for you, especially the MathJax as I have it installed on my server with some additions. Here is my current LaTeX preamble: \\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{amsfonts} And here is what I have in my MathJax configuration: MathJax.Hub.Config({ config: [\"MMLorHTML.js\", \"Safe.js\"], jax: [\"input/TeX\",\"input/MathML\",\"output/HTML- CSS \",\"output/NativeMML\"], extensions: [\"tex2jax.js\",\"mml2jax.js\",\"MathMenu.js\",\"MathZoom.js\"], TeX: { extensions: [\"xypic.js\",\"mhchem.js\",\"color.js\",\"AMSmath.js\",\"AMSsymbols.js\",\"noErrors.js\",\"noUndefined.js\"], }, menuSettings: { zoom: \"Double-Click\", mpContext: true, mpMouse: true }, errorSettings: { message: [\"!\"] }, skipStartupTypeset: true, messageStyle: \"none\" });",

The main differences is that with \"interactive with multiple tries\" you have to click \"Try again\" after reading the feedback, before you change your response. Also, with Adaptive the number of tries is unlimited. In Interactive it is number of hints + 1 (so you need to add hints to your question.) For multi-part (technically multi-PRT) questions, the difference is bigger. With interactive, you have to answer all parts of the question at the same time. With Adaptive you can answer one part at a time. So, I think they both have their different strengths and weaknesses, and you have to think about what will be best for your students and your teaching style.

Just to double-check: Moodle 4.5 (LTS) was released in October 2024, so according to the official release policy , at the time of this post, it is still within its bug-fix support period, which lasts for 12 months - until October 2025. Security-only support continues until October 2027. Given that, it seems we’re still within the window where fixes and updates (like improving compatibility with MathJax v3) could still be considered for the 4.5 branch. To be honest, it feels like Moodle 4.5 may have been unintentionally overlooked when MathJax v3 support was added in 5.0, despite 4.5 being an active LTS release still within its bug-fix support window. Given its widespread use, I believe it would be worth reconsidering support for MathJax v3 in 4.5 as well. Thanks again for your input!",

So technically, improvements like this could still be addressed. That said, I understand your point about MathJax not being a core focus for Moodle HQ. However, continuing to ship MathJax v2.7.9, which is deprecated and no longer maintained, raises a serious security and maintainability concern, not just for LTS users, but for any Moodle supported version site relying on it (4.1, 4.4, 4.5). I absolutely agree that the community should engage earlier in the release cycle. Still, in this case, I believe the MathJax update should have been included in all \" current stable \" branches at the time, which included both Moodle 5.0 and 4.5 . On Moodle 4.1 MathJax 2.7.9 was already outdated... Frankly, I consider this an oversight and I think MDL-75486 should be backported to 4.5. Thanks again!",

These magnitudes are analog in nature and perhaps affected by noise and other factors, so there are not an exact \"true value\" of the response. Instead of programming a single correct value (with some relative or absolute acceptable margin), we would like to give the student a score based on how much his/her response deviates from the teacher's value. I am aware that it can be achieved by defining a rich PRT with many levels, each one expanding a bit more the acceptable margin and lowering the score accordingly, but this is a bit cumbersome and time-consuming if you have a lot of questions of that kind. As it seems that there's no answer test that outputs a \"fuzzy\" truth value between 0 and 1, I tried to use a formula/variable in the \"score\" field of the PRT, but this doesn't work. It accepts only numerical values. Therefore I'm asking if there is a way to make a PRT node to yeld a variable score based on a formula or algorithm involving the student's and teacher's answers.

I am running MOODLE 1.9 on a shared server , not sure what version of Java. The demo does seem to work at: http://mydomain.com/lib.editor/htmlarea/popups/Dragmath/demo.html . Installing DragMath From the Moodle CVS - Recommended! This could not be easier. If you are running verion 1.9.+ click here or if you are running Moodle version 1.8.4 or greater but not 1.9.x click here and you will start the download of the zip file (at present there are no differences between the two versions. At this point you can unzip on your workstation and then you can upload the included files to their appropriate locations. This version retains the smileys and includes all integration files and all DragMath files (demos, docs, and all export formats) Warning: At present the zip file includes a version of adminlib.php that should NOT be used with Moodle 1.8.2 If you are using 1.8 DO NOT over write your adminlib.php. Install the rest of the files (other than adminlib.php) and DragMath will work without a problem. Apparently the Moodle automagically creates the zip with a parent directory of \"dragmath\". Should you wish you can unzip the files and then rezip with the top level directory being /lib, and this will allow you to simply upload the zip you just created to your moodle root and unzip there, and the files will be placed in their appropriate locations. However, please make sure all files are backed up, and in as much as there are only a few files you may want to manually install even if a zip with /lib as top directory were provided here just to ensure each file is backed up before installation. Upload the zip file to your Moodle root and unzip. Installing DragMath Integration and DragMath Applet Separately - Not Recommended! You install DragMath in two steps Install the DragMath package Install the DragMath integration package =====Step 1 - Install the DragMath package ===== Download the latest DragMath package from sourceforge and unzip it in the \n```text\n$CFG->\ndirroot\n/lib/editor/htmlarea/popups\n```\n directory (where `$CFG->dirroot` is your \"moodle\" directory as defined in `config.php` . NOTE there is also a `popups` directory directly in the editor directory. Don't use that one!). This will create a new directory under `popups` called `DragMath` containing all the necessary DragMath components. =====Step 2 - Install the DragMath integration package ===== Important Note: These instructions will REPLACE the smiley button on the HTML editor toolbar with the DragMath editor button. This was done to keep the installation instructions simple. If you want to keep your smiley button, see the section at the end of this article. Download the latest DragMath integration package from the modules and plugins database . In the zip archive, you will find two files. `dlg_ins_smile.php` -- Copy this file to your `$CFG->dirroot/lib/editor/htmlarea/popups` directory, overwriting the existing file (you may want to make a copy of the original file before overwriting it) `em.icon.smile.gif` -- Copy this file to your `$CFG->dirroot/lib/editor/htmlarea/images` directory, overwriting the existing file (you may want to make a copy of the original file before overwriting it) You must also change two lines in the file `$CFG->dirroot/lib/editor/htmlarea/dialog.js` around line 34 you will see the line: `case \"dlg_ins_smile\": x = 330; y = 320; break;` Change this line to `case \"dlg_ins_smile\": x = 540; y = 340; break;` around line 47, you will see a line that begins `var dlg = window.open(url, \"ha_dialog\", \"toolbar=no, menubar=no, ...` Modify this line, changing `resizable=no` to `resizable=yes` You might also want to change the mouse over popup from \"Insert Smiley\" to \"Insert Equation\". to do this you need to edit the file `$CFG->dirroot/lib/editor/htmlarea/htmlarea.php` around line 275 you will see the line: `case \"insertsmile: [\"Insert Smiley\", \"em.icon.smile.gif\", false, ...` Change this line to `case \"insertsmile: [\"Insert Equation\", \"em.icon.smile.gif\", false, ...` Finally, make sure that the new files and directories you create in the above steps are readable by the Web server. For example, make sure that the em.icon.smile.gif file has the same permissions as other gif files in the images directory.",

          "Text": "I am planning to develop a module for mathematics assessment using AIM ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/aimmath/ ). AIM solves two problems that arise when trying to automatically mark mathematics homework: Checking the correctness of the answer to a mathematics problem is hard because there is often not a unique way of expressing the answer. AIM solves this problem by feeding the student's answer to MAPLE, a computer algebra package. Students may be tempted to copy the answer off each other. AIM solves this problem by allowing the problem to contain random parameters, so that every student has a different problem to solve. Thus AIM has the same purpose as WeBWorK that Zbigniew Fiedorowicz has already integrated with Moodle ( http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=798 ). However unlike WeBWork, AIM does not require programming abilities to design the questions. We have a grant to roll out AIM across all large modules in the Department of Mathematics at the University of York. As part of this project I am planning to employ Moodle in our Department at the same time to provide a comfortable front end.",

I was not able to preserve trailing zeros with any input type through further operations / calculations. This might only apply to The next best thing you can do is string manipulation and evaluation. Let x,y be your students input (input type should be \"String\"): xdec: split(x,\".\"); xlen: length(split(xdec[2], \"\")); ydec: split(y,\".\"); ylen: length(split(ydec[2], \"\")); diff: xlen - ylen; The first line splits the input string at the delimiter \".\" (decimal point). The second line then takes the second part of this split operation (the right-hand side or decimal places) and takes an empty delimiter for the split operation, giving single characters. The length of the resulting array is the number of decimal places in your input. You can then simply compare whether diff equals zero. Cheers",

I think this is the best hope at present for an easily deployable and manageable way to provide moodle wide display of MathML, and I only wish that it would be implemented at Moodle.org VOTE HERE: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLSITE-599 There area number of issues that have to be addressed - from avoiding what one might call balkanization of code if too many versions are extant to what questions implementing asciimathml through themes pose for Moodle's functionality generally and what would/could implementation of asciimathml mean vis-a-vis other existing filters and the decisions are not in our hands, but I think the more people who support this effort the more likely it is that it will be a go.....",

          "Text": "Hi! I am very new to using Moodle, but I have been using LateX for many years. I am using Moodle on the Server of our University, i.e. I do not have admin permissions. I have contacted our local admin about the issue that I am going to ask, but maybe he's on vacation... in any case, I am trying to prepare a course that will start soon, so it would be super helpful if I could get the TeX code to work without the admin. If I enter $$ f(x)=\\Bigint_{-\\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt $$ (f(x)=\\Bigint_{-\\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt in Dollar-operators), it works just fine, displays the equation, everything good. But if I try anything else, it never works. For example $$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} $$ (f(x)=\\frac{1}{x} in dollar operators) displays a broken image. $$ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^x~3^{-t^2}dt $$ (f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^x~3^{-t^2}dt in dollar operators) also displays a broken image, etc. Do you have any idea what could be the reason for this weird behavior? Any help would be appreciated. I am aware of the possibility to create the equations externally and include them as gifs. It would just be so much nicer if I didn't have to go through that effort since I want to use lots of equations. Katharina",

Most likely $$ f(x)=\\Bigint_{-\\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt $$ was created to moodledata subfolder /filter/tex when that folder still had write permissions and your site admin changed the permissions to not allow writing to this folder anymore. Tex filter checks if the old image exists in folder and if it does not Tex filter tries to create a new one. The other option is that your settings of php have changed and there might be some disabled functions in php that no more allow creating of new images or if your site is using local distribution of latex paths of executable binaries might have changed in upgrading of site (see administration menu and settings of tex filter if there are green ticks after the paths). You can set site debugging to ALL in administration menu and click one of those broken images to get some more info about possible reason. If your version of moodle is 2.X you could also add MathJax script tags to additional HTML in site administration and use MathJax instead of Tex filter to get around this kind of problems - see https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=193064",

The only solution I've found is to provide an additional PRT Node which also awards grades if students produce the negative, i.e. \"-ta\", which is actually interpreted as: -(0 = (y-z)/B + y/A -x); according to the question test readout. Is there a more direct way to deal with this? I appreciate it's likely the zero that's creating this issue (if I take the term out and provide appropriate equivalents \"x = y/A + (y-z)/B\" or \"-x = -y/A - (y-z)/B\", either will work). Essentially, I'm looking for a way to set the left hand side of my equation to ±0 (the positive OR the negative zero), or whatever the appropriate approach should be.",

The problem that I have is that the feedback appears in a pop-up window, and jsMath will already have processed the page before that appears, and so the mathematics for that window will end up not being typeset. I'm working on a solution for this that will call jsMath again after the popup is displayed, but I'm not happy with it yet. I'll let you know when it's ready. Davide",

          "Text": "The jsmath filter now uses the latest version of jsMath (3.1). This version includes a number of small bug fixes (in particular, it fixes a problem with alignment in Firefox 1.5). There are also a number of significant new features. The most important of these is that the main jsMath files have now been compressed so that they should download about twice as fast as the uncompressed versions (this doesn't affect how fast jsMath processes the mathematics on the page, only how soon it can start doing so). A second important feature is the ability for jsMath to load extensions automatically as they are needed by the mathematics on the page. Several lesser-used portions of jsMath have been moved into extension files to help reduce the initial download, and font references using the `\\char` macro will load the font automatically if it is not loaded already. Additionally, you can define macros that are linked to extension files so that the use of the macro will cause the extension to load. Similarly, LaTeX environments can be autoloaded (though no examples of this are available yet). Finally, there is a new `\\require{}` macro that you can use to load an extensionfrom within a TeX formula itself if it is needed for a particular piece of mathematics on the page ( without the need to insert JavaScript code in the page). See the change log for more details. Finally, the configuration section of the filter's `javascript.php` file includes settings for `loadFiles` and `loadFonts` , which allow you to specify additional files and fonts to load when jsMath is needed on a particular page. This provides a means of loading your own extensions (for example, loading a file that contains special macro definitions needed at your site). Davide",

The `Autoload.loadFiles` field is supposed to be either a single file name or an array of files, but you have made it an array that contains an array, and so jsMath tries to used your array as a string (a file name) and fails. (Not that it is the presence of \" `[jsMath.Autoload.loadFiles.length]` \", which was not in my earlier instructions to you, that makes this an array containing an array rather than just an array.) There is no longer any need to make changes below the \"DO NOT MAKE CHANGES BELOW THIS\" message. Instead, set the `loadFiles` field in the configuration section to \n```text\n    jsMath = {\n      Moodle: {\n        ...\n        loadFiles: [\"extensions/moreArrows.js\"],\n        ...\n      }\n   };\n```\n (where the \"...\" represents fields that I have not shown). The javascript error that you reported above confirms that this is the problem, as that line is where the file name is trying to be used. When I tried to go back to the v3.0 also gave similar error. If you made the same change to its javascript.php file, you would get the same error. Note that you will need to empty the browser cache when you change versions of jsMath in order to make sure that all the correct versions of the files are being loaded. If your server uses a page cache, you may need to reset that as well. There is no reason why switching back to the earlier filter should not work if you do that. I think that if you make the change above, the new version will work for you. Davide",

It ended up being that our /usr/share/texlive directory had discrepancies and the settings for TeX notation in moodle showed where various executables should be installed, but those were also missing. Our sysadmin figured out how to get those items installed. Installing packages can be tricky, apparently, making sure they get all the parts. I'm just glad he fixed it. The way I was able to test this was to export a course with some math formulas, then import it into the new system. That generated the image with the same hash in the filter/tex dir in the moodle filesystem. They were a different size, different bytes and the physical appearance was bigger. Once the sysadmin got the packages installed correctly, I deleted the images so they'd be regenerated and voila! It was fixed.",

I then create PDF files of my notes which I post in my Moodle installation. I hope to start audio recordings and screen videos of my lectures as well. 2. I use Camtasia and Microsoft Journal to record video of myself answering questions students have posted online. I can then upload the video for all the students to see. I don't do this for every problem, just those I feel that the video would be beneficial. A short couple minute problem usually takes me about fifteen minutes to record, edit, produce, and post. I produce it as a flash file, which usually stays less than one megabyte for short problems. Hope this helps! Scott",

Using pen tablet is a bit difficult initially as while writing on the tablet one has to look at the screen. It would be much easier to write on the surface where one can see what one is writing in the same place therefore I guess TabletPC could be worth trying for a new user.

Animations/videos are good to explain concept in an interesting manner. The web hosting disk space and bandwidth limits have become very high and it takes very less time to do the recording while explaining a concept and then upload it.

          "Text": "Hi John I teach Science, Biology and theory of knowledge on the International Baccalaureate program. Our school bought 4 interactive whiteboards so I started playing with the smart board software with a cheap A4 tablet from aiptek (170 Swiss Francs approximately 120 US Dollars). Then I noticed that the license forbids the use of anything other than Smart technologies equipment. So I looked for an alternative. I found notateit for £16.95 license http://www.notateit.com/ it is a great piece of software. You can use the whiteboard screen with a beamer for free hand drawing writing etc. Annotate on top of existing documents web site applets simulations videos etc. The ouput is as manually contolled screen or (custom area) shots or each whiteboard page as an Image. I then use OpenOffice with photoalbum installer installed which collects all images in a folder into a StarImpress (Powerpoint replacement +). This can be futher edited or directly exported to flash or pdf format. I then upload them to a moodle course or combine them into an exe http://exelearning.org/ file which can be later uploaded as a website package or as a SCORM. I tried reload and gave up with its complexity once I found exe. There are still a few issues with exe but it is extemely intuitive, has a variety of idevices to embed content into web pages or SCORM or IMS e.g java applet, audio, images, flash files (even flash video with a few problems), cloze completion tests, scorm tests etc. I have started to experiment with a three tablet set up. 2 tablets are linked to my laptop via a USB hub and laid out so students can interact with the white board. I have had some of my best lessons ever solving genetics problems with student interaction. Very quickly students were collaboratively suggestion solutions and different interpretations of the available data, applying concepts learned in previous lessons. This approach seems highly applicable to math and physics problems. The notateit software is great to pre prepare half completed slides with diagrams, animations etc for student colaborative completion. I have taught a group of students how to use the software to prepare their own presentations of problems and issues. Then the moodle course area is great to archive or publish the presentaions for critical peer review. I hope some of these ramblings help. Cheers Alex",

I will prepare quizzes as pdf documents with enough space between the problems for students to do their work (students take their quizzes on paper). After the quiz, I will post the solutions on Moodle. With the pen tablet, I will annotate the original pdf document with my solutions in the spaces provided, export jpg snapshots, and display these in a Moodle Web page. When I simulated this process with Jarnal. I discovered that Jarnal only exports a snapshot of the current page. So for a multi-page document, you must page through and export a snapshot for each page. Slightly inconvenient, but I'm not complaining. What pen tablet do you use? What would you recommend for the above application? I'm hoping to be able to get away with the cheapest consumer level tablet like the Wacom Graphire 4 x 5. Thanks again for a great suggestion.",

          "Text": "Hello John, Thank you for starting this very interesting topic! I use a \"Graphire.4\" tablet (8in x 4in) to produce short tutorial videos for my Math classes. I got into buying it motivated by a really great tool whose \"demo\" version is free in the Internet. The instructor can produce videos (with audio) in seconds and immediately give to the students a link to the video tutorial. It is so simple and fast, that I have abandonned completely the typing of long answers with MathType in word documents. Here you have a link to a tutorial video I created to answer one of my Internet student's question on how to plot a line on the x-y plane: http://www.yourotherteacher.com/demo/ysevwugfrr/index.html The student needs to have a set of speakers in order to be able to listen to the recorded audio, and of course, the instructor needs a basic \"microphone\" to record the words... This great tool was created by Jeff Jones ( a Computer pofessor at a California  College).  It can be accessed via: http://www.yourotherteacher.com and there by clicking on the \"Try ot now for free\" banner. As you would see the set up is very simple and intuitive, and you can try it just by moving your mouse. Once you get all motivated, and want to perfect your style, you will look into a pen tablet system. Jeff was kind enough to upload a couple of basic grids for me, when he learned about my interest on his tool, so you will find included two background options: one for the rectangular x-y grid and another one for polar coordinates. He is developing more and more extra features with time. For example, he has lately included the posibility of using close-caption for the hearing impared. He offers a wide variety of tools and storing features for Schools that buy a license, but there is a lot already available for the free demo users! Hope that many of instructors in this forum would find it as useful as I do. Have fun! Cristina Berisso",

I then checked that d.svg was in the same directory. But that got me thinking about the path to d.svg was by default the same as ASCIIMathMl. I then went and added the full path to d.svg in the dsvglocation variable in ASCIIMathMl and voila all graphing now works, - so it appears that IE is not understanding my relative path from within my moodle site Have others had this problem?

As the focus has been on adding all the math tools to Moodle 2 and tinyMCE we did not bother to publish patches for htmlarea. However, you can also use asciimathml's asciisvg functionality to simply add graphs using text expressions (no applet .) While I think a stable working upgrade path to moodle 2 is still sways off, the math tools available will be extensive. In the interim, you may want to change to tinyMCE in moodle 1.9 and roll out the beta of Maunos plugins If you want to add geonext to htmlarea on your own there are notes in the forum on that and on adding jsxgraph to header or meta files. The tricky bit is purporting a geonext file to the activity so that jsxgraph will parse it. Integration w htmlarea requires parallel tweaks to dragmath (editing two existing files and adding a dialog file)",

          "Text": "Dragmath does not render any maths - it just gives you different output code like LaTeX (TeX) or asciimath and you need some renderer for that code (that changes code to images or for example to MathML) Even if you enable TeX filter from Administration menu it does not mean that moodle could automatically render your TeX notations inside double dollars as mathematical images. If you have given executable mimetex file in folder filter/tex permission to execute (there are different mimetex executable files for each operation system) moodle can usually use that file. If your server has some better distribution of LaTeX installed (TeTeX, TexLive, MikTeX, MacTeX etc) and if you have set correct paths to administration of TeX filter and get your TeX distro with ImageMagick or GhostScript functional you can use a larger variety of TeX commands - mimetex has rather limited set of commands. If you install separately JsMath or AsciiMathML scripts / filters you don't necessarely need TeX based renderer (like Tex filter or LatexRender filter) at all because those scripts use other methods to produce your maths... Dragmath button is not visible in administration of editor unless you edit adminlib.php and add that one row code that Marc has explained in Docs - usually if you want to use Dragmath plugin you won't need to hide it and don't need to edit adminlib.php at all. In moodle 2.0 DragMath will be a part of core files although it will be visible by default only if TeX filter is enabled.

On my maxima desktop, it suffices that I put the instruction : load(\"logic.mac\") to have access to routines of this library.

It seems I would need administration privileged to load this library, can I have some explanations that I could give to my administrator to my administrator ? Likewise, the functions \"eval_string\" and \"parse_string\" are not allowed on Moodle whereas I can used them in my optimized version of Maxima proposed by stack. Why do some functions are not available ?",

Anyway, things we don't allow anyone to do are here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/cas/casstring.class.php#L92 It is for this reason what we review contributed Maxima packages before adding them to the list of things we have checked.  There are now over 650 sites running STACK, so we can't just include everything. I will review the logic package. If you want to add load(\"logic.mac\") to your own server the normal place to add it would be around here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/stackmaxima.mac#L120 But, things might break...

There is an inevitable loss of quality as they are enlarged ( IE uses bi-cubic interpolation to calculate the colours of the additional pixels needed).

The size of the mathematics will automatically match the size set in your browser, so if you have a very large font selected, the mathematics will match that. Moreover, if your users have the tight fonts installed, then the math will resize automatically when they scale the page (no matter what browser they are using); if they don't have the fonts installed they need to reload the page to get the size to change. In any case, I think this should help your users who need to see larger versions of the mathematics. Davide",

          "Text": "I have been using DragMath regularly, but on Wednesday (Jan. 30) I was told by DragMath that I needed to update Java . I did that, updating to 7u11, which I assume means version 7, update 11. After the installation, I was able to use DragMath to answer a problem for a student. The following night, when I tried to get on, I was again told to update Java. I reinstalled the same version. This time DragMath didn't work. The window comes up; a small loading line appears at the bottom, with the words Insert and Cancel only. When I went to the Java website, there is an applet to test the installation of Java. It indicated that I didn't have it installed properly. I followed all of the directions and tests indicated on the website, but nothing helped. I am using a MacBook Pro with OS 10.7.5. I was using Safari v. 6. I would like to know if DragMath requires this version of Java to run. If so, I don't know how to properly install Java 7u11. (It should be automatic???) Should I try to go back to Java version 6? Will that work or am I just postponing the inevitable? I hope that you can assist me since Java is tied in so closely to Moodle via DragMath.",

The attached file is from the last version. As minor enhancement we provide a possible solution for the well-known feature of TeX filter: when someone modify the code, every double escape ('\\\\') is trasformed into a singol ones ('\\'): our hypotesi is that every sequence of double escape is directly followed by a space, and we substitute every ('\\ ') with ('\\\\ ') before passing the code to the filters.

I'm triying to keep latex formulas aligned with the text they are in, however whenever I use a carrat \"^\" or an underscore \"_\" to have a superindex or a subindex the equation moves slightly up or down, I know this is becuse The css makes the images to be centered to the line so if the image is taller it goes down a bit, no big mistery there. Since I'm trying to keep it aligned I thought I could use either the rule or the raise box commands to make the equation stay where I want it; sadly this is not the case, while rule works, I can't make the box it creates invisible (0px) to use it just to style my document (this tecnique is called strut); on the other hand the raise box command doesn't seem to work if its only one ellement you are rising since the image it produces is the same height and it keeps getting aligned to the middle. With both options I run into a third problem: for some obscure reason the first letter of the equation is rendered using a diferent typography than the rest whenever I use the rule or rise box commands. I have searched the forums here and have found nothing, has anyone run into theese probles? is there a solution. Thanks",

Then you also need two potential response trees.  \"Tree 1\" will only depend on the first answer.  So, you can choose to give feedback/marks if a student only answers the first part.  \"Tree 2\" will depend on the first and second answer, allowing you to use both parts and create follow through marking if you choose to. STACK was designed with exactly this kind of thing in mind. There is currently no way for the question to adapt, e.g. to only show part 2 when part 1 is correct.  I've thought about this, but a general mechanism becomes very complex very quickly. Chris",

Then, you need to know if it has LaTeX installed. IF it was Linux, AND you have access to a shell on the host, then you can issue the command \"which latex\" and see if LaTeX is installed and where. Anyway, even if there was no LaTeX at all, the filter should work, by using \"mimetex.exe\" or \"mimetex.linux\", automatically (both are included in the default Moodle distribution, in .../moode/filter/tex/). I have read in this forum that in some Windows installations you should check if mimetex.exe is not corrupted and if it is executable (I do not use Windows).

          "Title": "STACK 2.1 release.",
          "Text": "Dear all, I'm posting a message to provide an update of our progress in developing the STACK computer aided assessment system.  I appreciate at this time of year people's attention (in the Northern hemisphere at least) is turning to priorities for the summer and upgrades in anticipation of a new academic year in September 2009. Simon and I are coming to the end of a major phase of redevelopment of STACK.  This will result in better, more reliable features and a fuller integration into Moodle.  In particular this phase of development has done the following STACK now uses Moodle's TeX filter to render the mathematics client side.  To use all the features, in particular the use of answer boxes in equations, JSMath is preferred.   (We will stop supporting TtH and TtM in the very near future.) STACK now uses a cache for increased reliability and scalability.  Details of this are online at http://stack.bham.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Question_state_caching I believe this will address many of the load problems which users of earlier versions of STACK encountered when large classes logged in and all wanted versions of a test.   The cache will also allow better reporting and data analysis, although we have a lot of work remaining to implement all these features. STACK items now include tests for quality control.  In previous versions the teacher had to test items by hand.  This was time consuming, unreliable and difficult to do over random versions.  Now this process is semi-automated with the test items being included with the question when imported and exported.  These are similar to unit tests in software development. Because the development cache had such profound implications for the database design Simon and I have been working in a different branch of the CVS . It would be best not to attempt to install STACK at this time from the HEAD CVS branch! Our tasks are as follows Finish deployment within Moodle, to allow the teacher to undertake all processes though the Moodle interface. Merge branches of the STACK code and prepare a release candidate for STACK 2.1 Upgrade our server http://stack.bham.ac.uk/ with a demonstration. Therefore, we would ask anyone interested in using STACK to be patient for a week while we finish this round of development. Simon and I will post an announcement here as soon as we have code which we are confident others can install and use.   We will still have a large number of small bugs to fix, and also some features to add to smooth the question authoring process through Moodle.  But, we hope this will be a useful contribution in the very near future. Best regards, Chris Sangwin",

          "Title": "WirisQuizzes Release Notes",
          "Text": "Hello! Gaspar from the Wiris team here. We want to start making release notes for our Moodle plugins more visible to Moodle admins, and as part of that we will be posting them here. We will also update the plugin pages more regularly. This will be our first post of this type, so any feedback and/or questions are greatly welcome :­). WirisQuizzes Release Notes We advise upgrading your WirisQuizzes installation to the latest version (4.11). In recent product releases, in addition to bug fixes, we have introduced several new features: New features ✨ In a Graphical question with initial content, there is now an option to go back to the initial content In a Graphical question, teachers can now hide auxiliary objects from the Initial Content to prevent them from appearing in the student's graph. In a Graphical question, teachers can now choose whether the labels of the objects will be shown to students. In a Graphical question, teachers can now \"lock\" the initial content, preventing students from modifying the initial elements on the graph. In a Graphical question with initial content, the \"correct answer\" animation will now begin with the Initial Content instead of a blank plotter. New tools have been added for perpendicular lines, parallel lines, the mediatrix of a segment, and the midpoint of a segment.. A helper text feature has been added for the graphical answers, enabling tooltips to be shown to the user In a Graphical question, students can now be restricted to drawing points aligned only with the grid of the problem. In questions with “MathType in a modal window” answer type, the modal window can now be moved and resized to avoid blocking the page. Bugs 🐛 CalcMe performance for certain questions involving images in the graphical plotter has been improved. An issue where adding a matrix, deleting it, and creating it again could result in unintended wrong answer correction has been resolved. Validation of certain questions involving multiletter units has been fixed. When a polygon is built on a touchable device, a central point is no longer drawn in the center of the canvas, preventing student confusion. The Auxiliary CalcMe is working as expected again. The answer field in Moodle is showing as expected when using Wiris Quizzes in all layouts. The undo button now works as expected when using the handwriting tool to draw an object in a Graphical answer question type. Switching between Initial Content and Correct Answer is no longer breaking the content edition anymore in some cases A problem when saving the labels' visibility settings has been fixed. Incompatibility problems when using #plotter1_a_b syntax have been fixed. Browser zoom-out issues on plotter/sketch/statistics questions have been fixed improving the presentation of plot elements. Technical tasks ⚙️ Moodle 4.3 compatibility. Provide an API to work around the graphing capabilities of WirisQuizzes. Improved browser memory management for graphical questions. Generic integration for PHP files are now all encoded using UTF-8. Improved compatibility with PHP 8.1 Warning removed from info.php page in Moodle 4.2 and higher.",

What you can do in this case is use Maxima's \"zeroequiv\" function on the difference and test for equality with \"true\". However, in general, zeroequiv introduces lots of false positives in my view.  Try \n```text\nzeroequiv(x-sqrt(x^2),x);\n\n\nzeroequiv(abs(x)-x,x);\n```\n which is why I didn't use this STACK in the first place!  You may have other problems with this approach.",

The question is why it should exist as a separate filter if it simply provide a tex subset. It would seem that providing the ability to read the previously employed tokens to a replacement, that Moodle 2 can be further realigned (i.e. we can continue to parse tex using the @ without having to use the algebra filter. One option I have noted elsewhere is to replace the webworks parser with latexml (see, http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/ ) , which is also perl and provides full tex to mathml. One could employ the @ with latexml and the $ with the tex filter and that way natively support mathml in Moodle. This would provide tex via dvi using $, tex via mathml using @ and potentially both via asciimathml if you want to be able to provide students (and teachers) with the ability to write text expressions in asciimath and use the svg features that have been incorporated there.... There are a number of obvious issues in looking at such a change: 1) does algebra filter usage actually deviate somehow from tex usage, 2) to what degree is the state of latexml potentially inadequate for Moodle usage, 3) would licensing present any issues (latexml was developed by folk at NIST, 4) would we be better off simply dropping the algebra filter and including the @ token in the tex filter as a step towards deprecation?",

Are there any other specifics that anyone else wants to add? For example, I note the absence of the nth root but have found instructional material elsewhere on the web which suggests that webworks uses the same notation as mathematica (i.e. $$x^{1\\over n}$$ for $$\\sqrt[n]{x}$$ ). Is this a subset of a more widely known syntax? Can other systems provide competent parsing of the syntax more economically (for example, can this also be parsed by asciimathml for example)? How did the webworks system decide upon this system and to what extent will webworks remain with such syntax?",

          "Text": "Though my International Baccalaureate high school students are likely unaware of how this works, they're happy to be able to enter expressions in the familiar \"Texas Instruments 83/84-family calculator\" format [ e.g. (x-1)/(x+1)^2 ], and have them appear as TeX-rendered expressions in Moodle. Here is \"(x-1)/(x+1)^2\" enclosed by double @ symbols: @@(x-1)/(x+1)^2@@ \" 'Nice to not have to know the TeX (\\frac{}..., etc.) for this\", my students would say if asked. Several \"TeX-generating\" applications compete with the algebra filter, such as DragMath , Sitmo , and CodeCogs . In the majority of our actual use cases, however, Moodle's algebra filter is the easiest way for students to produce the nice TeX output. It's my hope that the algebra filter will remain in place until and unless the same behavior (i.e. proper TeX expressions from \"calculator-style\" expression input) is produced—at least as efficiently—by some other filter or feature of Moodle .

Does the TeX filter do the job or not? Obviously not, otherwise, why have an Algebra filter? If it does not do the job required, then why include it? Is Moodle trying to be all things to all people? This is not Ford or GM, why should Moodle need to be? If I am sensing the drift of v2.0 there is a number of things that are essentially adapted from other, existing apps, TinyMCE NWiki, et al, so why not the TeX filter?",

Since that time I have been working on creating an open source, JavaScript -based CAS (Computer Algebra System) that is capable of doing semi-automatic and fully-automatic step-by-step equation solving. It is being designed for use in demonstrations, exercises, and assessments. Here are some examples that show a prototype of this CAS solving equations that contain a single copy of the unknown (I had to remove the http:// from this URL , because this is my first forum post and the forum only permits one URL in an initial post): patternmatics.com/examples/expressions/stepbystep/single_unknown/ A student must have a clear understanding of the structure of mathematical expressions before they can successfully interact with a step-by-step CAS. Therefore, the first features I am implementing in the CAS are related to teaching this structure in a visual way. This is what I have working so far: http://patternmatics.com/test/expression_structure.html I am thinking about integrating this software with Moodle in some way. Is anyone in this forum interested in this idea? Ted Kosan",

This kind of functionality has been done before, although sadly some of the work is now trapped in legacy code.  It would be great to have this kind of functionality available in Moodle for our students to use. For people who've not looked into this before The software Aplusix has the kind of \"reasoning by equivalence\" which Ted refers to here. http://www.aplusix.com/ The authors of this software have thought a lot about editing algebraic expressions, e.g. http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/59/15/53/PDF/Nicaud-JeanFrancois-2008.pdf The work of Michael Beeson on MathXpert is inspirational, and should be essential reading.  See http://www.helpwithmath.com/ and his paper http://www.michaelbeeson.com/research/papers/hisc.pdf is a good place to start. The Numbas people ( http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/numbas/ ) are also working on a Javascript CAS.  I wonder if there is any milage in collaborating with them?

A .pdf version of this book, along with most of Alan Bundy's research papers, can be found here: http://patternmatics.com/research/research.html Alan Bundy and his research group at the University of Edinburgh developed an AI-based step-by-step equation solving system named PRESS (PRolog Equation Solving System), and it was the focus of much of their work in the 1970s and 1980s. The final version of PRESS was the result of over 10 years of research, and it was capable of solving most of the equations that were present on A-level examinations at the time. The CAS I am building is based upon Alan Bundy's research and PRESS. I updated the PRESS source code so it would run on a modern implementation of Prolog, and I am in the process of reverse engineering it. Alan Bundy still teaches at the University of Edinburgh. He has been assisting me by providing me with additional information related to PRESS that is difficult to obtain on the Internet. Ted",

          "Text": "Hi Ted. I am \"the Numbas people\" Chris referred to. I've done a fair amount of work on parsing and rewriting mathematical expressions, but nothing on equation solving. The Numbas source code is online at https://github.com/numbas/Numbas . In particular, the mathematical parser/evaluator is in runtime/scripts/jme.js and the code for rewriting expressions is in runtime/scripts/jme-display.js . I think the Numbas parser is a bit more sophisticated than the Khan Academy parser you're using, so it might be worth taking a look at. In fact, I did some work for the OU a while ago supporting someone to make the parser work standalone, but that didn't end up going anywhere. Maybe it's worth having another go at that! At the moment it lives inside a rather clunky script-loading system; it should really be a single JS file that you can drop in without much setup. Anyway, you'll probably be interested in the expression rewriting system I have. It's mainly used to make randomly generated expressions look more like the way a human would write them, but it could be twisted to do step-by-step equation solving. At the bottom of jme-display.js, there's a big list of \"simplification rules\".These are pattern-matching rules working on trees - each rule specifies a syntax tree to match, as well as conditions on the leaves/subtrees, and then gives a new tree pattern to rewrite the expression as. Something I would like to do, and I'd be interested in collaborating with someone on, is making this pattern-matching system more powerful. I'd like to work towards a kind of regular expression algorithm for syntax trees, which could do things like match repeated groups, or account for the commutativity/associativity/distributivity of operations explicitly. For example, I'd like to be able to say \"collect all constant terms together\" in a single step, rather than the bubble-sort that the system currently does by repeatedly applying the rule \"variables go on the left of constants\".",

However, it is a fairly simple pattern matcher that does not “know” about the commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication. PRESS has two pattern matchers. The simpler matcher (which is the one it uses by default) is aware of the commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication. A more powerful experimental matcher was also created for PRESS, and it is described in the following paper: http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/using-matching-in-algebraic-equation-solving%28dd8c9205-12f6-4512-a79e-325c2d9d6420%29.html I am going to attempt to make a JavaScript version of the simpler PRESS pattern matcher for the CAS I am building.

I can make up to 5 minute videos, so long procedures I split in parts. I am extremely interested in a \"white board\" with voice over IP to offer office hours in my Internet classes. At the moment I have to use the limited services that my school provides with \"interactive TV.\" Since I do not teach Interactive TV courses, I am left with whatever time slot has not been requested or is not being used (normally 2 hours late Friday which are not very popular with any student). For actual interactive contact with students I used some time ago the (office hours) website of CCCcOnfer (for California Community Colleges) http://www.cccconfer.org but the system they used was recently purchased by \"Blackboard\", so I do not know if it will be available for free to California teachers any more. It will be ideal if someone can come with a white-board that works within moodle to teach math interactively!! Cristina Berisso",

Our current most pressing need is for a totally online linguistics course that we're running. The instructor needs her students to do some drawings (syllable diagrams & the like) & use a lot of IPA symbols that are time-consuming to type in. But we also have math & chemistry instructors who would appreciate this feature. Here's my 'wish list' for how it would work: the instructor adds a new activty to her moodle unit she chooses 'whiteboard' from the activity list she tells the students what to do, assigns grading criteria etc. just like an assignment the students click on the whiteboard assignment, do their drawing, save their work. The file is stored as a jpg somewhere in the bowels of moodle the teacher goes in & marks the work etc. Moodle will allow her to re-save the diagram with her mark-up comments & squiggles. it would be most lovely if the whiteboard could also be accessed in a collaborative way so 2 or more students could work together on a diagram. OK, that's about it for now! Gina",

The point is, that I would like to set Check_Type to true in the input options. Then the students have to enter a set and not a list or a single solution. But next to the empty set {} and any finite set like {1,2,3} also the set of the real numbers should be accepted. I was thinking of recommending \"all\" as the proper answer if the solution set was the set of the real numbers, but \"all\" is no set in Maxima. Therefore if I then use the option Check_Type the students will not be allowed to enter a regular set and I basicly give away the solution, if I don't use the option Check_Type some will probably not type any set. Is there any solution to this? Stephan.",

I know from the volume of email I receive that STACK is being widely used, in some places by large numbers of students. E.g. up to 4000 users at a single site. However, while companies have data on customers, open source software is available for free download . To get a better idea of the extent to which STACK is being used with students I would invite you to take part in a short survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/35QQVH3 I appreciate the value of your time, but it would assist me greatly in making a case for future funding to support the development of STACK if current users could provide me with some details of their usage. For colleagues who have looked at STACK but decided not to make use of it, I would very much like to know why they have chosen not to do so. In releasing the STACK computer aided assessment system we invited colleagues to join the STACK online community http://stack.bham.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=16 Those people who use, or are interested in, STACK are again invited to join and contribute to this site. If you would like to contact me directly about STACK, rather than completing the survey, then please feel free to do so. Thank you. Chris Sangwin C.J.Sangwin@bham.ac.uk",

Executive summary STACK is a computer aided assessment system for mathematics which makes use of the computer algebra system Maxima to generate random questions, establish the properties of answers and to provide sophisticated mathematical feedback. This document reports the results of a survey of who uses STACK and the extent of this use. Ten sites responded to the survey to report their use of STACK. The code base is sufficiently reliable for regular use with very large (> 1000) groups of students. STACK is available in English and has been translated into Finnish and Japanese. The most significant barrier to use was the difficulty in installing STACK, both for evaluation and for deployment.",

          "Title": "Release of STACK 3.6 and STACK 4.0.",
          "Text": "It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of two new versions of STACK . ** STACK 3.6 ** STACK 3.6 represents a major new release.  The most significant feature is the new \"line by line working\". This enables students to solve an equation (or simple real single variable inequality) by progressively transforming their expression.  STACK accepts the entire argument, and establishes various properties such as \"are all lines equivalent?\", \"is the last line in 'solved' form?\" and so on.  I will write more about this feature in a separate email, but it represents the first significant step into full automation of students' free-form working. These features include a very large (bewildering perhaps) array of design choices.  I have released a *minimum* working product which automates line by line reasoning.  The intention is to work with students and teachers over the next year to identify the key features needed, and the most sensible ways of using this facility.  For example, is immediate feedback on each line of working actually helpful, or just a distraction?  We need to undertake some detailed research to better understand these issues, and I would very much welcome collaboration in pursing this aspect of online assessment use. ** STACK 4.0 ** STACK 4.0 represents a major new release and brings important developments in a parallel fork of STACK back into the main master branch.  These developments have been written by colleagues at Aalto in Finland, and I am very grateful for there significant contributions and ongoing collaboration.   These features have been widely tested in the parallel fork of STACK. In addition to the features in STACK 3.6, STACK 4.0 adds \"question blocks\".  Question blocks are conditional statements within the CAS text.  This will allow the text seen by students to adapt in highly non-trivial ways to the random variables, with whole blocks of text being revealed or hidden.  Looping structures enable the automatic generation of code which can be interpreted by Javascript which generates diagrams.  The architecture of the question blocks is very flexible and extensible.  I am only now beginning to appreciate the possibilities of this design.  Watch this space. STACK 4.0 is tagged as v4.0 and is available from the master branch.  This will be installed by default as it is the branch being supporting in the future. ** Why two separate releases? ** For the first time in many years we have changed some of the question authoring mechanism in STACK.  Instead of including CAS statements with @...@ question authors are now required to use {@...@}.  The extra curly braces enable better matching, and more reliable parsing which were essential in the question block engineering.  We have also introduced {#...#} to embed the *Maxima value* and not the *LaTeX representation.  For example, {@sin(n%pi)@}-> \\sin(n\\pi) whereas {#sin(n*%pi)#} -> sin(n*pi).  This is essential for communication with other software (e.g. chart generation) which needs a more formal syntax and does not accept LaTeX. Users upgrading from STACK 3.X to STACK 4.0 will find that existing questions need to be converted to the new syntax before they will function correctly.  We have developed an automatic conversion script which I have used reliably on our materials, but this is such an important step that I have decided to enforce a manual review before converted questions are saved.  Therefore, admins upgrading servers will need to work with question authors to facilitate this change! ** Future plans ** The University of Edinburgh will be using STACK 4.0 in the 2017-18 academic cycle.  I will support STACK 3.6 over the next academic cycle with bug fixes etc.  Anyone requiring support for STACK 3.X beyond June 2018 should contact me privately to discuss this further.  New features will only be added (by me) to STACK 4.X, Bug fixes etc. will be supported here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/tree/version3.6 While the line by line features will undergo further active development over the next year (and hence may change in STACK 4.1) the other features, including the blocks, are stable and I hope existing users continue to find STACK a useful and reliable assessment tool. I'd like to thank the team of translators who have translated the language packs in the STACK plugin. I very much welcome collaboration, and contributions.  Examples of questions, research studies, contributions to the documentation (e.g. examples of how to author particular questions) are easy to contribute without having to develop code. Comments welcome. Chris",

          "Text": "Hi all, I was wondering if it was possible to pass variables from STACK to the question text without rendering them as TeX. I would like to generate diagrams in SVG or canvas based on the variables used in the question, but this is impossible if the variable is passed as a chunk of code to be rendered as a graphic. For example, say I want to draw a diagram with variables aX and aY representing the endpoint of a vector \\(\\vec{A}=a_x\\hat{\\imath}+a_y\\hat{\\jmath}\\) drawn from the origin. I would like to pass these values into a script that draws the vector without all the html surrounding it. I've thought about writing a small script that searches for where the figure is rendered and pulls the variable out, but there has to be an easier way than that. I know this is possible to pull off with the \"Calculated\" question types in Quizzes, but since STACK doesn't talk to other question types, I'd end up having to stick with one question type over another. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading! Cheers, Peter",

          "Text": "Update: After some fiddling around, here was my best shot at a solution. Really, it's a modification of the code shown in the Geogebra tutorial by Andreas Schenkel. I had to create a work-around since \"MathJax-Element-x\" doesn't show up after my question is rendered, so my script is looking for elements that, as far as it could see, didn't exist. I also admit that I'm new to using jQuery (like, really new) so I may just be missing some simple solution. Anyways, here goes. I wrapped each variable whose value I want to extract with span tags and gave them an id. So, if the variable was {@a@}, I gave it the id aNum , i.e. <span id=\"aNum\">{@a@}</span> At the end of the question, I added a script that extracted the text from the element and then removed the curly brackets (since each value showed up like {x.xx}, where x.xx is the number I want). The code looks something like this, in case anyone is interested. <script src=\"https:// ajax .googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/ javascript \"> var aVal = jQuery('#aNum').text(); aVal = aVal.substring(1, aVal.length - 1); </script> From there, I have the variable to use in plots or whatever else I like. It's probably not the most elegant solution, but it seems to work at the moment. Thoughts? Cheers, Peter",

Using this option allows you to reject the answer as being invalid because there are insufficient numbers of significant figures.  The student (who has the calculation in front of them...) can type in a couple of extra places and demonstrate they can do this problem.  Even if the question says \"give your answer to 4 significant figures\", (or the student should know from the context) people often forget.  If sig figs/dps isn't the point of the question I think this can be unfair.  But it is up to the teacher in context to decide.

The \\boldsymbol macro usually has a different use: it provides bold numbers, symbols and greek letters that can not be obtained via \\mathbf. The blackboard bold symbols are actually provided by the `AMSsymbols` extension, not the `boldsymbol` extension, and `AMSsymbols` defines `\\Bbb` for accessing the blackboard bold symbols. They are part of the `msbm` font, and it turns out that when `msbm` is loaded, it does redefine `\\mathbb` to do blackboard board. But that only occurs when the `msbm` font is actually loaded, and the `AMSsymbols` extension doesn't actually load it, it only sets things up so that it will be loaded when needed. Unfortunately, that means that `\\mathbb` is left as its jsMath default, which is to act as `\\mathbf` . This is a bug, and I will fix the `AMSsymbols` extension to redefine `\\mathbb` initially. You can add that yourself by editing `jsMath/extensions/AMSsymbols.js` ; go to the bottom of the file and duplicate the third line from the bottom (that defines `\\Bdd` ) and change ' `Bdd` ' to ' `mathbb` ' in the duplicate. That should do it. As for `\\boldsymbol` , I think it does what you suggest it should: it makes bold numbers, greek letters and other symbols , and has nothing to do with blackboard bold.",

One way would be to create a directory `moodle/filter/jsmath/jsMath/local` and put a file there called `local.js` that includes the definitions that you want to have performed automatically. For example, if this file contains \n```text\n      jsMath.Macro('mathbb','{\\\\msbm #1}',1);\n```\n then that would define `\\mathbb` to do the blackboard bold that you were requesting. Once you create `local/local.js` add it to your `javascript.php` file in the `loadFiles` array along with `extensions/AMSsymbols.js` and `extensions/boldsymbol.js` .

The Algebra filter employs a simpler syntax, similar to the display format of Texas Instruments graphing calculators and should be adequate for the range of mathematical expressions encountered in secondary school and early college level mathematics and science courses. To trigger the filter, enclose the expression within double @'s: @@@expression@@@ To escape the filter enclose the expression within triple @'s: @@@@expression@@@@. Some basic examples of algebra syntax are shown here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=5402 The TeX filter employs the TeX notation for typesetting mathematics introduced by Don Knuth in 1982, which has become the standard for mathematics publishing at the university level. Its syntax is more complex than that used by the algebra filter, but it can accomodate the full range of mathematical expressions. To trigger the filter, enclose the expression within double $'s: $$$ expression $$$ To escape the filter enclose the expression within triple $'s: $$$ $expression $$$ $.  Here are some web pages explaining some basics of TeX notation: http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/course/intro2.html http://www.math.tamu.edu/~harold.boas/courses/math696/LaTeX-in-line-equations.html http://abel.math.harvard.edu/computing/latex/manual/node21.html http://www.matheboard.de/formeleditor.php Installation of the Algebra and TeX filters is a bit more complicated than the basic Moodle installation, as they rely on an external program called mimeTeX to convert mathematics notation into inline graphics. Mimetex binaries for Windows, (most versions of) Linux, and MacOS X are included in the distribution.  Binaries for other systems are provided at http://moodle.org/download/mimetex/ . An additional complication is that certain unzip/ cvs programs on Windows handle binaries inappropriately, resulting in a corrupt installation of the mimetex binary.  Should that happen, a clean binary should be obtained from http://moodle.org/download/mimetex/ Finally the Algebra filter requires Perl to be installed on the server . This is a standard part of Linux, but most Windows servers will need to install that as well. A suitable distribution of Perl can be downloaded from: http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ To diagnose problems in the Algebra and TeX filter installations, debugging scripts are provided. They may be accessed via the urls: http://yourSiteName/moodle/filter/algebra/algebradebug.php http://yourSiteName/moodle/filter/tex/texdebug.php",

You can't simply change theme header.html files to issue 'Content-Type: text/xml' declarations, as the html Moodle produces is incompatible with the stricter rules for xml parsing. The easiest way round this is to convert the MathML into T E X, and use the T E X filter, which is what the MathML filter that we have does. An alternative is some clever Javascript widget , but this would need to be applied on an item by item basis. I'd like to display some stuff I have written in MathML, and unlike Jeff Graham , I'd actually prefer to keep it as MathML if at all possible, but it's looking like the -> T E X -> GIF route is the only viable prospect, yes?",

I am doing this by trial and error, although I have read the STACK documentation on Authoring/Answer_tests.md, and the recommended article on Portable Regular Expressions by Dorai Sitiram. Neither tell you how to do it in sufficient detail. Suppose the desired answer is \"clean\", but I would accept variants \"cleanse\", \"cleaning\", and similar. I would also like to replicate the properties of stringSloppy question types, case insensitive and ignoring leading spaces. The following almost works. Student answer: string(ans1) Teacher answer: string(\"(C|c)(L|l)(E|e)(A|a)(N|n).*\")  (don't know why I needed both string and \"\", but this is one thing I found that worked.) This will not ignoring leading spaces, but it will be case insensitive and will match anything which starts with \"clean\". To ignore leading spaces, I just put in front \"\\s*\", i.e. string(\"\\s*(C|c)(L|l)(E|e)(A|a)(N|n).*\"). This does not work. I also tried escaping the backslash, \\\\s. This also does not work. Can anyone explain the proper way to use SRegExp? My impression is that backslash character classes don't work. I tried \\w* at the end and that did not work.

A more direct integration with moodle has been the team working with Gustav Delius, which is similar in some respects, employing another open source symbolic algebra parser (Maxima?).  There is even a remote question protocol behind it. Unfortunately I haven't had time to try either, but they would appear to be the golden nugget.",

If it has no meaning then you could just have students type in \"bar(x)\".  Then define texput(bar,lambda([ex],sconcat(\"\\\\bar{\", tex1(first(ex)), \"}\"))); to display the \"bar\" function (which does nothing) with a bar over the argument. Do you have \"mean\" in mind? Maxima has a \"mean\" function already.  Is that what you want? That's a little more complex, because Maxima's mean function expects a list. If you type mean(x) you will get an error.  You could put the following in the question variable. mean(ex):=texmean(ex); texput(texmean,lambda([ex],sconcat(\"\\\\bar{\", tex1(first(ex)), \"}\"))); but then you won't have the \"mean\" function available elsewhere in the question!

For the adaptive behaviour no problem because we are in fact not using adaptive but using Tim's adaptive for multi part questions behaviour, so lines 434-442 $showfeedback is corrected according to the part graded state, not the question graded state. Unfortunately we can't do that for other behaviours as all we have is the question graded state. A very quick fix would be to show the feedback if the question graded state is wrong or partially correct. Of course this would not be perfect as feedback for some parts will be displayed even is that part's response is correct, but at least if all the question is correct no part feedback will be displayed (only general and combined feedback). I think this is the best we can do without too much work (we don't have enough information provided by the behaviour to know the graded state of the part). But maybe I am wrong ?",

As a result, the whole point of the assessments is kind of lost. I tried one idea: breaking a problem down into several smaller steps so students have to work through the whole process instead of just giving the final answer. It works to some extent, but it also makes the quiz design way more complicated and time-consuming. Has anyone found better ways to structure online tests so students actually practice instead of just pasting everything into ChatGPT?",

I just started with a set of pH calculations that include the calculation of a logarythm (decadical, lg) for the teachers answer. But no matter what i do, whenever i check the correct answer in the preview i get \"-lg(x)\" (where x was calculated correctly and represents some value), but I want a Number! I tried `float` which results in the whole formula being shown, and i tried `radcan` to simplify. If i calculate the logarythm and insert it as answere it is not recognized as correct (even lg(100)=10, so its no preciseness issue) Can someone please give me a hint what to try next? Elisabeth",

But, while the healthcheck is quite a simple test, with few moving parts, if you are on a development server, you can simpify it more. Try making a file called test.php with contents like \n```text\n<?php\nrequire_once(__DIR__ . '/config.php');\nrequire_once($CFG->\ndirroot\n . '/question/type/stack/locallib.php');\nrequire_once($CFG->dirroot . '/question/type/stack/stack/cas/connectorhelper.class.php');\n\n$PAGE->set_url('/test.php');\n$PAGE->set_context(context_system::instance());\n\necho $OUTPUT->header();\n\n$casstrings = [\\stack_ast_container::make_from_teacher_source('1+1',\n        'test_instantiation_and_return_values()')];\n$session = new \\stack_cas_session2($casstrings);\n$session->instantiate();\n\n$result = $casstrings[0]->get_evaluated()->toString();\nprint_object($result);\n\necho $OUTPUT->footer();\n```\n Then access that in your browser. And, while doing this turn of the various caching option in the STACK settings, to make sure you are always directly calling goemaxima. Debugging that might be even simpler than debugging the healthcheck page. Really, there are two places the error might be, either goemaxima is not working, or the STACK settings are wrong. If you cant work out which it is, well digging into the above could you should find that in question/type/stack/stack/cas/connector.server.class.php in comes down to a curl call to the goemaxima server. So, can you work out that HTTP request and do the curl call from the command line? That might help find where the problem is.",

The task is to check for correct mantissa but wrong order of magnitude for input with units. I know how to do this for numeric input. Question variables `mantissaOK(x,y,tol):= is(abs(round(log(x/y)/log(10))-log(x/y)/log(10))<tol);` PRT AlgEquiv: SAns: `mantissaOK(ans1/tans1,0.005)` Tans: `true` Feedback for true: Mantissa is correct but the value is off by at least an order of magnitude. Check your units handling. If tans and ans contain units, then this only works if the units exactly match because otherwise they don't cancel out in the log() argument and create TIMOUT rubbish in the feedback. My impression is that equivalence of units is only handled inside the Unit... answer tests. For the above order of magnitude test I need an algebraic equivalence test, which doesn't seem to cancel MPa against N/mm^2. Is there a way to simplify expressions like MPa/(N/mm^2) to 1? Being wrong by some orders of magnitude is a very common error, so I'd like to include such tests by default in formative feedback.",

The truth has two parts (i) I teach mostly pure mathematics, so I don't have a need for a lot of numerical checking functions (otherwise I would certainly have done this myself!), and (ii) I don't have time to do everything myself and really need some help. Are you able to contribute this? If so, 1. Please create an issue on Github, https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack and a branch of the code named \"iss???\" to reflect the issue number. 2. I suggest the code goes near here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/assessment.mac#L594 3. The real work is (a) documentation and (b) testing. This is really important because I'm the one who gets support requests! Or people duplicate the code, so thanks for avoiding this by posting here.... Please include very big and very small examples, as used by extreme physics (astronomy and atomic physics). An example of a similar issue is here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/commit/0838bac4d8bca9fb9b384d03135cf1838440c81f So, if we get the code right it is not a huge amount of work to add. If you can't figure out how to add in the test cases (and it is a bit of a pain to set up unit testing in PHP etc), creating the test cases on a desktop Maxima is more than enough. Send me all the test cases and expected outcomes in a sensible format and I'll add the code to the branch!",

There has been a tremendous amount of discussion of MathML and Moodle. First, let me describe what I am doing. I compose my documents in LaTeX and translate them to other markup languages. For example, I use tex4ht to produce XHTML with MathML. So it is natural for me to start there with Moodle. This has lead me to try Jipsen's javascript MathMLinHTMLforFirefoxAndIE.js, instead of the other flavors of his scripts that seem to be popular in this forum. I am thinking particularly of ASCIIMathML.js. MathMLinHTMLforFirefoxAndIE.js works, but the Moodle editor undermines its application. If I paste the appropriate HTML into the editor in HTML format and save immediately the all is well and everything displays correctly. However, if I return to the editor and save again. The editor makes changes to the MathML code that render it useless. Three particular changes have caused all of the problems that I have detected so far. First, any \"<mspace ... />\" tag gets turned into \"<mspace ...> ... </mspace>\" so that the closing \"</mspace>\" is separated from the opening \"<mspace ...>\" causing rendering errors. Second, any \"<mo class=...>\" becomes \"<mo &#010;class=...>\" Third, the \"<mi>\" tag gets expanded into '<mi -moz-math-font-style=\"italic\">' These do not all occur after the first edit. I suspect that these are just examples of some more fundamental mistake or misunderstanding. Removing these changes with an ASCII editor puts things right again.",

One of the things we have been toying with has been the the impact of using various span tags which makes the markup more complex, but yields an arguably more powerful editor.

So maybe I do not understand your question. An example of my understanding is probably helpful. If I were to use asciimathml, then I would need to markup my text all over again for an asciimathml version of my original LaTeX document. A translator replaces LaTex \\section{} markup with HTML <h?></h?> for example. A CSS can then bridge the specifics of the formatting requirements for text and mathematics. How does that sound as an explanation? The current limitation to the HTML DTD is not very restrictive, at least for me. And in the longer run, I am expecting that we will all move out of HTML and into XHTML in any case. Cheers, Paul",

To the contrary, asciimathML (which includes a good bit of LaTexMathML) will parse and display most tex, as in \\sqrt[3]{27}=3 . If your entire document is in LaTex than you may want to look at just working with LaTexMathML. There hasn't been much in the way of development on it for some time, but its available and the fellow who wrote it is always willing to chat. If you just have LaTex in a doc, then asciimathml will parse and display the tex as MathML. While this requires the server to offer xhtml, I think this is quite a bit nicer than fighting with html.... If you are doing something else entirely (i.e. some additional translation, like convertin LaTex to OOo text or vice versa) I am not getting the picture - sorry. I don't know that the war over html5 or xhtml is so simply resolved.... seems like lots of folks opposed to xhtml",

As I said, I realize that I can keep my math in LaTeX for asciimathml, but my documents also contain text so I cannot just paste a LaTeX document into Moodle. But with a translator from LaTeX to XML with MathML, this is essentially what I can do in the XHTML world. Moreover, I can easily turn my LaTeX document into a first-class PDF document as well. One source can go to several outlets. If there is no need to write in several markup syntaxes, then it is easier to correct mistakes in one place than to trace them down in several versions of a document. And I was asking because it seems as though I could do this quite easily if the Moodle editor were not altering my code in hurtful ways when I return to it. At least that is what seems to be happening. I admit that I may be quite wrong about the directions of HTML, XHTML and XML in the future. When I saw a while back that it was easy to do wholesale translations of LaTeX into MathML, it seemed to me that it was time to move in that direction. I was not trying to work inside Moodle at the time. I was pasting XML documents directly into the courseware my institution has been supporting. I thought that the next generation of course ware would itself produce XHTML and Moodle does, right? But for reasons beyond my understanding that still does not permit direct insertion of MathML into the the editor. There we are restricted to HTML, as I understand it.

As you can see, if I put 2\\sin^{-1}1 inside doubledollar signs the tex filter at moodle.org will display the proper tex: $$2\\sin^{-1}1$$ which appears to be the expression you were trying to have displayed. You should first understand that Moodle can employ a number of different filters, and it looks like you are trying to use the algebra filter which uses I believe the double @ signs, but are expecting the tex filter to work, which uses double dollars signs.... so the first order of business is for you to understand which filters are in place and working on your moodle. Once you have checked that we can talk about the functioning of one filter at a time so that there is less likelihood of confusion. I would suggest that you disable the algebra filter in your moodle and enable the tex filter, then test the tex install to make sure it is fully operational. asciimathml and jsmath are other options for displaying math, but either of those have to be added to Moodle....",

The text of the note: Dear Google Apps admin,​ In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology. This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5. As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 ​as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers. We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010. After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar. Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above. Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser. We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change. In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience. We are aiming to beat that in 2010 and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration products for businesses.",

          "Text": "Björn, This is an interesting and important topic. The short answer is \"no\" we don't have code for this situation out of the box. However, the flexibility of Maxima means you could create a function which supports this situation. E.g. a function `recurring(n,m)` which holds the non-recurring bit n and then the recurring bit m. More recent versions of STACK allow you to then deal with this with tex.\n\nAssuming you are happy with the recurring bit as an integer you would do `texput(recurring, lambda([ex], sconcat(tex1(first(ex)),\".\\\\bar{\",tex1(second(ex)),\"}\") ));` Then, in the PRT you can define the function \"recurring\" as a rational expression, i.e. `` \n```text\nrecurring(n,m) := block([k], \n    k:1+floor(float(log(m)/log(10))), \n    n+m/10^k);\n```\n You probably want a more flexible situation in which you can do more, so your display function becomes `` `texput(recurring, lambda([ex],if integerp(first(ex)) then sconcat(tex1(first(ex)),\".\\\\bar{\",tex1(second(ex)),\"}\") else sconcat(tex1(first(ex)),\"\\\\bar{\",tex1(second(ex)),\"}\") ));` This is, of course, all untested. I hope this gives you a pointer as to how you could define a Maxima function to represent a recurring decimal, and (a) display it, and (b) evaluate the function later in terms of the rational number it represents.\n\nThe input side of things is more difficult. We have ambitious plans to enable teachers to have much more flexible input options, to either interpret students' input or combine two boxes (start and recurring bit) into a single value to show the student \"your answer is ....\" For now input is somewhat fixed.\n\nAnyway, I hope this gives you some idea of what would need to be done.",

I'm running maxima using a separate Tomcat server with a MaximaPool setup.  For reasons I won't go in to, I've updated our STACK plugin to 4.3.11 (2022060100) rather than the version released a couple of weeks ago,  Our test server is internal only and can't be accessed off campus. For the life of me I can't remember if I was seening this issue in our test environment prior to my update today.  The test passes fine in my Production environment from which our Test environment is cloned.  Production is running STACK question version 4.3.11 (2021072200). I wonder if anyone can suggest reasons why unicode support should fail and how/if this can remedied? Thanks, Stuart",

My colleague Niels Wallet also had issues with this in 2021 and this was discussed in a STACK bug report here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues/732 I have taken over responsibility for the server form Niels. This UTF8 issue (and another more serious non-STACK issue) was solved by correctly configuring the PHP .ini settings as required for moodle. In this case, our PHP [intl] extension needed to be correctly configured as per the guidence here: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/admin/environment/php_extension/intl The intl.default_locale value wasn't set at all and from what I can tell, it they falls back to other system settings, but this can be unreliable. I set this value as: \n```text\nintl.default_locale = en_GB.utf8\n```\n After doing this an recreating the maxima image, my healthcheck page ran with no errors and I was able to deploy the image to my MaximaPool setup.  All looks good and no obvious problems (so far).  Hopefully this will continue to solve this issue in future STACK upgrades too.",

I often have to change that to a higher permissionlevel, by loging into my site using DirectAdmin, provided by my provider. So: If I have a problem, I always check the permissionlevels first. To insert tex-formula's I also started to use dragmath 0.6.2 (latest version- see plugins and discussion in mathematics tools).A nice and useful tool. As a dutch speaking teacher I apologize for my bad English. regards",

I find myself constantly switching between unformatted editor and Atto or TinyMCE (don't know the implications of choosing one or the other). This always takes a series of mouseclicks, just for changing a setting in the question like type checking. It seems there isn't an undo option for such accidents, is it? I see these options: - Stick with the unformatted editor and use an external html editor for visual editing (copy from Moodle, do the edit, copy back) to avoid editing raw html and enable insert of images - keep separate files with the contents of the cas regions in stack questions and paste them into moodle in case of an accident or when I create the content.  In fact that is what I do with JSXGraph content outside STACK in order to have syntax highlighting when doing edits. - make backups (export) of questions and re-import them in case of accidents. Yet I didn't find a way to export individual questions. Any of these ways generates significant amount of extra work load. Is that the way it has to go or do I miss something? Martin",

Documentation for the master branch of the code is on https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/CAS/Plots.md with examples, but you should check the local documentation on your server to see which options you have available.  There have been some recent changes. In the case of your example, x^2+y^2 is an expression with two variables.  In Maxima, plot2d(x^2+y^2, [x, -1, 1], [y, -1, 1]) does not work either.  You need to create a single variable expression, to use plot2d (or plot in STACK).

This is possible for only the Maxima question variables, however. In the code you posted, you try to mix the Maxima variable `xo` with the JavaScript loop index variable `i` . When scanning the code, STACK does not recognize the variable `i` since it is not in the question variables. If using an integer as index, this works, because the expression `xo[4]` can be evaluated in Maxima. To solve this, you can assign the Maxima variables to JavaScript variables inside the JSXGraph block like this: \n```text\njsxgraph\n\n\nvar board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard(divid, {axis: true, showCopyright: false, boundingbox: [-1,6,6,-1]});\n\n\nfunction islessthan(a,b) {return Object.is((a-b)%1,-0);}\n\n\n// Point Coords\n\n\nconst xo = {#xo#};\n\n\nconst yo = {#yo#};\n\n\n// Loop\n\n\nfor (let i=0; islessthan(i,{#k#}); i++) {var P = board.create('point', [xo[i],yo[i]]);\n\n\n}                /*should now work*/\n\n\n/jsxgraph\n```\n Best regards Bernhard",

          "Text": "Hi John Thanks for your interest in STACK. Simon and I are working hard to make the code reliable and efficient. We've been using it this term with groups of 225 students in large computer labs here in Birmingham. I'm confident now it is working well, but am also painfully aware of some minor bugs we need to fix! Yes, questions can be served remotely. We have a \"minimal client\", you might like to look at this here. http://matsrv3.bham.ac.uk/worksheets/ This uses the opaque protocol, (as does Moodle) but does not have any content management. This is really just to demonstrate STACK is not tied to Moodle. Also, the source code of these questions is already in the STACK CVS , so they are available for use by anyone. I've used JSMath because (i) it is a Moodle filter, and (ii) seems to work well. STACK now just leaves the LaTeX in the question. STACK could generate some MathML on the fly but the question author also needs to write some mathematics. And, we wanted to put answer boxes into equations! JSMath seems to be working well. Students very much appreciate the ability to scale the mathematics, but keep the main font size fixed. So JSMath is not a \"requirement\" in theory, but is the only supported mechanism currently. I'd be happy to receive contributions from other LaTeX->screen solutions, tuned for STACK. The reason you need JSMath on the STACK server itself is for the teacher to test questions with the direct interface. If you only author yourself through Moodle, then JSMath need only be on Moodle. If you have questions you are willing to share in STACK format, there are plenty of holes in our current coverage. We are working on 140 algebra questions to cover the material in http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/staff/ad_barnard/Pocket.pdf I had hoped these would be ready before term, but I just keep being ambushed with something else! We have some partial converters for other question formats into STACK. http://stack.bham.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Converting_question_formats So, if you have lots of existing materials it may be possible to get STACK to load and partially convert them. Thank you for your interest, Chris",

          "Text": "Hello I have set up STACK with Maxima/MaximaPool according to the instructions found in the MaximaPool GitHub project . In short, that means: Set up STACK and Maxima on the Moodle server according to the instructions in the STACK GitHub project . Run the health check in the Moodle admin interface, and have it generate the optimised Maxima image in `$MOODLEDATA/stack/` . Copy the generated image (and the `maximalocal.mac` file) to the separate system dedicated to Maxima. Set up the rest there ( `pool.conf` , `process.conf` , …), generate the Tomcat Webapp file ( `MaximaPool.war` ), and install that to `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/` , then start Tomcat. When pointing STACK to the separate Maxima(Pool) instance, I then notice that it just times out while the MaximaPool threads all remain stuck in the first call to `waitForOutput()` in \n```text\nMaximaProcess.\njava\n```\n (called by the `MaximaProcess` constructor). To see what exactly is going on, I did some \"println debugging\" in `MaximaProcess.java` : \n```text\ndiff\n--- a/src/fi/aalto/maximapool/MaximaProcess.java\n+++ b/src/fi/aalto/maximapool/MaximaProcess.java\n@@ -208,6 +208,7 @@\n \t * @param test string to look for in the output.\n \t */\n \tprivate void waitForOutput(String test) {\n+\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Testing [\" + test + \"] against [\" + processOutput.currentValue() + \"]\");\n \t\twhile (processOutput.currentValue().indexOf(test) < 0) {\n \t\t\ttry {\n \t\t\t\tThread.sleep(0, 200);\n```\n The output I got from that in the system logs was the following: \n```text\nTesting [\"Maxima restarted.\"] against []\n```\n So it appears that MaximaPool somehow doesn't detect any output from Maxima itself; the value returned by `processOutput.currentValue()` just remains an empty string at all time. Therefore the strings defined in `process.started` (and later `process.ready` ) are never matched, and MaximaPool remains blocked in `waitForOutput()` . As a comparison, this is what happens if Maxima is run manually: \n```text\nroot@moodle-maxima:/var/lib/maximapool/2020120600# sudo -u tomcat ./maxima_opt_auto -eval '(cl-user::run)'\nWarning: argument a not recognized.\nMaxima restarted.\n(%i2) load(\"/var/lib/maximapool/2020120600/maximalocal.mac\");\n\n[ STACK-Maxima started, library version 2020120600 ]\n(%o2) \"/var/lib/maximapool/2020120600/maximalocal.mac\"\n(%i3)\n```\n Out of curiosity, I commented out the two lines that call `waitForOutput()` , and that seems to solve it: MaximaPool now continues with the execution of Maxima itself, and at least the STACK qtype health check in the Moodle admin interface also runs successfully (as opposed to just timing out). I could now probably go on an debug the MaximaPool code further to see if there is somehow an issue with its handling of stdout of the Maxima process, but perhaps someone more involved with the project has an idea what might be wrong here? Here's some additional information about my system: Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 Tomcat version: 9.0.31 Maxima version: 5.43.2 Please let me know if you need any more information, or if you have any hints for what else I could check to debug this further (short of just debugging the InputStream part itself).",

          "Title": "Access to the STACK demo exercises to understand their structure",
          "Text": "Dear Moodle / STACK community, my question is the following: are the STACK demo questions from https://stack-demo.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo/course/view.php?id=77 available as XML files to learn how they were constructed? I.e. can one download them for testing on a local moodle/stack server ? The reason for this question is that we are developing new STACK exercises for an entry level university physics course. There are two central issues that we encountered that seem to be solved in the demo: STACK-4.3.7-demo / Authoring features / Advanced features -> Follow through marking (question 10) . What we need is to A) make subsequent questions aware of prior answers. I.e. if a student has answered e.g. part a) incorrectly but has correctly used that wrong answer in solving part b) we wish STACK to be able to recognise that fact even if the final result for b) is incorrect. B) allow the student to \"Check\" parts of the questions without having to enter answers into all boxes. In the demo exercise one can insert just a) and leave b) blank, press \"Check\" and receive feedback on a). In our setup the system requires all answer boxes to be filled before allowing to check the results. Thank you for your time and looking forward to your suggestions. Many greetings, Alexander",

The stack is an area of program memory which is used for general temporary storage.  A common technique in use by crackers is to exploit programming sloppiness to overflow the stack with malicious executable code.",

Apart from the fact that Moodle installed fluently on 9.2 and not on 10.0, I finally managed to get them run. Starting the TeX and Algebra filter brought another two different results: on the 9.2 machine the Algebra filter works on the other it does not. On both machines the TeX filter works, but the filter setup is different. On 9.2 I use the standard values for the TeX filter, on 10.0 I have to remove the TeX headers. More crazy: If I use the standard values, each time I call the filter configuration, I get an additional leading backslash in the value field for the header.

It has a more robust and configurable way of parsing scripts from HTML as well. However, I am not sure what the interest really is in something like this in the moodle community in general, and Moodle HQ in particular.  It does not seem developers  seem are really really in favor of continued support for TeX binaries now that MathJax is in 2.7. Rather, than asking whether to close MDL-599 , I would like to discuss what the future of the TeX filter should be.",

Based on what has transpired in the last few months,  I can see an argument for a TexLive filter for those with TeX needs beyond those that can be addressed via MathJax, which is a narrow band I would think of largely University level Math users relying on extensive macros or packages not supported by MathJax. The current TeX filter can serve that need, especially if it is needed to support the Algebra filter, which is still in use by lots of Moodle around the world.  But one thing that has to be resolved is whether the Algebra filter can be successfully decoupled from the TeX filter (so that the results of whatever the Algebra filter does is past agnostically to any TeX parser. And that of course is one reason why a MathJax preprocessor for ALgebra notation could be handy, as it eliminates the need for a perl distro (though arguably most linux/unix based systems will have it anyway), consolidates the tools used for most Moodle SAs and users, and frees the TeX filter to be what it needs to be without having to address the needs of those who really are not interested enough in Tech to bother.",

However, as mentioned in the Introduction section of http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html , \"There's no inherent need to repeatedly write cumbersome <img> tags.\" It goes on to illustrate a simple one-line fix for phpBB that permits inline expressions containing [ t e x ]...[ / t e x ] to render the ... expression as a mimetex image. And that could just as easily have been $$$ ... $$$ (like moodle) instead. But I'm not familiar with moodle code, nor with the mechanism for submitting changes. While it's easy for me to say the moodle fix should be just about as simple as the phpBB fix (i.e., easy for me to say \"simple\" when somebody else is doing the actual work), mimetex's whole design is based on the idea that such fixes should be pretty straightforward. But Martin, or somebody else familiar with moodle internals, will have to confirm this for moodle. Unfortunately for us, \"Zig\" seems to be busy with other things these days. To make mimetex even safer and simpler, instead of <img src=\"myserver.com/cgi/mimetex.exe...\"> you can write <img src=\"http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.cgi...\"> which uses the public mimetex server running on my ISP. That way, you don't have to install or run mimetex (or any special math software) whatsoever. But you still do need the fix that recognizes $$$ ... $$$ and generates the corresponding img tag. John",

Upon checking out the current STACK docs for a relevant section for this topic, I stumpled upon https://stack-demo.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo/question/type/stack/doc/doc.php/Authoring/Options.md , more specifically the option \"Surd for Square Root\", i.e. Maxima's \"sqrtdispflag\". This might be an even more specific solution to Tim's problem compared to the \"simplify\"-approach I suggested. The mailing list with a discussion on this topic is no longer available - at least not following the link in the docs. Looks like this topic has been discussed at some point in the past.

At this time it works best with Adobe SVG Viewer and this viewer works best with IE, but there are hacks to make it work with other browsers too. On the other hand web browser support for SVG is getting better with Opera 8.0 and the upcoming Firefox 1.1 . This may not be enough to run sMArTH yet but things will surely evolve. Also the Renesis SVG 1.2 Rendering Engine will be available this autumn for Firefox /Mozilla/Netscape, Internet Explorer and Opera. The sMArTH developer team is planning to rewrite sMArTH from scratch this summer using a new SVG widget platform ( SvgUP ) and with the goal to make it more modular, customizable and extensible. We also have the intention to make sMArTH easily embeddable into larger web applications like moodle . Would you be interested in collaborating with us? Kind Regards, Catalin Hritcu sMArTH Team",

The student would do the work in smarth, then copy the LaTeX from smarth and paste it into a Moodle text box (in a quiz or online assignment). It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing!

So, the short answer is that if all you want to do is decouple DragMath you need not bother with SEE. If, on the other hand, you want to provide your teachers and students with a set of extraordinary math tools, then install the plugins and show them to your Math teachers and see how they respond. Frankly, at some point I suppose someone will have to take some Math lesson and then demonstrate point by point how SEE could impact instruction.

It's just an initial release, and so may not be suitable for production servers, but worth a look nonetheless. If you need to insert equations in questions, then you probably need to insert them in other\nelearning content as well, and if you are already familiar with the Word Equation Editor,\nthen this plugin would allow you edit all of your equations in Word and import them to wherever\nyou want in a Moodle course.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodle Community, I'm currently working on enhancing the algebraic formula input capabilities in our Moodle environment, specifically within the STACK plugin. I've come across CortexJS MathLive , which seems to offer a robust virtual keyboard for algebraic formula input. However, since CortexJS is not a regular Moodle plugin and requires the addition of JavaScript , I'm uncertain about the best way to integrate it. Has anyone here successfully installed CortexJS MathLive in Moodle? If so, could you share your experience and any tips on the integration process? Alternatively, if you know of other plugins or solutions that provide similar functionality for algebraic formulas in the STACK plugin, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations. Thank you in advance for your help! Best regards, Graz",

Many years ago we developed the \"DragMath\" Java applet , but support for that has ended.  It would be great to improve the user interface to STACK with a graphical option. I've not looked at CortexJS in detail though. Since STACK is integrated into Moodle and ILIAS (and we have a recent stand-alone API) we also have a discussion forum here: https://stack-assessment.zulipchat.com/# It's likely someone else has looked at this, and they may have integrated it (and not told anyone!) or rejected it for good reasons.  Perhaps you could raise the issue on zulip as well?

The interface I have developed allows you to link to such an assignment from within Moodle.

Maybe you can be so kind and help me understand... - If there are multiple variants deployed per question, how would you ensure that different questions within the same quiz actually draft the same variant (seed)? - Using the same random seed for consistent variable generation is most likely not reliable. If, at all, wouldn't this only work as long as variable generation in both questions is exactly identical? (That's a guess on my part, not verified.) - As far as caching is concerned, aren't you good to go as soon as variants are deployed? We always suggest adding at least basic test cases to cover answer testing, too. Seeds can be chosen manually, too... for a large number of variants / questions this will surely be impractical, but it might serve well for a proof of concept. Cheers Thorsten",

          "Text": "Hi, Im trying to use WEBWorK on Moodle through the use of the opaque question plugin. I have two issues : 1- Using a basic configuration of mathjax in combination with the tex notation filter the TEX used in Moodle works fine. We even installed the tikzpicture package and almost everything runs great. Problem is when we try to link a WeBWorK question through the opaque question plugin, the rendering of tex cause [Math] to appear instead of the TEX in the WeBWorK question (note that all the other TEX use directly in Moodle works fine). It appears that the [Math] problem is Mathjax not able to render the TEX fonts. 2- We were able to do a workaround for the first problem by using additonal HTML in mathjax and now the TEX in the WeBWorK question runs fine...but all the TEX function (like \\begin{tikzpicture} ) doesn't work directly in Moodle! I can see it load quickly for a second but then it seems to reprocess and only the TEX code is left. It seem has if the tex notation filter isn't usable anymore and only mathjax does the rendering!!!! Is there a way to use additional HTML configuration without droppin out all the rendering the tex notation filter did? here is what i added in additional HTML : <script\ntype=\"text/x-mathjax-config\"> MathJax.Hub.Config({</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml :lang=\"en-ca\">config: [\"MMLorHTML.js\"],</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">    jax:\n[\"input/TeX\",\"input/MathML\",\"output/HTML- CSS \",\"output/NativeMML\"],</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">extensions:\n[\"tex2jax.js\",\"mml2jax.js\",\"MathMenu.js\",\"MathZoom.js\"],</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">tex2jax: {</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">      inlineMath: [\n['$','$'] ],</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">      displayMath: [\n[\"\\ \\[\",\"\\\\] \"] ],</span></p><p>\n\n</p><p><span lang=\"en-ca\" xml:lang=\"en-ca\">     \nprocessEscapes: true }, TeX: { extensions:\n[\"mhchem.js\",\"AMScd.js\",\"AMSmath.js\",\"AMSsymbols.js\",\"noErrors.js\",\"noUndefined.js\"]}, \"HTML-CSS\": {\navailableFonts: [\"TeX\"] }, styles:\n{\".MathJax_Preview\": {visibility: \"hidden\"}}, MathML:\n{     extensions: [\"content-mathml.js\"]  } , }); </script> <script\ntype=\"text/ javascript \" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ ajax /libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\"> </script> Jonathan",

It is possible to configure MathJax to render that anyway, but it will only be visible in certain browser. This makes it a very bad idea to use.

In your other post https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=219049#p1043794 geogebra plugin was written for TINYMCE and MOODLE 2.4/2.5+ If you switch to tinymce editor in administration menu (plugins > Text editors) and if you have downloaded correct code from http://www.wiris.com/en/plugins/moodle/download and have read http://www.wiris.com/plugins/docs/moodle Wiris editor should work ok. On the other hand if you want to use that old math plugin package with Tinymath editor you should not use official Wiris filter - because filter should discuss with the correct editor... I have not upgraded math plugin packages since 2.3 versions and I use myself tinymce files today - tinymath is \"a dead one-man-project\" that was necessary for testing when core moodle 2 tinymce did not yet have full support for custom plugins... NOTE: Core editor integration was changed in moodle 2.4+ so 2.4+ plugin files won't work in 2.3 editor and 2.3 editor plugins won't work in 2.4+",

I went to site administration and moodle upgraded the filter and plugin. Because there was no Wiris plugin in tinymce plugins folder Wiris gave a note that Wiris plugin might be missing - otherwise the Wiris plugins worked ok with tinymath editor ( I had enabled Wiris plugin from Math filter settings and enabled Wiris filter ) Next I copied the Wiris plugin to tinymce plugins folder and I did not get any errors - and no note about missing Wiris plugin. So according to my test you can use Wiris plugins both with core tinymce editor and with modified tinymath editor. I still suspect that there might be some \"mixture\" of old and new files on your site - there can't be two Wiris filters but there can be two plugins in different editors - maybe some old file is in cache, non upgraded or some new file is missing, corrupted or in a wrong folder (people sometimes unzip files to wrong subfolders like filter/filter... have you tried to purge all caches from administration menu? If some character is breaking php code it often comes from edited files when people use non suitable text editors that add extra characters or change file format when you save files - or sometimes some javascripts or server side scripts can break code but you should see some error messages in browser error console or site debugging then... and sometimes single files can get corrupted when you move them with ftp ... \"Auto\" vs \"Binary\" vs \"ASCII\" file transfer",

This way I only can avoid penalization by setting the question level penalty to zero (or perhaps the prt-node-level penalty to zero). Thus I can't switch this behaviour on quiz level but only on question level. If so, it would mean the question behavour setting on quiz level is ignored. In this case I'd vote for a hint in the question form, that any quiz level settings for penalty are ignored.",

Is there a way to do something similar generating PNG or GIF's? A second possible solution for me would be to produce the graphics beforehand, rather than at run time, and load them into a course. That might mean generating the SVG files and converting them to PNG's or GIF's, and then uploading them. To give you and idea of my current work flow: I generate questions sets using a spreadsheet (for example, I might produce 10-20 versions of the same question, each with different parameters). I have added several functions to the sheets to translate and produce the TeX. If I want to include graphics, I generate them first using screen captures, encode the appropriate parameters in the file names, then have a filter generate the appropriate question. It is an arcane process. Being able to generate the questions and the graphics from the appropriate parameters would really streamline things.",

A toy example: instead of `((X[1]-3)^2+(X[2]-3)^2)/2` we want to require something like `sum(X[i]-3)^2, i, 1, 2)/2` . EqualComAss test is too restrictive and may disallow more complex solutions containing summation. Another purpose is to ensure that \\(\\prod_i e^{x_i}\\) or \\(e^{x_1}\\cdots e^{x_n}\\) is \"simplified\" to exponent of a sum .",

(1) I'm using Moodle 2.4(dev), so the course may not import into a much earlier version.  If you have problems please let me know and I'll ponder what to do about it. (2) If you find some errors with the questions, (I have tried to test them throughly, but they won't be perfect) then please let me know. I'd particularly welcome an exported updated working version if you can manage it, otherwise I'll fix the reference copy myself. (3) I'd very much welcome any contributions in a similar direction if you have materials you are willing to release. Chris",

          "Text": "Hi there, Does anyone know how to use Tex notation to cross-out parts of a expression? The idea is that I wil use moodle to teach logic to people who, most of the time, don´t understand math. So, if I have something like: $$ \\frac{20! 6!}{18! 5!} = \\frac{20.19.18!.6.5!}{18! 5!} = 20.19.6 = 2280$$ It is obvious that 18! and 5! are both canceled out, but several people are not able to see that and I need to show on screen that the numerators and denominators are being crossed out. I tried doing that in different ways, but the only option that showed some promisse was using \"\\not\" before what I wanted to cross out. Like that: $$ \\frac{20! 6!}{18! 5!} = \\frac{20.19.\\not18!.6.\\not5!}{\\not18! \\not5!} = 20.19.6 = 2280$$ But, as you can see, for 18! and 5! just 1 and 5 are crossed out and I would like something like 18! and 5! . The crossing out of just the first element  would confuse the students, for sure. As it seems, \\not would only work for unitary stuff, such as crossing out variables like on (and remember that my students are, mostly, completely dumb about math): $$ \\frac{2x}{x} = \\frac{2\\not x}{\\not x}=2$$ Anyone know an alternative to cross out?",

          "Text": "Gustav, Good question. The general principal is that validation should not depend (too much) no the actual answer, and should mostly be about syntax issues.  That way validation doesn't vary (too much) from question to question.  In my view, interface & \"validity\" should be a reasonably stable concept from the student's point of view. There is a \"same type\" concept, which does of course depend on the actual answer, but this was mostly to ensure system stability.  If the PRT expects an *equation* y=m*x+c and the student gives an *expression* e.g. m*x=c, then when the PRT take the right hand side, you get an error.  Lots of assumptions about student's responses, and problems arrise from false assumptions, can be dealt with by having type at the validation level. Ideally, we'd have a more subtle and sophisticated concept of type, e.g. %poly(Z; x), or %poly(Q; x,a),  etc.  This could then be used selectively to reject some things which can't possibly be correct.  I think this might be difficult to author, and hard for students to understand. To actually answer your question, have a look at Maxima's listofvars() function. There are a couple of ways of using listofvars(ex).  If you'd just like to know if a single variable appears in an expression use member(p,listofvars(ans1)); To check if it depends on more than one variable in a single step, use sets.  I'd do AlgEquiv test on setify(listofvars(ans1))  with {x,a,b,c}. for example, where the set {x,a,b,c} is the set of variables you want.

          "Text": "Transforming Assessment web seminar Wednesday 7 Nov 2012 Title: Automatic assessment of mathematics Presenter: Dr Christopher Sangwin (University of Birmingham, UK) In this free session Chris will describe and demonstrate the STACK question type in Moodle which is designed to assess algebraic mathematics. The basic design requires students to respond with an algebraic expression, rather than using multiple choice questions and can randomly generate versions of problems, establish the properties of any answers and generate outcomes, such as feedback. This serves to increase range of valid assessments in methods-based courses and mathematical subjects. Discussion of the changes in student behaviour will also be covered. When: Wednesday, 7 November 2012 at 07:00AM UST/GMT (Duration approx 1 hour). See your equivalent local time at: http://timeanddate.com/s/29wc A countdown timer is also available at http://www.transformingassessment.com A recording of the session will be published after the event. RSVP to receive login information: Please RSVP via email to 'rsvp at transformingassessment.com' Please use the subject line 'RSVP webinar 7 nov 2012' You will receive an automated response with login instructions.

          "Text": "A few months ago, I installed STACK using the modified opaque question type, and was quite happy with it. Sadly, I was not able to get it running in server mode, which meant that it was rather slow to grade questions when many were submitted at once. I tried to remedy that this week with poor results. Apparently, when I reinstalled STACK, my opaque engine stopped working properly, even when I entered the new key. My misadventures continued. I ended up reinstalling STACK. I deleted the original engine that had connected me to STACK and created another. The connection was detected. Here, however, is where things get ugly. When I went in to create a new opaque question, I would get errors saying that the database name of engine id 3 could not be retrieved. This, of course, was the engine that I deleted. I resolved to uninstall the opaque question type and reinstall it, hoping that this would resolve the problem. To that end, I scoured the moodle database using phpMyAdmin and removed all entries and tables pertaining to the opaque question type and deleted it's directory from the myserver/moodle/question/type directory. I also went into moodledata and deleted a directory there that pertained to opaque. Finally, I tried to reinstall opaque by copying the directory back and navigating to myserver/moodle/admin, but nothing happened. What must I do to reinstall opaque? Are things completely FUBAR now, and if so, what should I do to rectify the situation? Any guidance would be appreciated.",

I noticed a link for a new translator in this discussion http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=22718#119404 but it seems you can no longer add translators since these files don't exist after installation.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  Is there anyway around it for students who don't want to learn either TeX or algebra syntax?",

This may have a number of unforeseen consequences that could wreck what it is that you are trying to do. You would be better off downloading and installing a text editor that allows you to save in a UTF-8 format, like TextPad or NotePad++ or Crimson Editor . TextPad is proprietal and the other two are Open Source or Freeware. A lot of people love their Crimson Editor, but I have never used it. I have used both the other two and I cannot pick the difference, except I think I prefer the less flashy TextPad to NotePad++ (but I am an unimaginative and dour type of person, you may like the pretty colours, I dunno). Best bet here, go and have a look at these pages . Oh, btw , the Moodle forums are set up for you to ask almost any question either in a general category, or specific categories like Installation or Forums, or HTML Editor. Think about your questions, where do you think they fit? You might get a lot of help from these forums, or you might not get any help if you put a question in the wrong forum, or someone may advise you to repost the question in another forum. Good luck and enjoy your Moodle.",

To the best of my knowledge, no-one has had time to work on this since February 2019, so nothing has changed. It remains the case that having STACK work in the mobile app would be nice. Alos, probabably if anyone had time to engage with it, then some progress would be made. However, there is a lot to learn to understand both the mobile app, and the question system. And, even if you did, this would be a substantial piece of work.",

Open the Main Menu and go to \"System\" > \"Administration\" > \"Synaptic Package Manager.\" Enter your password, and then, when the program comes up, open \"Settings\" > \"Repositories\" from the menu at the top of the window.

We let the students type the system equations for static mechanical problems into matrix cells. (6x6 for 3D Problems). A lot of those cells need to be zero tho. to make it easyier to type, we’d like to fill all empty cells with zeros or at least fill all the cells with zeros from the beginning. i cant seem to find the answer for this problem. we tried to substitute the „empty“ cell with zeros. but we cannot get the variable of the empty cell to tell maxima to substitute it with zero. can anyone help with that? greetings Danny",

After replacing the mimetex.linux by the /usr/bin/mimetex file installed with apt-get install mimetex, I could get the TeX Filter fallback to mimetex to work fine. The problem is still with convert to work in order to avoid the fallback and get nicer equations. As a sideline, I´ve tested  MathtML, which worked fine, totally avoiding the TeX filter, but because I have lots of quizzes using $$ to define inline Math expressions, I believe it is not a practical solution at this time.",

I tested this in my old server, upgrading to 2.6.2.... there was a fallback to Mimetex in the Tex Filter. The full TeX convertion was taking place without problems in 2.6.1 and broke in 2.6.2. By the way, /usr/bin/convert run from command line, as you suggested, works fine, creating the png file. The problem is some place else. In any case, I invested some time in MathJax configuration and ended up disabling the TeX filter, moving to the MathJax alternative. So far I´m pleased with the results. I´m following the discussion on having MathJax already integrated in Moodle 2.7. I believe that is good move.",

The people who create STACK have created an interesting plugin that is a version of core Moodle enrol_lti that allows the use of a template course which is duplicated automatically \"behind the scenes\". It can be used  to link between different sorts of LMS, e.g. providing STACK (or any content)  to people using Blackboard or Canvas. I have been testing it recently and have been very impressed particularly as it could reduce the amount of maintenance creating courses.  You can find out more about it here https://github.com/maths/enrol_lticoursetemplate",

The challenge, now, is to make the question as general as possible while presenting expressions (from maxima) exactly as I want them.  The problem comes up when coefficients may be negative.  When I display a sum defined as a maxima expression the result looks too good, because maxima sorts the terms. If I write a sum of maxima expressions, I need to use parentheses to allow for negative numbers, but ideally I only want necessary parentheses and not superfluous ones.  It would also be better to simplify to avoid unary signs without reorganising terms. Does this problem have a solution?  Is it possible to make inline TeX code conditional by using maxima logic?  Any other approaches? Obviously, I can restrict the range of parameters and create different questions for positive and negative ones, but I try to minimise the number of questions I have to maintain.",

So if you define the following in your question variables simp:false; eq1:x^2+1+2*x=0; then {@eq1@} will be displayed in the same order as defined above. Also negative and randomly generated coefficients should be fine. If you have somewhat longish coefficients like a+2*b you can still simplify these coefficients seperately. This solution comes to limits, because if you generate your coefficients randomly and do not forbid -1, 0 and 1 as values, then you might end up with an equation like -1x^2+1+0x=0, which does not look very nice. So I normally try to avoid these \"critical\" values with my randomization. Stephan.",

Can I start with installing MAXIMA with my package manager (e.g. apt-get install maxima) or is it better to download maxima and compile it manually ? Are there installing manuals available ?

I've logged a bug about this issue here, including more detail, a screenshot and step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-66544 Any advice/fixes really appreciated!

If the timer js fails it will would not automatically redirect when the time has expired, nor would students no the time they have finish. They would work on a problem or page without knowing that it will not count. I would suspect that this is something that you may be able to fix in the theme renderer. Are you working with a standard theme?",

The timer is still running, but the student has no indication of how much time remains. Once the student reaches the point where the time has expired (though they don't it) they can continue to work on the question, but as soon as they navigate away, say to the previous question, they get bounced to the attempt finished page. All in all it is unhelpful behaviour which basically means you can't use the timer functionality with embedded LTI quizzes. Regards, Stuart.",

          "Text": "I thought I would follow up with one final post about this in case anyone in the future needs help resolving it. Because of the impact the issue was having, I decided to dive in and work out my own fix. I have essentially changed the theme files I was using (boost theme) to update the embedded layout rule to point to different versions of embedded.php and embedded.mustache which add in the blocks column.  I've carefully documented this process and included some sample files for an older and newer version of moodle.  See attached zip file. In the long term I would see the best fix in core to be either my fix, although I don't know all the contexts in which embedded layout is used and therefore cannot comment on undesirable side effects.  OR an additional layout is created for LTI specific embedded based on my fix. I checked the impact of not having the blocks show against a range of tools.  Quizzes are serious impacted.  The Book resource tool will not show the Chapter block.  I was unable to test the Workshop tool due to the amount of effort required to set it up.  All other tools/resources did not have any dependencies on the side blocks and therefore aren't impacted by this issue. I've also updated my bug report with the attached with the hope that a fix makes its way into the core code in the future. Thanks to Daniel for giving me the initial pointer in the code so I could start to unpick the problem. Regards, Stuart",

To quckly review, yes, if one places the applet code in an externally accesible locatio then it is easy enough to reference the codebase, as in the case of the java sketchpad jsp directory getting installed at fqdn/jsp. Others have noted that one an use relative paths, but that is going to be very problematic fro someone who is not the actual administrator.... The obvious answer is to be able to place the applet files in a directory created by Moodle and use the Moodle reference to access it in the html, which makes the files easily accessible to the teacher with a minimum of confusion as well as unavailable to everyone else on earth (see my prior note on the use of the /jsp install of the sketchpad files.) I have now tried a variety of things to accomplish this. By way of example, the java sketchpad files are installed here: http://fqdn/files/index.php?id=12&wdir=//jsp If you go to here: http://www.moodle.alaskapolicy.net/files/index.php?id=12 jsp is the first directory listed, and is listed as above And use slash args is tagged.

The point of this is to define \"elementary rules\" which will transform the expression repeatedly. Start in the Maxima sandbox and load(\"elementary\"); As an example take your expression, simp:false; p:x^2-(-5*x^2-14*x+2) ; Now, we can apply \"rules\" such as \"distribute unary minus over addition\", this is called \"negDistAdd\" p:transr(p,\"negDistAdd\"); this gives x^2+(-(-5)*x^2-(-14*x)-2) Next, we need to use associativity of addition, \"assAdd\" p:transr(p,\"assAdd\"); x^2-(-5)*x^2-(-14*x)-2 We continue with a rule which removed \"--\", p:transr(p,\"negNeg\"); x^2-(-5)*x^2+14*x-2 Notice, this sorted out the \"-(-14*x)\", but not the \"-(-5)*x^2\", but as I said, this code is experimental and I never finished this off.....

If you are using the fallback code that I have posted then yes there are some things that need to be fixed and I am going to have to work with Mauno to make sure I understand what may have happened to your usage. Yes, asciimath is wonderful and I encourage you, based on the sentiments you have expressed here to VOTE to include asciimath as a core Moodle 2 technology and a complement to DragMath. See this forum link for details! http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=102954&parent=455471 Firefox is SOOOOO simple because the fonts can easily be installed and you need nothing additional to do SVG but d.svg installed in the same directory. Additionally, if you have looked about you have noted that asciimath comes with a calculator and you can use that as a source to actually construct lots o stuff (one example is EqEd, the asciimathml equation editor, which is included with xinha in Mauno dropin xinharepla replacement for htmlarea (plug, plug, plug) However, because not everyone is using firefox (yet) I think it important that Moodle users have a simple solution that includes fallback when the browser is unable to do the MathML, for whatever reason. Its for that reason I am trying to find the time to finish the fiddling I am doing with David Lippman's fallback script so that a) users only get one warning per session, b) the warning simply indicates what needs to be installed (if the browser will support MathML/SVG with incremental installs) and advises that asciimathml will fall back to using mimetex or mathtran c) and admins have adequate details so that they can install via theme so as to avoid conflicts in other modules and speed processing s well as point the fallback at an appropriate mimetex or mathtran server . Frankly, I am disappointed that Moodle .org does not use it for Moodle (you can post a tracker request to that end) In any event, while some of the asciimath code can be quite confusing, you will see if you look that you can change the delimiter tokens (your versin should use <amath>...</endamath>, <agraph> and <endagraph>, as well as <`>...<`> and <$>...<$> (I am using \"<\" and \">\" for illustration purposes only, asciimathml does not use this style of xml tag) the /$ not the same as /$/$ (the former used to tell asciimath to parse tex, the latter being ignored by asciimath) . SO, you can fiddle about with tokens and the symbol tables and just generally have a ball.",

          "Text": "Hi, I came accross this thread while geting ready to write something about asciisvg and internet explorer. Anyway it got me thinking- mainly because like you I can't force my students to use Firefox. Yes IE is not great but it shouldn't be that bad. So having a closer look at that equation. \\begin{graph} xmin=-6.3; xmax=6.3; xscl=1; plot(x*sin(1/x),null,null,1000); width=200; height=200; border=25; xmin=-1; xmax=6; xscl=1; ymin=-1; plot(sin(x)+2.5); a = [0,0]; b = [5,5]; marker = \"dot\"; line(a,b); text(b,\"b\",aboveleft) ; stroke = \"red\"; path([a,[0,5],b,[5,0]]) ; stroke = \"green\"; marker = \"none\"; curve([a,[.25,0],[.5,.5],[1,1],[1.5,1.5]]) ; stroke = \"blue\"; circle([5,0],1); ellipse([0,5],1,2); stroke = \"purple\"; rect([0,0],[2,2],null,.5,1) ; marker = \"arrowdot\"; line(a,[5,0]);\\end{graph} I got that pop up error in IE but it still drew a graph. When compared to firefox's version they were exactly the same. But then I realised that neither had drawn the first plot. So is IE just being more correct by notifying that there is a problem where FF just ignores it and moves on. Anyway I believe that this graph statement should not have two versions of xmax and xmin, and I would think it is at least best practise to define the graph area before plotting anything. If you take out the first set as they are over-riddent by the second set, and move the first plot statement so it is after the scale statements i.e. \\begin{graph} width=200; height=200; border=25; xmin=-1; xmax=6; xscl=1; ymin=-1; plot(x*sin(1/x),null,null,1000); plot(sin(x)+2.5); a = [0,0]; b = [5,5]; marker = \"dot\"; line(a,b); text(b,\"b\",aboveleft) ; stroke = \"red\"; path([a,[0,5],b,[5,0]]) ; stroke = \"green\"; marker = \"none\"; curve([a,[.25,0],[.5,.5],[1,1],[1.5,1.5]]) ; stroke = \"blue\"; circle([5,0],1); ellipse([0,5],1,2); stroke = \"purple\"; rect([0,0],[2,2],null,.5,1) ; marker = \"arrowdot\"; line(a,[5,0]);\\end{graph} it now works in both IE and firefox. (although it did take about 40 seconds more to load in IE than firefox. regards Shaun ps - I too think asciimathml is a great little script. Been using it since moodle1.5. What I was going to write about was the difficulty I have in getting graphs to display at all from moodle to IE. Way back then it was a small bug in asciimathml if I remember. Anyway I upgrading to 1.9 and again could not get graphs to show in IE. I have finally got it to work but I had to actually set the full path to d.svg in asciimathml and voila graphs now work correctly. (don't reply to this problem here as I will now go back and start a new thread about it)",

          "Text": "Hi, Unfortunately our moodle/ STACK service went off line this morning for a number of hours.  We run moodle on an Ubuntu based server setup (with separate servers for database and goemaxima/docker) and it exists solely to deliver STACK based quizzes. We've pinned down the problem to the number of inodes/files reaching the capacity of our moodle server.  This was preventing apache from reliably restarting and also blocking an integration to moodle.  After we diagnosed that the inode capacity was at maximum, we resolve the issue by removing a historical copy of the moodledata directory and also by clearning the STACK question cache which had 722,214 entries in it. I note that from the moodle 4.4.0 release notes, this is mentioned: The number of CAS-evaluation sessions has been cut down significantly. Conversely, the amount of things happening in a single CAS-session has grown significantly. This may affect your Maxima load and the size of the CAS-cache. You may need to retune your operation if you have fine tuned it based on those details. This will also affect cache keys and values so tuning caching may also matter if one tunes everything. Does this refer to the file caching that is done or database caching? We have built up 722,214 cache entries since August. Is this high or what you would expect under STACK 4.4.0+ ? (we are running 4.4.4). One of our actions is to increase the size of the /var directory where moodledata is stored which will in turn increase the inodefile number capacity. What other optimisations do you recommend to help our server cope better? Were there any signicant changes in moodle 4.0+ that resulted in the number of cached files increasing? Our server info says that these were also big users of files:",

I was reading through some other posts and found a program called jpgraph which I think would be most beneficial for our program.  I am just wondering if other people have different suggestions for programs to use, and if there is a way to take data gathered in a questionnaire and have it autograph with a program to help cut down on man hours used. Any help would be greatly appreciated",

          "Title": "New version of algebra filter",
          "Text": "Enclosed is an update to the algebra filter, which converts calculator type algebraic expressions (aka TeX without backslashes) into gif images.  The main improvement is that one can enter these expressions delimited by @@ tags, i.e. @@some algebraic expression@@. This circumvents the current incompatibilities with the HTML Editor, which currently mangles the alternative <algebra>some algebraic expression</algebra> tags. (The <algebra> tags are still recognized by the filter.) If one wants to enter a single @ character, one can do so without the filter transforming it. If one wants to enter @@, @@@, @@@@, etc. without interpretation by the filter, one needs to enter an extra @. Thus @@@ comes out as @@, @@@@ as @@@, etc. and the filter will not try to interpret adjacent text as algebraic expressions. Some additional improvements are that the filter now recognizes a wider set of algebraic expressions than in its previous incarnation. For instance, it will now allow = signs, differentials, derivatives, and integrals. You can visit my site at the following url: https://webwork2.math.ohio-state.edu/moodle1_2d/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=12&username=guest , where some examples are shown. You will be automatically logged into a special guest account which allows posting to the forum, so you can experiment with entering expressions on my site, and I hope you will do so. The cvs has also been updated.",

          "Text": "I'm having a little trouble getting the units to be recognized correctly on this STACK question that I've attached.  I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that \"g\" is the only unit expected here because I haven't seen similar behavior on other questions. As an example, an answer might be 65.0g.  When that's entered, I get the following results: Input Insert Stars Strict Syntax Result Expected? 65.0g Yes Yes Invalid NO 65.0g Yes No Valid Yes 65.0g Yes, single character Yes Invalid NO 65.0g Yes, single character No Valid Yes If I edit the question to use \"m\" as the unit instead of \"g\" then 65.0m is valid Insert stars and strict syntax on. In a different question where the answer might be 1440000ng, I get the following: Input Insert Stars Strict Syntax Result Expected? 1440000ng Yes Yes Valid Yes 1440000ng Yes No Valid Yes 1440000ng Yes, single character Yes Valid (but splits n and g) Yes 1440000ng Yes, single character No Valid (but splits n and g) Yes Now you're probably saying, \"well just turn off strict syntax. That will fix it.\"  And it will for the first one.  But a student who puts in scientific notation with strict syntax off will get the E treated as a unit.  And that doesn't really work well for things like 1440000ng. Thoughts?",

Since we have some koefficients in our matrices, I tried to use the SubstEquiv testing method. But it doesn't seem to work in a matrix. Is there something I didn't consider? I found a workaround, that are quite some work with the feedback tree though. First I tried to build the matrix myself, so that there a are ton of answers, but there I had the problem, that moodle accepted the answer even when not every field had a value -> no feedback, no points for the student. Then I used the Matrix as input type and compared every entry in a single knot in the feedback tree with SubstEquiv but in the end I still need to check, that all entries use the same variables which seems to be quite complicated in some cases.... So my questions: is there any way, that I can use subst equiv for matrices? Or is there at least a way I can get hold of the variable list a student used in his answer? That way, I would be able to manipulate his answer myself... Thank you for reading! Maybe someone has a good solution for my problems.",

          "Text": "Hello all....first of all, I'm not a Math teacher, but I need to train Math teachers on the use of our 1.9.2 Moodle system. I have done a lot of studying of TEX language, and figured I would use that to help our Math teachers create math symbols in Moodle resources. So to test my own ability, I typed into a Moodle web page several lines of TEX notation, and they rendered exactly right! I was very proud of myself, until I returned the next day, opened up the web page of TEX language I had created the day before, and found IT WAS NO LONGER RENDERED CORRECTLY. Now it just looks like regular text, blue in color. Why would it render correctly one day, but, without any editing or changes in the TEX notation......NOT render the following day? Thanks for your help!",

Since I need a working instance of STACK to create the desired demonstration, this is a typical case of the Egg and Chicken problem. So my question is simple: does any one knows where I can find some impressive examples of the capabilities of STACK put into work?

I expect you will find much that you need, and it would be a shame to have yet more Maxima commands which do substantially the same thing. If you need to load a package in your own version of Maxima (for test or implementation) you can add a line to ...\\moodle\\question\\type\\stack\\stack\\maxima\\stackmaxima.mac This can't be done per-question or by the teacher - it would be a huge security risk.

The current setup uses the CDN version of MathJax, as you know but, you may not know that you can install a local version of MathJax and use that. When you have downloaded and installed a local version, you can then mod it by adding any packages you want. Obviously you will need Ghostscript or similar to convert the TeX, I don't think that comes as part of MathJax. One issue you may run into, (you shouldn't but..) Atto uses the CDN as native, but may not play nicely with a local version, so you may have to use TinyMCE as your editor. There are any number of TinyMCE plugins that will extend the user friendliness of TinyMCE that are just not yet available for Atto, including music notation, Poodll Anywhere and lots of other stuff. Another possible alternative is to download and install the entire texlive package to your server and add that to your Moodle. (Not difficult,, but can be tricky.) That way you can add anything you like without having to adapt or rewrite any of the MathJax custom code. I'm sure someone else will have a better approach than this, but it might help.",

This enables students to link seemlessly from the WebCT course to NetTutor without having to log in a new username and password for NetTutor.

The problem We sometimes allow students to take a practice version of a quiz many times and then afterwards, an assessment version which uses the same questions from the question bank. Unfortunately, we discovered that the randomisation\nseed worked in such a way that the question in the assessment was EXACTLY the\nsame as the first practice attempt i.e. the same set of random numbers had been\ngenerated by the same seed etc. At the time, there did not seem a proper\nsolution to this so we got round it by creating a duplicate of each question\nand then applying a minor change (e.g. changing one of the randomisation\nparameters). Can you confirm if this was a known issue some years back and is now no longer an issue? Recently we have re-tested this issue and can no longer reproduce the problem. but I want to be sure before I start inviting new users to use our STACK service. Thanks and best wishes, Stuart.",

I refer to \" Not all Maxima functions are enabled by STACK , for obvious security reasons. It may be that your function belongs to a library which STACK does not load by default. Do you need to use Maxima's load command to use it? If so, you will need to ask your system administrator or the developers to add a load command so that this library becomes available. Some libraries are optional and may not be included by your local installation. You should also be aware that there are also a number of functions defined by STACK which are not standard Maxima functions. The command you need may well not be enabled since you should use one STACK provides instead.\" Lot of greetings Regine",

In any event, 9000 files later I have what I think is the complete curriculum in both English and Spanish running. I have also located a contact in Spain (José R. Galo, Coordinador Proyecto Descartes) who is willing to correspond about the work the Ministry has done (this is some very nice material) and I have asked him to subscribe to the forum. The course work is actually outside the moodle as the courses are not self contained as one would see in a SCORM and I would be happy to provide info to anyone wishing to look at ripping any of it pending the Ministry's resolution of the download issues. I did post previously about ways to identify a correct codebase from within a moodle resource or activity without requiring that the resource live in the same directory as the applet and in a directory that is exxposed to the external world (i.e. accessible without resort to the moodle) and have had no takers on that one. I have noticed code such as this: \n```text\ncodebase\n=\"<?php echo $CFG->\nwwwroot\n.'/lib/editor/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/dragmath/\napplet\n/classes' ?>\"\n```\n and while this does not use file.php to reference the applet, it would appear to be able to offer restrictions to access of the applet beyond that available at present (which makes the applet available to the whole world) and I will try tolook at converting some of the Ministry's lessons in at least moodle resources with such an internal php reference.",

In your case I think you should apply \"trigrat\" to all expressions: the teacher's answer, and to the student's input. So, the argument sans should be trigrat(ans1), etc. Why don't we always do this? Because in some cases this is monstrously large. E.g. try trigrat(sin(x)^200); There are some situations where you need to use the context of your question to give the algebraic equivalence testing a helping hand. Chris",

          "Title": "Linking Moodle with a CAS",
          "Text": "Hi there, I've just joined Moodle very recently, ie today, and wanted to let this forum know of my plans to link Moodle with a computer algbra system.  There are at least two reasons for wanting to do this (1) To provide a CAS enabled chat space so that students and teachers can discuss mathematics in an active way with expressions being evaluated with a CAS system in the background, and plots being generated dynamically. (2) To extend assessments to include CAS. The basic idea is that a student provides their answer, this is subtracted from a teacher's answer and the CAS simplifies as far as possible.  A zero solution indicates the two are equivalent.  There is a lot more to this, but I'm leaving the details for later.  However, this is something the AiM community have been doing for 4 or 5 years, (see http://maths.york.ac.uk/moodle/aiminfo/ ) Of course, a lot more can be done including random questions worked solutions questions with non-unique answers which require properties from an answer.  This is something I'm very interested in, to try and generate some mathematical detabe http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/Publications/Emac03.pdf There are lots of technical details, which I'd be very happy to talk about in due course. I don't want this to be a long initial posting.  This is simply to open up discussion about using computer algebra through a VLE, to altert others to what I am doing, and to encourage people to join in. Some technical thinking so far: There are a number of CAS systems around. I want to make sure that Moodle can operate independent of which CAS is used, as far as is possible. Actually, for learning and teaching only a small subset of CAS commands are really useful.  The syntax for these is very similar amongst CAS systems.  The open source CAS maxima will certainly be one I'm including early on. I notice that Moodle already has an algebra filter that works via TeX.  Great, I've done exactly the same in my prototype code!  However, I filter through TtH to produce raw HTML, rather than using Perl.  This isn't perfect, but does avoid pictures. I'm not in a position to release any code yet,  although I've been working on a project to provide this link, and intend to release prototype code soon. The experience of the AiM community has been very good indeed, and I hope we can recreate that functionality within Moodle.  Please do comment. Does anyone else have similar plans?  Is this useful?

          "Text": "Hi All, Last Friday night, I had a slight case of insomnia and as I lay there, it suddenly occurred to me that there is now a fairly easy way to have students show all the steps in solving math problems and equations based on Justin Hunt's latest additions to PoodLL. So far, I've figured out three ways of having them show their work in a quiz. It is also possible for them to do an assignment activity that shows their work for class or homework assignments. And, it is also possible for a teacher to demonstrate a solution directly in Moodle and save it for students to review later or makeup a lesson on their own. If anyone is interested in a how-to, let me know. I am currently working on explanations and examples, but students are really keeping me busy this week, so it is going slowly.",

I believe this could be done fairly easily using R. Grothmann's \" Circle and Ruler \" (CaR) which is a program that allows students to construct geometric figures freely as they would with paper, pencil, and strait edge, and a compass. One of the features of CaR is the ability to build \"Assignments\" which display a \"Well Done\" message when the student has performed the construction correctly. I don't know much about Java (that is what CaR is written in) and PHP, but I'm fairly certain that the pop-up could be redirected so that it tells moodle whether the student succeeded or not. If anyone is interested in adding this feature, I'd be willing to help in my own meager way. You can contact me at bob@mbackus.com. Please see Burchell High School's web site for examples of how to create assignments using CaR .",

One can buy postscript versions of Trebuchet for about 50 pounds, but one would prefer not to have to. By 'changing the font', I mean what TexAide would call the Primary font, or what TexAide's advanced define styles dialogue (and the Microsoft Word equation editor) calls the fonts for: Text Function Variable Vector Matrix Number Our server is running a standard install of RedHat 4, with Moodle 1.7.1.

More precisely, students are supposed to determine a basis of a given vector space without knowing the dimension in advance.  Providing the exact amount of input boxes gives away the dimension. I am wondering whether there is a way to have a flexible number of input boxes for vectors. E.g students decide during runtime that they want another box for another vector ... or they specify the required amount of boxes initially. I was considering to provide the maximum possible number of boxes and just use the relevant ones for the evaluation ... but maybe there is better solution or a better workaround ?

There is no way to combine this level of detail with also having addition to be commutative, sorry.  The rules-based answer tests really do rely on associativity. If you would like to test for a `+` in front of a number you can switch off all simplification, and then look at `safe_op(ans1)`.  If a student types in `+3` then `safe_op(ans1)` will show the operator `\"+\"` (a Maxima string).  If a student types in just 3, then it will be `\"\"` (no operator).  So, you can test individual expressions for a plus sign.  I hope this helps.",

          "Text": "To start with, if you have the server capacity available, then you can experiment with goemaxima in quite a low-risk way by setting up a new install of that, while leaving your maximapool setup in place. Then, all you need to do to switch between them is to change the URL in the STACK setting in Moodle. So, you could do back-to-back performance comparisons, and you could initially use goemaxima at low-stakes times, but stay using maximapool at high stakes times, until you are sure it is right to permanently switch. The reasons I believe goemaxima is better (even though I am one of the two people who created maximapool 10 or more years ago) are: 1. goemaxima is implemented using more appropriate technologies for the task at hand. The wrapper around Maxima is written in Go, not Java + Tomcat, so it is a much more lightweight wrapper. Also it can use appropriate operating system mechanisms (fork) to rapidly spawn the required Maxima processes. This means that goemaxima is likely to be significantly faster / higher throughput on the same hardware. 2. The end result is packaged up as a Docker container, which is a very convenient way to build and deploy the required setup (once you have got your head around Docker!) You can take goemaxima's pre-build containers, but we chose to build our own with the particular version of STACK code, and Maxima that we want to use (built using their build files, just changing the configuration.) 3. That containerisation is good if you are deploying onto infrastructure like Kubernetes or AWS Farngate, which can give you automated scaling of the available resources as load changes.",

However as implied by the commit, I'm not really comfortable just downgrading the maxima version as that might be an unexpected breaking change for existing users (I could probably still be persuaded otherwise if other issues spring up).

It might be possible to use also a tiny javascript to change dropdown menus to other html elements and this way show images with other html elements to other browsers than FF but core moodle might need a new question type for that. So the best workaround today is to use other question types for questions having big mathematical expressions and to use html entities or unicode characters in such question types that use dropdown menus.",

The speed is the reason that it is often quickest to use asciimathml unless the equation is very complex, and in that case use dragmath and save in dragmath format or export and make the syntax available in the text expression format you otherwise use..... We have been experimenting with EqEd, an asciimath method of allowing you to insert equation primitives which is much faster but much more limited as well and the packages that Mauno has been working on for tinyMCE I think include that (and I have posted links to sites where you can see EqEd elsewhere in this forum.)",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We use STACK with goemaxima, with goemaxima running on a separate server . Now we would like to perform some load tests. For starters, we would like to bypass moodle and send API requests directly to the Maxima server. I know that the command line of the Maxima server can be used to execute a statement like `diff(sin(x^2),x);` . However, I would much rather send requests to Maxima from outside via cURL. Is that possible? Requests like the following are successful, but always return `(%i7)\\n(%i8)` , where \"\\n\" stands for a line break. As far as I know, this indicates that the request was successful, but activated Maxima in an interactive mode instead of returning the result of the computation. `curl -X POST “http://<our-goemaxima-ip>:8080/goemaxima?timeout=10000”` `\\` `-H “Content-Type: application/json”` `\\` `-d '{` `\"input\": \"diff(sin(x^2),x);\"` `}'` Can I adapt this example so that Maxima computes and returns the result for input instead? I would also be very happy about other approaches for simple load tests. The background to my question are planned tests in which 150 students (engineering sciences; first year of study) will work on a moodle quiz that consists largely of STACK-type questions.

That caches the command that was sent to Maxima, and the response that was recieved at the time. Running through a few thousand rows of the table makes a good load test. I remember thinking about scripging that. But, I don't think we ever did, because goemaxima was cearly faster than we had before (about 2x).",

While that may not seem bad at first, with 150 students, waiting time could become annoying. goemaxima can handle up to 32 parallel requests, and while our server only has two processor cores, we could use a larger server. I also know Maxima uses caching, and students sometimes receive identical questions. Given that, would you expect processing 166 comparable student responses to be significantly faster than running the 166-question test suite via the bulk test script?",

Bear in mind that to run a question test on one question, STACK first has to do the initial randomisation and generate the question; then grade ther response; then render any maths in the feedback. And, when a student is working on the question, that will be well spread out in time as they think, it won't all happen in a fraction of a second. You really need to build confidence in the system gradually. Don't go out and try to run a 200-student exam tomorrow, where everyone starts at the same second and submits at the same second when time expires. Instead, can you find something like a homework assignment, where students work in there own time, so the load is spread out. If you can do that, an have monitoring of the server CPU / Ram / disc IO / networking, then you will see where you are at in reality (including the effects of things like caching) and how much room you have to grow with your current hardware - but it looks like your current hardware is pretty capable.",

Eight parallel test suites took 175 seconds. 16 parallel test suites took 245 seconds. We then upgraded our server . A single test suite now takes 31 seconds while 16 parallel test suites take 125 seconds to finish. More importantly, goemaxima seems to handle parallel requests efficiently. Starting today, we have three weeks in which a few hundred students can work on test tasks whenever they want. Later, they will work on tests in smaller groups at the same time. Until then, we will keep an eye on the server's workload. I will post the final server configuration and a few sample questions here later and describe how the exams went.",

LaTeX is the oldest, probably the most used and most complete. It is easy to use because you can write the equation code directly without using any software. It is particularly suitable for mathematics and scientific texts. MathML is also an excellent language for formatting equations. Although in theory you can write the code for the equations directly, in practice this is nearly impossible. So you need software to write the code, but in fact this makes it easy to write equations. Perhaps the best known software is MathType, recently purchased by the Wiris company, and which is a paid product. You can find other editors that are free for example by visiting https://dynamiccourseware.org/course/view.php?id=36➚ . MathML is very well suited, for example, for engineering texts and other texts that do not need the look often used in mathematics, with fonts resembling Times New Roman. AsciiMath is a very simple language, but it still gives excellent results. UnicodeMath is a language created by Microsoft and can only be used with the Office 365 series of software. It is of no use for Moodle. 1) First of all is this format okay, in terms of compatibility and speed or do I need to use LaTeX format? Which one is recommended? What you have shown is in MathML language. It is perfectly okay in terms of compatibility and speed. You don't have to use the LaTeX language. You can use LaTeX or MathML, both are excellent. Be careful though because LaTeX users are often die-hard fanatics and they will try to convince you to use LaTeX at all costs. It's not necessary, you can use MathML and get just as good results in most cases. 2) Is there any other way or any other updated plugin to import maths equation? There may be other plugins, but the Microsoft Word File Import/Export plugin works just fine. See https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=430409#p1732244 for details. Note that this plugin takes equations created with Microsoft's equation editor and transforms them only to MathML in Moodle. 3) I have thousands of questions... What question type are they? Have they been prepared with a template, for example Moodle2Word, for importing into Moodle? Or are they in Aiken format or in GIFT format? Were the equations created with Microsoft's UnicodeMath equation editor, or for example using MathType? If the equations were created with the Microsoft equation editor, you can view them in LaTeX format. If you move the LaTeX code outside the equation editing box, they will import as LaTeX equations in Moodle. Once imported, you need only to add the delimiters \\​( \\​).",

I created questions in MS Word using Microsoft Equation editor and then converted them as per the template of Moodle2Word and imported them in Moodle using the plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/qformat_wordtable . The plugin developer Eoin helped me to solve the issue by using an additional equation delimiter '<math'. Eoin  explained that: \"Equations are displayed using MathJAX filter, which uses a combination of CSS (stylesheets) and JavaScript (programming language). When you are editing a question in the Atto or TinyMCE editor, they are also using a combination of CSS and JavaScript to present the content. To avoid clashes between the two different sets of JavaScript code (MathJAX and Atto/TinyMCE), the editor disables the MathJAX JavaScript. Therefore when previewing a question or doing a quiz, the equation is presented OK, but when in edit mode, it is not fully displayed.\"",

Here is Chris's summary of the improvements Added in the Question blocks Changes to validation of casstrings. We now allow syntax such as 3e2 to represent floating point numbers. The strict syntax settings still flag 3e2 as \"missing stars\". Improvements to catching common syntax errors with trig functions, e.g. sin^-1(x) or cos[x] Refactored the numerical tests. This means they are now standard Maxima tests, not using PHP. Allow the use of the Maxima orderless and ordergreat in cassessions.\nThis helps with display, without turning off simplification. Expanding CAStext features. Enable a function as an answer type, e.g. improve validation. Refactor answer test unit testing to distinguish \"test fail\" from \"zero\". Reject things like sin*(x) and sin^2(x) as invalid Provide a new option on how parentheses are displayed for matrices Provide an extra syntax checking option to enable stars to be inserted between single characters, e.g. xy -> x*y. Add the input parameter `allowwords` to enable the teacher to specify some permitted words of more than 2 symbols length. Reinstate the STACK 2 feature called \"Hints\". This has been done\nas a \"Fact sheet\" to avoid ambiguity with other Moodle features. See Fact sheet documentation. Better install (auto OS detection), healtcheck and testing. When using the Maxima Pool servlet, it is now possible to use any\ntype of HTTP authenication\n(e.g. basic or digest), and there is a separate configuration option, so\nthat you don't need to put the username and password in the URL Thanks to everyone who has contributed: Chris Sangwin (85 commits) Tim Hunt (36 commits) Mikael Kurula (5 commits) Matt Petro (1 commit) Jean-Michel Vedrine (1 commit) And everyone who sent us bug reports, suggestions or comments.",

In fact, doing some dynamics graphs with Stack and pstricks code is easy because Geogebra can export a file in pstricks. I only replace some caracters by CAS random variables in pstricks code generated by Geogebra. On the other hand, pstricks is well documented and it's possible to do such differents types of pictures.

In this case, solve return a *list* which is ordered.  If you don't want order you can turn the object into a set.  The following Maxima code might come in useful: \n```text\nl1:[x=-1,x=-3];\n\n\nl2:maplist(rhs,l1);\n\n\ns:setify(l2);\n```\n If you'd like to do this to the student's answer you can put commands which depend on the input name (e.g. ans1) into the *feedback variables* before you apply an answer test.

They expect expression for the 2nd and 3rd argument of the \"if\" command and it becomes difficult for the student to understand the syntax. Second idea: a sequence of logical expressions: (m>0 and x<=-3/m) or (m<0 and x>=-3/m) but this expression doesn't show if the student considered the case m=0. Third idea: handle dynamic input answers, so that for each new case on m, the student add two input boxes and enter the value of m in the fist box and a sequence of logical expression (x>-3/m) in the second box the define the interval. But I don't know if these \"dynamics\" boxes is possible. One could say that we expect the student to deal with a fix number of boxes but he would know the number of case and I would like to avoid it.",

I should say that the difficulties you are having are due to Maxima using the LISP boolean operators which do not respect \"simp:false\".  This is a pain. A minimal example in Maxima \n```text\nsimp:false;\np:true and false;\n```\n I'd expect this to keep p as \"true and false\", but it always simplifies to false.  Anyway, I do have ways of fixing this, so STACK can certainly assess this kind of thing.   If we correspond, I'll also improve the docs using your examples (with your permission ).

In the past I've started from the educational and CAS aspects of the problem and used these to inform the development of STACK.  The above paper is an example for single variable inequalities.   This is something similar for scientific units:  doi:10.1088/1361-6404/aa5e9d We probably need something similar for multi-variable inequality problems as well.  This isn't going to make version 4.2 this summer.  Sorry.

My understanding is as follows (from best to least desirable): MathJax - clients require JavaScript capability TeX notation ( SVG ) - introduced with Moodle 2.8 TeX notation (PNG) - sharper output TeX notation (GIF) - grainy output, but most widespread support I realize this situation is continually evolving but most clients (browsers / devices) should now support SVG graphics and JavaScript, no? Please share your experiences here (e.g. we have several tablet device X with software version Y which does not work with MathJax or SVG graphics so we are using Z math filters configuration).",

          "Text": "Hello Greg, If I understand the question, you are asking what the optimal server configuration for the best or widest client access and best TeX display in 2.8 would be.  I would suggest installing and configuring all binaries in the TeX filter (both Imagemagick and dvisvgm) and setting image type to SVG. I would also enable or make availble the MathJaxloader filter. Moodle will sniff the browser version to see whether it will support SVG, and the TeX filter will use PNG images if it does not.  You do not have the worry about whether a client supports SVG or PNG.  Likewise if you enable both filters on a page, the TeX filter will display if javascript is disabled, and MathJax will display if images are not appropriate. The only potential down side to having Tex filter enabled is that all mathematics is displayed inline style instead of in display style. Teachers can of course disable the TeX filter in an activity if they want to use display style with MathJax, or alternate delimiters can be set to allow this in the configuration settings. The advantages for using the TeX, are loading speed on the client, the ability for extra latex packages not supported by MathJax, and backup if javascript is unavailble. MathJax is great in most or probably 99% of cases, but you might want to also have the TeX filter enabled if you are the type that is not satisfied with two nines for your availability.",

Oh yes I should mention FYI for others that at least for Ubuntu Server 14.04, all the dependencies for the TeX filter (at least as I recall) seem to be met by installing the texlive and imagemagick packages.",

As a science teacher, I also find the mhchem extension, enabled in both MathJax and TeX filters, to be useful, with or without the Atto Chemistry Editor plugin .

When creating a quiz, first create one question category for each kind of numerical question you want to ask. In each category create multiple variants of that type of question. You may do this by creating one question copying it and editing the numerical values in it. Then when editing the quiz click add a random question and select the category. When a student attempts the quiz, Moodle will select one of the varients at random so each attempt appears to have different questions. SLACK, formula, and calculated question types each do something like this automatically for you. However, it is easier to understand if you try it manually first. SLACK and formula questions are especially helpful for upper grades where you need students to enter algebraic responses instead of numbers and check whether they satisfy several different conditions.",

This is open source project lets you create write questions (or browse/edit from a large public question bank) - you then download an exam package as a SCORM object activity that you can put into Moodle for students to attempt. Here is a quick comparison compared of NUMBAS to the other built-in Moodle maths Quiz questions and STACK question type. This is off the top of my head (sorry it's not well ordered and it's just an opinion and not definitive/comprehensive by any means (especially subjective comments I've indicated with an asterisk *)! Feature Moodle Quiz Activity - maths question types STACK question type NUMBAS Support error carried forward marking (incorrect previous answer can be used later for credit) No Yes Yes Support for units Yes (although a little clunky*) Yes Yes Support for algebraic expressions No (string matching only) Yes Yes Support for randomised question variables Yes (creates multiple copies of a question). Question variants appear in the same order in the Quiz and can't be shuffled (as each question variant need to be organised into a category). Yes Yes Support for adding worked solution feedback with the random question variables No (although this could be added programmatically via GIFT import) Yes Yes Reporting Yes Yes Limited (SCORM reports are unpleasant to read) Regrading Yes Yes No (actually, this is possible if you host questions on server and link via LTI , but not via the simple SCORM activity route) Writing questions* Easiest* Hardest (uses maxima syntax) Public question banks are available (e.g. Domain )* Tricky* (uses JME syntax) Questions are written on numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk (need to create a free account) - where you can browse other peoples' questions Writing custom feedback based on student response Limited Yes Yes, but somewhat tricky at the moment*!",

          "Text": "Stephen, This is a good question. The units system in STACK is very simple.  The comparisons work by converting back to the base scientific units.  Other functions, allowing you to manipulate units are very simple.  At the moment we don't distribute \"/\" over \"stackunits\".  The function \"stackunits\" is an ephemeral form, just representing units.  In particular you might expect the result of \n```text\nR:stackunits(12,ohm);\n\n\nU:stackunits(12,V);\n\n\nta:U/R;\n```\n to be \n```text\nstackunits(1,V/ohm)\n```\n At this point is isn't! However, if you have \n```text\nta:stack_unit_si_to_si_base(stackunits(1,V/ohm));\n```\n then this is simplified to \"A\". I think a \"general units simplifier\" would be a useful addition to the functionality.  You can see the current code here: https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/stackunits.mac If anyone would like to work on this aspect of the units, I'd be delighted to receive some improved code. My advice at the moment Stephen is to use \"stackunits\" at the very last step, just before you show the expression to students. Chris",

AsciiMathML is using javascript to produce either MathML for browsers that support MathML or image fallback for those browsers that do not support MathML - if you have a script that has image fallback and if that script has correct renderer path for those images - for example some public mimetex server . You should not use AsciiMathML as filter - the old files had some conflicts with other code - the better way is to add to your theme meta.php for example tags like <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"<?php echo $CFG->httpswwwroot ?>/lib/editor/common/AsciiMathML.js\"></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var AMTcgiloc = \" http://someserver/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi \"; </script> supposing you have a script called AsciiMathML.js (name can be different) in folder lib/editor/common/AsciiMathML.js and http://someserver/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi is used to render image fallback.",

It would be very neat if every GIF created by the filter was also a javascript link, which would pop up a window showing the TeX code. This could then be copied-and-pasted back out as required. OK: My example is here: www.ucl.ac.uk/is/fiso/lifesciences/test/texpopup.htm . You'll see that when you click on the image you get a javascript popup of the type that can be copied-and-pasted.",

If you go to your test page and follow the link at the bottom to the SECOND test page, you'll see that the image fall-back mode is not working. It appears that some of the files in your jsMath/fonts directory are empty and others are missing. So perhaps your file corruption problems are more widespread than you thought. Perhaps it would be worth reinstalling jsMath and its fonts. While it may well be true that Gloabl.js was corrupted, I don't see how this could have been the problem as global mode is disabled in the Moodle filter, and this file will never be used. Perhaps one or more of the other files were also corrupt and you replaced them? Anyway, if you try to use the image fallback mode, you'll see that you still have more files that need fixing. Davide",

You can always use the jsMath control panel (available from the small jsMath button that appears on any page with math on it) to check to see if there is an updated version of jsMath, so I haven't been taking up space here with such announcements. I did think that you might like to know, however, that the lastest release of jsMath has a new extension that implements most of the amsmath AMS-LaTeX package, including the align, split, gather, and multline environments, and a significant number of macros and other environments as well. (See the jsMath documentation web site for more details.) A number of the amsmath features will trigger the AMSmath extension to be loaded automatically, but you can also add it to the loadFiles array in the jsmath/ javascript .php file in the moodle/filter directory on your server . If you add \"extensions/AMSmath.js\" (including the quotes) to the loadFiles array, that will make the AMSmath extensions available on all pages. You might also consider adding \"extensions/AMSsymbols.js\" if you have installed the msam10 and msbm10 fonts on your server. See the author's documentation for the extensions for additional details. Download the lastest version from the jsMath plugin page . Davide",

So, I would suggest you start looking at desktop Maxima first.  STACK modifies base Maxima quite extensively, and it might be better to hook into some of those modifications.  E.g. we already have parallel Boolean operators ( https://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Topics/Propositional_Logic/#boolean-functions ) It would be possible to do something like this already. `simp:false;` `p1:8*false;` `p2:subst(0,false,p1);` `p3:ev(p2,simp);` So, no doubt you could selectively evaluate the predicate 3<2 as well. Happy to help if you need me to.  It's a useful extension. Chris",

I would first change your path for the first two binaries to /usr/bin and see if Moodle finds them. You may also want to actually ask your host where latex and dvips are located as your host may have a different location for such binaries or the binaries may not be installed. If you have shell access and your host does not have dvips and latex in an open /bin you can likely create your own ~/bin, install appropriate tex binaries and then point your moodle to them.

You might like to have a look at it. There are various schemes to integrate it with moodle, (e.g. moodle bridge ) some of them are waiting on the RQP module settling down, but it will happen eventually. Anecdotal data shows convincingly that homework with immediate feedback has the effect of having students spend more time at their homework and having them asked more focused questions. Statistically backed conclusions are being written up and should be published soon. -- Mike",

Before I dive in, is it possible to have some idea on what kind of computing power I would need to host 10 simultaneous users using STACK quizzes? I am wondering if it would be better for me to send a self-hosted (with LAMP +Maxima+moodle) Ubuntu virtual machines to students and transmit only their grades to online Moodle.  That way, it will be near infinitely scalable.",

Is there a way to tell STACK to accept both (for example) E0 and E_0 as the *same* character, thus avoiding making a terribly complicated potential response tree that will handle all the possible combinations of underscore / no underscore?

In our testing environment Tex and Algebra filters work great.  On our production environment it does not.  I cannot figure out the problem.  Both systems are running in the same VM version of the VM environment, same kernel, same distro, same Moodle version, etc. Permissions are correct, the file has the right file size, and it is set to executable. I can open the file and read it, but when I execute from the CLI I get \"File not found.\"  It's strange.  I finally got Tex working by installing ImageMagick, Latex, and TexLive.  However, the Algebra filter seems to still want to use the mimetex.linux file.  This is where the problem lies.  Is there a way to tell Algebra filter to use the Latex/ImageMagick combo instead of mimetex.linux?",

          "Text": "Thomas, Yes, this is very annoying.  I consider it a bug in STACK, but the truth is that the bug is caused by a subtle interaction between STACK, the editor, the MathJax filter and other clean up code in Moodle. Imagine we have the following question text \n```text\n\n```\n <p>Find vectors so that \\( v = \\lambda_1 \\) input:ans1 \\(+\\lambda_2 \\) input:ans2 </p> <p> validation:ans1 validation:ans2 </p> In the various transformations between the teacher and the students the \"inputs\" get replaced by tables, and the maths text gets processed by the mathjax filter.  This leads to spans with class \"filter_mathjaxloader_equation\" containing an opening paragraph <p>, but with the span closing before the table for the input.   We get something like this \n```text\n<span class=\"filter_mathjaxloader_equation\"><p>Find vectors so that \n\\( v = \\lambda_1 \\)\n </span><table class=\"matrixtable\"> ....\n```\n Then later in Moodle, the closing </p> is inserted by some later Moodle cleaning up code.  All very helpful, but it breaks the display! One way to avoid (workaround) the problem is to switch off the TinyMCE editor: go to ' Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Manage editors ' Then don't use paragraph (`<p>`) tags in your question text. This is all very well until someone comes along and edits the question later and the editor puts back in paragraph tags for you.... I would very much appreciate some help here from people with more knowledge of Moodle about how STACK can adapt to stop this bug.  Any suggestions?  Sorry I don't know more about the text editors and filters in Moodle to know exactly what to do here. [B****Y editor keeps changing my pre tags when I try to post an accurate description of this problem!]",

This currently is made out of two parts: 1) I would like to set the default questions behavior to alow floating point numbers. 2) I would like to alow students to use complicated expressions in thier answers. The reason for this is mainly that I use my home-made units-testing answers, so I need my students to be able to type in the units, some of which are three letters (or even 4 letters) long. I know I can alow them specific words in each question, but this just wouldent do, as it requiers a long list of allowed words to be copied to each question and there are to many chanses for errors. So I would like to do one of two things - either have some global list of alowed words that can be used in all of the questions on my moodle environament, or to just allow students to type in any three letter long expression. What can I do? Thanks",

First to set the recored straight - I am already using STACK in my course.  Also, we already discussed the Units Issue in: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=253359#p1101207 I am currently using units in my questions, and I built some functions to support  units analysis which includes: 1) The ability to transform all units to one specific units system, to compare answers (such as in your example above for the m/s to Km/h). 2) the ability to compare the units of the students answer with the correct one. 3) the ability to choose the list of equivalent units. 4) adding constants which have units, for student usage. 5) checking that an equation or expression have equivalent units (that is m+s =s is not allowed). Other features I would like to have: 6) The ability to enter three and four letters \"units\" - this is very important to me, and if there is a way to do it with the current version of stack, I would like to know how. 7) One global units transitions map that will be maintained in one place, and can be excessed from every question. 8) The ability to check the arguments of exponents and trigonometric functions have no units. --> I have not  build the ability to differentiate between (m/s) and (Km/h) as I see no scenario in which I would like to correct a student for working in his own chosen units system - and if he \"mashes\" together to unit systems, it will reflect itself in the final answer.

See https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/CAS/STACK-Maxima_sandbox.md Most of the Answer tests start with AT.....  For example ATAlgEquiv(sa,ta). ATCASEqual(2,2); The syntax for tests with an option is ATInt(x^3/3+c,[x^3/3,x]) i.e. you need to tell STACK the teacher's answer and variable. They are defined in https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/assessment.mac https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/stackmaxima.mac (At one time I thought it would be useful to separate out the API from the \"assessment package\" but ran out of emotional steam). To see what the functions return, see lines 389 onwards of https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/stack/maxima/stackmaxima.mac The cryptic feedback strings are defined in the language file, e.g. https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/lang/en/qtype_stack.php Lastly, the *whole point* of these functions is to avoid (as far as possible) writing things like \"if sa=ta then mark:1 else mark:0\" and replace such things with tests for specific properties.

          "Text": "I have been struggling for sometime trying to get STACK to run on a Ubuntu Server therefore I decided to start from a clean system and have re-installed Moodle and STACK but before proceeding any further I wanted to check what I was doing was heading in the correct direction. The version of Ubuntu that I am using is 14.04 and I have installed Moodle 2.9+ ( everything is working at the Moodle level - big thanks to the people behind the documentation ). I have installed STACK using the Installation Instructions and the plugins installed without any problems. Currently I have Maxima 5.32.1 running on the server which was installed using \"apt-get install maxima\".  Maxima is working and I have generated and displayed plots ( gnuplot version 4.6 patchlevel 4 is installed ) outside of STACK . My questions are as follows: 1 ) In the documentation it mentions that Maxima 5.25.1 to 5.31.3 are supported - do I need to install one of those version ? or will STACK run with 5.32.1 ? 2 ) Running the STACK healthcheck amongst the errors I get: \"loadfile: failed to load /usr/share/maxima/5.32.1/share/draw/draw.lisp\". I have loaded the file at the command line without any problems. Also, I have successfully loaded the files suggested in the STACK-Maxima, at the command line, and tested some of the STACK functions. Is it a file permissions problem that I am having ? - if so - any suggestions on how I can resolve. Grateful for any help. David",

So, the very latest code is aways there, but it is being changed, and we may accidentally break stuff from time to time. Then, every so often, when we are fairly sure that nothing is broken, we take the latest version on github, call it a release, and put that snapshot into the plugins database. So if you install from github, you have the very latest code, but there is a small risk. If you install from the plugins database, it is safer, but you may be a bit behind the latest developments. As it happens, I found something broken yesterday, so I am glad I did not do a release last week. I will try to fix it today, then do the release.",

I am asking since I ran into the same problems you did - apparently running a similar setup (Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS) and thus relying on the same maxima-version which was installed by apt-get. Could you confirm that the error was caused by a file permission problem? @Tim Hunt: I installed stack via git (I followed the installation instructions posted on https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md and chose the 'clone from git'-option). Maxima itself is up and running and I am seeing the same output as David did: \n```text\nloadfile: failed to load /usr/share/maxima/5.32.1/share/draw/draw.lisp\n```\n I tested a clean install of moodle and put the moodledata-directory below the /var/www - folder (not recommended, I know) as well as outside the /var/www-folder. File permissions on maximalocal.mac are set for www-data/www-data and ugo=rw-. I would be glad if you, David and Tim, or someone else could provide me with further ideas to get stack to connect to maxima. Thank you in advance for your help!",

The permissions on the draw.lisp-file were (in a last, desperate try) set to 777 for www-data - but without any effect. SELinux is not active on my server. But while following your instructions and testing some of the topics from the sandbox-page, I observed the following: 1. When I start maxima as www-data (sudo -u www-data maxima), some process or function tries to access the /root-folder (as can be seen from the following snippet: \n```text\nMaxima 5.32.1 \nhttp://maxima.sourceforge.net\n\n\nusing Lisp GNU Common Lisp (GCL) GCL 2.6.10 (a.k.a. GCL)\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n(%i1) load(\"/var/www/moodledata/stack/maximalocal.mac\");\n\n\n/bin/mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/root’: Permission denied                     <---- Here!\n\n\nCompiling /usr/share/maxima/5.32.1/share/draw/grcommon.lisp.\n\n\nloadfile: failed to load /usr/share/maxima/5.32.1/share/draw/draw.lisp\n\n\n -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);\n\n\n(%i1)\n```\n 2. When run as root (for the first time), loading the maximalocal.mac causes the compilation of several files (gnuplo.o, gnuplot.data, picture.o, pictrue.data and several more) in /root/.maxima/binary/binary-gcl/share/draw 3. When run as root after the initial compilation, those files are loaded / imported when loading the maximalocal.mac-file: \n```text\nMaxima 5.32.1 \nhttp://maxima.sourceforge.net\n\n\nusing Lisp GNU Common Lisp (GCL) GCL 2.6.10 (a.k.a.

I think that the following steps happen when maxima is run with www-data rights a) Check, whether the compiled files exist and are accessible b) If not, create /root/.maxima/binary/binary-gcl/share/draw and compile those files into that folder. Do you have any thoughts about this? Thank you in advance again for your support Adrian",

You need optimised version of maxima bundle created using documentation , then it works smooth and there are no errors in health-check. Step-by step guide for you, courtesy of Lancaster University CIS: 1. In Moodle STACK configuration set \"Platform type\" to \"Linux\" (not optimised) and \"Maxima command\" to empty value. Run the health-check script. It may contain errors which could be ignored, scroll to \"Debug info\" > \" Context use\", it should contain something similar to: \n```text\nPlatform: unix-optimised\nMaxima shell command: maxima\nMaxima initial command: load(\"/srv/data/moodle/stack/maximalocal.mac\");\n\n\nMaxima timeout: 10\n```\n The Maxima initial command above is the one we need to produce optimised version. 2. Login to one of the web-servers, become root. Check what maxima version we have and what the LISP implementation is in use: \n```text\nroot@moodle:~# maxima --list-avail\nAvailable versions:\nversion 5.34.1, lisp gcl\n```\n gcl is the default implementation in Debian, and we will use it. Thus, the portion of maxima optimising documentation we need is GCL . 3.

Now it is time to reconfigure Moodle. In Moodle STACK configuration set \"Platform type\" to \" Linux (optimised) \". Set \"Maxima command\" to: \n```text\ntimeout --kill-after=10s 10s /srv/data/moodle/stack/maxima-optimised -eval '(cl-user::run)'\n```\n The above format will make sure that command is never run for more than 10 seconds, thus will not cause performance issues. Save the configuration. Now run the health-check script, scroll down and press \"Clear the cache\". The loaded health check result should contain no errors. If you see some broken formula images, but health-check does not report errors, this has nothing to do with maxima or STACK, check TeX Notation filter settings, you most likely do not have texlive package installed on your system.

          "Text": "Dear all, I am reaching out with an issue I have been unable to resolve on my own, the problem I believe boils down to an issue with JSXgraph and encodings. In its simplest form I created short answer question (I started with a formula type question but the problem applies to question types provided by the default Moodle installation). As advised on JSXgraph page using Plain Text Editor with HTML format I created three tags: <p></p> <p></p> <jsxgraph></jsxgraph> as the question text (the rest is not important). The first tag contains (three) letters from the English alphabet, the second contains a single letter from either the Cyrillic or Turkish alphabet, the last one is a copy paste from the jsxgraph examples where a simple board is created. When I preview the question I obtain the following error Exception - DOMDocument::loadHTML(): Argument #1 ($source) must not be empty when I remove the second paragraph (containing non-english symbols) the question renders the expected jsxgraph board. If from the administrator interface I change the JSXgraph plugin (Coding between tags->convert encoding) to \"No\" and bring back the Cyrillic paragraph, the page renders the correct JSXgraph but the Cyrillic texts is not properly displayed, similar to the errors described in the following post https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=241878 I cannot apply the solution described in the above post ( it is from 2013 and jsxgraph/filter.php does not contain such line). I am using Moodle 4.5.3+ Build 20250321 and JSXgraph v1.10.1 - additions (2025-02-26) This ticket https://github.com/jsxgraph/moodle-filter_jsxgraph/issues/48 appears to be a related issue but the solution there did not apply as well. The following post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77370472/domdocumentloadhtml-source-must-not-be-empty-error-when-inputting-result-fro leads me to believe the issue is somewhere on how information is passed to and from the jsxgraph filter. On the server I have multiple formula-type questions that are either in Turkish or Bulgarian and for those questions everything renders as expected. I see this issue only when including a JSXgraph tag, hence I do not believe it is an issue with how the operating system is set. If it helps: for some of my formula type questions I experienced a correct behavior when the jsxgraph tag is the last tag in the question text (correct rendering of Cyrillic and graph). Should there be any tags after the graph I receive the above error. I will appreciate any assistance!",

You will need to set the configuration of the jsMath filter so that it will use characters other than the ones used by algebra filter to indicate the start and stop mathematics. By default, jsMath uses \\(...\\) or <tex>...</tex> to indicate in-line mathematics and \\[...\\] or $$..$$ to indicate display mathematics. If the algebra filter uses these, you can set them to something else in the jsmath/ javascript .php file and jsmath/filter.php files.

Do I simply need to install the moodle text filter plugin for JSXGraph ( https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_jsxgraph ) or is there anything more to it than that? I note that the STACK syntax to link to a JSXGraph board is to use square bracket syntax jsxgraph (traditional moodle filter syntax I think), but the moodle JSXGraph plugin documentation says to use an angle bracket syntax <jsxgraph width=\"600\" height=\"500\">.  This different has led to me asking this question over the installation method.

On Mark's server , Apache /PHP exports its value of $QUERY_STRING (typically something like \"id=x&....\") to subprocesses launched by php scripts. The fix clears $QUERY_STRING before launching mimetex.cgi.

I use Moodle 4.2. 3- Could anyone post a couple of examples of using rand()? 4- I tried several times and several formats and it always gives a syntax error. 5- In my opinion, z=rand(1,3); should return an integer between 1 and 3, that is: 1, 2 or 3.

Some of our students told us, that the rendering of the formulas in quizzes takes some time (eg up to 20 seconds). Other students had no problems. I'm not shure why rendering is slow. Could it be that browsers on client side (eg version, browser setting, plugins, ...) can delay the rendering? Or will rendering be done only on the server ? Is there any possibility to make rendering faster? Eg install MathJax-Library localy on the server? Changing MathJax configuration in the filter settings?

Is there currently a way to do this or is the numeric question type limited to accepting a number (in this case 13.3)? I would be curious how other math teachers handle this issue. Would it be better to use the short answer type and accept 40/3 as a text value and 13.3 as a text value? I am also curious as to how math teachers handle answers that students need to put in either algebraic or tex format. Do most Math Moodlers simply avoid having the student input answers that are complicated and go with multiple choice? Any thoughts/advice that I can share with a Moodle-enthusiastic, Geometry teacher would be appreciated.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, I have emailed our Moodle tech guy at our university, but he does not know the answer unfortunately. Perhaps someone in these forums can help. I'm having trouble getting TeX to work properly in Moodle. I have read the documentation, and sometimes it works properly, but there are certain things that don't. I have a feeling I know why (some notation requires other LaTeX packages that don't seem to be part of the Moodle implementation of LaTeX) so I would like to know if there's a way to get these working. For example: 1. If I type $$ \\int_a^b f(x) dx $$ THIS WORKS.  But, 2. If I type $$ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} $$ , THIS does NOT work. The second command works on a local implementation of LaTeX on my computer but, of course, only after adding \"\\usepackage{amsmath}\" at the top of the .tex file. I tried adding this command in between the $$ $$ directly into the Moodle editor, but still no luck (didn't figure it would work but it was worth a try). I have attached a pdf file outlining what these are supposed to look like on Moodle (though, I'm sure you know already). Again, the first one works, but the second one (and hence, anything else that requires that or any other package) does not. This is severely limiting what you can do with LaTeX on Moodle. I have also tried the Java math editor, but that doesn't produce the desired results either. Please note I have gone into my settings and ensured that the TeX filter is ON. There is NO filter for MathJax available on our implementation and I don't think they are going to allow it so I'm looking for an alternate solution if possible (preferrably, one that does not involve uploading images, but I will do that if there's no other way!) Any help would be greatly appreciated... thanks.",

The new question type is powered by the STACK assessment system which in turn uses the Maxima computer algebra system. Luckily you will not have to install any of this software in order to use the new question type because it consumes these as web services that can be running anywhere on the web and for now we are providing web services for this.

          "Text": "This is the first time I try STACK on Moodle 4, and I run into an obscure error which seems to be unknown by google. In a simple minimal example, just defining a function `f: x^2+x*y` and rendering this in the question as `{@f@}`, gives the following error. ``` This question generated an unexpected internal error. Please seek advice, e.g. from a teacher. Too many arguments supplied to ct2_latex(%_val,%_mode); found: [x*y+x^2,\"i\",_ct2_simp] The field \"\"Question text\"\" generated the following error: Too many arguments supplied to ct2_latex(%_val,%_mode); found: [x*y+x^2,\"i\",_ct2_simp] The field \"\"Question variables\"\" generated the following error: Too many arguments supplied to ct2_latex(%_val,%_mode); found: [x*y+x^2,\"i\",_ct2_simp] ``` This was using installations from github, MOODLE_400_STABLE for moodle and v4.4.2 for STACK, for the three question behaviours I simply used the master branch.  I have had the same error with different variations under Moodle 4.1 as well.  I see that the definition and usage of ct2_latex has changed between versions, but I have not read the code and have no clue what is really happening. Maxima is version 5.44.0, using the goemaxima docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/mathinstitut/goemaxima PHP is version 8.0, but I don't suppose that makes a difference I suppose I must have found a bad combination of versions, but what would be the right combination?  Does anyone have any ideas?",

Just to note, following the STACK conference in April we made it much harder to leave a system in this state after an upgrade, so this kind of problem should become apparent much quicker in future.  I.e. at upgrade time.
