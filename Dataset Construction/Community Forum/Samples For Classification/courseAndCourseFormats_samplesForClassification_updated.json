I have to include \"Degree Programs\" & then \"Semesters\" in every Degree Program whereas moodle just have courses & categories. I tried my best in searching a similar discussion but didn't found any suitable discussion in this regard. I'm sure that there will be any plugin etc used for adding degree programs & semester format in moodle as most of the universities of the world using moodle also have similar format. Any guidance/help in this regard please?",

So one suggestion would be to have your degree programs as a top level category, semesters as a sub-category in each one and then the courses themselves inside the semesters. It doesn't need a plugin, just organise your categories and courses the way you want them (I find a paper and pencil exercise or card decks a good place to start.)",

Will the start/end date change dynamically at any time? -          Moodle doesn’t have an end date, because it’s not possible to set one? Or because it depends on the semester end date?

Line 274 of /course/editsection_form.php creates the conditions to restrict this. Does anyone know of customizations that allow for using the same profile field more than once in the \"restrict access\" conditions?

I am trying to use Restore to load a course into a production build of Moodle. I was able to load the course (after changing some permissions in the directories). I logged in this morning, and my course was replaced by a brand new course. All of my activities , blocks and everything were gone. So I restored the course again, logged out and back in, and the same thing happened. My course disappeared. I am totally clueless on what to try next. Can I create a new course with the course backup? Since it seems tied to my account somehow, does it have to do with admin permissions somehow? The development version of Moodle 2.6.2.

This hack uses the standard jquery styles and libraries but you can create your own if you know how (mine does need some work;P). It really helps if you have many courses with sub courses, slows down the scroll to death on the full course list. Demo: http://prettyjaded.co.uk/moodle/course/ I have basically replaced the full course list table with div tags to implement(lines 1813-1890ish!) All you have to do is first backup your course/lib.php file (you know what will happen if you don't!) and replace your course/lib.php file with the one I have included. You will also need to add the following code to your theme header: <link type=\"text/ css \" href=\"http://jqueryui.com/latest/themes/base/ui.all.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />",

Fixed \"When in 'Show one section per page' mode and the column orientation is set to 'Horizontal' the sections on the main page do not fill their correct width. This is due to the use of the 'section_summary()' method which needs to be changed within the format to set the calculated width on the 'li' tag.\" because the core fix I submitted on MDL-39099 has now been integrated. Thus requiring version 2012120303.11 2.4.3+ (Build: 20130502). 2. Moved 'float: left' to styles. css for Henrik Thorn - CONTRIB-4198 . 3. Realised that Tablets have more space, so allow two columns even when two or more are set. 4. Moved all 'cnconfig.php' default functionalty to 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Columns' so that defaults can be changed by the administrator from within Moodle without resorting to code changes. 5. Added capability 'format/columns:changecolumns' to editing teachers and managers such that site administrators can choose to disable functionality through roles if they wish. In order for this to work the version number must be updated. 6. Added automatic 'Purge all caches' when upgrading. If this appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches' under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'. Cheers, Gareth",

This particular course will have existing and new students enrolled, into a COHORT and then self-enrolled to the course. Other than manually backing up/restore without student grades is there any way for the course to be reset so that the grades remain, but the students may take the same instance of the course each year fresh? Is there a way to auto backup and restore a course using Moodle? I have read the issue ( MDL-35335 ) https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-35335 on Moodle Tracker which is currently being developed, however any further information on how i may do this would be fantastic.

How do I set this up? Am I required to create all of the individual courses first? Do I then set the one I want as parent as the meta course, or do I set each of the children as the meta course? Does enrollment take care of its self?  I.e. once the student is enrolled on the parent the child courses auto appear in the users course list?",

This would be used, for example, when getting students from different sections (example PSYCHOLOGY 101 Sections 1 to 20) into a departmental site (PSYCHOLOGY Department site); OR 2. In scenario two of your link, create one individual course (not metacourse), then create multiple metacourses. This would be used, for example, when all five courses are intended to have exactly the same students. In both cases, you can see students being enrolled normally into standard courses and then the entire student list of a course being added to the Metacourse. The individual course/s must be created FIRST, as the course name is what you would use in the metacourse to enroll the users.",

That is why i want to make a course format plugin. My questions are the next. How i can via the course format the appearance of the incourse (mods) redesign? Can i load the incourse  with ajax without going to the the page of the mod? in joomla they have a paramter that load only the content of the page. \n```text\nindex.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1\n&tmpl=component\n```\n have also moodle something like that?

The Topics course format now has the functionality we wanted when we installed Collapsed Topics. When just disabling CT, the courses using the format still used I. So, following directions found regarding this we decided to uninstall it completely, since Topics is the default course format for courses to use. It worked well in our test server ; courses using CT \"fell back\" to Topics instead. But, when uninstalling Collapse Topics from our production server we also noted that all courses having used Collapsed Topics got hidden from students. There was around 7000 of them, and we didn't at first know which courses that was supposed to be hidden or open. We could get that information from the backup, and that problem was solved that same day. But we are now a week after the change still struggling to get all our integrations that also was affected by this correct. I don't know if courses getting hidden is expected behaviour when uninstalling the course format they use, but that happened to us so I wanted to share that information.",

For my university I want to develop a plugin for moodle that should provide a kind of quiz/game that is globally available for all students. Ideally the quizzes can be grouped in \"rooms\" (kind of courses) and will then be linked by the courses (one-to-many) Is it possible/designated to copy/extend some of the course logic like enrolments et cetera and make a new navigation point where these courses are listed? This may be useful for the \"room\"-logic of my plugin. Also, I have looked through the plugin types list ( http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugins ) and am now wondering if it is even possible to provide global content for students outside courses?

It is currently in 'beta' and therefore should not yet be used on a 'live' system. I have tested under Moodle 1.9.5. The code currently contains quite a bit of commented test code which I will remove when beta testing is complete and I am then able to integrate into the main CVS repository for contributed code. I would be grateful of any feedback you can give. Full installation / upgrade instructions are in the included 'readme.txt'. Please note that this is the only place at the moment where you will be able to acquire this version. Cheers,",

And for \"Child course 1 & 3\"  we set \"Parent Course 2\". Now when someone is enrolled in a parent course they are automatically enrolled in the child course. This works great for setting up a \"Parent Course 2\" that also uses \"Child course 1\". It makes it easy so we dont have to duplicate any of that material. So that is the overview. Now what I would like to achieve is: When \"Parent Course 1 or 2\" is clicked on under my courses in the sidebar taking us to the landing page - show me the child courses as it would if I set topics and quizzes for those topics. Is this possible? I have done hours of searching before posting here and come up empty. Any help or advice for how to attack the issue is extremely appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

Right now, we receive an email everytime a course is requested like : \"The user XXX XXX requested a new course on https://mymoodle.fr/course/pending.php \" I would like to add a note, which specify the School, as we manage only the course from our school. Is there an easy way to that ? Like, adding a checkbox when creating a course with all the schools, and having in the email title someting like \"[SCHOOL] Request for course creation\" ? Or adding a fiels in the profile, where people can declare their school and it is added to the email we receive ? Thanks !",

Instead, the user must click \"Exit Course\" in the upper right to be redirected to the main course page. Additionally, after completing quizzes, the user is redirected to the main course page. What I'd like is for all activities to have the navigation link to the next activity in the lower right. I don't want to disrupt the flow of training by redirecting the user to the main course page.

Therefore I've created https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjb2048/moodle-format_grid/c058a98b067e012cbd39a121c8ea48951db6dc37/db/upgrade.php which is a direct replacement for the version in V4.0.1.0 to cope when there is an error the first time you perform the upgrade, and subsequently needing to update again. Because the format version has not changed, i.e. updated, then the update element will execute again, detect that you already have a 'format_grid_image' table, delete and recreate it, then cope with what might of happened. I've only tested this 'once' and only where I manipulated the data in the database to mimic what I was told. Therefore, as usual, I cannot stress enough that you need to test first on a test server that is a direct replicant of your production server to ensure that everything should be fine when you update on production and always have a backup or more!  Note: The 'format_grid_icon' must still be there for the second run to operate as it should.",

I suppose I should keep my eye on Moodle for any notices people post about how their testing of the new version of the Grid format it working. Regards, Gary",

I've even included the \"lang\" folder from the version that was made for 1.8, as it was missing from the newest plugin for 1.9.*  A custom theme is not an issue at this point because I have not changed the default Moodle theme to a custom theme, so that is not the problem. I'm using Moodle 1.9.3. Then I tried two things: 1. Using an existing course, set the course format to the \"Page\" format successfully, and created a page. The course menu works fine, but the tabs don't work (probably because I can't change the theme. It would not allow access to the course settings function once this was done. Seems the only way to get this function back is to not allow themes to be changed on the course or user level (site admin settings). 2. Tried creating a new course, but it would not allow me to add a new course while the theme settings are as they are (allow user or course themes). It's probably just a simple thing like a php file somewhere requiring a change, so that Moodle can access the flex_rooms theme that comes with Flex Page, but I wouldn't know. If you haven't experienced any of these issues on a server , then maybe it might have something to do with the differences in path names (windows vs linux environment). Not sure if anyone has tried Flex Page on a windows system yet. I'd really like to resolve this. I am a designer and I really like Flex Page, particularly the course menu.

          "Text": "Good question - it seems so simple doesn't it to setup course names. However, down the road the choice of naming structure can present problems for both users, teachers and administrators. Here's my view... 1. If you were providing courses in the physical world then these would probably be listed in a 'catalogue' of some kind. The names in the catalogue should be meaningful and attractive to the potential 'users' - they are acting as 'advertising' and 'marketing' devices. So, in a Moodle space the smae should apply. 2. Long Moodle names are thoese that the potential users will see to 'attract' them...they should therefore convey enough menaing to draw people to the right course 3. Short names are used in palces ONCE A USER IS IN A COURSE - these don't have to be so comprehensive but should convey enough meaning for users, teachers and administrators to underdstand the source or target of any e-mail, post, log messages, reports etc. A tip - if you want to be precise about course identification consider using the Course ID Number field in course settings - this is an internal reference only, it could link to the course providers own catalogue of courses for complete clarity. Hope this helps. Graham",

          "Text": "Greetings! I am at a small, liberal arts university in the USA using Moodle 1.9.9 with around 650 courses each Fall and Spring semesters. Our organization and approach to the naming of course sites is: categories for each academic year - e.g. 2010 - 2011 - and then subcategories for each semester - e.g. Spring 2011 Full Name is the name of the course that the student/teacher will see and the teacher can change this if they would like. This is also what shows in the \"breadcrumb trail\" - did a little tweak to accomplish that Both the Short Name and Course ID Number are identical and are using the same naming/numbering listed elsewhere across the university with a semester and year tag added. The Short Name and Course ID Number cannot be changed by the teacher. For example: Full name = Greek Civilization Short name = CLA0731401-spring-11 Course ID Number = CLA0731401-spring-11 The reason for tweaking the \"breadcrumb trail\" to show the full name of the course is because that is typically how students and professors refer to their classes.

The entire e-learning course is about 3 hours in length and very large.  It is impossible to combine all the lessons together into 1 course.  Even if I could, a student would have to load the entire thing in order to take the course which causes all kinds of bandwidth issues. I need to connect lesson 1 to lesson 2,3,4,5 etc... so it flows for the student and they smoothly transition from lesson 1 to lesson 8 and complete the course. Is there something I need to do on the last slide of each lesson in order to make it activate the next lesson so it is a smooth workflow for every student.  These are NOT regular moodle users so need this to be a seemless, simple and easy course to take. The Weekly, topic format makes absolutely no sense to any user and confuses more people than it helps.  Are there alternatives that work for the type of scenario I'm using it in. Should I be using Moodle?  Is there a way to link 8 lessons together as one course and have scorm grading / reporting work smoothly. Thanks for any help! Steve",

I know the buttons are available but I would like a command contained in a label resource which the student can click and it will open the collapsed topic section and take them in the area to the position which I have given an ID, I understand how to go to say #Section-3 and how to HREF to an area with an id when the topic is open but I do not know how to expand that section with a command encompassed within the goto area # command, can anyone help?

To resolve it I created a blank course and import from the course with issues all the activities I wanted to be restored on the bulk course creation.

If there is a file 'externservercourse.php' in the 'course' directory on the Moodle server , which contains the function 'extern_server_course', then that can be used to redirect the user to a different URL . The way it would be set up is the 'real' course is placed in one category, then empty courses are placed in the other categories. When a user visits one of the empty courses, then they are immediately redirected to the 'real' course. Unfortunately, when arriving at the 'real' course, it is listed in its actual category (not the category where you started), but it is a way of providing a sort of shortcut from a course in one place in the category tree, to another. It also requires a bit of coding, if you want a proper interface for setting up the links (rather than just hard-coding a bunch of course ids into the 'externservercourse.php' script).",

One of our requirement is to give access to external users, we have decided to add external users to Active Directory so they will also have access to Moodle. In order to differentiate between external and internal users we are planning to use user field e.g. email address. Now the problem we are facing is, we want to hide course categories/courses by external or internal users (decided by user field). We can't go with the option of Roles/Cohorts access restrictions as we need to assign users to roles/cohorts in advance instead we want to this on the fly. So, every user signed into Moodle will have the same Student role and based on user field will be external or internal user and shown courses/course categories accordingly. Is there a way to achieve this in Moodle. We are open to using any Plugin as well. Any suggestions from the Moodle community to resolve this issue will be highly appreciated. Thank you, Sameer",

The client that will be using moodle to create courses wants to be able to give in the following when creating a course: - Topic (is there) - Trainer (not there - have to enrol somebody afterwards) - Date and time (date is there, time not) - Location/room (not there) - Content/themes of the course (not there) - Number of spaces available (not there) Is the description field the only place to be able to put some of these details? The client also wants it so that the people who want to sign up to the course should be able to see straight away a list of the Training Topics, with details of the topics, the date, and the trainer and possibly the number of places that are still free, as well as a button to sign up. Also, through clicking on the topic, you should be able to see more information about the training and again, a button to sign up is there. When  a person signs up, they should do this using their name, email address and company/department, and if possible topic wishes for the training. The client wants to see who has signed up (with their nme, email address, and company/department, and also the suggestions (topic wishes). I would appreciate any help. I know it's probably a big wish to be able to do all of the above, and in some cases not possible. But work-arounds are also very welcome.",

Most of these courses have identical content (a required English as a second language class), so we duplicate a 200mb course template full of content to make each of the 170 courses. However, in Moodle 2.7, the Upload Courses feature adds four unnecessary blocks (Recent Activity, Search Forums, .... ) in the right column and scrambles the careful setup of blocks we had in the template course, putting all of them in the left.  It seems to ignore the block setup of what was backed up in the course backup file (.mbz). How can we prevent that from occuring? The undesirable workaround is to hire student labor for two days to manually remove these blocks one by one and reorganize our intended blocks one by one. Another big issue is that in Moodle 2.5, this process was automated using a third party tool, allowing creation of multiple courses. Now in Moodle 2.7, this feature is now in core but only allows a single course to be created. Our site admin engineer is forced to do Upload Courses one-by-one, 170 times!",

          "Text": "Hi All, I'm interested in how the administrators out there who have to deploy lots of different courses organize and work with Moodle. For example, I have 20 different courses that I may deploy in different combinations for different user groups. Each time a new group comes together to take a class, would you recommend I backup and restore a new instance of the required course(s), name it something, unique and then make that their specific course? Or just assign the users to the specific courses they are required to take? Typing that out, it seems obvious that ovetime if I just assign people to the base classes it will be hard to track people, but I'm still interested in how other admins deploy and combine courses. Does anyone else have a base group of courses they repeatedly deploy when a new class starts?",

This problem can be fixed by going through each course and selecting the edit function for one of the resources and selecting save (you don't actually have to make any changes).

I tried to add a new category of classes and got a red message saying the category couldn't be added. I realized I had to add some new members, went and did that and came back to the main area where my classes had been listed down the center and they were gone!!! Now, in the area where my courses were listed is a repeat of the right hand, introductory text block. It seems the issue is that the only course category that existed (was MELODY) was somehow deleted when I went from the \"add category\" screen in courses, to the \"add users\" area. Because now I get this message when I go to courses: Serious error: could not create default category. And no one with admin status can re-establish a category. NO category, no classes. Oddly, a friend just went in and, did a search under the instructors name: Rick Carnes (at www.songwritersguild.com - click on chat or on forums). He found the missing courses under the instructors name and was able to subscribe to them. So, maybe they're not gone...but I can't see them as admin. And I still get the serious error message when I go to courses. I know I am still in the process of learning Moodle but, this is mindboggling .",

Using this I've hit the list of the content of the whole course on the homepage of the course for students using CSS : #page-course-view-topics .course-content .role-student { display: none; } However, this caused my drawer navigation on the left to be confused, and the class \"pageItem\" which determines what activity I am currently on is set the the last activity when a student enters the course. Everything works as intended - I am on the front page of my course only visually \"the focus\" in the navigation is set to the last activity. I think It is because of the function setPageItem function in the mutation.js file. I've tried to set the first item as default but it does not work. Please, does anyone have any idea, how I can fix this? Or is there a better way to hide the list of all activities on the front page of a course, just for students? Thank you!",

          "Text": "Hello, I've released the release candidate version of the Collapsed Topics course format for Moodle 5.0 as follows: Release 500.0.1 for Moodle 5.0 version 2025041400.00 (Build: 20250414) and above within the MOODLE_500_STABLE branch: https://moodle.org/plugins/format_topcoll/500.0.1/35794 https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-format_topcoll/releases/tag/V500.0.1 with: First Moodle 5.0 version. Update section highlight in line with core changes. Plus from the V405.1.0: Fix 'ARIA attribute for accessibility : aria-labelledby' - #160. Fix keyboard control of toggles in terms of focussing only on a the actual element that does the toggling. Fix 'Space key input not registered with the system Inplace editable in sections titles' - #161. Fix 'defaulttogglepersistence' not working. Improve single section page logic, especially when returning to course from creating a module. Important: Because of 'Subsection support' which has been incredibly difficult to support to the extent that I've had to wave a 'white flag' and remove the 'numsections' setting.  The course format API has been broken apart into so many interconnected small pieces (each tending to have separate PHP, JS and Mustache files), https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/plugintypes/format#format-output-classes-and-templates and https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/plugintypes/format#the-course-editor-structure , that it is difficult at times to understand and keep in working memory what is going on and where a given element of functionality is implemented to the extent where it can be overridden and changed.  Thus the format will now operate as 'Topics' does in terms of number of sections management.  Collapsed Topics was only ever designed to operate on sections and as such sees sub-sections as different entities not related to the number of sections in a course.  Collapsed Topics will now not allow you to have as many 'Sub sections' as you want - as was in V405.0.2 - due to increased chance of course restore failure, see: MDL-84874 .  Additional tracker issues of interest for this are: MDL-84038 and MDL-84291 . Because of the removal of 'numsections', this has an impact on backup and restore, which I've tested.  However with such a change brings risk and a greater chance of error, thus I cannot stress enough that you MUST test and be sure that the format works as expected before it goes anywhere near a production server .  I found with the Grid format that once 'numsections' was removed that it was tricky to go back, and therefore it would be unlikely even with the flexibility I like of being able to set the number of sections both as a course setting and add / remove in the course itself. I have refactored the whole toggle state preference JavaScript such that it no longer uses YUI.  This I hope will help to keep the format going for many years to come as older technologies are removed from core. Note: Always install on a test server to confirm that the format does what you want it to do before updating or installing on a production server!  And as this release could contain bugs and so I strongly recommend that you check on a test server first!  Not sure how to set one up?  Then look at the 'Installer packages' on https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/ . Ensure that you have multiple backups of all data before using.  Please report any issues. i.e. 'bugs' with this release ONLY here.  Before doing so please read 'Reporting issues' on the 'Information' tab on the course format 'Settings' under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Course formats' -> 'Collapsed Topics'.

Well, it is a mess: only CMS format and FN format (distracted from MoodleFN) survived, but all the other ones are crippled or killed: project formats, tab-formats, changed weekformats, day-formats... With any new release I normally take the new course-formats as starting point and insert my patches: it still worked in the early version of 1.6.. my patch for section zero, to show the activities of section zero in a horizontal row is now complete useless, because the table structure is replaced with the CSS approach.. Should I scream help or start to accept that I have to live with only the narrow set Moodle.org offers. Ok, lets take that old day-format: it offers a course as weekdays, and gives sunday and saterday another color. of course should the format be rewritten in CSS (so here is the ugly, old code, any help welcome) I inserted the line: $day = optional_param('day', PARAM_RAW); I changed like in other formats the checking row: if (! empty($day) ) { the error message is gone but... then only section zero shows up, with the jump-to-menu: i can jump to another (single) section and choose to show all the sections ... there they are, but gowing back to the starting point I still see only section zero (So I still miss one checkpoint...) I see, $day is already used in anther way, so change the lines: $pid= optional_param(pid, PARAM_RAW); if (! empty($pid) ) { It works!! one down, ten to go",

When you look at the course from their perspective (login as), it shows all the requirements to be complete are met. But the next activity, which requires completion of the previous, will not open. It isn't the same user or the same course every time. It is always different people, different courses and different points in the courses that it happens. If we manually uncheck completion in the Activities report and manually recheck it, everything is fine. But I'd rather not have to do that. Other users, even during the same day/hour etc, complete fine. It is possible all the modules not reporting are SCORM but many of the courses also have Quizzes and I'm not sure there aren't quizzes doing the same thing.  It is really strange. My users have been advised to use computers (not mobile devices) and to not use Chrome, which means most of my users are using Edge (though some are probably using Chrome against advice..). Has anyone else seen this? Any way to correct the issue?",

          "Text": "I can see that some have asked a similar question before (I've added links to these in the bottom), but my issue is not completely the same and might even be a question of future development in moodle. Here's what I want to do: Create a \"meta course\" with 4 linked \"child courses\". Each of the \"child courses\" will have \"completion tracking\" enabled and will have some kind of certificate when each is completed. From the \"meta course\" I want to be able to follow the progress of the \"activity completion\" on each of the \"child courses\" - e.g. indicated by a progress bar. Lastly, the \"meta course\" should have a kind of \"completion tracking\" of its own, where the progress of each \"child course\" works as an activity to be completed before the entire \"meta course\" is then completed. As of now, the two first bullets seem perfectly possible, but is there any way of doing the two latter ones? I see a very strong use case this in many different contexts (including the two already mentioned forum posts).

While currently the application of the template happens only when a teacher opens the course, it would be a relatively simple development to implement a scheduled task automates that process.

But is it possible to create a CLI script to copy a course and set its start date? Or else a Cron job which set new date on the existing course? Would you have any thoughts about it? Thanks a lot for your help!",

Also, how the heck do you add an announcement on top of the home screen? for the life of me I  cannot find where to go and add content to the announcement section.

For drag ability the current technology suggests one of the following java , flash, Dhtml or code that parses a final output that can be dragged. Templates would make things easier to add required information to the database fields needed however it may be a bit restrictive. Just Thinking - maybe someone might give this a try.",

What I have is a school where we will have approx 1200 student users and 90 teacher users, each subject is getting a course (year 7 Science, year 7 English etc..) then within these courses I would like to setup separate groups within the course for the 8 different classes of that subject (in the course year 7 Science there would be all 8 classes as groups - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, white) with the students and the appropriate teacher placed in the groups and roles within the course - still using internal enrolment key as the enrolment plug-in does not put students into groups only into courses as far as I can see. The template system for new courses would be ideal, or is there another option for what I want to do? Moodle v1.9.3+ (build 20081022) Thanks.",

Reset language improvements in line with global default tracking as implemented in 3.10.0.2. Improved backup restore with numsections. Added 'Toggle blocks location' functionality, thanks to John Joubert ( https://github.com/John-Joubert ) for the patch - #100. Fix 'Deprecation warning for 3.11' - #99. Fix 'Section content is in a column when using horizontal columns on a single section page'. Fix 'Column orientation combo box strings'. Improve activity meta from information gained on #101.

However, you could just have a 'Topic' course and have conditional activies which then allows them to 'see' the next week. But for the full functionality a change to Moodle core needs to be made to add the 'coursefirstaccess' attribute so that a course format could be written to provide what you require.  Please consider looking at Moodle Tracker and if there is something similar, vote for it, otherwise create an issue.

Something like not being able to access the next topic until you pass the final quiz for the previous topic. As far as I can tell, the only way to do that is to have each item in the next topic say \"Restricted: ‘Not available until the activity xxx is marked complete.’ A bad compromise would be to have that at the Topic level, but I don't see any way to do that.

Open up the database and find the 'course_format_options' table. Make an entry for each 'course' id with the format of the 'format', section id of 0, name of 'numsections' and a value of the number of sections you want on the given course.  If you have other courses that are fine then look for examples in the same table.

Ok, what I'll do for 'free' is place the section name as the 'alt' field text, sort the icon size relative to the styles, back port the quiz restore issue and log file new activity to Moodle 2.3.4+ (because of MDL-36095 and therefore I had no choice but to update the code to support it).  I notice that you state that are running 2.3.2, so you will have to upgrade within the 2.3 branch to use it - back porting to another off shoot branch will cause greater configuration management nightmares for me.  This is a trade off as I normally only do improvements (the alt text) in the latest version. Anything more will require discussion. Gareth",

I am new to my Admin role (long story) so still feeling my way around. How/where would I check that sync is running? Also, regarding course completion recalculation, we imported a course including the user data from 2000 \" old\" users who had \"Completed\" the course (which contained quizzes and activities that required a grade and feedback to pass) and since then we have added 63 new users who are at various stages of completion. However for some reason the new Course Completion Settings are not the same as in the original course (in the new course, only 1 activity is ticked as required for completion, instead of 10) and now all 63 new users are showing 100% Completed after doing just one activity. We want to reset the completion settings in the new course to include all the relevant activities but when we go to Edit Course Completion Settings  we get this warning message: One or more students have already completed a criterion so the settings have been locked. Unlocking the completion criteria settings will deleted any existing user data and may cause confusion. Are you saying if we go ahead and do this anyway, the course completion will recalculate  ie \"sync\" - both for the 2000 original users and the 63 new users. Many thanks for your time; very much appreciate any advice regarding this issue",

I've inspected the source coding and looked at various approached tried on other websites, but haven't quite got the solution.

I've created all the courses, but what I'm trying to figure out is if there's a way to create a course path per user based on their role so we don't have to keep assigning the courses individually whenever we hire a new person. As an example: Technician will automatically be assigned courses A,B,C,D CSR will be assigned course A & D Management will be assigned A & B So once we set the user up, either add a role, group, or cohort and then they will automatically be enrolled in the courses. Is there such a feature or workaround? Thank you so much in advance for your help! Version 3.6.4 Theme: Boost (default)",

The reason I am asking is that we implemented a couple of years ago an online form that helps teachers request new course sites, with an option available to choose another of their courses as a template.  We recently noticed that hidden courses do not show up in the form: teachers must first make the course available and only then can they proceed with the duplication process.  I find this a bit strange, as teachers should continue to see all their courses, as visibility is linked to their role. We do have cases where some courses must be hidden from students and would prefer not making these visible during a given time period. Am I missing something?  Thanks for your help.",

Best option, change the Role. Create Categories with the Respective courses in them. Assign standard User Role to all Admins except those you want as Site Admins.

Having worked a lot recently on Mobile themes, I've changed the logic such that if you have set the course to have two-four columns, then on a tablet device 'two' columns will be displayed given the avaiable screen space. Because of the changes, some of the JavaScript has changed, therefore you will need to perform a 'Purge All Caches' ( http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Developer_tools ) when upgrading. Cheers, Gareth",

Therefore at this moment in time, there is nothing I can do to solve the problem.  Sorry. Cheers, Gareth",

Nice idea, but again, this I believe will cause confusion as it is logically intermixing two different functionalities.  So, when the image does not react to the size change then I'll get questions like 'why is the image not resizing when I change the size of the box?'. Ok, I do now see the possibility that when uploading that gif images are left unprocessed and scaled using CSS .  The code as it stands was designed to be as optimal as possible.  However, if a compromise that the full size of the file is downloaded, then it is conceivable that it would work behind the scenes without user interaction.  This will take time to figure out and I don't have time at the moment.  But I'll keep it in the back of my mind for sometime in the future.

In the Moodle 2.3 version if you wish to remove the functionality, edit 'renderer.php' and remove: // Collapsed Topics settings. echo $this->settings($course); around lines 351/352.  Then the defaults will be used unless the spanner has been used previously to set course specific settings, in which case you need to edit the rows in 'format_topcoll_settings' in the database or put the spanner back temporarily and do a reset as administrator as mentioned above. The spanner will disapear in Moodle 2.4 when planned custom course settings are added to core and I can move the code in that direction. Regards, Gareth Developer of Collapsed Topics",

But it isn't 300 users mark complete; 60 are complete but don't have the check. I only know which ones are being affected when I see they did the next activity, which the non reporting one is required for. More irritating than the email.

I suppose to stay out of trouble, you'd need to rely on activity completion (which is reversible, if needed - UNLIKE course completion, AFAIK ), plus badge / certificate. For such courses you'd need to visit the Course completion page and verify that nothing is checked there, or else add (temporarily ?) the \"Course completion\" block and ensure it says \"No completion criteria set for this course\".

The show paginated sections at the bottom is supposed to show only 10 sections at a time. By default not all the sections are displayed. I was trying to keep the course format as simple as possible when I started working with it. That's why no date label is automatically added for the user. Adding a label starts opening the door to other questions. For example: * what format should be used? Different date printing formats are used throughout the world * a teacher may start working by preparing a couple of classes ahead of time. Thus the time when the teacher first enters a topic label may not be the same as the date that he or she would want to use for the topic. Did you find the rest instructions in the course format useful or were there any confusing? Was it useful to have the new sections hidden by default? Thanks, Jose",

I can see your point about the date - very tricky! - but you could get the date format from the defaults within Moodle somewhere, it must be stored somewhere in localization, add in a label with the date and then it would be a normal label that can be edited, far easier than creating a new one and ensuring that the sytle is consistent. I think that the instructions will be useful as most of the teachers I teach on how to use Moodle are not so 'TechnoSavvy' and need more help than the average computer user. I am not sure about the 'hidden by default' as this would then require an extra action on the part of the teacher and they may not realise that they have to do it - re: my above comment. Therefore as this is a 'process' change to the norm, then you could include it as instructions - if this makes sence? Cheers, Gareth",

Now I am trying to link our testing software (Examplify) to Moodle but it is getting confused because it can't recognize groups and only the class.  While that shouldn't be an issue it does become one on the testing side as anything posted to a course is available to any in that course and I can't filter it to a specific group. Have been thinking of setting up, what I would call is a master course, so that anything we want the students to see would be there and would only require one spot to be updated if anything changes.  Then I would set-up another \"course\" specific to that group of students. How do I link them so they don't see the two courses and can the gradebook in the master course pick up marks from the sub-course? Or does anyone have any suggestions of a better set-up?  I don't want to get into just duplicating the course over and over as I feel that would be an issue pertaining to consistency of materials from one to the next.",

Alternatively you could advertise for a developer to do this for you. I think the tools are all there within Moodle, so it's 'just' a case of putting them together in the right ways - that said, the 'just' here would be outside my immediate experience and expertise, so I may be wrong about the complexity of achieving this!",

At the moment I'm using my\nown bookmark block to import/export bookmarks but another method\n(Teemu's portfolio / the glossary / Tony's bookmarklet) could very well\nbe used. This is just a proposal for a new way to display them. A lot of the topics in my course are based on one or two activities and then some webpages for students who want to know more about it. How about displaying them like this: first part of the screen contains the normal section of the course. second part displays external links stored in a sitewide bookmarks database (and thus easily exported / imported into the teachers browser. Firefox has a great bookmark manager that I would like to use for my Moodle links as well) Take a look here",

I like the bookmarklet tools that you and Tony developed, and your module in particular I know I will use in at least some of my courses, probably pretty much as is. However, I feel that so far none of the solutions presented allow for anything more than passive consumption of the content of the pages that include the bookmarks. It would be nice, for example, if the bookmarklet tool could be used to insert bookmarks into a glossary, and put into specific categories within that glossary, just as Tony's tool allows one to add bookmarks to a specific topic in a course. The advantage of this is that it could allow for a variety of things to be done. Teachers could allow students to add bookmarks to the glossary and to add them to the various categories, thereby creating a repository of bookmarks in various categories related to the course subject matter. This is more logical for learning purposes than each student having their own personal bookmarks they can share with the class. Their personal contributions could still be noted if the format of the glossary were to show the contributor. Secondly, collecting them in a glossary, and enabling comments on the glossary item, would provide an opportunity for students to reflect more on what they read on the linked pages-it could even be an assignment that students post comments and this would ensure that they were reading what they were supposed to be reading.",

Now I know Moodle can release content on a weekly basis, but that's based on a specified time. What I was wondering is if Moodle can release content to the enrolled student based on a time duration since that student enrolled (like through a rolling enrolment scenario). An example would be, I enrol in a course in Moodle, and then 7 days later, Moodle releases the next topic/content to me. After another 7 days, another topic is released so on and so forth. The releases of content would be specific to the student, not to the course like you get on the 'weekly format' course format choice. Thank you so much! Now back to Scorm uploads and Server Timeout Problems :D Cheers, Brodie Greig",

Now suddenly I find bugs in the course and want to rectify them. What will happen if I re- upload files in the course? Will first 15 users have to take the course again? Will 20 users have to restart the course? Is there any provision to manage course versions? Meaning first 15 users will not have to go through the course again. for 20 users, it may be restart of the course. Experts can you please comment?",

See this link for setting a default block layout: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Block_layout I am not totally sure I understand what you are trying to accomplish. My recollection is that a restore (not import) will set a block layout as well as content. So if that is easier for you, or you have multiple templates you need to work with, that might be a better option. We do both on our instance. We set default block layouts to cover newly created courses, and we use restore to copy courses with content. As long as the blocks are installed, then the restore should pick them up and arrange them in the same way as the original. Hope that helps! atw",

I've gone to all this effort for several reasons: To fix the 2-3 image ratio which was actually 1-3 due to a single character typo. To remove the M1.9 conversion script which was claimed to pose an issue if kept on the server .  If you're still running M3.2 or less then remove it manually as per the Readme.md file instructions. Remove the old out of date pre-PHP Unit tests. Add missing 'MOODLE_INTERNAL' definitions to prevent PHP code being run outside of Moodle. Alter the information produced when the image generation breaks, such that the filename, section id and displayed image index from the files / format_grid_information table are shown on the error message.  If you think this is an issue then please don't install and do tell me why!  I've done this because there is a reoccurring 'oddity' that seems to happen (perhaps on upgrades) that images get broken and can't be put back.  I don't know why this is, but have a 'hunch', if that hunch is correct then I can either find the problem leading to a solution and / or add 'admin activated repair functionality'.  But I need you to tell me the information in the error and the steps that lead up to it. This does mean that all five versions are functionally the same. All of these releases are 'beta'.  I've tested them to a certain extent, but I STRONGLY advise that you test thoroughly before placing on a production server. Please kindly put comments about these versions here ONLY. If you find this post useful, then please mark it so. Gareth",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm working on setting up a Moodle site where we'll be making use of the Social course format. However, I'd like the course home page to display Recent Activity for the course instead than the default social forum. Rather than modify the code for the Social Course Format, I've made a new course format by copying social one as per https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=169976 . So far so good. Now I just need to modify the format.php file so that it does what recent.php does. I tried just copying the code from the recent.php file into the format.php file but it just gave me the error: Coding error detected, it must be fixed by a programmer: The theme has already been set up for this page ready for output. Therefore, you can no longer change the theme, or anything that might affect what the current theme is, for example, the course. Any help would great.

HOWEVER if there are other conditions to enrolling in course B apart from completing course A (manual enrolment, paid enrolment etc) these override the badge enrolment, rendering it somewhat useless - its an OR not and AND. in other words Badge enrolment only works and a pre-requite mechanism if there are no other enrolment methods on that course. Pre-requisites are pretty commonplace for training. As  relative newcomer it seems strange to me that Moodle does not have anything like this built in. I also tried using the badge restriction plugin to restrict access to all course activities to a badge but now this plugin has stepped working for some reason - it has not been updated for some time. The quest continues...",

However, I'd like to reuse some \"course\" information. Let me explain... I've used other Learning Management Systems that allowed for \"Course\" definitions. Using those \"parent\" objects one could then create \"classes\" that ran on specific days. It helped with reporting and tracking. Here's how I would like it to work. Create a \"Course\" that contains a description of the content, a duration, room requirements, equipment requirements, and a few other details. What it does NOT include is a date and time or specific attendees assigned. That would go into a \"Class\"!  I'd like to use the \"Course\" defined earlier as a parent object to create a class that then gets attatched to a specific date and time. The \"Class\" item would accumulate students and after the physical delivery of a class we could close the session and grade the results. Those results would appear on the students transcripts. Finally, we could search for everyone who has ever taken a specific course from the \"Course\" level or look at a specific instance at the \"Class\" level. Does Moodle allow for that type of a structure or tracking? I see it being very useful for distance education and classes that last a whole semester but I'm having trouble setting up the above hierarchy for just one class. I'm concerned that it is terminology or the naming conventions that are confusing me. Please help me understand how to set this up for my installation of Moodle. Thank you",

I have a course that currently has 4 topics.  Topics 3 & 4 are dependent upon completion of Topics 1 & 2, so each students needs to complete the first half in order to access the second half.  We taking ongoing rolling enrolments so we don't need to monitor or manage where a student is up to for their completion and they can go at their own pace.  As soon as both the first topics are completed, the next ones become available.  What I want to do is allow a student to make a 50% payment, and have access to the first half, which is easy done with the way it is currently set up, but I want the second half of the course to not become automatically accessible without my permitting it once the other 50% course fee is received.  Is it possible to do this for just one individual student?  Or will I just need to monitor her progress, then discontinue her course access manually once she has completed the first two modules?

I was wondering if any plug-ins or core functions are available in Moodle 3.2 for this thing (or even in a posterior release would be nice), since it sounds to me like it should be a basic/core functionality.

Fix error with analytic - get_section_dates function - thanks to https://github.com/tuanngocnguyen for the patch - #65. Improve accessibility by having the 'left', 'content' and 'right' section areas in that order rather than 'left', 'right' and 'content' which makes the tab order wrong. Really the key one here is point four where I've completely changed the markup so that it is no longer 'content last' which is different from core method.  This is for accessibility reasons and might affect some themes. Also due to direct messages about non-stable versions not showing up as updates from the plugin's DB I've marked both as 'Stable' even though I'm not quite sure of the full effect of '4'.  As always, you should test on a test system first.

Or it is just the activities & resources ( Database activities, Assignments, label, web/text pages etc..) created by the users would be deleted? Also, does it means that the Q&A forum types would not be removed ? It's not stated in the moodle docs . I don't see the \"teacher forum\" type in my moodle (using v 1.9.1).

This behavior looks normal after all, but grid does not seem to work with orphans !

In Moodle 3.3, the fact that the last\nsection's id is not consecutive creates exceptions: ``` Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in\n/usr/share/nginx/html/aviv2017/course/format/topcoll/renderer.php on line 787 Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in\n/usr/share/nginx/html/aviv2017/course/format/topcoll/renderer.php on line 788 ``` I get these exceptions for every id from 7 till 109. When I change to any of the core course formats, such as topics or\nweeks, this doesn't happen. I originally thought this was a problem with Moodle removing\n'numsections' from version 3.3, and therefore posted on the Moodle development\nforum and even on tracker , but was told\nthat this issue is related to the topcoll format. I am using the 3.3.1.1 (2017042203) version of topcoll, on Moodle 3.3.",

So some of the blocks contains modules to be used at specific times, other contain modules to be used at all times but for different purposes.

          "Text": "I haven't found a topic with exactly this problem, so I am adding it. I want to create a number of sequences of pages such that each sequence is in a separate unit (topic) of a course. The pages may be read only pages or even some forms that take input from the user and pass that input on to other subsequent pages for display. In short the page sequences are just a web application that handles its own navigation and state. But: for any Unit i and Unit j, the sequence for Unit j must be conditional on the user's visiting the LAST page in the sequence for Unit i. Since the link to the first page of Unit i seems to be the only link exposed in the course Units in Moodle, it seems that the only way to get the desired conditional release is through creating some sort of \"score\" that is required to be earned, and which is granted (automatically) when the user visits the last page of a sequence. If I were to create a dummy quiz (\"Are you ready to proceed to the next Unit?\") it could probably be done, but this is very hokey and not at all what the client has in mind from a look and feel perspective. There is no relevant time-driven release, either. The only way I have been able to conceive of getting what is needed is by taking each sequence and creating a SCORM module out of it. Completion of each SCORM module could automatically store a score, right? Implementing each sequence as an LTI tool that returns an outcome would also work, but that means adding LTI Tool code to the sequences, which is out of scope for this project. I'm hoping there is some built-in Moodle functionality that in my ignorance I have simply missed. Any suggestions? Thanks, A",

Since most of my students do not do their homework till the morning of the lesson , this means that they get confused as to which is this week's quiz. For example, the homework for tomorrow's class is in week 5 which is from October 28 to 3 Novemeber. But most of my students will end up doing the homework tomorrow morning (especially since today is a bank holiday). So they come to the computer on the 4th and consequently look at the resources in week 6 because it is marked \"4 November - 10 November.\" The matter is compounded since I have made the bars around \"This week\" pink. Tomorrow morning it will be week 6 that is surrounded by pink bars. Okay, so I could turn off the highlighting but... It would be great if one could set not only the start date, but also the start time of the course. That way, while the date problem would remain (there is nothing I can do about the fact that week 6 starts on the 4th of Novemeber) but the pink high lighting would at least remain on week 5 until the time of the class. For tomorrow's class I may move the class on a day, making week 6 start on the 5th, but that may confuse them too. Umm.... BTW Moodle is making them work their goolies off.

The “topic course format” sees each section as one topic and the “weekly course format” sees each section as a week’s content. In the case of a weekly course format, the date of the section will be displayed on a weekly basis from the start date  to the end date of the course.

Reading between the lines it appears that if they keep adding lots of information to the general section then a) they have poor course design skills and or b) they can't be bothered with the quality of the course material.  In both situations the solution is with them being taught and having dictated performance management targets which will hurt them the most and wake them up to do a proper job. The options in Moodle (as I've come to learn) have to be positive.  Therefore if there still is going to be an improvement then my vote will be for '3'.  If you do raise it, then please post the number here, I'll look at it and may even consider implementing it.

I'm trying to add an option to add a unique image to represent a course with the option to select rather than the instructor image on the summary page. I've added 2 new course custom fields. I created a new field type of 'courseImage' based on the field 'file' type.  I am able to upload an image and check if I want it to be the default. That works fine. I can get the information out of the mdl_course_data_info and field tables. The trouble is that I cannot resize the images on reload or verify image type with my approach. I'm trying to work it something like the user profile image process but can't seem to tie them together. I've been using PHP for almost a year but am lost here. I'm trying not to overwrite core code if possible. Any suggestions? Thanks.",

As it stands I could create a subject course and then put the dates on the weeks. The current week would not highlight in pink though. Twice weekly is pretty difficult because the spacing between the days is not clear. I suppose that ideally it would be necessary to allow the teacher to specify the first week (with as many classes as one likes) and then press a \"repeat weekly\" button, a bit like yahoo calendar. The course I am meant to be preparing is twice weekly for 7 weeks. It is intensive, with a bit of homework (a quick vocabulary, reading comprehension, and listening quiz) after every lesson . There are 14 of them. I deserve the nightmares I get. Timothy Takemoto",

Therefore with those time and version constraints you are better off requesting / working with the developers of the block manager ( https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=block_cmanager ) to iron out the bugs and add in the features you require.  I had a quick look at the code and there is a separate database table where new options have already been added.  And block do support storage of files - http://docs.moodle.org/dev/File_API#File_areas - however, I do know from the grid format that file upload and storage is not simple.  Despite all of this, the contributed solution will be the fastest option, even if you fork the code and perform the work yourself.  The source code is after all GPLv3 as with all code and plugins in Moodle, so you can copy and improve on it.

On our front page we have 20 separate course categories which house 361 spearate courses. When I click into one of the categories it desplays the list of courses within that category. The problem arises when either one of our co-ordinators or a candidate logs in and tries to view the list of courses its a different list than the one displayed to me (I have admin rights). It seems to drop off half of the courses of the end of the list so obviously the candidates cannot view thier spacific course thus they cannot enrol onto it. I have tried ammending the lib.php file and also the index.php and lid.org.php file to a higher amount (500 courses) so the front page will desplay more courses but this doesn't seem to have done anything. Please can somone help me out with this and point me in the right direction as to what i need to do to sort this out. Many Thanks.",

Since I upgraded my Moodle to 1.8, I am no longer able to duplicate an old format type to create a new one... it always goes to the default format - in my case the weeks format. I am able to change the format name in the settings drop down menu by either creating a course/format/lang folder or by changing the Moodle.php file - both work. Any assistance you can provide would be appreciated.",

          "Text": "Hi. I don't know what I am missing here but I can't find a course in the My Courses block once it has been enrolled. I have created a Topic based course which has a Course Module and an Assessment Module.  Both are in the same Topic, so there is only one Topic in the course.  Both are SCORM packages. The course module is set up for unlimited attempts (as I want students to be able to keep going back to it) The assessment module is set for 3 attempts, so that I can tell if a student is struggling. When we open the dashboard we can see the course listed in 'Available Courses' and we can enroll on the course and complete the course module.  If however we come out of the course, we would expect that we could see the course in the My Courses block 'Course in progress' section.  It is not there. We can see that we have access to it in the My Course dropdown menu, but this is very confusing for students who think it has been removed and so they don't complete the assessment. Now that I have expalined all of that I should state that I am using course licences to allocate users on a course in IOMAD.  I don't think that this will amke a difference but all onformation is worth knowing. I am on Moodle 3.2. Any help to a frustrated moodler? Thanks Mark.",

In fact, this is very similar to the \"weeks\" and \"topics\" format, in that each \"phase\" is actually a \"topic\" with additional information regarding the start and end dates of the phase. The project format allows to mix phases and topics. A Gantt chart is automatically included in the top area (section 0) of the course. It represents a 'bar' for each phase and a milestone for each assignemt activity that is defined as part of a phase. By mousing over the milestones the teacher gets a list of students who have competed the assignements and who got feedback already. It would be quite easy to add events from the calendar to the Gannt chart. The motivation to develop such a course format is that we have been using a homemade project manager based on postnuke in the past 2 years ( http://teamframes.epfl.ch ). As we are now moving towards using Moodle as our basic elearning toolkit, we wanted to continue supporting teachers who do project-based teaching. The implementation is very preliminary but does the essential. I developed it with 1.5 and then had to adapt some code to have it run under 1.4. It relies on a modified version of JpGraph that allows mouseovers and upon overlib for the popups. Open questions which I have not addressed yet are how to backup such a course including the information about phases. How to allow one member of a group to submit something that 'counts' for all members. How to allow multifile submissions to assignement. How to enable file sharing among the group members. etc. etc. If you are interested in having a look, testing is available at:",

In the end I hope that a student can draw in a project the starting GANTT and the progress figures(25%, halfway,..), are you moving in that direction? (For example: when working on a project in a Wiki, it is not  possible to  measure the progress automatically, only the student's feeling can be expressed, so..)",

For the teacher view, there would be some redesign to be though of in order to accomodate the display of multiple progress bars. Also, giving the students the possibility to design their own project can be a interesting learning activity. This would however require that the students have editing privileges like teachers. Concerning the deliverables in the overview of assignments, they are indeed connected. In the popups, NA appears where something is missing.  'OK' or an icon appear to signal a feedback or a file. For the teacher: the colors of the milestones correspond to whether no/some/all students have submitted their assignment and to whether no/some/all students got feedback. For the student: the colors of the milestones correspond to whether they delivered or not (green/red) and to whether they got feedback or not (green/red).",

Makes me wonder whether we could use them for most of the Moodle activities ? Teacher mouses over a journal activity and gets a pop-up of what has been done and what still needs comments! I wonder whether the Gantt chart could be a block and whether all of Moodle's activities could simply get an additional variable that tagged them as certain phases (or some custom term). For example, I could imagine tagging all of the the first term assignments this way, so that students could have a quick glance at what needed to be completed. Thanks! Tom p.s. Because of your \"quick glance\" look at feedback, it seems that the Gantt chart could even function (in block form) as a \"marking\" block (like the one that Mike Churchill created), that would allow teachers to quickly view what needed to be graded in certain projects/phases/terms.",

With the desire to move to a new more flexible course format API for Moodle 2.4 as I believe indicated at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Developer_meeting_May_2012 - what is the best course of action for contributed course format developers to follow?

Things that might sway you one way or the others is how you track enrolments and grades and other things like that. Don't be afraid to experiment; don't be afraid to continue asking questions in these forums; and other good places to learn more are http://docs.moodle.org/ and some of the Moodle books that have been published (look in the support menu above).",

The IT guy I'm working with took some screenshots of the system as he went through a process described by Gareth for removing rows from certain tables. Those are attached as two zip files to this post, and if anyone is curious about Gareth's actual instructions, I can post those. 3. The last comment the IT guy shared was \"A couple of things that I noticed are that I could not uninstall the plugin from the plugin overview, and I was unable to find any entries in the capabilities table.\" 4. Gareth has been unable to replicate. Thanks!",

Assuming that CT files are already in place in '/course/format/topcoll'. Remove all 'topcoll' ('format_topcoll' and 'format/topcoll') rows from the following tables in the database: config_plugins, capabilities, role_capabilities and course_format_options. In the 'config' table, find the row for 'allversionshash' ('name' attribute) and set to an empty string, i.e. clear completely. Perform a 'Purge all caches'. Go to 'Site administration -> Notifications'.  The URL should have no 'cache' parameter and if it does, change to 'cache=0' and reload. This should kick start the update checking mechanism and reinstall the format. Put Moodle out of maintenance mode. Note: If you had set any previous CT specific course settings, then these will be lost. Cheers, Gareth",

This release is 'Stable' and I cannot stress enough that it MUST be tested on a test server first as reverting back from 'gnumsections' to 'numsections' could prove difficult.  Therefore it is essential that I am still reassured from the community that this works in the 'wild' beyond what I have already tested. This functionality has been put in place in V402.1.1 (a release candidate version) such that you can both change the number of sections via the course sections in the old fashioned way and at the same time use the modern way on the course page itself, adding in sections singularly where you want them. If you're not sure how to set up a test server?  Then look at the 'Installer packages' on https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/. ; Ensure that you have multiple backups of all data before using.  Please report any issues. i.e. 'bugs' with this release ONLY here.  Before doing so please read 'Reporting issues' on the 'Information' tab on the course format 'Settings' under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Course formats' -> 'Grid'.

Well, I am not a programmer so this is my novice assessment of the issue.  Maybe others will jump in with more ideas. To get the process started, you can always add this as a \"feature request\" in the Tracker system.  Yes, this can also be suggested in the Moodle User's Group. Having said this, I think that I would \"vote\" for this feature.  I like the idea even though it will add complexity.  My classes do have a start date and a very consistent end date for all assignments (quizzes, forum discussions, and assignments.)",

So if you want to enroll my course01 you have to give my organization 2 Euros. At the same time I deliver my courses by grouping them. To do this I added to my moodle installation two metacourses. Let me call them metacourse01 and metacourse02. Each one of these two metacourses is the collection three standard courses. If you want you can buy the access to my metacourse01 for 5 Euros saving one Euro. My metacourse01 collect the course01, course02 and course03. My metacourse02 collect the course01, course02 and course04. Well, as far as what I described, inside my Moodle installation I must have three instances of the course01.

They don't actually prepare lessons and courseware, but rather steer the discussions and collaborative work towards a desired goal. Each instance of a course template can take vastly different directions, depending on where the participants drive it, but always results in a constructive lesson . I don't find a forum quite the right entry point for this, so I haven't used the social format. Likewise, I find the columnar look of the topic and weekly formats to rigid. I've been tinkering with a new format,based on the social format, that uses a wiki as its entry to the course. This page can be managed easily by the moderator, and more pages can be added as needed. Using the various activity and resource filters, links can be created to course activities simply by typing their names. The whole course could be managed easily by a non-editing teacher. I'm thinking of providing a way (although I haven't figured out how yet) of allowing a particular wiki page to be selected as the default course page. This could be changed as necessary (one per week?). The moderator could also highlight particularly interesting submissions by the students (at least if they were other wiki solutions) by entering the page name on this page. Does this make sense to pursue, or am I reinventing a wheel that I can't see? mike",

The main page of the web interface for such a group maintained using YahooGroups provides the last five messages and an area above the last five messages for discription and links.  This arrangement is a bit like the summary space or topic 0 that preceeds the topics on the main page of a Moodle course using the Topic Format. The column to the  left of the discription and five-message display lists links the message archives, the member list, a file area, a member chat et cetera. I think the Social Format in Moodle more closely approximates the discussion-group centric format used at YahooGroups. The one addition that I would suggest for Moodle's Social Format would be a space above the messages displayed on the main course page.  This space could function like the correponding space, the summary or topic 0, provided in Topic Format.  I would also suggest both a discription area and provision for adding resources and activities like the summary or topic 0 just like what is made available in Topic Format. I will be looking at the other forums at Moodle.org to see where else I may advance this last idea. John P.S. The YahooGroups site that was utilized for a series of one-week continuing education courses over a six month period for lawyers, law librarians and legal professionals is at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/network-lawyers Anyone here at Moodle who is interested in taking a look at this set up let me know so that I may extend member and/or moderator priveleges so that you may take a better look.

          "Text": "Hello, I've updated Collapsed Topics for Moodle 3.10 as follows: Make engagement information optional - #80 and #91 - thanks to Nina Herrmann ( https://github.com/NinaHerrmann ) for the enhancement. All course settings now have an option to track the value of the global default as set by the administrator.  Thus, when they change, then the course changes without any user interaction on the course.  The reset course functionality is still there and will set the value of the setting to the this 'new' default value.  The default colour value is '-' and the colour picker box will show the colour that has been set as the default.  All other settings will state what the default currently is. You can get it from: moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=23213 .  All being well, I'll backport the new default functionality as I spotted a few bugs when implementing the code.  They are not worth fixing as the new functionality resolves them. I've also created two videos to demonstrate the new 'Defaults' functionality: So hopefully this is a useful improvement.  Please post comments / issues with this version ONLY on this thread. Gareth",

          "Text": "On Moodle 3.8.4 (Build: 20200713) We have a course using single activity format and a scorm package. The scorm package used to work on Moodle 3.6 and stopped working after we upgraded to Moodle 3.8. When the scorm launches it doesn't show anything, but the console shows various javascript errors, suggesting they are missing characters from the end of the file. When I edit those files to add extra junk characters on the end (in a comment), those files start to work, with just the trailing few characters of my comment missing. This happens for every file the scorm package contains, and I can't add extra characters on to the non-text files, such as fonts/images. The exact same scorm package works when used within a normal course. I've spotted a few other bugs on the bug tracker about pictures not working on single activity format... possibly related as they may be having some bytes trimmed from the end of the file too. The weird bit is I have another VLE on the same version of Moodle where this error does not manifest. Has anyone seen this sort of error before? Can anyone suggest anything I can look at to debug/fix this? many thanks Stephen",

Even thought the course is set to show one topic only, when I enter editing mode, it displays all the topics, which makes the page take quite a while to load, since there are many activities. This means doing simple administrative things on the course (adding assignments, editing multiple assignments, etc.) takes a lot longer since each time it must reload the page, it must load the entire course. It seems this is the standard behavior, but I was hoping someone with more experience than me might have a good solution? (One alternative would be if there is an easy way to copy an entire topic from one course to another. Then I can just copy topics of the course as the year progresses). Thanks so much.",

An alternative is a programmatic one such that when editing you have to click on a section to edit them as you want.  However, this means that moving activities / resources between sections is impossible.  This does mean modifying the code.  It would be possible, but how long to work out the changes, difficult to say without a de-risking exercise. Or use Collapsed Topics where all of the activities / resources are still there, just not shown unless you open a toggle.  Therefore easier to D&D from say section 30 to section 1.  Page load probably the same as you currently have. Critically I would start to question why a course has become so big.  Perhaps consider leaving it as is and then progressively transfer to a metacourse solution with a course for each section.",

Seems an odd way of doing it though as I would have thought that the interface 'renderable' would have a method that the empty class in the example implemented then the render for the format would not have to have a method and it gets called with an instance of an empty class that this then gets discarded.  Seems inefficient.

In some cases however tutors use one Moodle course to cover a number of uniquely coded MIS courses. Our solution was meta courses where, for example, four uniquely coded courses are all enrolled on a meta course. We would then like the four enrolling courses to be hidden so that the student sees only the meta course. We have turned availability off but when a student logs in they see the course greyed out and if they access they receive a message saying course is unavailable to students. Is it possible to keep the enrolling courses entirely hidden from the students' course categories so that they see only the available meta courses?",

          "Text": "Hi, M2.5 version of the columns format (beta) is now available from: https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=2958 Changes: 1. Fixed \"When in 'Show one section per page' mode and the column orientation is set to 'Horizontal' the sections on the main page do not fill their correct width. This is due to the use of the 'section_summary()' method which needs to be changed within the format to set the calculated width on the 'li' tag.\" because the core fix I submitted on MDL-39099 has now been integrated. Thus requiring version 2013050200.00 2.5beta+ (Build: 20130502). 2. Removed '.jumpmenu' from styles. css because of MDL-38907 . 3. Moved 'float: left' to styles.css for Henrik Thorn - CONTRIB-4198 . 4. Improvements for MDL-34917 . 5. Realised that Tablets have more space, so allow two columns even when two or more are set. 6. Updated core API calls to M2.5. 7. Moved all 'cnconfig.php' default functionalty to 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Columns' so that defaults can be changed by the administrator from within Moodle without resorting to code changes. 8. Added capability 'format/columns:changecolumns' to editing teachers and managers such that site administrators can choose to disable functionality through roles if they wish. In order for this to work the version number must be updated. Cheers, Gareth",

          "Title": "Collapsed Topics updated from V405.0.3 to V405.0.4 for Moodle 4.5",
          "Text": "Hello, I've released an updated 'release candidate' version of the Collapsed Topics course format for Moodle 4.5 as follows: Release 405.0.4 for Moodle 4.5 version 2024100700.00 (Build: 20241007) and above within the MOODLE_405_STABLE branch until the next release: https://moodle.org/plugins/format_topcoll/405.0.4/35357 https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-format_topcoll/releases/tag/V405.0.4 with: Fix 'allow_stealth_module_visibility' still using 'numsections'. Fix missing '$USER' global when editing the course settings. Important: This is still a 'release candidate' because of 'Subsection support' which has been incredibly difficult to support to the extent that I've had to wave a 'white flag' and remove the 'numsections' setting.  The course format API has been broken apart into so many interconnected small pieces (each tending to have separate PHP, JS and Mustache files), https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/plugintypes/format#format-output-classes-and-templates and https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/plugintypes/format#the-course-editor-structure , that it is difficult at times to understand and keep in working memory what is going on and where a given element of functionality is implemented to the extent where it can be overridden and changed.  Thus the format will now operate as 'Topics' does in terms of number of sections management.  Collapsed Topics was only ever designed to operate on sections and as such sees sub-sections as different entities not related to the number of sections in a course.  Collapsed Topics will now not allow you to have as many 'Sub sections' as you want - as was in V405.0.2 - due to increased chance of course restore failure, see: MDL-84874 .  Additional tracker issues of interest for this are: MDL-84038 and MDL-84291 . Because of the removal of 'numsections', this has an impact on backup and restore, which I've tested.  However with such a change brings risk and a greater chance of error, thus I cannot stress enough that you MUST test and be sure that the format works as expected before it goes anywhere near a production server .  I found with the Grid format that once 'numsections' was removed that it was tricky to go back, and therefore it would be unlikely even with the flexibility I like of being able to set the number of sections both as a course setting and add / remove in the course itself. I have refactored the whole toggle state preference JavaScript such that it no longer uses YUI.  This I hope will help to keep the format going for many years to come as older technologies are removed from core. Note: Always install on a test server to confirm that the format does what you want it to do before updating or installing on a production server!  And as this release could contain bugs and so I strongly recommend that you check on a test server first!  Not sure how to set one up?  Then look at the 'Installer packages' on https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/ . Ensure that you have multiple backups of all data before using.  Please report any issues. i.e. 'bugs' with this release ONLY here.  Before doing so please read 'Reporting issues' on the 'Information' tab on the course format 'Settings' under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Course formats' -> 'Collapsed Topics'. If you find this post useful, then please mark it so. Thank you, Gareth",

When we initially set it up, we did not enable this feature through the advanced features accessible to the administrator. We have been using our courses for a couple of years, what might we expect would occur if we enabled the feature now? There are students enrolled in our existing courses at all various points of progress. We could set up new courses within our current Moodle after we enable activity completion and have it available for future students. I just don't want to throw a wrench in our existing courses by enabling the feature now. Would enabling activity completion thru advanced features not affect the current courses unless I tried to turn on activity completion in each courses' settings? In my research, I could not find a clear answer to whether I also need to be concerned about a default setting that might influence what is already existing. We are using the clean theme I believe (one of the installed versions, not an add-on). I am using Internet Explorer 11. Thank you for your time. Sandy",

And be clear about the requirement--you must have 80% on each activity AND 80% overall.  Sometimes students try to game the system. Most activities have a grade by default (either one assigned on completion--quiz, scorm , lesson --or one you give manually--forums, glossary or assignments).  You can set restrictions to require specific scores/completion before the next one is done as well.",

Important: Please read my previous release post ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=467617 ) if you want to know why 'numsections' has been removed. Always install on a test server to confirm that the format does what you want it to do before updating or installing on a production server!  And as this release could contain bugs and so I strongly recommend that you check on a test server first!  Not sure how to set one up?  Then look at the 'Installer packages' on https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/ . Ensure that you have multiple backups of all data before using.  Please report any issues. i.e. 'bugs' with this release ONLY here.  Before doing so please read 'Reporting issues' on the 'Information' tab on the course format 'Settings' under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Course formats' -> 'Collapsed Topics'.

The core command line is documented here: https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Administration_via_command_line - perhaps you could write a local plugin that has a cron cleanup task - https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Administration_via_command_line#Scheduled_tasks - that progressively deletes the courses in a category using similar code to '/course/delete.php'.

          "Text": "Hi everybody- I'm a Moodle newbie but I am very impressed so far. I'm a firefighter with a large urban fire department, with a large MS Access training records database kept at the fire academy. My current job involves a ton of work just to keep this monster working, and I will move us over to Moodle, with a just little help. We (me and the academy's summer intern - a CS grad student, thankfully) have our basic setup running nicely on a windows box, with phpmyadmin, mrbs , and php acceleration added in. The intent is to begin with Moodle as a central record-keeping tool AND a repository for course presentation materials and handouts. Once it does that convincingly, and with less effort than what we have to do now, we'll expand into all the other features. So far, works GREAT. Our difficulty is this: the academy training right now is recorded in MS Access with three key fields: userid, courseid, and completion_date. The course duration varies from 23 weeks down to single day seminars. The thing to keep in mind is the focus on the completion date - the \"finish date\" which we use to build each FF's master training record and produce college-type transcripts . (We are also a credit-granting agency with a full-time registrar.) In terms of enrolling students, the six month courses and other \"longer\" courses work fine in Moodle as is. A student would only enroll in such a course once. The single-day training that we have is repetitive, though, and is scheduled in terms of firefighting units , not individual members/students. We know Engine 1 is coming for the drill, as scheduled, but the members working that day will be enrolled/recorded as trained only after they get here. A firefighter may come four times in a year for the same drill - \"Tactical Unconscious FF Removal\" or \"Self-Rescue Rope Refresher.\" Upon completion of the drill, a hand-written sign-in sheet goes to the data-entry person. Most firefighters and their officers will repeat at least one of the single-day drills during a two-year period. They are essentially re-taking a one-day class. We've looked at groups , restoring courses, etc. and haven't found a solution yet. (One particular drill/class is conducted 300 days a year, and most training is conducted at least once a month.) The solution we desire will let the data-entry person, who is swamped, enroll anyone off of her backlog pile, some of it more than a month old, as well as the current 'today' students. It will let specialty instructors build attendee lists for future multi-week classes that are offerred 4x a year. And, eventually, regular instructors in the classroom will sign in to Moodle and before starting their refresher training Powerpoints or printing their new handouts, they can go around the room and take names/enroll students right from the podium. In short, we need to enroll students in a course, then find and enroll them again in a new \"section\" of the same course next week or next month, and we need to back-fill 200,000+ training records across 20,000+ active/retired members within 400+ current/archive courses. We've been tempted to add a training_date to the role_ assignment table, then modify the assign.php/html files so when assigning the role 'student' for a course, the user will have to pick a 'section_complete_date.' (the date of training for one-day courses, and the \"finish date\" for multi-day or multi-week training.) As we say over the radio, \"Can anyone advise...?\"",

There is many teachers an every teacher have own course (may have more than one course). I can take his id, name, but i don't know how i can take only the course/courses that manage (course id, shortname, fullname). There is and many student that belong to some courses. But I don't know how to take the course id, shortname, fullname of the courses that user belong when i heve his id. The idea is when some student take test in external database is saved his result. Then when some teacher log into my system, I take his id and when he go to view the results from tested students to view only the results ot students that belong to his course. To do that i have to know the course/courses managed by the teachers and the courses that students belong to. Thanks P.S.: I hope to understand what i am trying to tell you.",

I work for a K-12 STEM education organization. We offer classes in a traditional hands-on setting. Our website allows parents to register a student for classes (courses) that we are currently offering, so they need to see the course name, date and time it will be offered. We also provide age requirements and cost. Please see the way we list our information below. I'd like to know if I can customize Moodle courses to accept date, time, age, and cost, and if the Moodle Available course page can display similar information. We do not offer any online courses at this time. Thank you!

That would certainly be the easiest, I think. Although you are not providing online courses as such, bear in mind that Moodle is alos used by many institutions to support face-face teaching, as a means of sharing information (giving out course materials, providing announcements), enabling online collaborative work as class/home activities (through forum discussions, wiki activities and many others), and/or assessments (self-marked quizzes, submitted work, etc).

Since then the course format API has been changed drastically and therefore won't (I extremely suspect) work on Moodle 4.5. Flexible was developed from the Grid format by me (funded) as you can see here: https://bitbucket.org/covuni/moodle-format_flexible/commits/branch/master . To make Grid work with the changed course format API, I needed to rebuild it from scratch. This was not trivial. However, the only ways I can see technically to bring Flexible forward would be to repeat the same process from the current Grid format, or replicate what Grid currently does not have that Flexible does. If I were to do this (the later), then again, my time would have to be funded.  For the former would depend on what 'Jez H' would like to do with the format and take things from there.

I used to work for a UK university and we were using flexible course format and I really liked it. I am open to other suggestions. I see that there is a theme plugin called 'Adaptable\". Would this theme provide similar functionality? Is there any other theme / course format similar to flexible that would not require so much work at the start? I liked flxible option as it provided nice clear, single section view that worked well on different mobile devices. If there is any format / theme similar to flexible format, please can you advise me? I must say that the university I now work in does't provide much support so it would be great if I could just download readily available plug-in? i miss using Moodle and would like to get started in the university I work in now. I will be really gratefulf for your help. Best wishes, Joanna",

My time for such would have to be funded. You could install both on a test server , look at what documentation is out there and then see what they do. With Adaptable extra functionality for sponsors, that is subject to change and can be understood for a specific version by what has been indicated as not available in the theme settings (italic text / disabled).  There is guidance that I issue when contacted directly when you're using the theme. If you wanted me to 'revive' the Flexible format then the time scale depends on my workload and what I may encounter along the way, as it's bespoke development - normally a certain amount of hours spread out over days etc.  Cost wise, certainly a three figure sum in GBP, possibly a low four figure sum.  With \"And would you advise going this route for someone with little support.....locally.\" then I advise to seek out and get local support.

So! I assume I need to edit the renderer or the format. I've had a bit of a look through the code in other formats, but I haven't yet figured out how I can stop the page from rendering the topics. What's the best way for me to do this? Or am I really best just hiding everything and being done with it? Thanks! Louise",

When you say 'creates a section' do you mean actually create it or unhide it from the students?  As when I was teaching I wanted to prepare as much as possible and then only make it available when I wanted it to be so.  Also, I preferred semi-manually as often I would repeat lessons over different days and being ICT other things like Citizenship / events / exams etc. would break the sequence for one particular class so having an automated system would have made this tricky.  I tended to stick with having a reversed weekly format as ICT was only taught for one lesson per week at KS3.

          "Title": "Add custom css classes per course",
          "Text": "I was wondering if there is out of the box, without \"hacking the core\" or finding another plugin, a clever way to achieve what I need : For the moment, if I use the assignment activity in SOME courses (not all, but several. 5 at the moment but it will increase), I have to add about 25 css rules to hide/display/modify the appearance. In my Fordson theme, I have to add .course-X .gradingform_rubric .criteria, .course-Y .gradingform_rubric .criteria, .course-Z .gradingform_rubric .criteria {display:table} .course-X #rubric-advancedgrading, .course-Y #rubric-advancedgrading, .course-Z #rubric-advancedgrading{width:100%} and many more of the same (or other fancy scss loop that generates in the end the same bloated css) The idea would be to be able to add at the course level one (or rather several) custom classe(s). I could see it as an input text in Course management in the section Course format or Appearance. Doing that, I would be able to add only ONCE in my SCSS : .MYCUSTOMCLASS .gradingform_rubric .criteria{display:table} .MYCUSTOMCLASS #rubric-advancedgrading{width:100%} ... I don't need (and want) to use course theme or other, because this case in point would not be matched at all : If I need ONLY 2 custom modifications for 2 activities , I would need maybe 3 themes (which is overkill anyway), one for both modifications and one for each modification, otherwise, I could stay with all the css. The custom course field are not meant for css purpose. I think anyone could see the improvement in term of size/speed of loading and cache to refresh once versus each time a new course needs it. And also, it would be very versatile : It could be applied to any ressource or activities (if css targeting is right or possible) it could be used in conjunction with javascript , without the need to also duplicate the code Thank you in advance, if you have any clue",

          "Text": "Thank you Gareth, to take the time to answer, even by a question. I hoped my explanation was complete. It maybe wasn't explicit enough : As an instance of use, som teachers want to change the appearance of the grading grid in assignment. For that, I have to add about 20 css rules per course where it is needed. So, if it is needed only in 5 different courses, I have to generate 100 css rules. As moodle goes, I have to target them with course-id from the body class. .course-2512 .myrule1, .course-2140 .myrule1{somerule} This is only one example of the overbloated css I need to add. I could be asked to do the same for the display of quiz result, or forum posts... The point are : these modifications are not applicable to all the activities / ressources, and not in the same courses. In some course, I could have to do styled Quiz, classic Forum, styled grading, and in other classic quiz, styled forum, and classic grading, and so forth. I am still for the moment using Moodle 3.9, and as far as I searched, there is no simple way ( = natively from moodle, without a plugin) to do it. If my explanation is clear, do you have a suggestion to help me prevent from having a megabyte css file, and endless requests for adding new css lines.",

Use SCSS instead (in the theme 'scss' setting), that has a syntax that will help with the repetition.  Thus you can have a long list of course classes with then the modifications within, something like: \n```text\n.course-X, .course-Y, .course-Z {\n    .gradingform_rubric .criteria {display:table}\n    #rubric-advancedgrading{width:100%}\n}\n```\n sort of thing.  This is off the top of my head and totally untested!  I realise that this is similar to what you're saying, but I don't think there is any other way without code changes, as t o get 'MYCUSTOMCLASS' etc, into the body classes for a given course will need code changes.

Always install on a test server to confirm that the format does what you want it to do before updating or installing on a production server!  And as these releases could contain bugs and so I strongly recommend that you check on a test server first!  Not sure how to set one up?  Then look at the 'Installer packages' on https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/ . Ensure that you have multiple backups of all data before using.  Please report any issues. i.e. 'bugs' with this release ONLY here.  Before doing so please read 'Reporting issues' on the 'Information' tab on the course format 'Settings' under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' -> 'Course formats' -> 'Grid'. If you find this post useful, then please mark it so. And finally a request from me.  Please kindly don't ask when there will be a version for Moodle 4.5.  I won't be able to given you an answer as each upgrade faces different problems.  One will be developed in the fullness of time, but there is no fixed date.
