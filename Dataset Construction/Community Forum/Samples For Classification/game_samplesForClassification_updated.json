In the Hangman game I built a glossary with 10 words without spaces and without special characters, and in the Hangman activity settings I indicated to use 10 words from the glossary. Some words, however, appear multiple times, while others do not appear. The same happens with the Millionaire: I set the quiz with 15 questions and in the Millionaire activity I select No in the \"Randomize questions\" field. Some questions appear multiple times and others are never presented. This creates confusion when the solution to the games is proposed in plenary. Is there some setting to use to avoid this problem? I use version 2024-12-05 on Moodle 4.1.4+ Thanks in advance for the answer.",

          "Text": "It sounds like you're trying to add questions to a crossword puzzle, but you're getting stuck in the question bank and not being able to add them to the game. Let me guide you through the process: Create or open a crossword puzzle : Make sure you're in the crossword section and have either started a new puzzle or opened an existing one. Access the question bank : In the crossword editor, there’s typically an option to view or manage the question bank. This is where your stored questions live. Select questions from the question bank : Once you're in the question bank, look for a way to either choose or add questions to your current game. Depending on the plugin, this might involve selecting individual questions or importing them into the puzzle. Add questions to the crossword : There should be a button or option to add the selected question to the grid. This might be labeled something like \"Add to Puzzle,\" \"Insert into Grid,\" or simply “Use in Game.” Review the crossword grid : After adding your questions, check that the clues and answers are showing up correctly in the grid, adjusting if necessary. Save and play : Once you’ve added all your questions and clues, save your puzzle and start playing! If you're not seeing an option to add questions to the grid, it might be a specific feature or setting of the plugin you're using. It might help to check the plugin’s documentation or reach out to the support team for more detailed instructions. Regards, ovaroms.com",

I have been looking at the vast array of excellent available plugins trying to find one that does what I want, but so far have not been able to. The scenario is that I want to display a ladder where Avatar one appears on the left and Avatar two appears on the right. Each Avatar moves up or down their side in response to the answer to a player selected question, selected from pre-existing possibilities. Ideally the player would be able to select which Avatar they wish to play as. An example of how this could be used would Avatar 1 would be Aircraft Passenger, Avatar 2 would be Cabin Crew If the ladder is showing how to maintain calmness in a aircraft Avatar 1 question can I have a drink please. Avatar 2 responses a/ Yes certainly b/ NO! If the player selected b then the Avatar 1 and 2 would move up their sides of the ladder towards disruption at the top. If the player selected a then they would both stay where they were. the next question would again move them up or down the ladder as a result of their response. Does anyone have any suggestions of a plugin that would allow this? Regards Paul",

In previous 2.0 version the module worked great. Now in the new 2.5 version, we're able to add the chosen game, select all options, but then after clicking on \"save and display\" we're forwarded to the front page (\"My home\" in our instance). We've worked on it for few weeks but at the end been told that's something with the server sharing options, but the former 2.0 Moodle  was installed on the same server as well....so probably there is something else I have 2 questions: a. why this happens?  b. if we install former version of game module for Moodle 2.0 - will it work with 2.5 Moodle?

Unless I'm mistaken, and hopefully I am, you will need some outside tools to help. For example If you want to present and demonstrate the software to your students in action, you could use recordmydesktop or similar software, upload the video to youtube, then link it to your moodle course. I also would to here from others who have more experience in something similar. I think the key to all of this is format compatibility.",

The problem is solved but we still don't know why it happened.  I have a suspicion that the glossary may have been created with cut/paste from word and the creators may not have cleaned the HTML out.  Sometimes the html from word is pretty ugly.  The only thing I can think of is that there is something weird in the glossary html that when it got pulled into a game it freaked out the whole module.  I have no idea what sort of HTML could do that but it's the only idea I have.  I'm thinking of cleaning up their glossary (apparently I'm an on-line maid) but haven't gotten the chance.",

When a student enters a course they are placed in a group.  For the purpose of the games module they will all see the same glossary.   However students in group A would like to work with a specific category of the glossary while other groups have there own categories.  All in the same course.   It would also be very useful if when a student from category A reaches a level of competency they are automatically moved up to a higher level of challenge. The games module is a credit to you and I congratulate you on your exceptional efforts. John",

I thought there is a standard way to implement group support: Almost all the core modules and many contributed modules support groups, so that if a module ( both Content or Activity ) is added to a course that has groups and groupings, you can define access and/or visibility for the module in the interface for editing the module. If your module supported groups (and, by the way, support for Grade category would also be great!), there would be a section under editing the module (the interface where you choose what game to use, where questions are taken from, game specific settings, etc.) called \" Common module settings \" It would have boxes and choices Group mode Grouping Available for group members only Visible ID number Grade category As far as I know (and the title for the section is Common module settings, after all) this is standard interface/parameters for modules. If you look at the Edit/Settings page of any core activity, for example a Quiz, you will see what I mean (you may have to click the \"Show advanced\" button to see all the options I listed above). I hope you will implement this, as it is a standard feature for Moodle modules and one that we rely heavily on, as I mentioned in my original post. We really love these games, so it would be a shame if we can't use them! Best, T",

A question regarding the phone joker: Is it possible to write my own text to be displayed as joker? It would be cool to adjust the joker to the acutal question. Even better: Would it be possible to play a mp3-file as joker to make the \"game experience\" more real? Another question regarding the questions: Is it possible to allow a feedback after an answer? The questions allow a feedback, the millionaire-game doesn't. Can this be enabled? It would be nice, to explain correct or wrong answers to the students. The super feature would be to show a movie-sequence or play a mp3-file as feedback. Is this possible in any way? Thanks a lot for your help!! Thomas",

Does anyone know of a version of the game module that will work with a 1.8.8 moodle. I have managed to install a version on my 1.8.8 but blank pages were produced when visiting the activity. Also installing it broke my moodle cron job, which took a few days for me to nootice. Forum posts not beiung sent, courses not being backed up, eek.. Turns out it was the some code in the game module preventing the cron. I have looked through the CVS and old downloads on forums and cannot find a version that works.

I installed the latest version of this Game plugin on Friday (31st July) - it setup the database tables ok, but seemed to break the Admin > Notifications script on moodle (admin/index.php now redirects to admin/upgradesettings.php even after tables have been setup successfully, and upgradesettings gives lots of feof() and fread() errors implying it's trying to open files which aren't there - but doesn't tell me which files grr). Is it possible this version of game left some garbage which moodle can't handle? Our moodle is 1.9.4 - I installed it just fine onto my local 1.9.1 installation months ago just fine, so has something changed? I've been through your database setup code and it seems ok...

          "Text": "Dear David Hicks, Thank you for your response. The game you reference is vs the computer. I would like to have students play each other, but propbably not live - asynchonously. There are some others online though it seems. I was thinking of using university students but perhaps even giving small cash prizes! The initial impetus for wanting this sort of functionality is because games are used in cultural psychology e.g. in the work of Yoshio Yamagishi http://www.istc.cnr.it/T3/map/cells/env-soc.html He finds that Japanese and Americans play games similarly until the strategies of other players is a secret. Then Japanese play more un-altruistically, due to lower levels of generalised trust, he argues. I thought that the protection vs. promotion mechanism \"nickel\" experiment here http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Psych407/Takeshi_april3.pdf might work well in a game theory paradigm, using instead of nickels, some sort of display of trust, like the points at ebay. It would be predicted that Americans would be motivated to increase (promote) their \"trust points\", but that Japanese would be more motivate not to allow their trust points to decrease (protection). As well as just a game with payoffs, I would really want some way of displaying a players past behaviour. But it sounds like it would cost about 3000 dollars to program. And I already have one experimental psychology module, the TUI to keep up. Tim",
