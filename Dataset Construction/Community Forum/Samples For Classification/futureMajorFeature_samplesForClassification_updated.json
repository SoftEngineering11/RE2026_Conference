          "Text": "Hello Moodlers, We have been doing some ground work research on Double Marking and other complex marking workflows for https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-64118 as we set out to do last summer. We are now at a point where we are able to share our progress and invite potential collaborators to join us. We have completed: Market research First prototype of  basic \"open\" double marking in core Assignment initial engagement with HQ Here is a demo of the prototype: Video From here, we are looking to take an iterative approach Step 1: - “open ”Double Marking with Marker allocation - joint feedback, separate grade, manual feedback agreement -> this is what the current prototype delivers. Step 2 - Improve Marker Allocation by moving to a dedicated page - Sample Marking (only some are double marked) Step 3 - Expand double marking to have parallel independent Feedback options. - Make mark & feedback agreement a sub-plugin type (would allow institutions to implement their bespoke quirky rules) - with a potential output being Marker allocation - full double blind marking Fundamentally, step 3 is where all the good stuff will come together. In particular the agreement plugin framework could allow for bespoke meanings to what is expected from marker 1 vs marker 2, automation of agreement of feedback via AI, allocation of second markers based on first marking, etc. Since Moodle needs to support many different use cases, this ensures the bespoke complexity can be built in pluginland but Moodle can provide the framework for it. The speed at which we can progress this will entirely depend on how many collaborators come forward. We are looking to follow a similar model to the Quiz project. If you would like to get involved, please reach out to me at a.spark@ucl.ac.uk",

          "Title": "Proposal: Improve Core Quiz Notifications (mod_quiz)",
          "Text": "Proposal: Improve Core Quiz Notifications (mod_quiz) Hi all, We recently developed a local plugin to enhance the quiz open notifications sent to students, and I’d like to suggest improvements that could be implemented directly in Moodle core to make these notifications more accurate, configurable, and informative — without requiring a custom plugin. Current Limitations in Moodle Core Notifications go to all users with mod/quiz:attempt: This includes teachers, managers, and other non-students — even if they are not the intended audience. No role-based filtering: Core has no built-in way to restrict notifications to only student roles (e.g., role ID 5). Fixed 48-hour notification window: Moodle currently hardcodes a 2-day window (DAYSECS * 2) before the quiz opens, with no way to configure it. No admin UI for notification settings: There is no place in Site Administration where you can configure quiz notification behavior, delay, or targeting. No way to customize the email content: Administrators or developers cannot add custom HTML or plain text (e.g., exam preparation instructions) to the outgoing notification. Group restrictions may not always be respected: While availability restrictions exist, it’s unclear whether notifications fully respect group-level access (e.g. \"Must match group A\"). Suggested Improvements for Moodle Core Add role filtering for quiz reminders Let administrators limit notifications to specific role IDs (e.g., students only), avoiding unnecessary messages to staff or lecturers. Add a configurable \"days before\" setting Replace or override the current hardcoded 48-hour window with an admin-configurable value (e.g., 3, 7, or 14 days before). Respect group access restrictions in reminders Ensure the quiz reminder system uses core_availability::filter_user_list() or equivalent to only notify students who truly have access based on group rules or availability conditions. Support content injection into the message Provide a way for site admins to append HTML or plain text content to reminder emails (such as setup instructions, policies, links). Expose developer hooks or override points Allow developers to modify or extend the quiz reminder behavior (timing, roles, content) without needing to override core classes like notification_helper. Real-World Use Case We had the following requirements in a real academic environment: Notify only students (not teachers or staff) Respect group restrictions (e.g., \"Must match group A\") Send the reminder exactly 7 days before the quiz opens Include custom HTML instructions in the email: \"Complete Exam Setup\" \"Install Google Chrome\" \"Room Scan required\" \"Review the Examination Policy\" To achieve this cleanly, we developed a local plugin. But these improvements could greatly benefit all Moodle sites if supported directly in core. Would love to hear if this is being considered for a future roadmap, or if there’s interest in extending the mod_quiz notification system to make it more robust and flexible.",

The logic of using this capability to decide who gets the message is correct. (If your role setup is different, I recommend you reveiw it.) The content of the message is a language string. Thefore you can customise it using Language customisation . The groups thing was just a bug, and I think it got fixed: MDL-84327 . I think that pretty much only leaves making the time-perion customisable. For me, the issue is not just the 2 days, it is the built in assumption what all quizzes with a close date have an open date. I tried to point out that was a false assumption before this got implemented, but I was ignored.",

          "Text": "Thanks for the thoughtful response! You're absolutely right that mod/quiz:attempt is the correct capability to use in principle — but in practice, many institutions (like ours) have custom or extended roles for assistants, delayed students, learning support, etc. Some of those may also inherit that capability. We’ve since corrected our role config, but having optional role filtering or exclusions could help prevent over-notifying unintended users — especially for large institutions with complex role hierarchies. As for language customization — yes, for static strings it's great. But our use case required injecting reusable HTML footers with exam prep instructions, policy links, etc., which aren't feasible to manage through the language system alone. A plugin hook or dedicated message property would offer clean extensibility here. Regarding the group filtering — thank you for confirming MDL-84327 fixed it! We've verified that it's working as expected.",

This feature would streamline the workflow by eliminating the need for external tools and provide a more seamless experience for all users. One of the primary use cases is the submission and review of 3D models. Students would be able to upload 3D objects, such as FBX files, as part of their assignments, and teachers could view and interact with these models directly in Moodle. Additionally, the feature would support interactive feedback, allowing teachers to comment on each submissions. This feedback would be visible to students within the platform, enabling them to take actionable steps to improve their work. Grading would also be simplified, as teachers could assign grades based on predefined rubrics, which could include criteria such as topology, texturing, animation quality, or adherence to project guidelines. The feature would include an open source 3D viewer integration within the moodle grading view, enabling the use of a lightweight, web-based 3D viewer capable of rendering FBX, OBJ, and GLTF/GLB files. This viewer would offer basic navigation tools like orbit, pan, and zoom, along with support for common rendering modes such as wireframe, shaded, textured views and animation playback.",

I suppose that when OS’s don’t have viewers, it is unlikely that web applications, like Moodle, will have viewers. Moodle lacks a viewer for the more common MS Office files. So, from my experience, what you are asking for will likely not happen for a while unless you can develop the viewer yourself. However, Moodle does provide an excellent alternative to grading uploaded files of any type if this is what you are trying to do. When I have students submit files, like Excel or Visio, I can download them in mass, view them with my MacOS viewer or from within an application, and use Moodle’s CSV files to enter grades and comments, then upload these CSV back into Moodle’s gradebook. Nope, you can’t “mark-up” these files unless you convert them to PDFs or graphics, but I prefer to enter comments into the csv file. If you prefer to use Moodle’s Assignment grading interface, you can still open these files in their application and",

Institutions that use Moodle for computer based assessment but want a paper fall back. Remote printing of assessments. Benefits I\nknow of no product that will assist the lecturer to prepare paper\nassessments, store the results in a gradebook, assist with reporting,\nand final outcome calculation. This will reduce the workload of the lecturer. Will provide a mechanism to share question banks. Ease of question creation and administration. Workflow Create questions as normal but also store the question in Latex (a tool like Pandoc [ https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html ]) can be used. Create questions that are meant to be printed (for example crossword) Create\nassessment as normal, but filter to only use printable questions. And\nif moderation / external marketing will be done, set flag. Format the output with the Latex Exam class ( https://latex-tutorial.com/typeset-exam-paper/ || https://ctan.org/pkg/exam ) or something similar Add any additional pages required (for example: formula sheets) If students are going to mark on bubble sheets generate the bubble sheet with a barcode for the assessment ID. Decide\nhow many variations you need (You will use variations when you have\nstudents in rows and you want to prevent wandering eyes) Print\nthe assessment(s) master and memorandum. Add barcode to the assessment\nmaster to track at which workstation, and when it was printed. Students write the assessment / mark the bubble sheet. The exam papers are marked. The bubble sheets are scanned using either a desktop or a dedicated OMR scanner and thereafter the data is uploaded to Moodle. Moodle marks the student responses and creates a data entry form that is used by the\nlecturer\n\nto capture the marks for the rest of the questions that were manually marked. If the moderation flag has been set, capture the moderated results. Store the grades in the gradebook. Generate reports (if required) Use the data in the gradebook as normal.",

          "Title": "Text editor analysis - Replacement of Atto",
          "Text": "Hi all, Let's talk about text editors, specifically Atto, and its future. Atto was designed as a lightweight, accessible, in-house editor for Moodle. While it has arguably achieved all of these goals, it was written nearly a decade ago, uses deprecated technologies, and is difficult to maintain. In addition: Moodle lacks the dedicated, in-house, knowledge to maintain a rich text editor\nMaintaining our own editor detracts from our core business goals of writing a kick-ass LMS to empower educators. The JavaScript world has moved on, but because Atto is built upon the now-deprecated YUI framework, it is increasingly difficult for us to add new features using modern language features. The library we use to normalise content selection (Rangy) was abandoned shortly after we started to use it, and has a number of known issues that detract from the experience of using Atto. Many of the language features that Atto is based around were experimental at the time of its original writing and never made it to the browser specification. Their continued use is not advisable. Atto is fine for editing short content, but when editing larger, or more complex, content it becomes more challenging. In particular, the undo/redo are problematic, and image handling is tricky. Possible solutions As with any problem, we have multiple solutions available - each has their own benefits and problems. To add to this, Moodle also has a number of restrictions which we place upon ourselves and which make any product selection more complex and/or prohibitive, in particular: Our plugin structure does not support files being parachuted into place. We have a strict plugin architecture which must be followed for community plugins to work. We do not use any server -side JS processing, such as WebPack. All of our JS is shipped with Moodle, or community Moodle plugins , as pre-compiled code ready for production. This prevents us from using any editor which tree-shakes code based on configuration, or whose APIs are mangled during their build process. We use our own Translation system ( AMOS ) We use our own dialogues, menu bars, and other UI features All software we include must be compatible with the GPLv3 license Rewrite Atto Perhaps the most obvious solution is to rewrite Atto with more modern JS practices (ES Modules) to match our other JavaScript content. In doing so we would also have to find an alternative to the Rangy library, and to the deprecated Document.execCommand() browser API. In an ideal world we would also maintain backwards compatibility with existing Atto plugins, but this would be extremely difficult given the chagne of technology (moving from YUI to ESM), the necessary change of underlying API, and the replacement of Rangy. The complexity of this project would be high, and Moodle would still be maintaining its own text editor, which is a huge distraction from our core business. Replace Atto Atto is not the only rich text editor available, and many other Open Source editors exist. These include editors like CKEditor, Tiny, and Quill. Others do exist but are not included here as they are opinionated in their design and/or abandoned. However, replacing Atto is not a trivial task. Whilst this approach would work around the issues of finding alternatives to Rangy and the use of deprecated browser APIs, it would not solve the issues of breaking compatibility with all existing third-party plugins; however it can provide a wealth of existing functionality with years of dedicated research and development instead. In many cases the current Moodle plugins can be replaced with existing plugins, negating the need to develop them again for Moodle. CKEditor The limitations above immediately preclude the use of CKEditor 5, which requires WebPack, and tree shakes the entire platform. It would not be possible for third-party developers to write plugins for multiple versions of Moodle, and a new compilation step would be required, and could only run when all possible plugins are in place. Configuration would not be trivial. QuillJS QuillJS is an editor framework. Whilst it can provide an editor without any further configuration, to do anything more Moodle would need to create all interfaces using our own existing components and integrate these with the QuillJS APIs. This is closer to the Replace Atto approach, but with a well-supported underlying editor API. This approach would still require all of the current overheads of maintaining an editor, albeit without most of the more complex editor parts. Tiny Tiny is a full-featured editor, which comes with a number of standard plugins which replace many of Atto’s standard features - these include standard formatting, font and colour selection, alignment and justification, undo/redo, word count, source-code viewing, table support, links, emojis, copy, and paste. Many of these features will work as-is for Moodle. Some use the Tiny modal and form frameworks and we would have to decide whether to use these in Moodle, or to rewrite them using the standard Moodle interfaces. This decision would not have to be made immediately. Other options I looked at a number of other possible editors, but these were either opinionated in their choice of technology (for example jQuery, specific Bootstrap versions), or were abandoned. What this means I have just opened MDL-75071 to look at migrating away from Atto in the near future. At the moment, given the above analysis, we are looking to migrate to the latest version of Tiny. Important: If you are aware of other editors which meet these criterion, and you feel we should include them in this consideration now is the time to mention them. At this time we are still analysis the work required to support Tiny 6 and are trying to consider items including: third-party plug migrations accessibility backwards-compatibility with older versions of Moodle The possibility of supporitng Tiny's own 'Premium' pluginset Best wishes, Andrew",

Accessibility of the editor's UI. Support for multiple languages. Paste clean HTML content from MS Word. Preferably open source or at least available under a site license, not a per-user license.

Atto was always intended as an accessible editor and we worked very hard to have it generate accessible content with an accessible UI. It currently meets AA and attempts to generate AA-compliant content (this is not easy). Sadly the browser APIs do not make this easy, especially without any normalisation layer included. As I understand it, TinyMCE 5, and the newly released TinyMCE 6 are significantly better than older version for accessibility both in terms of UI, and generated content.

I have not tried it in more recent versions of Moodle. Feel free to fork the project and continue its development. I have a PoC of ckeditor 5.x for Moodle, but it is not compatible with our direction. The latest version(s?) of ckeditor require webpacking, and the standard configuration performs a tree shake and minification. Because of the way that this is done, it becomes extremely difficult (I won't say the impossible because there will be a way) to write plugins for it unless you run the webpack with all plugins in place . It's also not easily compatible with Moodle's plugin and subplugin directory structure. The only way I could get it working and have it such that I could even attempt to write a plugin which is installed at run time was to include the entire source and all dependencies (some 300MB). As I say, if it were possible to run webpack at runtime, it would be fine, but we don't have NodeJS as a runtime dependency for Moodle.

We hope to also make it available in the plugins database for Moodle 4.0, and possibly 3.11 and 3.9 too (to be confirmed). Atto will remain the default editor for Moodle 4.1. From Moodle 4.2, Tiny will be the default editor, and we are considering moving Atto out of core and into the plugins database at the same time. This will depend on community feedback, and uptake from plugin developers. We do not accept any new YUI code into core, and have not done so for some time. We accept patches to existing YUI code and we strongly encourage migration of all non-atto YUI code to ES modules (ESMs) as quickly as possible. Right now we have too many things which are dependent upon YUI to know what the deprecation schedule will be. Once Atto has been removed, we will also be looking at updating the File manager, File picker, and Repository client. At this time we have 191 YUI JS files in core, plus some other locations which explicitly use YUI. After Atto's removal this will drop to 114. Some of those are compatability layers, or YUI itself, so the number is closer to 100. I know that the quiz code will shortly be updated to move to ESMs, and a number of other locations only use YUI code as part of their migration paths (course formats). The other big location using YUI is the EditPDF interface in the assignment activity, but this will require substantial work to migrate. Hope this helps, Andrew",

I'm sorry, but this is the reality. We *need* to make inroads to remove YUI and, as long as Atto is in core, I suspect it's highly unlikely that will happen. The deprecation policy is a little grey on its impact with regards the removal of plugins from core, and we haven't really applied it in that sense in the past. We removed a number of legacy plugins in Moodle 4.0 as a part of MDL-72046 and these were not subject to the deprecation policy either. I'm not sure why Atto is any different to those. Whilst Atto has been the default editor for a number of years, we've all known that it will be retired sooner rather than later due to its reliance upon YUI. We are trying to make it as easy as possible for developers to transition their plugins to support Tiny - for example, we are making Tiny available in the plugins database so that developers have a wider audience (hopefully back to Moodle 3.9 but TBC). I do understand where you're coming from, but I think there needs to be some give and take. Atto will be the default editor in Moodle 4.1 (LTS), which has a support end date of Nov 2023, and is security supported until Nov 2025. This the absolute latest we should consider supporting Atto to. We could (and I'm not saying we will) include it but not recommend it until Moodle 4.4, which has the same security support end date.

You keep taking about HQ 'supporting' Atto, as if HQ atually actively workes to fix the majority of bugs that are reported in Atto. I am sorry, that is just not true. HQ has ignored most Atto bugs for years. (I wonder how has fixed more Atto bugs? HQ or OU? Care to check?) That can continue, and, as I aready said, work on Atto can continue to ramp down. Just ignoring bug reports is very different from ripping it out. I can see your LTS point. So, that is an argument for removing Atto before 4.5. So, I think you should plan to icnldue it up to 4.4. If, by watching all the third-party atto_ plugins in the plugins DB, and montioring use of the various editors on a sample of Moodle sites (e.g. talk to partners), you later get the evidence that no sigificant harm would be done by removing Atto in 4.3 or 4.2, then make that case when you can prove it. But, for now, I think plan A should be to leave it in until 4.4.",

          "Text": "Again, I agree with Tim. Specifically, to address what Andrew says, \"We removed a number of legacy plugins in Moodle 4.0 as a part of MDL-72046 and these were not subject to the deprecation policy either. I'm not sure why Atto is any different to those.\" The difference is that almost every single piece of text and a lot of other content beside (video etc) in Moodle is and has been done with Atto since it came out. I don't think there is a more important tool for content in the whole system. Not a single one of the plugins in 72046 or related trackers are on a par with Atto for functionality: they were all old long before removed and they had mature replacements. They had long outlived a formal deprecation window. There is a long history, for good reason, of co-supporting key deprecated tools, e.g,. Legacy files (which still exists in 4.0), old Assignment (only removed in 4.0), both got a decade of extra life. I agree with Tim that leaving it until 4.4 is a realistic plan to give people the necessary time to work through the inevitable issues of moving content over. I would call it the minimum realistic plan because the history of replacing things that become legacy is pretty clear in my experience in the field: if the new replacement does not work flawlessly %99.9999 out of the box, it will not be adopted right away. People shy away from it and stick with what works until it starts to break or just disappears. And none of us really want to put people in the position of having to move to something that doesn't work well. When Atto arrived, it mostly replaced Tiny right away for new content not only because it was the default but was simple and worked well. Even then it took a while, a year or two. But meanwhile, old content stayed on: only with the revamping of old content every two or three years did Tiny use fade away. The cycle of content updating plays a key role. On large sites with thousands of courses, many on a two year or three teaching cycle, that won't happen in eighteen months. If Atto is available as a extra plugin, I can easily predict it will be installed widely to get around this issue - because keeping Atto around will be less disruptive to teaching and is easier than updating hundreds of thousands or millions of pieces of text content -- unless the replacement process is almost frictionless, which is really the key. If the new Tiny can meet the accessibility bar, that would be a good choice, since I know it can meet the advanced user needs I see in the technical teaching areas. However, the really great thing about Atto is it is simple and clean: it supports all the ordinary needs without cluttering things up. Ideally we would like to have two modes for the editor, basic and advanced. Right now, advanced users can simply swap to Tiny in the preferences. That is working pretty well as far as I have seen. Basic Atto works very well for everything else. If we had a \"Basic Tiny\" with the same set of features as Atto comes with, paired with a \"Advanced Tiny\" with all the buttons, that would certainly lower the inevitable friction in converting. This could be a preference or even a capability, but I think having one and only one editor with one view for everyone will present some challenges. Atto's great virtue is it is simple (but not too simple). And advanced users still have a way to get those extra tools. Keeping that dual ability would be really ideal.",

TinyMCE autosaves the content every time a savepoint is generated. That happens when the undo stack is modified - usually whenever you click out of the editor, use a button, or press the [return] key. Hope this heps, Andrew",

It may be that we are an outlier in that we lock-down student emails to institutional ones as this makes it easier for our HR systems however it would be useful to allow students and external staff to use a secondary alternative email if desired. Some staff work for other institutions and therefore have other email addresses and may wish to group their emails in one inbox; the option for a secondary email would be perfect for us. I'd not seen the ability to forward notifications to another email (other than the profile email) but that does sound useful I'll give that try in the first instance although it does seem to be a complicated, rather unintuitive method for students/staff to simply assign a secondary/forwarding email. I think most users would expect to see this field in their profile settings. Alternatively perhaps the best option would be have the current method but have the 'notification email' field also visible in the user's profile under their main email address making it easier to find and edit. It would also help to advertise that the feature exists.",

Maybe the framework could have an \"editing\" and \"non-editing\" view? In editing view, the row order would be preserved, along with drag and drop, but in non-editing view, you could sort and filter, and any department row with child departments would expand to show those departments. For filtering, we would have to decide on criteria?",

          "Text": "Hi Adam, there is an existing ticket for providing a refactor of the Departments UI, to support the same use case as yours—that is, support for managing a high volume of departments/positions, in particular to avoid issues with the Firefox browser at scale. The ticket was closed when a more modest solution was provided, and which you see in your Workplace site: after 200 departments, the drag/drop functionality disappears (which was the cause of the Firefox issue). I hadn't realized that the ticket for the original refactoring approach had been closed, but IMO it's a far more robust solution, and I have asked the Workplace product team to reopen it. While Jira tickets for Workplace are not open to the public, I can share the basic details of the solution: Only show the first X nodes (X being large enough to load all nodes in most of the cases) When there are more than X nodes, show a link or button to load the next X Drag and drop will continue working as it is now, but only on visible nodes Modal form Introduce a Parent field, with an autocomplete. The autocomplete should show the path beside the node name (as in users allocation) If path has more than N nodes, we use ellipsis (i.e. \"... / Node 2.4.4 / Node 2.4.4.2 / Node 2.4.4.7\") Search: Introduce a search functionality: an autocomplete to select a node in the hierarchy (as in the modal) When a node is selected, we only load the node and its children (node's sub-tree) There has to be a way to \"remove\" the filter I'm not sure if this approach would cover your particular use for wanting a visibility toggle?",

We’re looking to speak to: Educators in higher education (undergraduate) We’d also like to learn from some non-Moodle users, so if there’s someone in your network who isn’t using Moodle but might be interested in participating, feel free to share this with them. This is a great opportunity to share your own experience, and help us improve notifications, and Moodle in general. Selected participants will also receive a gift card as a token of appreciation.

It should be inferrable as the #anchor is based on the type of destination (e.g. section / module) and the identifier, so programmatically it should be possible to generate the redirect URL from something like editing an assignment to redirect to the course page with a \"#module-\" in it. *But* that requires all of the redirect links following an operation (where you want this to happen) to be updated...",

Messaging is a key part of the learning experience, and we know there's a lot that we could be doing better in this space. That’s where you come in. We’re conducting a research study to learn more about the role of messaging in the Higher Education learning environment , and we need your help. We’re looking to speak to: Students Educators Admins, and People who are responsible for evaluating and choosing an LMS at their organisation. If you’re interested in participating, please fill out this Moodle Research participant form . Feel free to share it with others as well. We’ll be conducting 60-minute virtual interviews between 8-24 August 2022. There’s a limit to the number of people we can schedule calls with during this time. However, if interest exceeds our capacity, we’ll provide another way for people who are interested to provide feedback. We look forward to learning from you!",

We are also seeing a range of reasons so it isn't always reflected in the total days late. Yes you can do it in rubrics but our institution prefers to use Marking guides. In Marking guides, can there be an optional criterion at the bottom of the setup page to add a negative mark criterion. So final grade is all the criterion added minus the negative capped at 0 marks. An advance option would to be able to use %,  So when marking a late student I could set it at 10% (plus comment) and the raw student score would automatically send to gradebook at 90% e.g. raw 60 out of 100, would become 54 out of 100. Leave it blank or at 0, no effect on the raw score.",

I have seen this lots of times on other sites, for instance when buying something as a \"guest user\" and then being prompted after the purchase to create a real account and so put in my name and password where my previous order has been saved for me.

To communicate what day they are on, I need to create a custom message that is restricted to only that group, but I need to have multiple copies, which ends up being very messy and time-consuming. If I could have something like: Welcome [firstname] to Chemistry 1000. You have been placed in the [prac_group] afternoon practical group and the [tut_group} morning tutorial group. Please contact your tutor [tutor_name] at [tutor_email] should you need any help.

I have found tracker issue https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47032 which says this is in development for 2.7, but not sure this is progressing. If keeping to the same Moodle instance, it wouldn't be necessary to duplicate file resources, just migrate the data minus user information. It can pretty much be based upon activity backup and restore in core Moodle with the right parameters set (don't copy users, grades, groups etc to the new instance). Should we have a new tracker?  Does anyone agree?  The Royal Veterinary College is too small to support and maintain hand built plugins, so it would be good to see this move into core.",

          "Text": "It would be really nice to have a \"Moodle Vital Signs\" feature for Moodle Admins. Administrators use Moodle but over time settings get changed, admins come and go, and Moodle itself upgrades with new functionality. It would be really nice for admins to have a feature which could do an assessment of a Moodle instance for core \"vital signs\" of Moodle health. Just like you and I go to the doctor and they check our temperature, weight, and blood pressure because these are core indicators of our health, we could do something like this for Moodle. I am not a Moodle expert, so I don't know what those vital signs would be. But use the body for reference. There are core 'vital signs\" for overall health that give you an indication of how the body is doing and whether there are any 'serious' indications this person may need to be 'admitted' for further analysis. There are also 'structural dimensions' to the human body. The spine, for example, needs to be in alignment and bringing alignment to the spine fixes a number of other issues. And then you move your way out to 'muscle tissues' / 'range of motion', etc. If we took an analogous approach to Moodle, we could develop some core 'vital signs' to check a Moodle instance for overall health and give Moodle admins a dashboard with these indicators to fix. Sort of like an SEO evaluation of your website?? And then perhaps there might be room for some of these other factors like 'structure', 'flexibility'/'range of motion', etc. Moodle admins and developers could probably start working through a list of suggestions. But imagine the usefulness of being able to run a 'vital signs'-like check on your Moodle instance and be given a report of things you can fix to improve it?? Todd",

For instructional designers and those who live and breathe Learning Management Systems, it is not too difficult to figure out the features of the settings and how they might best be used. BUT . . . for non-specialists (the vast majority of Moodle users), they really need more help and guidance. Feature Request: Create a Moodle Assignment Wizard So if an instructor creates a new assignment, they could click an \"Assignment Wizard\" button which would bring them through the settings for that assignment or quiz to set it up with what they want: Would you like to see a word count? Is this a summative or formative assessment? Do you want students to see the answers to the question right after they take it or after they finish the entire quiz? Do you want students to take the question over and over again until they get the right answer? How would you like that to be scored? Points off for wrong answers? etc. The point is that a wizard like this helps 'translate' the functionality of settings in Moodle and does a better job of teaching what is possible (instead of leaving it to instructors to click on question marks next to each setting to figure it out). I know it is a big ask, but I believe functionality like this would increase demand for Moodle.",

However, we had planned to build it within our plugin (which is an activity which has a lot of use cases). Your post made it clear to me, that an „activity creation wizard“ could be a thing. A number of activities come into mind that could benefit from this, e.g. Assignment Quiz Forum Lesson Database Each of them have „too many features“ (which is perfect for experts, but overwhelming for non-experts). What do others think? Is that something of value for teachers? We already have a plugin which makes creating courses easier (kickstart), so it would make sense for us to add such a wizard for activities. Cheers Stefan",

Hopefully a _really_ good wizard would (at the end of the process) also give you an option of seeing all the settings that it has configured for you (so as to be a useful learning exercise, rather than a prop that teachers are uncomfortable to move beyond). I like the idea of the wizard - but the really tricky part is to determine the right questions to ask, to split the features up in a way that works for the different use cases (because everyone will be able to come up with a list of the core, essential features of each activity, and everyone's list will be different). An extensible wizard that can be customised by local admin teams (via some sort of UI to edit every question shown and edit the outcomes - both in terms of activity type generated and settings configured), would be ideal, but one that started with a good, solid range of initial questions, so that institutions do not _have_ to customise it, for it to be useful. Thinking, as I type, an import/export would also be nice, to share good wizards with different institutions ... Just to be clear - I'm not here to volunteer to write this system - I have quite enough Moodle code to write in my day job! Besides, as I implied above, the code is probably the easy part, the hard part is the questions and the decision tree - that needs a lot of careful thought, research and user testing.",

As mentioned above, the first version of it could follow the same logic as kickstart (the course format): 1) The admin creates a number of activities pre-configured for the most important use cases. 2) The admin then creates a backup of this activity and adds it to the kickstart \"activity templates\" 3) The teacher can then open the activity chooser and a) either pick \"core naked\" activity b) or pick the kickstart activity, which acts like a \"wizard\" Within the kickstart activity, all activity templates, each with a description and instructions would be provided. The kickstart would then, instead of saving a kickstart activity, import the activity templates and the teacher can (optionally) configure it. In a future version, we could add the \"decision tree\" using questions like discussed in this thread. We currently work on a development (for another activity) which has 90% of the functionality, once we've completed that, we could wrap that within a separate activity easily, something like mod_kickstart I'll post updates about the developments here.

          "Text": "Hello everybody, Having in Moodle a video player side transcript that would be autoscrolling ald clickable, that would be great. In fact, about 6 years ago, a user was already asking for that here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=281372 As he already mentioned, this became very common in courses on EDX: when there is a video with some teacher talking, a transcript of what is telling is automatically scrolling on th side of the screen, and it is possible to stop the autoscrolling and click on a sentence to jump to the corresponding moment in the video. This is also possible on some streaming platform like Microsoft Stream and Youtube, it seems. I think it is just a little JavaScript trick, as for example illustrated on this web site: https://jsbin.com/bevehi/edit?html,css,js,output I am not a specialist and I can't make it work when I try the same code in a f ile resource , using a video and VTT that are stored in Moodle. Well, what is important here is that t would be nice to have it when we use a page resource and when we integrate the video player: having an option 'scrolling and clickable transcript on the side' would be great. All the best, Thierry.",

          "Title": "Feature Request > Moodle Glossary for Embeddable Learning Units",
          "Text": "Context : Currently instructors upload content for instruction to Moodle in various ways. These include uploading file folders for course resources, adding online videos to content pages, books, or lessons. Some upload files to a 'hidden module' and then use active links to link to them from various resources and activities . Problem: Course maintenance becomes a problem as instructors make changes. Did I change that in the hidden block? Or was that the file attached to the activity itself? The YouTube link is now broken in the video. Without doing a full, fine-toothed comb review of every single element in the course, there is no way to guarantee all content is fresh and up-to-date. This is time-consuming. Feature Request: What if it was possible to use Glossary Entries as Embeddable Content Units for your Moodle activities and resources? So imagine you could go to a Moodle Lesson , Moodle Page, Moodle anything, and simply 'embed' a content element from the Moodle Glossary (as opposed to simply 'linking' to it and pulling the student out of the activity / resource to the glossary). Here is the 'use case': Instructors could use the Moodle Glossary to create an encyclopedia of learning content designed the way they want it to look. And they could embed these within their Moodle Activities and Resources. When they want to update them, they simply update them in the Moodle Glossary. Think about the value of this for ongoing 'Course Maintenance'! An instructor or instructional designer would not have to go through an entire Moodle course line by line and though every activity. They could simply go through this Moodle Glossary and check for broken links, make updates, etc. I think there could even be secondary value for students studying for a Midterm or Final Exam, as they could look at the glossary, with its comprehensive content, to study for the exam?? Hopefully I am making sense, but I think something like this might be very useful for instructors. They could also use the tags to organize and filter their resources and use the comments to annotate them.",

          "Title": "Amazing Idea for Moodle - Course Review Functionality",
          "Text": "I developed \"Modular\" Course Design Reviews for our University organized by Areas of the Moodle LMS: Course Header (Welcome & Orientation) Main Course Page (Navigation & Clutter) Modules - Big Picture (Alignment with Outcomes ) Assignments - Individual Prompts (Rigor & Standards) Syllabus & Gradebook (Alignment & Accuracy) Media Check (Quality & Accessibility ) Each one allows you to answer 10-20 questions using branching logic on a Microsoft Form. I have it setup with a Power Automate flow to send the results by email to the reviewer. The advantages to this Modular approach to Course Design Review: You can delegate specific reviews to those with relevant expertise (e.g., Media Check by a Multimedia Specialist, Modules - Big Picture to an Instructional Designer) These shorter \"mini-reviews\" are easier to complete in one-sitting (compared to comprehensive reviews) Collating everything which needs to be reviewed for a particular \"View\" / \"Area\" of the LMS saves course reviewers time, as they can review all of it in that location. Here is what I want Moodle to be able to do: An Annotated Course Review Functionality based on Area of LMS The new feature would perform two functions: Function 1 - Based on Moodle LMS Role, would allow customizable questions to be created to evaluate that area of the course. This would allow for both a quantitative, multiple-choice like question (\"Meets Standard\", \"Almost Meets Standard\", \"Does Not Meet Standard\", \"Not Applicable\"). Users could make their own, but this functionality would be capable of generating a CSV file or report of some kind. It would also allow for qualitative, open-ended feedback questions . Function 2 - Both Quantitative and Qualitative feedback could be seen within each area of the LMS as \"annotated comments\" based on certain roles. So an Instructor and Instructional Designer role could see them but not students. They could use this as a checklist to clean up and make adjustments to the course based on these annotations and then delete them or mark them complete when addressed. So there would be a function which would tie customizable questions for feedback to a specific area of the course shell (e.g., Activity, Main Page, Module) and there would be another function which could capture that feedback as annotations which would show up for certain user roles in those areas of the course. What is the value of this feature to users of Moodle? The value is that instead of users of the LMS using external tools, methods, etc.  to do Course Design Reviews for Quality Assurance, this functionality could be integrated within the LMS in the areas where that feedback is relevant and may need adjustment / improvement. This also makes it possible for universities to choose their own, customizable review standards. So a university which wanted to use Quality Matters, could type in those standards into this based on the area of the LMS these could be identified. But another university could use OSCQR Rubric or create their own. This would be invaluable functionality and could really set the Moodle LMS apart from competitors which do not offer anything close to this type of functionality. I am also open to making the modular reviews I created open source so others can benefit from them and the community can improve on them. They could even be added as \"defaults\" to give end-users an idea of how best to use this functionality and  then customize it for their needs?? Bonus would be if it was also made possible to award a Badge or Certify a course based on a certain score for these questions!",

          "Text": "As an instructor and instructional designer, seeing bungled HTML content from students / faculty is frustrating (e.g, multiple sized fonts, awkward spacing, etc.). Because the text editor in Moodle prioritizes the local HTML of content in each text box, when students and faculty copy and paste from the web or word processors, Moodle retains awkward spacing, fonts, etc. The entire point of using Moodle as a Learning Management System is to streamline the experience of teaching and learning . Seeing bungled formatted HTML is, in my view, one of the most significant frustrations of end-users with Moodle. My web browser has a way to clean up content and strip away ads and content besides pictures and text and puts it into a clean, easy-to-read format. Is there a way to do this with a plugin for Moodle? Can we add this as a button? or code it to work better with existing web browser functionality which already does this? (for example, when looking at a forum post, Safari web browser can clean up the text for the very first forum post, but will not find or clean up the others). Any effort to make readability a priority would greatly streamline the end-user experience. I would love to see this find its way into Moodle 4.0. If there is already a solution, I apologize for not already knowing and would much appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction. Kind regards, Todd",

Option to export evaluation data, or to visualize them on graphs. Option to compare your evaluation to instructors' average or other specific instructors, within your course, or across all courses in general. option to make the evaluation mandatory by not allowing students to enroll into new subjects unless they completed the evaluations it would also allow survey that are not connected with any subject (e.g. student office, or the faculty in general) overall scores of courses and even instructors (optional) would be transparent - visible to students even to those who are not enrolled. Previous years' evaluation included, providing  opportunity to track a course's or instructor's (optional) development over time. survey question could be of various forms e.g. grading, drop down (who was the best prof?), short answer, long answer, etc. Option for managers (Course leaders, student representatives) to access every aspect of the results Any other suggestion?

It is not feasible to delete an already used scale or even do an recalculation if the scale had an error, since each plugin might include it's own implementation of scale. (And it will be impossible to find the tables a random plugin uses to store the scale setting) . Therefore we propose a new feature, so that scales can be marked as archived.  If a scale is marked as archived it must not be displayed on create of new activities or in the gradebook. For activities created before the scale was archived, it will still be possible to see the original and update other fields. Please share your input whether this a feasible approach.",

I'm sure anyone who thinks this through will understand why, and the potential impacts on learners of changing a Scale after it has been used! I do like the idea of archiving, or perhaps \"Locking\" a Scale. I use the word locking because it's consistent with the concept of locking a forum discussion. And yes, locking a Scale would be really good, if it could then not be used for new activities. Given this, it would makes sense to have a \"Replicate\" Scale option, to make a quick copy, before locking the old one.",

          "Text": "Looking behind all the discussions I had over the last months with clients one issue was mentioned very often: activity stream. Driven by other tools like (Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Microsoft Team, Totara Social) people are asking for activity streams as key feature for social activitiy in a platform.  I thought a lot about the idea and why it could make sense in a LMS. Corporate learning is more and more defined by an 70:20:10 concept. 70 % is learning on the job while being confronted with new requirements, making new experience, trial and error. 20% of learning is based on discussion with colleagues and managers, 10 % are formal courses organized by HR departments. A Learning Platform should support all types of learning at an institution. Lets think how Moodle can support this in the best way. Activity streams comes in focus when people are using Facebook, Twitter, Slack Micosoft Team. The common concept is that there is one location where all activities that happens are integrated and I can directly react. Some clients reported that using such tools activated a lot of people that were inactive in blog , forum or chat tools. In formal learning concept that has pros and cons: pro: better overview than only reading the number of new activities in dashboard per forum. easier reaction in course discussion con: formal learning needs concentration on a topic and it makes sense to go to the topic related course first. most learning will use learning paths The argumentation for informal learning will be different: pro: getting a quick overview about a lot of topics I'm subscribed to reaction with a few sentences should be easy its not required to be involved in all activities liek a course getting impulses for daily work are pushed in a activity stream con: If activity stream grows I will see only the lastest topics. I remember an extensive discussion from 2015 about Forums Blogs and Nature of Discussion here at Moodle.org I think we should discuss the Activity Stream idea also here. What do you think?",

          "Title": "Suggested features",
          "Text": "First of all thanks for your great work and effort to imporve and develop Moodle. My two cents, and things i think have to be added/changed would be: 1\n- Some kind of subtasks inside a task. ex: i have class with my pupils\nmonday, wednesday and friday. Then i open a task to be delivered on\nFriday as a limit date. It would be great to have three or two subtasks,\nwhere pupils should deliver their work ( what they ve done monday, what\nthey have done till wednesday and the final deliver). In this way\npupils where \"forced\" to work everyday and dont let the activity to the\nlast day ( and usually ask for more time to deliver it). Also would be\nnice in order to show to parents or inspectors about the work of a\npupil..... A partial solution would be create three different activities , but it would be more difficult to deal and then the marks.... 2\n- Attendance moudle as core of moodle. Is essential as a teacher to\nhave a proper attendance core module, where you can follow the pupil\nattendance, with some filters and graphics. I know theres a plugin, but\nmany administrators dont like to use them and i think is important\nenough to be a core-part of moodle. 3 - Some kind of\nteachers area, where i cant get info about past activities , with pupils\nwithout marks, any activity that has to be marked, activities that would\nbe closed in short period... 4 - An option that\nactivities that are hidden, would not appear in the gradebook. ex: i\nhave 10, 12 activities from other mates or other courses. I have them\nhidden to pupils and closed. In function of the pupils and when im sure,\ni decided to choose three activities. These ones are shown and opened\nto pupils. Then if i need to configure gradebook i dont want that the\nhole 10 activities would appear. In a big course with 60-70 activities\nis difficult to manage, when you only use or open 10-12. It doesnt have\nsense to have 50 activities hidden in the user gradebook ( specially\nwhen you want to watch pupils marks by rows) 5 - In the\ngradebook, to rename the total mark of a category. I made inthe\ngradebook another categoy ex: M9 - Uf2. Then i calculate the marks using\na formula for example. then i get a Total: ....Would be nice that i\ncould rename this and write something like \"Final mark of M9-Uf2\"\ninstead of total Which these improvements, moodle would be perfect to me.",

          "Title": "Import Grades: Fix Error Messages",
          "Text": "Importing grades is one of the places where some fixes definitely should be made. There are several annoyances in this one module: When uploading a file, the default file should be the last one that was uploaded (if any), and when you are selecting a file to upload , you should start in the same directory as the previous file. The \"Identify User by\" and Grade Item Mappings should default to the previous values (if any). IOW, if you have an assignment called \"HW1\", and last time, this grade was saved to \"Homework #1\", then \"HW1\" should get mapped to \"Homework #1\" by default. (This is especially annoying if you have half a dozen grade items to match up.) The Mother of All Annoyances: If the import fails, you get a generic error message (such as \"Supplied grade is invalid\", with nowhere to click to get more information). If one of your students registered late, and their number is not in the Moodle course, this happens. At the very least, Moodle should identify the student whose grade is invalid. Better yet would be to identify the student and the grade. Even better is to find all invalid grades and report them, so you can fix things all at once. As things stand, you have to delete the records for some of your students and then repeat the entire import process all over again (and you encounter the first two annoyances again) to see if that group is okay. Doing this half a dozen times is enough to raise one's blood pressure. Provide an option to stop automatic recalculation of grades once grades have been uploaded. I have a program that does that already, and they get uploaded to Moodle.",

This is being worked on in MDL-46375 and documentation is\ncurrently a work-in-progress. Once this change has been integrated, it will allow developers to write\ntheir own storage backend for files currently stored in the Moodle filedir .\nPlease note that files currently stored in either the temp directory, or\nthe cache directory are not stored through this API, and must still be shared on disk between servers in a cluster. What this change does mean is that the filedir can be replaced with a range\nof alternatives. The most popularly suggested backend is Amazon's S3,\nhowever you could also write backends for systems including: Amazon S3; Rackspace Cloud Files; Ceph; FTP ; WebDAV ; etc. This change should not require any changes for developers or administrators as standard -\nwell, unless you're calling parts of the File Storage API which you\nshouldn't be ;) For developers wishing to implement a File System alternative, there should\nbe generally minimal work required. The new API has the concept of both local and remote file\npaths, with remote file paths beings consumed where possible. Any path using a standard Protocol Wrapper is accepted (or a standard path-on-disk). I hope to finish this change in the next week, but comments and queries are\nwelcomed as ever, Andrew",

Code using the file API will hardly have to change at all. The only remaining thing I am not sure about is whether different file system back-ends should be a full Moodle plugin-type in their own folder, with version.php etc. That is a bit more heavy weight. (Currently they are just one class file in a particular folder. Oh, and hopefully another file of unit tests.) However, if they were plugins, it would be easier for people to share them through the Moodle plugins DB. That might seem like a small thing, but actually, I think it is quite important. Anyway, thanks to Andrew for working on this.",

This piece of functionality was internally dubbed the \"Oh shit!\" button, short for \"Oh shit I accidentally deleted 45 minutes worth of work on an essay question and pressed next resulting in me losing all my work!\" I don't think the functionality is complete(Need to log events when a save is converted and when question responses are \"undone\") but it should be stable. The tracker for it is https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-56317 and I am working on the master branch and the 3.1 stable branch(what we use at my employer). The changes are quite substantive and involve modification of data mapper SQL statements, database indexes/columns, question behaviours, question attempts, question attempt steps, question usage, auto-save functionality include the return data etc. I appreciate any and all feedback as I am sure I have missed something and would probably feel rather awkward if everything passed without me having to go back and rework something I missed.",

          "Text": "Current issue The current content/activity navigational structure with high levels of linking is very disruptive to the learning flow.  This is compounded by inconsistent breadcumbs / left-navigation-menu behaviour. Request: I want to be able to present learning content followed immediately by a reflective activity/question.  However, because each activity needs to be on it's own separate page, the user has to stop the learning process and then figure out the hyper link - often separated from the learning material. The intermediate step of clicking into an activity needs to be removed (or provide an option to remove it). So a Moodle activity that would normally provided in the content area (by itself, on a separate page) would now be a block that could be sequenced together with other Moodle activity blocks. Example Change from: Page => Quiz => Page => Forum Change to: Page [+] Quiz [+] Page  [+] Forum Further thoughts I find the navigation disorientation is more significant and issue than the \"Death by scroll\" issue.  Scrolling can be managed to a degree through Subject Format, Completion tracking and Theme optimisation.",

Nor is using the lesson (which is just a self-contained activity and doesn't offer the full range of all other plugins).

          "Text": "I mentioned this on the general developer list, without drawing any comment, so I'll try here, even though it is not a MAJOR feature. There are many sets of constants defined against small sets of integers.  For example, completion/criteria/completion_criteria.php defines such a set.  File cc1 excerpts the relevant definitions. These constants are ubiquitous in the database tables, and they obscure the meanings. To determine the contents of such records requires manual cross-referencing with the code, as in this example from the contributed ad-hoc queries. CASE WHEN p.criteriatype = 1 THEN \"Self\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 2 THEN \"By Date\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 3 THEN \"Unenrol Status\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 4 THEN \"Activity\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 5 THEN \"Duration\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 6 THEN \"Course Grade\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 7 THEN \"Approve by Role\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 8 THEN \"Previous Course\" END AS criteriatype, If these constants change, the query will no longer work as expected, and may not work at all. I noticed this when I was trying to grasp some of  the intricacies of Moodle by looking at the install. xml files and making my own ad hoc db queries. It seems to me that this situation can be relieved, without impacting the integrity of the code by creating an ancillary table or tables that provide a mapping from constants to meaningful text:- the reverse of the definitions in the code. File cc2 shows an outline of the changes to the previous file.  The procedure as outlined would create an in-memory mapping as well as the database mapping, but that can be dispensed wth. Such changes can be made incrementally, gradually increasing the number of mappings.  I, for example, am looking for a way to automatically assign a grade to the simple completion or non-completion of a particular activity, so I could map the constants that are of interest to me.  Others, with other areas of interest, could extend the mappings. Is this of any interest to the developers?",

          "Title": "Option to enable write access for guests",
          "Text": "This is a thread to track discussions for MDL-56258 . Essence of the issue and topic of the discussion Currently it is not possible to allow write access for guests. This is due to a Moodle policy of never allowing guests write access to prevent spam and to minimize attacking vectors (eg. possibility of XSS by anonymous users, etc.). I understand the concerns about allowing guests write access but I think there are valid use cases to do so regardless. This brings me to the proposal of adding an option to enable write access for guests regardless to the security concerns. I state explicit that this should not be enabled by default. For all I care, we could \"hide\" this settings under the security section of the site administration and add warnings about the risks. The capability and role system we have is almost good considered. But it should be possible to use its complete power by allowing an admin to configure it completely to fit their needs. And not to restrict it. An admin should know what he is doing. Additionally to prevent misunderstandings, as long as this setting is not enabled the corresponding capabilities should not be displayed while editing the guest role (more specifically a role based on the guest archetype or the role that is selected for the \"Role of visitors\"). And additionally, maybe to initiate another (related) discussion The proposed workarounds of using the \"No authentication\" authentication method or using a dedicated user with public login credentials did not solve the problem completely. This users will of course also get the role defined with the \"Default role for all users\" setting (by default this is the authenticated user role). But due to the algorithm of checking capabilities (calculate the combination of capability settings of all roles the user has in a specific context ) it is not possible to give this dedicated user less capabilities than a normal user in system context but override this to explicit allow some specific things in a lower context. The prevent setting works just for overrides within the same role and prohibit setting can't be overridden (for a good reason). See the Override permissions wiki page for details. Maybe an additional setting \"between\" prevent and prohibit would be useful. But this needs another tracker issue.",

So, for example, the following is 'correct' behaviour: Create a quiz that allows 1 attempt, and which automatically gets marked as complete when a student has completed all their attempts. Student attempts the quiz and gets a bad mark - quiz is marked as complete. Teacher overrides the settings for that student, and allows them a second attempt. Because of the policy, the quiz is still shown as complete, but this is clearly not what anyone was expecting, and this was reported as a bug MDL-52722 . It looks even stranger if the quiz has a 'Grade to pass' set. Then, the quiz is not just shown as Complete, but Complete - failed. Is this enough to cause us to re-consider this policy?

          "Text": "Hello, Moodle's event monitoring system is nice but however when a teacher wants to add a rule he has a huge list with all possible events. This list is too large for normal users and moreover he can add rules to events that are not intended for his role. I'll give an example out of our Moodle system: Our teachers don't have the capability to view the course log (capability report/log:view) However a teacher can create and subscribe to this rule: Log testcourse Logs Log report viewed 1 time(s) in 1 minute(s) When an admin views the log of this specific course, the teacher gets a notification. However, when he clicks on the link to the log he gets the following message due to the missing capability: Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (View course logs) More information about this error Debug info: Error code: nopermissions Stack trace: • line 786 of /lib/accesslib.php: required_capability_exception thrown • line 115 of /report/log/index.php: call to require_capability() So, it should not be possible to create and subscribe to rules that are not meant to be used by a specific role. We don't want to take the capability tool/monitor:managerules away from the teachers. They still should be able to create their own monitoring rules. Now I wanted to start a discussion how this can be optimized so that each user only can create and subscribe to event monitoring rules he has the capabilities for? I also created a tracker ticket for this: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-52164 Cheers, Kathrin",

          "Text": "Changing functionality \"coursetags\" in 3.0, please object before it's too late. As part of MDL-50851 I'm changing some functions in Tag API and have discovered one of \"easter egg\" Moodle functionality called course tags. There are so many things wrong with it and so many bugs that migrating on the new API is impossible without either fixing or dropping it. I have not found a single bug in the tracker regarding this and I assume nobody knows about it / uses it. First of all, what is wrong: This functionality can be enabled only in the settings of the block \"Tags\" by checking \"Show course tags\" ($CFG->block_tags_showcoursetags). When enabled block \"Tags\" can no longer be used for displaying tag cloud and is used to allow users to tag the current course with some tags. Every tag added to the course via this block \"belongs\" to the user who added it. So no manager can change the set of tags for the course if they were added by another user. Courses can be searched by the tags using \"Site pages > Tags\" search box just as well as user interests and blog posts tags. Obviously bad tag words can be removed or flagged as inappropriate but nothing can be done with valid tag words that are irrelevant. BUG: When course is backed up and then restored the information about the user is lost and nobody at all can change it any more BUG: When course is being deleted function coursetag_delete_course_tags() is called that deletes tags instead of deleting tag instances. This means that if the deleted course has been tagged with \"moodle\", the tag \"moodle\" is removed from any user's interests, any blog post, etc. BUG: If instance of block \"Tags\" is configured to show official only tags, and user is trying to add a tag it will disappear without any explanation because newly added tags are not official UI of course tags (again, accessible only via block) is so terrible, it makes me want to vomit. There are some minor bugs there as well. It is impossible to use \"Tags\" block to display tagcloud when $CFG->block_tags_showcoursetags is on and so on What I would like to do: remove all \"coursetags\" functionality such as block setting, pages to add/edit \"my\" course tags during upgrade automatically convert all existing course tags into proper user-less tags add a field in course edit form that will allow teacher/manager to set or change course tags similar as one can set user interests, blog tags, question tags, wiki pages tags, etc. everybody will still be able to search for tagged courses using /tag/search.php If you do use the coursetag functionality in it's current form, please tell us why it is good and we should not drop it. If you don't but would like to tag courses - vote for MDL-51132",

          "Title": "Feedback for new opportunity - Mark as all read",
          "Text": "I’m a student at a university of technology on Cyprus and I use the moodle just like other students. From the use of this moodle I have discovered some new ways to improve new functions. The function that interests me is part of the function of messages. At my university we use the function of messages to communicate between as about a subject, so that we are continuously updated for any course. The moodle platform gives as the opportunity to connect with any account for example: Gmail account, Hotmail etc… so that incoming messages are sent there .To make it clear, if someone sends me a message and I’m not connected to moodle account I can receive it through my email. So now I want to propose a modification for the domain of messages, about the function which use a popup window to inform the user for new messages. Existing Function When a user has new messages a popup window pops up. The popup window has two options: 1) Go to messages When the user presses on the link a new window appears, so from then on he can read his messages. (If he has messages from more than one user, then he must to choose the messages that he will read) 2) Ignore When the user presses on the ignore link the popup window disappears. But when the user logs in again the popup appears, regardless if he had read his messages from his other account. Suggestion What I suggest is to create a third option which is “ Mark as all read ”. So I have come to this option after I have researched it with quizzes in my university. The results that I have found are very positive and the student think it will be very useful. Like we have seen different organizations like google, outlook, etc. they have already added something similar. What does the function do? When the user presses on the mark as all read link then the unread messages will get transferred from “ message” table (Stores all unread messages) to the “ message_read” table (Stores all messages that have been read). The user gets transferred to the Homepage! The next time the user logs in, the popup will not appear except if he has new messages. Why did I choose mark as all read? The popup window displays the messages that a user has. If he has more than one message then it displays the total of the messages. The user most likely has read the messages from the other account so the mark as all read option will be useful. If the user observes that the total messages are more than he has read then he will have the option go to messages, where he will read the message that he wants. The next time that he will log in and the popup appears, then he will have the option 3. If the user hasn’t read all his messages but presses on the option 3 then the message are still in his email account. The “Ignore” option is very important because it forces us to read all the messages and we were always informed. But many times we read the messages from the other account and not from the moodle account and the number of unread messages increases. So, I believe that this option is a very good idea and it will be very useful. I would really appreciate any feedback for the new opportunity that I propose. Thanks in advance, Koulla.",

          "Text": "This has been already mentioned on the wiki document, to get some functionality Moodle will need to issue SQL query against the log data. This means that Moodle will have to know the exact structure of the logging implementation. Only the interface methods for getting logs may not be enough. One way to deal with it, would be to keep a minimal core SQL DB log table forever. So an even would be created but for some logs they would go to mdl_log as well. This could be a minimal set of log events with a minimal amount of data - just to suffice for common functionality that uses log table at the moment. Another way to deal with it, would be to create a set of interfaces for each functionality that we need from logs, eg: interface login_information with log_login_errors method to cover http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_usage#lib.2Fcronlib.php . This way, when some functionality would be required (e.g. finding failed logins since), log mechanisms would be queried. The first one that implements appropriate interface would be used. If none, then the feature would not be available. Another point, invoking get_events like this: \n```text\n$reader->get_events($select, $params, 'timecreated DESC, id DESC', $page*$perpage, $perpage);\n```\n looks to me like every log plugin will *have to* expose/store data in SQL table, is that intentional?

How is this proposed solution solving problem #1? By changing all current joins to event listeners, as suggested by Martin ? Database table can be scalable - it can be done on the DB level, eg by partitioning or using MySQL Proxy (for MySQL).

          "Text": "Two more problems from wiki, \" Existing problems \" section: Logging is added ad-hoc by developers and has spotty coverage. Some logged actions do not contain important information needed later. New framework won't help for #1 - logging will still need to be added ad-hoc by developers. To fix this, we would need to think about front-end controller that does the logging without having a need for developer to implement that explicitly. The same goes for #2 above - we need more data passed not the new framework. As for: log tables are joined in many popular queries and are slow This can easily be fixed without complete rewrite as well - it'd be enough to log as we do now and also trigger an event. So - what are existing issues with logging at the moment? I don't think we need a complete rewrite and new architecture to solve issues listed in http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_2#Existing_problems . By creating whole new logging layer we are: reducing reliability (introducing new bugs, new layer, more components) introducing more complexity (logging is dead simple now, does it have to be complex?) decreasing performance (direct write to table  vs event -> observer/listener -> write to table) creating more work just to catch up with the existing features at the end of that phase we will have no added value (as there will be no other logging plugins) I would think about what really is important and implement just that, for example: events seem like a great idea, maybe just trigger an event after we do a normal write to DB? If anyone needs to consume logging event, then even creating local plugin may be OK, do we really need more interfaces? Look at messaging plugins for example - nobody is really using them and that has added more complexity into Moodle structuring log data is again a great idea - we can do it already without complete rewrite (e.g. add more columns to mdl_log) we need to tackle SQL joins on mdl_log no matter what - so let's do it now and then think about the rewrite. Maybe we should put some data (like logins) into a separate table, as suggested by Petr? In general, I would suggest to first see what we need and then create a framework/layer for our needs, instead of doing the opposite - creating architecture that we may need in the future. Tomek",

It is not our intention, our intention is to be a good open source community member and improve Moodle for all. The activity grader has been fully baked, we have had clients using it for 1.5 years and have modified it and updated it in several ways based on their input. It is our opinion that it is to the point where the only positive progression forward is the inclusion of more activities within it. When it comes to inclusion of more activities we have 2 options: 1. Continue how we have and hack parts of core Moodle to add activity support and maintain these hacks as the core activities are modified. 2. Ask that Moodle and the community to consider the inclusion of an activity grading interface and work with the community towards consolidating activity grading. We could release this interface to the community via the plugins but then that would require community members to maintain core hacks. We want to be good citizens and so we try to stay away from releasing features that require core modifications. On your point about commenting on other's specifications, I believe we have participated in many ways. I have commented on several of the tickets in the tracker on requested features, we have provided accessibility feedback on several tickets and our developers have reviewed several specifications for suggested features. If there is something specific you would like comments on I would be happy to review it and give feedback. There is nothing about this specification that requires it be in Moodle 2.6, we would definitely think the community would benefit most if it was in 2.6. The interface already works, as I said it has been used for 1.5 years. We can demo it now, in fact anyone can test it out on our public demo site at http://demo2k12.moodlerooms.com/ . We plan to complete the lions share of the work that needs to be done to complete the inclusion into core. We are more than happy maintaining it as a proprietary feature of our product or considering its release as a plugin that requires core modifications and updates with each Moodle release. The reactions to the interface we have received at Moots, from prospects, and our clients though pushed us to request that the feature be added to Moodle and not released as a plugin.",

Joule Grader is a complex system and could have significant impacts to grading in at least one core activity, with additions from advanced forums to core forums probably 2 activities. We do not want to rush inclusion, instead we want to get it in right. Moodlerooms doesn't plan to release Joule grader outside of a core release. Because it has such a significant impact on activity grading we do not want to have community members installing it incase Moodle HQ determines that apis need to change in order to provide the best functionality for the entire community. Moodlerooms is staffed to handle api changes internally, but we aren't staffed to fully support community members converting from Joule grader to the Moodle activity grader. We really do need a different name for Joule grader when it is included into core.",

See e.g. MDL-31237 - How would this interact with sites using TurnItIn or similar? Can this display TurnItIn assignments?

Originally we were unable to allow users to adjust the size of the columns, since our last release this has changed and we are considering improving this. 2. We are adding that to our December 2013 release of Joule so that change would be included. 3. Currently only Forums is supported and we could probably add rating capability to the interface, but the original idea was that you would review the forum and rate the posts then use grading interface to grade the overall performance. The idea was that ratings would be used as a metric for grading but not as the grade. Database and glossary don't support grading. Long term I would love to convince Moodle HQ to add grading to many more activities. 4. At the moment no, but that is something we will be looking into as part of the Assignment grading work flow that was added in Moodle 2.6. Long term imo this interface needs to support all grading options a teacher would want for a course. 5. Turnitin would depend on what plugin you are using. Joule grader will have an API that activity plugins can take advantage of. Turnitin Direct would need to add Joule grader support to their plugin. If you are using the plagiarism plugin not the activity then that like PDF annotation should be supported in this interface. But needs to be added. This is something we would need to look into further.",

          "Text": "I'm currently looking to address a number of issues we've identified with forum notifications. The issues that we've identified all relate to the volume of e-mail generated by the Moodle forums. One of these will hopefully be addressed in MDL-39707 with introduction of per-thread subscription. Force Subscribe forums We make a lot of use forums in a force-subscribe mode. This is because we want to ensure that students receive notifications for some forums. We therefore want all students to be forcibly enrolled. However... some of our staff also want to receive notifications, whilst others don't. Most often this can be accomplished by using different roles for different types of staff (e.g. Teaching staff vs. Administrative staff), but often we have many members of teaching staff and not all of them want to receive notifications. This is currently handled using a capability - mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe (introduced in MDL-33166 ). Anyone with this capability is forcibly subscribed to the forum, whilst anyone without the capability cannot subscribe. We'd like to propose introduction of an additional capability - mod/forum:allowforce un subscribe to allow certain roles to unsubscribe from forum notifications. I've raised MDL-40483 to propose the introduction of this new capability. Per-Forum Digest settings The final area we've identified for improvement is that of the volume of e-mail for forums where a user is interested in the content. At present, it is possible to choose how to receive forum notifications with three options: No Digest - single e-mail per forum post Digest Complete - a daily digest with the full post details Digest Subjects - a daily digest with the post subject only We're proposing that this be changed to a per-forum setting with fall back to a per-user preference so that users can have a default setting, and override this on a per-forum basis. This change was raised in MDL-4908 may years ago but has not been addressed to date. I've written a brief specification of the changes in http://docs.moodle.org/dev/mod_forum-subscriptions . Summary I would really appreciate any feedback that people have for the new capability introduction, and the per-forum digest setting. Thanks in advance, Andrew",

The concept is different to the ILP block. That means that thee are several groups in a class and often some activities are assigned to one or two students only. Moodle offers such functionality with groups, groupings and exclusive settings for groupings on activity/resource level. This works well technically. If we think about a one year term, a class with 25 students its no fun to try to handle this with Moodle features and processes. We are looking for ideas how to make this much easier for teachers. Here are some first ideas: The teacher can select on activity level with a new icon in edit mode students from his course that should get access to this activity. The student sees a separate icon that this activity is selected for him/her. The teacher gets a new link in settings block with a table listing all activities and students and can select the students that should do some special activities.  Students will see only activities that are marked for them. Same should be done for groups. We would like to see if other  regions are also interested in such features and what additional requirements are. ralf",

You could say that activity X is available to students X days after they enrol. \"Expect completed on\" could also be set mean \"students are expected to finish this activity within 10 days\", instead of just a date. The extension of this would be to move options in assignment module for \"allow submissions from\", \"due date\", \"cut-off\" date into generic module options (and then have each module to support those or not). This way, a common notifications framework could be easily built in Moodle (e.g. send email 1 day before cut-off date for any activity). cheers, Tomek",

I also think that all assignments should have the option for due dates, cut off dates, and extensions. Both quiz and assignment have these implemented.  Seems like time to complete would need to be added to each of these dates as each could be different, except extension as that is based off the cut off or due date.",

Directory: course/extensions/ blah This is not the correct path for this feature - the extensions only relate to modules - not a course so the folder would sit at the top level (like plagiarism). 2. Re: changing get_coursemodule_from_id... No - you should create your own function and not try and overload this core one. Firstly - you often need to get the extension date for someone else (not $USER) - so your function needs to accept a userid and second - if everyone added their own features to that core function it would be an unrecongnisable mess. 3. I see a couple of other things not mentioned in the spec. (a) The assignment and quiz both have their own extension date logic/data which would need to be upgraded into these new tables with no data loss. (Quiz has special handling for when a student has the quiz still open when the time expires - the assignment doesn't need that). (b) This extension date information will need to be included in backup/restore. (c) You will probably need something like the user_picture stuff to add the extension date fields to a query and then a function to display a date from a record with those fields. Regards, Damyon",

I've followed the lead of how Plagiarism/Repository plugin system was implemented and built it to work with all the internal Moodle plugin management functions. One consistant theme that appeared to be mentioned a few times was a central method of tracking and keeping deadlines was also something people wanted. Recognising that Extensions and Deadlines work hand in hand, I have built a Deadlines plugin also which (for the activities that are modified to support it) will track open/deadline/cutoff dates in a central table. I've structured it such that at the base level, there is a 'deadline' module which contains the base class; like how Plaigiarism operates. With just that setup and no deadlines/extensions plugin installed the activities will default back to their own storage mechanism (own database table). When a Deadlines plugin is installed, for modules that supports it (determined by calling plugin_supports('mod', $this->modname, FEATURE_DEADLINE)), it will track that modules open/deadline/cutoff data in it's own table, linked back to Course Module ID. For now I've been concentrating on making mod_assign work with this, so far so good, individual and group extensions are implemented and working, and the functionality for staff to add an extension to a student is working too. I realise I'm kind of side stepping some of the established processes here regarding the spec etc - but fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) we're developing this primarily for our requirements first and foremost, however we're fully committed to giving this portion of work to the Moodle community. I'm lucky that my manager shares my vision to contribute this work to the community and he was very accomodating when I threw the 'deadlines' monkey wrench on the table which required a little extra work that wasn't in our Moodle2 upgrade project plan. The feedback we've had in the past is that it meets most peoples needs (admittedly a small subset of people though), our academics certainly love it and the usage of our 1.9 version shows that. I have been keeping my thread here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=216784 updated with my progress. It's heavy on the pics, apologies in advance if you're on a low bandwidth connection. I'd love to hear back from people regarding this, particularly HQ and Core devs, both from the implementation aspect (admittedly hard to gauge until there is code in the open, still working on that!) and from the usability aspect of the UI - which is where I think it needs the most community input to be honest.",

For audio you can choose the PoodLL MP3 recorder which does record straight into Moodle. Only the video recording repository needs to use the tokyo server. There is not really a good serverless solution for video, though there are some java efforts. So ( perhaps predictably) I think a free, albeit far off, server solution is pretty good.  For people that doesn't work for, we usually help them set up their own server. But I think we need to look beyond the \"recorder\" itself. Thats just a part of a bigger picture. Moodle really needs a seamless framework to handle recording from multiple sources and going into different locations. By that I mean, recording from tablets and phones, from desktops via flash, and from desktops via uploads. And not just recording into the repository. But also recording into assignments, questions, database activities and forums. That is really what PoodLL is aiming to be. Yes its a lot for one plugin.  In fact its a total of 5 plugins, and soon to be 6. But it does do all of the above. And nothing else does that yet. But I've appreciated your feedback over the last few days, its been very helpful.",
