Trying to put a form together that has the following layout: Title of activity Category 1 Criterion 1 date1, (date2, date3) comment Criterion 2 date1, (date2, date3) comment Category 2 Criterion 1 date1 (date2, date3) comment Criterion 2... The issue is that the date field is auto-populated with current date each time the Database is opened. As only one date field is necessary for the evidence, if a learner completes it with one date, the rest of the dates will be automatically be put in my Moodle regardless, which is not correct for the purposes of evidencing. Is there a way to make the date fields be all blank to start with or to have placeholders? Also, is it possible to export as pdf? That would be more suitable for exam bodies as evidence.",

One other way you might consider doing it is to have each entry contain just ONE Date, and then make a Radio Button or a Menu Field for the Category. Each user would just add a new record when they complete the step which would contain the date they completed that step. If you get clever with Groups (one user per group and separate groups), you can display each user's entries in the \"List view\" to see how many steps they have completed. Or you use the \"Approval required\" setting, and don't approve any entries to keep them \"private\" for students. You would need to filter by Student in order to see only one student's entries. You can use JavaScript in your template to \"print\" list views which would download as a PDF depending on your browser settings. There is a webinar and Moodle Academy course coming up in September on Moodle Database which may give you more ideas.",

          "Text": "Hi, to be flexible, I wouldn't use the date field type but rather a number field (for timestamps) or a short text field, that i used here. In the \"Add entry template\" I changed the input html into this: \n```text\n<div class=\"mb-3 pt-3\">\n  <div class=\"fw-bold\">Date</div>\n  <div class=\"date-field\">\ndate\n</div>\n</div>\n\n[...]\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flatpickr\"></script>\n<script>\nwindow.document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) => {\n  // Add the flatpickr stylesheet if it is not already there.\n  if(!document.getElementById('flatpickr_css')) {\n    var link = document.createElement('link');\n    link.id = 'flatpickr_css';\n    link.rel = 'stylesheet';\n    link.href = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.\ncss\n';\n    document.head.appendChild(link);\n  }\n  flatpickr('.date-field input');\n});\n</script>\n```\n so basically adding a div with a class around my date field placeholder. At the end of the existing code in the template, the javascript is added. The input field can be easily set via a datepicker provided by the flatpickr.js library now. I am not sure whether the link element can be in the body at any place, therefore I add the css stylesheet via javascript in the header. The stored values are in the form of YYYY-MM-DD. These dates can actually be sorted. If in the output you want a custom formatted date, you can do something like this e.g. in the Single View template: \n```text\n<div class=\"mt-4\">\n  <span class=\"fw-bold\">date</span>\n  <p class=\"mt-2 date-field-out\">\ndate\n</p>\n</div>\n\n[...]\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dayjs@1/dayjs.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\nwindow.document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n  const nodes = document.querySelectorAll('.date-field-out');\n  for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n    const value = nodes[i].innerHTML;\n    if (value.trim().length > 0) {\n      dayjs(value).format('MMMM D, YYYY');\n    }\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n Again, in the existing html, the p element is extended by the class \"date-field-out\". The javascript loads the day.js library, reads the YYYY-MM-DD date contents and reformats them to the given format. One thing to watch out when using dates, is the timezone and daylight savings time. For this PoC I didn't check any of these issues, but you should be aware of it and may change the code a bit. The mentioned libraries support this, while the plain Date object within javascript treats everything as UTC. HTH , Stephan PS. the square brackets in the code are lost, so whenever the date appears as a link, it's the placeholder with the square brackets. PPS. to have the output of a list view or single view printed as a PDF, you could do something similar that I have done in https://github.com/srobotta/moodle-database-presets/tree/master/personel-list",

In the template the file is inserted dynamically with the placeholer pdf . That creates a link and an icon in front of it (to illustrate the filetype). This javascript snippet checks for the link, actually checks that there is a pdf linked (only by looking at the suffix of the file). In that case the anchor element is replaced by: \n```text\n<embed src=\"https://url.to.your.moodle/the.pdf\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"  type=\"application/pdf\">\n```\n Unfortunately you cannot limit the file upload to a pdf ( AFAIK ) and (just checked) you can fool Moodle by renaming an image to pdf which then brings you a blank embed window.

I always recommend to disable the code editor (uncheck the box) to have a plain text area for the template editing. Then you get the plain HTML and avoid errors when the editor does things (e.g. enclosing each paragraph into a p element) that are not preferred. What I also spot in your code is the missing id that is there by default and used in the javascript snippet. I guess your double square \"How to pdf\" is the variable placeholder that produces the link. In this case in your div element with the font-size or any other element, that contains the link to the pdf, add the id=\"defaulttemplate-single\" attribute. The other solution would be going without the id attribute. In this case change the selector in the code from \n```text\n \n\n\n  \"#defaulttemplate-single a.data-field-link\"\n```\n to `\"a.data-field-link\"` I used the id selector to replace only links inside that template and avoid unwanted replacements of any other links that might be on the page (although unlikely). If that still doesn't help then open the javascript console to see if there are any other errors that keep the Javascript from working correctly. Best regards, Stephan",

What exactly do you have and where do you upload it? An mbz file would be uploaded via the course restore menu. 3. Depending on what you have, I suggest the following: - If you have a backup of your Postgres / Mysql : restore it in some other instance, export the entries (e.g. as CSV) and reimport them into your current installation. - If you have an mbz file, try to figure out what it contains (the mbz is a zip file, rename it, unzip it and have a look). You might have the entries as an csv or xml or whatever there as well. Then you could us that file to reimport it into the db activity. HTH , Stephan",

          "Title": "Database fo CPD and/or RPL",
          "Text": "Kia ora team, I've created a Database that can be used for collecting CPD points/hours. Video demonstration (3 min; no sound; apologies for the amateur production!) Scenario A given number [n] of CPD hours/points are awarded per year; with [n] being the maximum\nnumber of hours/points that can be awarded for the year/course. For\nthe purpose of the example courses, I have set that number at 20 CPD\nhours/points per year. I am not sure if this is a realistic number but\nit was (somewhat!) easier for me to do the maths in my head when I was\nworking things out. 😅 Students upload evidence of their CPD to [a database activity in] the course. The course teacher views the CPD evidence and decides how many hours/points the CPD evidence is worth. The student can be awarded a badge/badges in 1 of 2 ways: One-off: The student receives a badge after completing 20 CPD hours/points. Iterative: The student receives a badge for every multiple of 5 CPD hours/points. (N.B. \"Points\" can be replaced with \"hours\" and \"CPD\" can be replaced with \"RPL\".) Here are the 2x ways, depending on how often you want to award people for their CPD points. One-off : i.e. 1x badge/permanent record for 20 points Iterative : (e.g.) 4x badges/permanent records, each for 5 points and accumulating to 20. Workflow: One-off How does it work? Student uploads evidence of their CPD to a database activity in the course. Each item is a separate entry into the database. The course teacher (or equivalent role) views the CPD evidence. They\nmark it as approved and then give it a rating. The rating indicates how\nmany points CPD each evidence item (i.e. each database entry) is worth. Once 20 points is reached, the student is able to view and open a page\nresource; opening the page resource triggers the badge being awarded.\n(Done this way because badge criteria does not include grade.) OR Once 20 points is reached, the activity is considered complete and the badge is awarded automatically on activity completion. The student receives a badge. The badge reflects 20 CPD points. The\nbadge stays attached to the student profile regardless of any future\ncourse enrolment or unenrolment. Reporting The teacher can view the gradebook to see how many points the student has accumulated. The student can view their gradebook to see how many points they have accumulated. Cons The maximum number of points is 20. If a student is awarded 10 + 5 + 8,\nthen they will only receive a maximum of 20 points. The additional 3\npoints beyond 20 will not be 'counted'. Workflow: Iterative How does it work? Student uploads evidence of their CPD to a database activity in the course. Each item is a separate entry into the database. The course teacher (or equivalent role) views the CPD evidence. They\nmark it as approved and then give it a rating. The rating indicates how\nmany points CPD each evidence item (i.e. each database entry) is worth. Once 5 points are collected, the student is able to view and open a\npage resource; opening the page resource triggers the badge being\nawarded. (Done this way because badge criteria does not include grade.) The student receives a badge. The badge reflects 5 CPD points. The\nbadge stays attached to the student profile regardless of any future\ncourse enrolment or unenrolment. Then, After 10 points are reached, the student is able to view and open\nanother page resource; opening the page resource triggers the badge\nbeing awarded. The student receives another badge. The badge reflects (another) 5 CPD\npoints. The badge stays attached to the student profile regardless of\nany future course enrolment or unenrolment. Then, the same kind of set-up for 15 points and 20 points. Reporting The teacher can view the gradebook to see how many points the student has received. The student can view their gradebook to see how many points they have accumulated. Pros Students can receive rewards more frequently. Cons Students have to click on the Page resource to receive their badge. Settings Both  \"one-off\" and \"iterative\" courses: Groups The course will have groups, in order for students to be able to only see their own database entries. You can auto create groups. Use the option Group # and the limit of 1 member per group. There\nis a 3rd party plugin available for auto creation of groups on\nenrolment, but I have not used it myself. Course settings Course name: CPD points 2024 Enable completion tracking: Yes Group mode: Separate groups Course Activities and Resources Database (and Pages for the \"iterative\" course) Database settings Name: My CPD points Entries Approval required: Yes Allow editing of approved entries: No Entries required before viewing: None Maximum number of entries: None Ratings Aggregate type: Sum of ratings Scale Type: Point Maximum grade: 20 Grade category: Uncategorised One-off: Grade to pass: 20.00 Iterative: Grade to pass: 0.00 Group mode Separate groups Add grouping restriction: Group: (Any group) Activity completion One-off: Completion tracking: Activity completion with pass grade Iterative: Completion tracking: Do not indicate activity completion Example fields Date completed (date) Upload evidence (file) Details (textarea field) Link to course or site ( URL field) *CPD can be replaced with RPL if necessary. Permission change Permission changes to Database activity \"My CPD points\": View the total rating you received (mod/data:viewrating): +Student Then, differences as follows: Settings: One-off Badge Name: \"20 CPD points\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 20 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Database activity Settings continued: Iterative Page x 4 (Page 1) Name:\"Click here to be awarded your 5-point CPD badge\" Page content: \"Congratulations!\" [Add further info if needed.] Page 1 Settings Restrict access Student must match the following Grade: My CPD points must be greater than and equal to 25% Hidden entirely Activity completion Show activity as complete when conditions are met: Student must view this activity to complete it. (Page 2, 3, 4) As for Page 1 BUT Restrict access Student must match the following Grade: My CPD points must be greater than and equal to 50% (Page 2) 75% (Page 3) 100% (Page 4) Hidden entirely Badges Badge 1 Name: \"5 CPD points (1)\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 5 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Page 1 \"Click here to be awarded your 5-point CPD badge\" Badge 2 Name: \"5 CPD points (2)\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 5 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Page 2 \"Click here to be awarded your next 5-point CPD badge\" Same for Badges 3, 4 - make sure they are connected to the correct Page. FAQ Why the additional step of the Page? Because a badge criterion can be activity completion but not grade. Why add Student to mod/data:viewrating? So that they can see the ratings they were given. Why groups? So that database entries can be only viewed by the student who made the entries. In order for the database entries to be rated, they must be approved. Why not display pages one by one? i.e. restrict access In case the student doesn't access the first badge before they are able to access the second badge. Could Teachers or Managers award the badges? If you want them to, yes, add them to the badge criteria. Why not have badges that are 5, 10, 15, 20 (rather than the proposed 5, 5, 5, 5)? Because Badge \"5-point\" and Badge \"10-point \"might look like a total of 15 points, when it is really a total of 10 points. A \"20-point\" badge could be a nice additional badge to round off the calendar year. Perhaps make the 20-point badge with no expiry date and the \"5-point\" badges could have expiry after a year. That way, badges don't become overwhelming or cluttered. Please add any comments or suggestions you have for improving this further. Ngā mihi",

          "Text": "This can be achieved creating a new tab with an iframe and put the binary data into the url ifself. The following code sample demonstrates this for PDF files only in the single view: document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) => { document.querySelector('#defaulttemplate-single a.data-field-link').addEventListener('click', (ev) => { const url = ev.target.getAttribute('href'); if (url.match(/.*pdf$/i)) { ev.preventDefault(); With small modifications this can be adjusted to other file types as well and also in the list view. Basically after loading the DOMContentLoaded event attaches an event to the first Anchor element with the class \"data-field-link\" when the link is clicked. This attached function checks the suffix of the url and by this guessing what content type might be expected. For a pdf it fetches the content of the file, creates an iframe in a new window and adds the content via the src attribute. Here you have the chance instead of providing a url, use a base64 encoded string. That works also for other elemens such as images or anchor links when you want to force a download that otherwise would just be displayed in the browser. To make this work in the list view, two things need to be changed: * The query selector for fetching the Anchor links must not include #defaulttemplate-single * Fetch all Anchors with querySelectorAll() Best regards, Stephan",

While I don't have specific information on whether this has been done in the exact context you're describing, similar data integration and sharing between platforms are relatively common in web development. Here's a general approach to achieve this: 1. **Expose Data via API in Moodle:** - Set up an API within your Moodle instance to expose the data from the database activity. Moodle supports web services, including REST and SOAP protocols, which can be used to retrieve data programmatically. 2. **Access Moodle API from WordPress:** - In your WordPress website, you can use server -side programming languages like PHP or JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the Moodle API. Libraries like cURL (in PHP) or the Fetch API (in JavaScript) can be used to fetch data from Moodle's API endpoints. 3. **Parse and Display Data in WordPress:** - Once you retrieve the data from Moodle, you can parse it and display it on your WordPress site. You can format the data as needed and use HTML, CSS , and JavaScript to render it in a user-friendly manner. 4. **Scheduled Updates:**",

Right now all of these external interfaces are read-only, but that could probably be changed if necessary. Although our prototype is built on an \"Event\" database where events have titles and locations and dates and so forth, this plugin was designed to work other data types as well. We aren't sure whether we want to release this in the wild as OpenSource, at the moment, but if anyone wants to use, please contact me and I'll share the share the code with you.",

I want\nthat when entering the data of the table, the id field of the table\nis automatically calculated and entered. And on\nthe other hand, I want to concatenate 3 fields into a fourth field. I have\nseveral problems: 1.\nCreate the id generation field. I've\ngotten that field to auto-populate using the list view and single\nview templates, and javascript. The\nproblem that when changing the page, it calls the javascript again\nand initializes the counter. I have\ntried to put it in a localStorage, but it should not work in moodle. I don't\nquite understand the architecture of this plugin. Because in the HTML\nit doesn't let you write javascript or call a function from it. It\nwould also help a lot to know how I can get other elements of the\nview, like the page number where we are right now... Yours\nwould be to enter this value, when entering each record and thus it\nwould not have to be calculated every time you generate the view. 2.\nCreate a field, with the concatenation of several fields of the\ntable. According\nto the code I show below, it should work, but it doesn't. But\nyours would be to enter the value when entering the record, instead\nof the views. Therefore,\nthis field should be hidden, so that it is not seen by the user and\nautomatically. Can PHP\nbe entered in the \"add entry\" template to create a form and\nthat when clicking on save the record, the id and appointment fields\nare modified? This would be the code, but it doesn't work in moodle: /* Inicio del código de la plantilla javascript */ if (localStorage.getItem(\"cnt\") === null) { localStorage.setItem(\"cnt\", \"1\"); } function init() { var cnt = parseInt(localStorage.getItem(\"cnt\"), 10); var id_documentos = document.getElementsByName(\"id_documento\"); var citas = document.getElementsByName(\"citas\"); var autores = document.getElementsByName(\"autor\"); var titulos_articulo = document.getElementsByName(\"titulo_articulo\"); var anios_publicacion = document.getElementsByName(\"anio_publicacion\"); var organizaciones = document.getElementsByName(\"organizacion\"); for (var i = 0; i < id_documentos.length; i++) { id_documentos[i].innerHTML = cnt++; var autorValue = autores[i].textContent; var tituloValue = titulos_articulo[i].textContent; var anioValue = anios_publicacion[i].textContent; var organizacionValue = organizaciones[i].textContent; citas[i].innerHTML = autorValue + '.' + tituloValue + '.' + anioValue + '.' + organizacionValue; } localStorage.setItem(\"cnt\", cnt.toString()); } window.onload = init; /* Fin del código de la plantilla javascript */ I have many doubts, and really, I don't know how this plugin\n(database) behaves. If\nanyone has any more information on how the different template calls\nto javascript and how I can get data from the URL ... I would\nappreciate it.",

For me on both Moodles, the onchange works for the textarea also, but not in what I would call the correct manner. It is popping up your alert 2 window after EVERY character I type, instead of waiting for me to click some where else. If you send me a private message, I can give you teacher access to where I have it installed.",

Very interesting that on your Moodle 3.11.4+ installation the js ONCHANGE event keyword seems to be triggering ONINPUT event behavior by \"popping up your alert 2 window after EVERY character I type, instead of waiting for me to click some where else\" ( https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_oninput.asp versus https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onchange.asp ). My site is running a Moodle 3.9.9+ installation where the js ONCHANGE event keyword does work as expected for text input elements (DB \"text field\") but produces no visible behavior for textarea elements (DB \"Textarea field\"). Same results on current Firefox , Chrome, and Edge browsers. I will try testing other js events on the textarea field and see how Moodle reacts.",

I have a course with multiple groups and the group mode for this course is 'Separate Groups' (& Forced). In this course, there is a database activity. When the users (modified nonediting teachers) use 'Add entry' to enter data it works as expected (i.e. they can view only the entries they submitted and the users cannot view the entries of the users in the other groups). However, if a user uses 'import entries' to enter data, these entries are visible (in the list view and the single view) to all the users in the course. Similarly, export entries does not work for the imported entries. It seems like the system cannot link the group with the entries when entries are imported. Is there a quick fix for this issue? We use Moodle 3.9.1. P.S. I have the same problem as discussed here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=388543 Thanks!",

I would like to have the page parameters, i.e entries per page, ascending/descending, etc. basically everything in the search criteria to be disabled for students. I've been playing around and can remove the Advanced Search bar from the list view via CSS in the List View Template, but it seems that any student can go in and change these parameters and save them on a global level... This would basically undermine all my links directed at a specific order and number of entries. Is there any way to set it up so that the student only has access to List View and with no search or maybe no possibility to save any changes to these parameters globally???? Thanks in advance!!!!!",

I have not managed to find an appropriate response in the forum discussions (I might not be looking for the correct terms) My aim is to set up a database for students to submit specific academic requests to academic management - such as extensions on submission deadlines, or access to a supplementary exam if the student failed the first one. (The purpose is to have all these requests collated in one place). Privacy of the requests was a concern - but if I understand correctly, I am able to set \"require approval for new records\" (and then just never approve them) - and this will allow entries to remain private, and for me to comment on the entry, for the student to see my comments and respond (and still only see their requests), whilst I can still see all requests? Firstly, is there a maximum number of records that can be added to the database - and then once that limit is reached, the database becomes visible to all students? And secondly, do I receive notifications when students submit new entries and do the students receive a notification when their entry is commented on? Thank you for any guidance to set me in the right direction!",

Actually, my tests show that really, the moodle APP doesn't load whatever is in the javascript template part of the database plugin. The other tabs are loaded (single template, list template, css template) but not the javascript template. Therefore none the preset using javascript can be used by the moodle app. It is a bit disapointing because most of my students use the mobile app on their mobile. I hope that the tracker I have set up will get some votes and that the mobile team will repair this soon (for now, it is low in the priority schedule).",

I cannot think of nor see a way of doing this, without the student having the edit view and putting their name in the \"requestname\" field, which would give them access to edit all the other fields.

If you don't, and you use the editors, you will break the layout as it will save table info in the header that has to be in the footer for this to look right, when you are looking at the list view. In other words, it will turn the normally attached list view header , into a separate, un-attached row, above the rest of the list. Basically, what template is doing is putting the table start info in the Header area, and the table end info in the Footer area. You then add one table row in the header that contains table headers  with the column names and any formatting info you want, such as your use of strong. In the Repeated entry area, you define and format one table row with a definition of what goes in each cell or column. You should also add a More link in one cell. In this case I added it to the Noun cell. It makes it possible to go directly to a single record in, Single view. To make each row more compact, I have left off the examples and images. That's what the more link is for, to take you to the single view so you can see the whole entry. NOTE: You need to edit this preset as you do NOT make use of you CEFR checklist field.

          "Text": "The database module provides 2 settings Available From and Available Until, which basically hide the activity from users if the date conditions aren't satisfied. This seems to duplicate the functionality of the (site-optional) Availability-Date conditions. Is there much objection to merging these 2 features so that the From - Until database setting is migrated to the core availability feature? It has been pointed out that availability is a feature that can be turned off at the site level. So I propose  to treat is as new feature on master, and to drop these 2 settings in favour of the Core Availability API. As part of the upgrade we could migrate the settings to the availability settings but it would require site admins to enable availability, but we should be able to highlight this requirement as part of the upgrade. My main reason for this is that it allows 2 ways for end-users to set up exactly the same behaviour, and for the sake of simplicity /reducing cognitive load, it seems that we should only offer one way of doing things. It was suggested some end-user feedback should be sought. Full details posted in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-60927 M",

If 'sort by' is set to a user-created field, then search will only search that field. This means you miss out on sorting by one field (such as a due date), and filtering all the results by the search string. I didn't expect it to work this way. Seems like it might be a bug.

I have to try a lot of times to get a selector that works, because I don't understand the high level CSS syntax that's used. For instance, I've never seen > or [ ] used in CSS before, and don't have a clue what that means. I think a lot of syntax has been added to CSS since I last used it about eight years ago! The CSS I'm using is definitely theme and language dependent (because it uses the exact outputted string in the label), so that's probably why it's not working for you. I guess it might even be dependent on which branch of Moodle you're using because different versions of the database plugin may generate different source. It's worth persisting a little more, because I think displaying both the advanced search checkbox and a tab at the same time is confusing and redundant. At first I hid the checkbox, but that broke the functionality. Hiding the search tab works for me though. Good luck.",

Both groups are allowed to post comments and to grade entries. I get one single grade (average grade) for each entry (no matter who gives the grade), and all comments posted appear one after the order (by date). Impossible to distinguish (comments and average grade) between the 2 groups (students and teachers). I'd like to get 2 different average grades (one for each group) and a way to separate comments (students comments in on side, teacher comments on the other side). 2. Is there a way to apply a css to format comments? To change comments policy, background-color, float, and so on (as it's possible to do it with list and entry templates). Thanks a lot!",

The text editor on each page does allow you to upload multiple pictures and of course any text you want. You could even do like I have and install Justin Hunt's new Snippet plugin and create templates to give a consistent look/layout to each photo on a page. I have been using Snippet to make HTML templates that give me the typical layouts that are premade for creating slides in presentation programs such as LO Impress and MS Power Point.",

Can anyone advise if the following behaviors are possible, and if so how? Students will need to be able to review their entry and amend it any time up to the closing date. Some fields need to be populated from the user profile The student should only see the add entry tab within the activity Tutors will need to be able to add data to the students submission which will be included in the eventual export. The application form will be running on a separate site so messing with the core code is a possibility if needed. I have added a tutor comments section in the Add Template and hidden this using CSS , can this be revealed depending on a users role? This site seems to suggest that I could pull values from one database into another but I'm not having much luck with that approach. Any advice gratefully received.",

What I have in mind is a field that would automatically pull the list of students and provide these in the database. I'm guessing that this could be done with JavaScript , but lack the expertise. So, is it possible to create a database activity where one of the fields is a list of students that has been automatically pulled from the class list? If so, can the email address also be pulled? I'm thinking of a teacher being able to provide specific feedback on a presentation. That feedback would then be emailed to the students (and hopefully, go into the gradebook). I know that it is a lot to ask.",

After a teacher uploads a feedback file, student will get notification and the grade will go to Gradebook. In database, teacher can use ##Comment## to give student feedback. Teacher can also give \"Rate\" to each entry and the Rate can be listed in Grade book. Students can use Event monitor to get email notifications.",

We are building courses for learners with very limited computer skills, and at certain points in the course we want them to answer questions for evaluation by teachers. For various reasons, we've concluded a database is the best vehicle for capturing their answers. In order to minimize the need for student navigation and typing, we'd like to provide them a URL link to a database \"Add entry\" form and pre-populate some of the fields of the entry they are adding. For example, a couple of fields we wish to capture are the Lesson # and Question # they are answering, and at the point in the course where they are linking to the database, we know what those are. Linking to the database Add Entry form is easy - something like\n../moodle/mod/data/edit.php?d=3 will get us there. But how do we\npre-populate fields with data? Is there any way to add that data to the URL link to the Add Entry form so as to pre-populate those fields? We would consider alternate means of linking-and-populating, if they exist (would prefer not to use more plugins or JS code, but can if necessary). Thanks in advance for your ideas!",

I have created the fields and built the template, there are only a couple of issues that I am having problems with. The two main problems I am having is that I cannot delete db entries. I used the teacher role and the admin role, but there is no delete option in either of the list views as described in the FAQ. Could the reason be that we are using an older version of the db?

Here's my wish list.... A User enrols into the course. Before undertaking the scorm activity I want them to enter useful data  within the database activity such as their full name, email, and particularly relevant safety certificate details (eg their working at height cert as well as the expiry dates etc.) To really help, can a rule be used within a database to control (for example) if you tick a certain box you are forced to fill in specific fields.? For example I ask \"are you working at height?\" If you tick yes you need to add the cert details. However, If you tick no you can skip these fields and carry on filling in the other fields? Once all this has been done I'm hoping to set up the course to allow the user  to undertake the other training activities but to only allow the student access the certificate once the admin has viewed the users data entered into the database activity, and marked this activity complete  - say if they are happy all information given is in order such as the certificate dates etc. I've been looking through the forum to try and find a similar thread so apologies if I missed this or if I'm asking the question in the wrong place! Any thoughts or advice gratefully received and by all means point me in the right direction if my idea of using the database maybe making things more difficult. Kind regards Darren",

Currently the id and name attributes for database field controls (e.g. input , textarea ) are created with the field database id number, e.g. { 'id=\"field_'.$this->field->id.'\"' }. This is problematic for template javascript, as different instances of the same database preset will have different ids (as each instance has it's own copies of the fields in the database). This can be worked around by adding ids or classes in the Add template, but a better solution would be to use a sanitised version of the field name as a class on its control element. I've a patch (on the issue) that adds these classes for Checkbox, Number, Text, and URL field types. Any thoughts?",

          "Text": "Hello, I have been asked to create an online form for our dissertation students that they would have to complete after every supervision progress report meeting. It is basically a questionnaire, but the difference is that, once students have submitted, the supervisor may be able to edit some fields as well as add comments. Every student can only see their own entries. I thought of trying the Database activity of Moodle, as well as the enhanced version, Dataform, https://moodle.org/plugins/search.php?s=dataform The dataform is a release candidate and I have spotted a couple of problems in the testing, so I prefer not to use it. My problem with the database activity in Moodle 2.2 is that it is a complete nigthmare to update or modify fields within the different templates (Add a new entry/View List/View Single, etc). The templates section in Moodle 2.2.4 is absolutely rubbish: nothing works as it should and it takes me ages to go through all the different templates when I add or modify a field. Because I am desperate, I thought of creating my online form in Moodle: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Form_API but I don't understand this bit: Then instantiate form (in this case simplehtml_form) on your page. What does it mean: 'on your page'? Do I need to create a blank html page in the moodle core code? Any advise is very welcome. Thank you very much.",

I have stumbled across the database tool and it seems to work well for my intended purpose BUT I want to simplify the way that searches are done. I would like the staff members to be able to type in one search term and see a list of results. I would like the search term to work across all fields in the database (there are only 5, two of which are text field, and two of which are drop downs). At the moment, the Advanced Search seems to be the default. It prompts staff to insert search criteria against each field, rather than them searching for one search term across all fields. The simplest way to do this seems to be 'hiding' or at least not make the 'Advanced' search the default option. However, I can't seem to turn it off! Any suggestions? Thanks, Peta",

MySQL has the GROUP_CONCAT function for that.  MS- SQL doesn't have a function designed for that purpose, so the common idiom is to use FOR XML PATH('').  is there a Moodle DML function to do that in a database-neutral way? I've found many posts in this forum where people have been using GROUP_CONCAT, making their code not portable to Microsoft SQL and possibly others.  If such a function doesn't exist in our library, should it be added, so people can use it rather than database specific code?",

          "Text": "> If you think you need GROUP_CONCAT then it is probably a sign that you don't understand relational databases. I started to address that in my original post, and perhaps I should have.  Certainly that's true when you WANT a relational data structure, such as in the business logic, so maybe 80% of the time that it's used, it shouldn't be.  Then there's the other 20%, when it's not being used wrong. The other 20% of the time, when it's actually proper / okay to use in my opinion, fall into two categories, one when it's \"acceptable\", and one when it truly is the best way available. Sometimes, it may be acceptable when both a) you're in the presentation layer and that's what you're going to end up with anyway, and also b) doing it in the query is ten times faster than calling a PHP function in a loop.  A example of that would be as above, a list of users, one column of which is the groups they are in.  If you're writing the UI page to show that (not a library for user info), I think that's acceptable.  In that case, you WANT something easily human readable, you don't WANT a proper data structure any longer. Where it may be the best choice available would be if there were a class called user_list, which does not show the groups.  You want to add a plugin to show the groups. Thankfully, class user_list does offer a method user_list->add_column() to add a cell to each row in the table.  So easy enough to add the \"user's groups\" column, right?  Except add_column() gets you one cell, for one value.  The list of groups isn't a single value, so you can either a) have your plugin return the group list as one value or b) rewrite the exist user_list class to allow each cell to contain an array of values, which it will then concatenate in PHP, accomplishing precisely the same result with far more work. A particular instance of the above type of example that you are familiar with is question_bank_column->get_required_fields() - it expects one field, so GROUP_CONCAT(tags) might be the best way to do it.  The other option would be to get Tim involved in significant changes to how question_bank works, just so you could have a column for \"Used by these quizzes\", or \"has these tags\". Wow I was long-winded in this post, but I don't feel like editing it to be shorter.",

There are existing two extensions of \"dataform view\": one which allows to show the stored data in the course area (mod_dataformembed; that's you are looking for?), the other to show the entry in a block (block_dataform_view). It seems that dataform will be able in short time to export the data content with pdf and watermark ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=216871 ). Maybe that this activity fits your needs.

My query concerns: External database enrolments which cannot be removed automatically. We are using Moodle: 2.3.1 Database driver: mysql Our problem is that enrolments handled by the enrol_database plugin are unable to be deleted manually through the course reset function.  I would really appreciate if anyone would be kind enough to advise whether this is a known problem with v.2.3.1 or whether it might be a problem local to our institution.

My question is around how to inform the Drupal database of a successful or otherwise completion of a quiz. We will use Moodle to offer exams. There will be one exam (quiz) to be paid for, and two that are free. We will create the payment process in Drupal, and inform the Moodle database about course registration when the exam is paid for in Drupal. My question is around setting up the courses and quizzes in Moodle. Since the two free exams are optional, am I better to do them as separate courses, with only a single quiz in them? If I put all three quizzes in the one course, can Moodle notify upon succesful completion of a single quiz? My next question is around creating a module to inform the Drupal database of quiz results. Is there an existing module I can use? If not, would someone point me at a good guide to writing Moodle modules (I'm VERY new to Moodle). Thanks for any help.",

I guess there are some decisions like whether Moodle pushes the data, or Drupal pulls. Also does this happen the moment the quiz is complete, or in batches on cron. The gradebook XML export was designed for this sort of thing, certainly, it is a nice machine-readable format for passing grades around. I don't know how much of the automation is in place.",

When you create the username and password you will have to be careful with the GRANT command. It needs to reflect the IP or name of the Moodle server. E.g. GRANT ...... on moodle.* to moodleuser@192.168.1.99 ..... You also need to have networking enabled in MySQL - if it is already accessed from other machines then you won't have to worry about that. It's usually that GRANT command that's the problem with MySQL and there are some settings in my.cnf that can trip you up. More info: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/access-denied.html",

I've just started learning how to use Moodle (Joule), and just came across the Database activity; so, I'd be happy to hear from anyone who has experience using the activity in the above-described manner, with advice on setting up fields and templates, and perhaps theAdmin issues in getting the database (in a course, I assume) set up for use by al faculy in a department or institution.",

Maybe this is of some use to you http://www.abceducation.ch/mod/data/view.php?id=247 It is specifically designed for our IB Middle Years Programme documentation and as a non logged in user you can see it and search it .If you log in as username  testteacher   password testteacher    you can edit and upload files to the resource tab at http://www.abceducation.ch/mod/data/view.php?d=2&mode=single#page=page-7 Go to the test entry and you will see a file to download Specif and fine grained permissions can be set so some groups can view, others edit and upload. Others design and add templates and field etc. The templates can be edited to what you want. It has a java script and tab. css to give it its form. I am not a web developer but just adjusted this script to my needs. If you want to download the database go here http://www.abceducation.ch/#page=page-6 You can download it adapt it and then put it into your moodle site as a preset. This preset can be made available site wide and makes the database available in different instances in each course. It is an  empty vesssel that can be used for different departments If you or anyone else can use it, adapt it donate to our partner school atthe same adress. Cheers Alex",

We used separate groups so the teacher could comment on the entries including the grade then alter the view template and remove group mode so students could review other's entries without seeing the comments (grade). When students add entries and they are NOT approved they are only able to see their (separate group) entries - this is as expected. However, when the teacher approves entries for a group (say Group 1) all students see these regardless of their group membership (Group 2,3,4 etc) - this is not what I would expect for separate groups (only visible groups) Also regardless of separate or visible groups, the groups dropdown doesn't seem to filter the entries for students or teachers... Is anyone else experiencing this problem with Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090630) ? This could be related to MDL-17652 (unresolved) or MDL-9229 or MDL-18965 (both of which are reported as resolved & fixed respectively). Cheers",

May I ask: why do we need groupid in the database content table? This records, if I understand it correctly, is the group membership AT THE TIME when the entry was made, which has nothing to do with the time the entry is LOOKED AT. Now why would this make sense? Can we not just pull in the group membership from the group_members table when the records are requested? Sorry, but groupid in the database content table looks like a non-normalized design to me. I'll set groupid manually to fix the problem for now and hope that by not changing group memberships all will work from now on. If that is wrong, please let me know. Michael",

In the listview, I'd like the items to become hyperlinks and link to the relevant entry (single view). I'm working with a 'text' field question (in two square brackets) and a 'text area'  field answer (same brackets). I've set the 'text' field to be automatically linked. In the list-template I've entered the following code in html: <a href=\"##moreurl##\"> question </a>   (again 2 square brackets around question). I've worked with this code before in the database module and it's always worked perfectly. Could you tell me if you're encountering the same issue? Thank you",

The following commentary may be useful. moodle_er_diagram Creating an ER Diagram from the log generated at install time. Note that some of the table relationships in Moodle are not strictly relational, i.e. some tables may have multiple value fields and there may be missing primary/foreign key relationships. This will result in a diagram where a table has no link to any other table. However this process may still result in a diagram that is useful to understand the database design. This was done on a Windows/Xampp machine. And MySQL Workbench 5.1.18 Don't do it on any system with important data, it involves truncating (deleting all records from the log) This assumes the use of the My SQL database. It was done using the MyISAM back end. I believe it would work with innodb.

If i click any course I'm 100% positive it has had database activity entries I get none listed. The database activity overview shows a correct number of entries in a course but when I want to view them I get an empty list. I am not sure how long it has been like this, I got notice from one of our teachers just today. If I try to add any entry, nothing happens (no entry is stored). If I try to create a brand new database activity in a course and add a new entry, nothing happens. I've read some tips on how to get rid of this (including saving search settings or restoring database activity template), none of them helped. I even thought there might be an issue with physical Moodle database so I did a dump and ran a search on it and I've found that all the entries are stored in. Thus I think the problem lies within the Moodle guts. Tried to look at user permissions, database activity module settings but have found nothing that would be of help.

This could be the name of your group, but you could give it any name really. Set your database groups property to 'separate groups'. Enter the homework activities being logged in as this 'user'. Now if anyone from that group accesses the database they will see those activies/records whereas they will be hidden from any other group. If you are logged in as yourself and enter an activity that will be seen by all the groups - use that method for activities assigned to all the groups. When you, as the teacher, look at the list of activities you can 'filter' it to show only the activities of one of the groups - or all the activities. You can use the Url field to have links to your Hot Potatoes. When you go to the list of Hot Potato quizzes and right click on the link of the Hot Potato you want to be linked, you can copy the link. Copy that into the Url field. Now you can access the Activity from the database record. Regards Marius",

When using Firefox , the \"View list\" page displays the thumbnails in a series of rows, depending on how many entries there are in the database. However, IE displays the thumbnails in one big, ugly column. Also, the \"View single\" page looks fine when using Firefox , but when you view it using IE the image is no longer centred relative to the viewport. These errors make the preset unusable in my opinion, as most people use IE , not Firefox . I know this is a CSS issue and have tried to fix it by altering the CSS template, but have had no luck in doing so. I'm not sure whether this is due to an error in the CSS code or IE miss-interpreting CSS rules. Has anyone else noticed this? Can anyone out there help me with this issue? Thanks, Marty",

          "Text": "Hello! I am a relative newbie to Moodle, but I have always been impressed by the collegial community and willingness to help. I'm seeking wisdom from those more experienced. I'm trying to decide if the DATABASE or QUESTIONNAIRE module is more appropriate for my needs. So far, I've used neither, and as a disclaimer, I actually haven't downloaded the questionnaire module yet, since I only recently learned of its existence while trolling for information through these forums. I need to collect data on an ongoing basis from a group of graduate students. Here are the particulars: I need the students to record simple data each time they visit a K-12 classroom (e.g. number of pupils, grade level, time spent, activities offered, etc.). Over the semester they may visit several classes a week, so they need to be able to access the module multiple times. It may be helpful for them to be able to search the module, if only to check back for their previous entries (to be sure they have logged in the information, tho that may not be necessary) - which I believe would suggest the DATABASE module. However, the big issue for me is ease of exporting data to EXCEL so that I can produce monthly tallies and summaries for reporting. Thus, what module is recommended? Does one or the other have a \"better\" selection of question options? Greater ease of exporting? FYI - I am using Moodle 1.9.5 Any insight would be gratefully appreciated. Thank you so much.

As Stuart notes, it is not clear whether you are talking about a table in your database (which is an actual table) or database activity module (which makes use of data_records). One comment I had was that the name of the person creating the entry is automatically stored with each record added so you do not necessarily have to ask their name unless you want them to put in a nickname or you were just using that by way of example. All that data_records stores is that someone added an entry. It does not actually store the data in that table. You may want to take a look at the data_content which is related by a join between the recordid field and the data_records' id field. I think if you use something like phpmyadmin to poke around with a sample database that you create you will be able to figure things out pretty quickly. Let me know if this helps or if you have additional questions. Peace - Anthony",

I will simplify the notations here to give you an idea data.id->>data_fields.dataid (an instance of a database activity module can have one or more fields joined by the respective id and dataid fields), data.id->>data_records.dataid (an instance of a database activity module can have one or more records added to it), data_fields.id,data_records.id->data_content.fieldid,data_content.recordid (the content is stored combining the record and field ids - in other words the content for a particular entry's particular field. So, I would start by creating something like: $data = get_record('data','id',$dataid); // where $dataid is the id of database activity module you are working on $datarecord = get_record('data_records','dataid',$data->id,'userid',$USER->id); //get this user's entry $fieldidname = get_record('data_fields','dataid',$data->id,'name','Name'); //get the field record for the Name field in this database $fieldidage = get_record('data_fields','dataid',$data->id,'name','Age'); //get the field record for the Age field in this database $datamyname = get_record('data_content','fieldid',$fieldidname->id,'recordid',$datarecord->id); // get the content record for the Name field by the current user $datamyage = get_record('data_content','fieldid',$fieldidage->id,'recordid',$datarecord->id); // get the content record for the Name field by the current user $myname = $datamyname->content; //get the actual data from the content record $myage = $datamyage->content; //get the actual data from the content record This is obviously not the prettiest way of getting at the data but I hope that it helps to illustrate how the data is stored. Please note that I have not tested this code as it was written solely for illustrative purposes so there may be mistakes in it. In summary, you need to have the recordid and the fieldid in order to get to the content. Let me know if this is helpful to you. Peace - Anthony",

If so, provide a screen shot of where you would like those fields to be and then I can give you a better idea of how to customize your site for those fields. That said, what I would really recommend is creating custom user profile fields which Moodle already provides. This may meet your needs better without having to customize anything.

The particular piece of code which needs modifying is the \n```text\ngenerate_\nsql\n()\n```\n method in the `data_field_text` and `data_field_textarea` classes. The following code is based on Moodle 1.9.3+ (Build: 20081119) —I know we should upgrade, but it has been low priority because it is an internal server . \n```text\n function generate_sql($tablealias, $value) {\n\n\n /*\n\n\n * Original code\n\n\n */\n\n\n // return \" ({$tablealias}.fieldid = {$this->field->id} AND {$tablealias}.content LIKE '%{$value}%') \"; \n\n\n /*\n\n\n * Modified code\n\n\n */\n\n\n $sql = \" ({$tablealias}.fieldid = {$this->field->id}\"; \n\n\n foreach (explode(\" \", $value) as $val) {\n\n\n $sql .= \" AND {$tablealias}.content LIKE '%{$val}%'\";\n\n\n }\n\n\n $sql .= \") \";\n```\n Glancing at the latest code from CVS , it appears that those methods have been modified since our server was installed, so my modifications will need changing. So that seems to work, but it doesn't feel very satisfying. If anyone has a better suggestion—particularly one which does not involve modifying code—I would love to hear it.",

However, seeing the table you're requesting more information about and the fields you mentioned, I'm guessing you might try to get the grades of all courses in which a user has enrolled. To do this, here's the SQL statement I used earlier to get this data. (It took me a while to figure out!)

You can also select course grades for multiple users.

It's used to remember the display state for the course, for example user 123 on course 2345 may have topic 2 visible and all the rest collapsed. An entry is only written to this table when a user visits a course on which they are enrolled. When they are unenroled the record still remains as it's nothing to do with enrolments and used purely for the display. I think what you are trying to do is determine course enrolments. The table you need to be looking at (I think) is mdl_role_assignments. Regards, Lewis",

Basically it is a database of questions that are grouped in several different ways, and if I were doing it outside moodle I would simply present the records in groups a few at a time for input. i.e. question group one brings up q's 1-5, group 2 brings up q's 6 - 12 etc. For reporting I will be wanting to look at the answers in a different order than the way they were collected. Eg. report one is answers 2,4,7,9-12 and so on. This is simple with a database with fields: question, answer, input group, report group and so on. From looking, neither questionnaire nor quiz have this flexibility. Thanks for your thoughts. Ed",

I've added a database activity and when trying to import entries from a csv file, depending on which of the numerous formats and settings I've tried, I get one of two error messages: either get_records_csv failed to read data from the uploaded file. Please check file for field name typos and formatting errors' or could not update record ID xx . When I get the could not update record ID xx message, according to the number of records the database contains, it appears it added one new entry (regardless of how many I tried to import). All that appears, however, are the text fields; the actual record is blank. I've used excel and notepad to create the csv file. I've exported the table as csv from the server where it resides to my local computer, then directly imported into Moodle. I've used every combination of delimiter, etc. I can think of and entered (and not entered) those in the Moodle import dialog window. I've imported through IE and Mozilla (Windows XP), and I've tried to import lots of records and just two records. I've included the field names on the top line and I've excluded them (not that I expected that to work, but you never know). I have held my breath and held my tongue that certain way that sometimes works, to no avail. I've looked at various patches related to database import/export, but it seems I'm current on those (though they would be easy to miss, as I'm cross-eyed now). I can manually make entries with no problem. Any help would be most appreciated. I need this database, but if have have to manually enter the 600-800 records one by one, I may just change careers.

This seems to have had a knock on effect, where the 'edit' icon and the 'Turn editing on' button has disappeared, when I logon as an administrator. I think the fix would be to go into the moodle mysql database, find where the content of the Front Page summary is stored and fix or remove the html code there.

Even if you do end up writing your own custom PHP code. I would still recommend that you organise your PHP code as a gradebook plugin.

We take a look with the developer and in fact the sql request hasn't any ORDER BY parameter...it's a simple SELECT * FROM mdl_comments WHERE ..so he added the field date of creation as the ordering parameter and now all comments are ordered.. I have take a look in Moodle Tracker and forums and haven't seen anything, so maybe it's abnormal we get this behaviour on our server if it works for everyone..

They want to install Moodle and \"forget\". I argue it: This university have a database with courses, teachers, etc. and the university administration maintain it. I want Moodle use teachers, students, etc. from university DB. For example, university create a new student on university DB (this student can use Moodle without create an account), university drop a student on university DB (this student can't login on Moodle). Same with courses, exam timings, teachers, etc. University DB is admin with software developed by university (I can modify it). I think we can modify university software for accés to Moodle DB and create&drop accounts, courses, etc. but I don't know if it can do data inconsistency (probably, isn't it?). Do Moodle have any API to do this? Thanks to read me (I talk a lot, I don't?) if you could.",

However their implementation have changed time to time. Before the 13/02/08 : the 'Required entries before viewing' was working as expected, but 'Required entries' settings didn't do anything. Between the 13/02/08 and the 14/03/08 : both of them did the same actions ('Required entries before viewing') After the 14/03/08 to before the fix is applied : 'Required entries' did what 'Required entries before viewing' should do, and 'Required entries before viewing' did nothing.

The reviews are written by the students, they submit their entry to the teacher, which corrects it if necessary, and then sends it back to the student. If the entry has been approved, it is published and accessible by anyone. We set up a testsystem, to see if this module meets our requirements. Here are our problems: 1. The validation workflow should in fact be endless (correction of the correction etc.). 2. The teacher should be notified when a entry awaits approval (nice to have: message in the news section and/or email notification). We think the db-module is very powerful, and we would like to contribute to it. We both have a specialization in information systems, and are therefore capable of working with php, xml and css and we have help for the javascript . We wanted to ask you what you think of our project, any advice/suggestion is welcome. Thanks and Greetings from Switzerland!",

But we have another (big) problem: an entry can be changed by its creator (student) after it has been approved , which shouldn't be the case - once (definitely) approved, only the teacher should be able to make changes.",

Every user can increase this number up to 1000, which may result in lots of database queries, huge server load and slow loading time. IMO , this number should be settable to a maximum allowed in the preset, which then can never be increased. regards, rob.",

          "Text": "We are running Moodle 1.8.2+. About 2 weeks ago students started to complain about loosing their work (forum posts, discussions, etc). Faculty members started to complain about grades disappearing. After some digging I discovered that field id in mdl_user table does not match field userid in mdl_forum_posts or mdl_forum_discussions or mdl_stats_user_daily tables. Looks like auth_ldap_sync_users.php removed user records from mdl_user table and repopulated them again with different id. Is there an extra field somewhere (like loginname or email or idnumber) that would help me to find a way to link new internal id to an old internal id? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

When a teacher wants to make an entry to the database I need information such as : what course the plagiarism occurred in, which student are you reporting etc. Rather than have them enter all of this manually (which could lead to mistakes and then, via the GIGO principle, weaken the database) I would like to provide them with a drop down list from which to select their courses and the students enrolled in that particular course. I have done similar things before using PHP and mySQL but the database module seems to scrub all of the PHP out of any of the templates I create. I have tried Javascript , but that is client side rather than server side and is not giving me any joy (I'm a javascript noob, btw ). I am sure this can be done. Similar drop downs are provided in many other modules. I just can't seem to get them working properly here. Can anyone help? David",

          "Text": "Hi all, Question time for you all. I've recently been investigating a number of tools to try and replicate the processes used in a physical art gallery, i.e. replicating the following process: 1. a Curator creates a gallery (i.e. a teacher sets up an area for assignments), which would be a template of, for example, three pictures (or other file types) and some descriptive text. 2. the Curator allocates Exhibitors (students) to the gallery based on class lists, which also happen to be imported from Blackboard. 3. Exhibitors upload files into their 'blank exhibit' within the gallery and add some descriptive text. 4. the Curator, other Exhibitors and Visitors can view exhibits in the gallery (a critical aspect is that all images/text for an exhibit can be viewed in one browser window for an exhibit wherever possible). 5. Exhibitors can leave peer review comments at other exhibits (reviews can be seen by the submitting and receiving Exhibitors and the Curator but nobody else). 6. one of a number of Critics (assessors) can assess each exhibit and provide marks back to the Exhibitor (numeric and textual), and these marks form part of their assessment. In an ideal world the peer reviews submitted by students could be assessed along with their own gallery exhibitions. The critical parts of this request are not so much around how pretty it looks, but far more around being able to peer review and critique work in a way that restricts others from viewing these critiques, except of course for teachers... After much soul searching it looks like the database module in Moodle is the best fit for doing this, due to setting up templates for sumbission, providing peer reviews and linking back to a grade book. The question is whether this is the best way to do this task within Moodle? I thought about using the Gallery2 integration but this is more about peer reviewing (and is not necessarily restricted to image files either), and I just can't get my head around the Workshop module. Any feedback welcome!",

How to restrict the viewing of peer reviews - at the moment it doesn't look like there is any way of restricting how comments show up, which is a shame as that is something that is important in this specific case. Unless of course anyone knows a way that I can restrict how comments are displayed in the database module... Anyone? Anyone at all?

Although I haven't got a site I can share I can talk about how I had it set up. First - create a database activity. Second - create a template that has (for eample) a title (text field), two images (two blank image files) and a description (free text field). Third - (optional) modify the 'list view' to not show images - keep that as uncluttered as possible - maybe just exhibit name. Fourth - tinker with the 'single view' to show each individual exhibit however looks best in your situation. Fifth - enrol some students, give instructions and away you go! Students can not only post images/text but also leave review comments and if desired ratings for each exhibit. You can also limit the gallery to one exhibit per user if required. A very neat way around an otherwise tricky problem. Hope this helps! Mark.",

If students are uploading scanned images, pictures, etc. the size of the images varies, but it looks like the database templates limit me to one size, so it seems like images get squeezed and stretched to fit that size. Am I wrong? It seems also like there are limits to places where students can upload images using the editor and resize them. I can't seem to get it to work on any of the modules, actually. I may end up offering a link to Flickr for the students who care a lot about how their images are presented, and since these are art and design students, this may be end up being most of them.

In each module there are permissions (capabilities) that allow you to override some default actions. In this case you might want to override the permission (capability) to mod/data:writeentry. There just don't seam to be enough permissions (capabilties) for all the different roles in the database module. In some modules, the permission (capability) structure has been nicely thought out. So this is a request to the database module developers, please assign permissions (capabilities) to the various actions that exist in the module so that us users can override then if we need to and don't \"hard code\" them in the php.

Basically, students have to enter: student name, book title & publisher, stars rating for the book, a textarea or two of comments/review, and some other information (book level, number of words), etc. First, I'm worried that students can easily edit/delete other students' entries. Do any current database module users have comments about this? (I really don't want to have to 'approve' the entries as it seems needlessly time-consuming). Second: In the future, we'd like to build a BOOK REPORT/BOOK REVIEW system where the database is initially populated with the book information (title, publisher, level, isbn, no. of words), then students add their reports which include a review of the book and a 'stars rating'. Teachers can do lookups on students to see their reviews and ratings; and teachers/students can do lookups on books to see all of the reviews for that particular book. Any comments from experienced moodlers on whether the database module is a good fit for this project? The future hope (beyond the prototype) is to have the database global and accessible to students in many different courses. Thanks!",

More than 500 students are already made \"staff\" and the only thing slowing us is the conversion of the already existing webfolios (from an html format in WebCT or a Word format in MS SharePoint). To have an idea of what I am talking about, you can access the auto-formation flash modules available to our students. It is in French but I am sure you will get the main point (you can skip the first two sections which are local to our institution). From the point of view of a student, when admitted (and for the duration of his-her studies) a template of folders (and sub-folders) is created and many Word (or whatever you decide) templates are made available to modify and populate this folders's structure. Everything is private between each student and authorized teachers. Also, the templates are so universal that students can backup locally everything and re-use it when they leave our institution.

Could you please share how you set your database(s) up for this? I'm intrigued. I hadn't considered doing this, but it would help me immensely. Since I teach elem students, I use an external motivator called Reward Points. Basically, for certain assignments/activities, I have assigned Points. They complete the assignment/activity, they get the points. These points are \"cashed in\" every two weeks for special privileges or prizes. Since completing homework is a major issue with my students, they get points for this. I noticed there was a grading option available on the database module. I had the idea of setting up a Scale called Reward Points and using it. I'm curious, though, where do these \"grades\" show up? If they show up in the gradebook, will they affect the quiz grades there?",

So far so good, however, if the student goes back in to edit the entry after it has been approved then they could potentially add inappropriate content. To prevent this, I think that the approval status should be revoked if the entry is edited by a non-teacher. To address this, I have commented on MDL-5581 and would encourage those interested to vote on it. To prevent entries from getting lost, I think there needs to be another sort option of Approved/Date Entered so that the oldest issues awaiting approval appear at the top of the list. I have also requested the capability to have the database module send an email to the teacher when an entry is add/updated. This would let teachers know when something is needing approval and is similar to the behavior of forums and assignments. It is listed as MDL-8377 in the tracker.",

I'm not sure if my experience is related to your point, but I have set up a research article review database for university students in which they find an article, get permission from a teaching assistant vis a vis the \"appropriateness\" of the article for review, do the review, get graded and then (hopefully), the review is approved and opened up for perusal by other members of class. The problem we seem to be getting is that although the teaching assistant has approved the article as being appropriate for inclusion in the database, she has not approved the actual entry by clicking on the \"Approve\" link. Nevertheless, the article is still released for class perusal even though oftentimes the student has not finished entering data in all the fields. This looks a little like the problem you mention. Being nosy, I might have looked at the record and I am wondering whether simply by opening up the record to look at it, I (or the assistant) have triggered the approval process. Obviously we don't want to have done this, so if we have, we want to be able to revoke the approval. Am I making sense? Rick Danielson",

Issuing an approval and then allowing students to change or update it without reseting the need for re-approval seems dangerous to me (especially in a K-12 environment). For university students I would not be as concerned but can still appreciate the desire to review the appropriateness of a submission. There is no need to worry about simply viewing a submitted entry. You can view it and not approve it; however, once approved it will stay approved. There is no button for un-approving and perhaps that should be included as well. It could be the same field but if the article is already approved then it would have a link to Unapprove. Perhaps a third option of Approve Permanently could be used and that would give teachers the freedom if they wanted to have edited submissions unapproved or not. Peace.",

There seems to be no way to prevent the database entries from being displayed even though nobody has approved them by clicking on the approve link. This looks like a bug or (hopefully) something silly that I have done. I would like to be able to re-approve things or to revoke approval and then re-approve them again, etc. However at this point in my course it's getting serious that I am able to keep them \"unapproved\" until they have been graded.

This can readily be done for new records by editing the options list for this field, but existing records are not changed (not surprisingly, as there may not be a 1:1 correspondence in the order of old and new keywords). We're thus thinking of globally changing existing records to match the new options list for this checkbox field, by directly editing mdl_data_contents. For instance, we could change the table entry (363,54,5,'Economy##Energy##Geology##Habitat##History##Land Use##Planning##Politics##Settlement##Vegetation##Water','','','',''), to e.g. (363,54,5,'##Economy##Energy##Geology##Biodiversity##History##Land Use##Planning##Politics##Settlement##Vegetation##Water','','','',''), in which the term \"Habitat\" becomes the term \"Biodiversity.\" Should we anticipate any problems with correctly accessing and displaying the above, esp. if the new options list is arranged alphabetically and \"Biodiversity\" is higher up on the list than \"Habitat\"? My sense is that what's stored is the actual options list text and not the order in which this option occurs, so if the text is present in the entry then the checkbox will be checked in the browser view no matter where the text is found.",

I haven't thought yet about what to do when it is set up with visible groups. The \"Course\" field type would provide a drop-down menu with courses.

In 1985, I had the great fortune to discover an exceptionally brilliant and robust relational database - DataPerfect, a companion to the legendary WordPerfect - that continues to evolve as an ever-more powerul digital engine; most visibly to generate extensive sets of web pages - see. e.g. habitat.igc.org/faces/ - while compiling and cultivating an extensive body of structured curriculum information, documents, web resources, geographic & hydrographic information, civil society networks, etc. with a focus on sustainability- and peace-related issues. Among its many deatures,  DataPerfect has the ability to export sets of data in virtually any reasonable format, including delimited text format. What I would greatly love to be able to learn is how to export data from DataPerfect databases into MySQL tables in Moodle, so that the relationship between elements of a course and with relevant resources, activities , etc. is  maintained when the information is imported into Moodle. The most fully-developed example that I would like to be able to migrate to a Moodle platform is the site for the Gandhi-King Season for Nonviolence - www.gandhi-king-season.net . The site is conceived as an open source curriculum on nonviolence - with Nonviolent Responses to Terror & Injustice as the most recent theme - and that clearly would, I am convinced, offer far greater learning and teaching opportunities if the curriculum were to be transplanted to a Moodle platform. I have many other questions relating to developing interoperability between DataPerfect and Moodle, Perhas what might be most helpful for me if I could be directed to the best conceptual & schematic overview of the relational structure of Moodle's My SQL tables. I look forward with anticipation to learning about Moodle from a databse perspective. In peace",

I'm posting their requirements here for reference really just so that if anybody just happens to be looking for ways to improve the module at any point, they've got the information. Also, do let me know if any of this is actually possible already! These are the important issues: (1) Data input needs to be verified by user defined criteria.  For example if a student inputs a date of an observation, I want to check that the date is in the past.  I also need to be able to check that values are in certain ranges. (2) I need to be able to read the data from a program or application.  This could be achieved in different ways.  A live link to the actual table using ODBC.  But perhaps a simpler solution would be an automatic download from the table every 24 hours as a comma separated file, or some variation of this (i.e. just download records that have been added). (3) Moodle needs to be able to display ‘live’ data.  For example I should be able to read my data table, create a graph or a map, copy that graph or map to some disk area which Moodle polls at least once a day and updates its website, so the students see the results of their data collection. (4) A nice touch would be entering data by clicking on images too. (2) and (3) would enable me to provide an autonomous solution.  I would write a program which I would schedule to run once a day, it would read the latest data, update its map or whatever, copy it to the Moodle update area and the students would see the results.  I really don’t think anything less than this cuts it.  Just imagine a long running project that collects data from all over the UK.  Can we really imagine that people are going to be happy to copy and paste data out of Moodle into their application and then go back into Moodle to upload some file.  I don’t think that will work in the long run.",

Do you need to to use access for a specific reason? You can use PHPMYADMIN to export from and manipulate the moodle database. Alternatively you can download MYODBC from the My SQL site and set the moodle database up as an ODBC data source. That way you can connect to the Moodle MYSQL database with the MS Access inferface and save it as a .mdb if you like. There is an option to export tables as CSVs in access.",

I have exported the Data Bases contained within MySQL and would like to keep a running record of students which have uploaded evidence to prove they have done certain work and on what date that was. Currently i see there are individual data bases kept seperately holding the Data Base Module information. I've noticed the field in which the students' ID is kept is useful for keeping track of their comments and files which they have uploaded. My query is this. Is there a way to collate Data Bases into a single data base from the data base module. prefferably showing the students ID and all other relevant fields under their ID. such as their comments, files/names of files they have uploaded, date uploaded/commented, etc etc Is possible to change the DB so they are all kept under the students ID?",

I have stopped to develop this contrib module, because there will be other database module (folder is also called data) in 1.6 standard. So, if you use this contrib module in 1.6 there will be problems with standrd version's database module. It's probably impossible to make update script from contrib database module to standard version's database module. I don't recommend that any one will install contrib database module on production server unless you change the name of the module and make 1.6 version by yourself. If someone wants to do that, I am certain that Martin will give the rights to write in contrib/data directory. First you must change the name of the module of course. Teemu",
