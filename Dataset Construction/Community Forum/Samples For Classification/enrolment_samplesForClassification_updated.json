Thanks Joe Database Record Details in the mdl_config_plugins table, where plugin=\n'enrol_database' and name='unenrolaction'.  The record gets a value of 2\nfor 'Disable course enrolment' and 0 for 'Unenrol user from course'.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I using moodle for a series of courses at my university. As I understand the enrollment policy is global for all the courses in the site. One can use the default internal policy, or use an external database , or the paypal option. In any case the choice is  global. For example I cannot choose to give the possibility of freely subscribing to a course and, at the same time, to choose the subscribers of another course from a database. Or for example to have a set of non institutional courses based on the paypal mechanism and other based on the internal policy. I see that this is always possible by using an external database and a set of external applications. Anyway,  a per-course enrolment policy where the enrolment policy can change on a course basis could be interesting. Do you think that a similar feature could be implemented in Moodle, and how to implement it. Or is there some other way to circumvent this problem? Many thanks Michele",

When I assign users to courses in LDAP (by adding them to posixGroups), they are now auto created on Moodle when that user logs in, and in the course I can see who is in which role for that course.

In my case that's partially ok, cause a moodle user can be at the same time a student and a teacher, and a site wide setting could block that.

          "Text": "I am a bit of a noob to Moodle but I am learning it as quickly as I can. The issue I would like some help with exists because I have been asked to put together a site that would handle mass enrolment (and I don't mean 100 students, I mean more like in the millions) as well as allow students to self enroll. As I understand it, the mass enrolment process is best handled using a csv flat file that is then converted to a cohort. However, this particular organization already has multiple other organizations from multiple countries ready to purchase the courses and I really feel like I am asking a lot of them to create a csv file to our exact parameters. At the same time, simply having them send a list of students for us to manually enter ourselves is unrealistic as the number of students we are talking about would require an amount of time that far exceeds the time we have available to manually enroll them. I guess then that my question is, if you knew for a fact that you would be enrolling millions of students in a course from multiple nations at the same time (and a great many of those would be paid for in bulk) how would you handle that while still allowing other students to pay for and enroll themselves? Or am I simply overthinking this?",

I do have to say this new method is absolutely terrible and let me tell you why. I am hoping someone can offer some trick or option that might work better for me moving forward. Let me start by saying what I currently use Meta Courses for. We use them as resource pages where we want to add all Medical students for example into a lab resource page. Another use was for student surveys or messages meant to target large groups of users, lets say all Business students enrolled in courses with a prefix of BUS. In the old Method, the course itself is set to Meta Course and when you get to the point to add the course, you could actually search for courses (let's say by session or program as indicated in the course name) and then add them all at once.  This method was very quick and easy to set up at the beginning of each term. In the new method, the nice thing is that you can have multiple enrollment methods. One teacher enrolled manually and many students from multiple courses enrolled by meta link. The downside is that you can have to add only one class at a time. This becomes a tedious problem when trying to add say 100+ courses at the beginning of each 4 week term.",

They can't get in, since I have enrollment keys for all my courses, but its becoming annoying. Could somebody tell me who these outsiders are, and why they would bother to attempt to enroll in my courses? Are they generated by bots or something? To me it seems a complete waste of time and resources... More importantly, how can I prevent this from happening? It's not serious but it is bugging me. Many thanks for taking your time to answer these questions - I do search, but only rarely do I seem to find effective keywords for finding the answers I want.",

Currently these are all the ways we have for limiting self-registration. If it's any consolation, moodle.org also has tons of users who are not enrolled in any course - people just create accounts in order to have a profile page, or tags, or something else... but don't leave any spam , so their accounts are not detected. I guess they just need to learn a bit more about Moodle to realise their actions are pointless!",

Starting from Moodle 4.4 , there was a change in `enrol/index.php` where the page context is now set to the parent context : \n```text\n$PAGE->set_context($context->get_parent_context())\n```\n This change causes the following issues for our clients: Blocks that were previously added to the enrol/index.php page for a specific course have now disappeared . When adding new blocks, they are now added to the category level , not to the individual course enrolment page. Is there any official reasoning behind moving the context to the parent, or a workaround to restore the previous behavior (keeping blocks at the course context level)?",

But now I have to disable LastPass autofill when working on Moodle, which is REALLY annoying, as I use several test accounts and will have to type the passwords every time I change account. And now I have to go back through the last 30 lessons changing the enrol key to something else. The tracker says that it isn't a Moodle issue, but I've never seen this happen before on other sites.

During launch, we want to disable registration to the previous course, but retain access/availability for enrolled users to finish it. I noticed hiding an enrolment method locks out all enrolled users from viewing the course even though it's available. This is similar to 195349 except the notion \"teachers locking themselves\" concluded in suggestions to prevent teachers from clicking hide on enrolment methods. My issue is the same, except I'm looking for ways to keep access/availability for enrolled users. Changing course availability also blocks our users from accessing it.

I am using moodle version: Moodle 1.9.10 (Build: 20101025) I have set up a Metacourse with two children courses as I wanted to allow for two different amounts to be paid. We are enrolling both Indian students as well as foreign students into our course. I have created two course payment options on the front page , one which links to the childrens course and is paid in U.S. Dollars, the other which links to the other childrens course and is paid in Indian Rupees. In testing out the system, with my test student account I ordered both courses. I received the payment notification just fine for both, here comes the issue: as far as I can tell, so did every other authenticated user registered on our site! How do I know this? All of my coworkers have received a copy of the payment notification, they are all authenticated users. I also received an email from a friend in the states (I am in India) who is registered on our site who also got a copy of my payment notification. So here comes the question: What setting do I need to turn off in order for this to not happen when every user we have orders their course. I went into permissions and noticed that they were turned on for \"receiving new order notification\" and \"receive invoice copy\". I turned them off and then test ordered another course. My coworkers still received a copy of my payment notification. I have also searched forums and google rather thorougly for a solution to this problem but have yet to find any reference to it. I would appreciate any help which can be offered. Thanks in Advance ~T",

Because disenroling a student from a course will delete their work and our student enrolment status may flucate in the begining of the term and we do not want to delete any data.  Do deal with this I have customised the imsenterprise code and capabilities to support teachers disenrolling students that are not in the ims xml.

So for example, once a student has self-enrolled into the course, then they should be able to enroll again using paypal or some other enrollment method. When I set this sort of system up, moodle automatically directs the student back into the course they are already enrolled in when they try to go to the enrollment url. I imagine there is a piece of code somewhere saying that students that are already enrolled into the course should be redirected back into the course, bypassing the second enrollment page.

What we encountered is that our college have more than 1000 classes (in moodle courses) each term. We employ an external DB to sync courses and enrollments, then use metacourse-link to deal with classes of the same teacher and metacourse. But the teacher have to manage multiple moodle courses (even being hidden) and the student have to accept two courses (one meta, one child), for large classes the grouping is also difficult to distinguish among several child courses. But if students were stored into cohorts (according to classes), then grouping is very easy for each cohort enrollment instance. So, does someone have similar needs and ways to create cohorts automatically (through CSV or external DB)?  Or if moodle future  include such features? Any suggestion is appreciated.",

This role needs to be able to do all the other things a student can do (post to forums, give and receive feedback, messaging, etc.) therefore guest access is not appropriate. I understand that enrolment methods are course based not role based but form the forum questions I've read (and not found a solution), this is a fairly common requirement.  Could a role be based on the guest role but have student rights? Solutions would be greatly appreciated.",

The issue being that our SIS doesn't store the student's Moodle id, and therefore we need to be able to gain access to the id via a known variable. I suppose we could create a workaround by making the user creation script pass the user id back to the SIS, but that won't help for accounts created via other means than the API. As well as enrolling the user, we also need to add them to a group, but that will hopefully come easily once we have the user id. Many thanks in advance, Paul",

          "Title": "Enrolment by database - have to manually enrol as well",
          "Text": "Hi all, I've been trying to get enrolment via an external database working. Initially I was having problems with \"Weird user error\" messages, but this was resolved by downloading a new version of enrol.php from this thread: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=12670 (file posted by James M.) However, it is still not working as I expected: 1) If a user logs-in and their details appear in the enrolment database for a course, they still can't log in (\"manual enrolment is disabled\") unless an admin has gone into the course and manually enrolled them, in which case they can access it fine. 2) However, if their details have been removed from the enrolment database, they can't access the course even if they have been manually enrolled by an admin. Clearly therefore, moodle is seeing the enrolment database and utilising it (otherwise manually-enrolled users would be able to access the course anyway). Anyone got any idea what is going on? Should I download the Branch Release or the enrol.php file from it. Config: \"Allow internal methods\" is disabled The enrolment table is compared to the \"shortname\" field for the course. Thanks for anyone's help, Richard Anderson",

Typically, Moodle’s payment plugins integrate with individual payment gateways, such as PayPal, Stripe, and others, allowing users to pay for courses through their selected provider’s platform. However, my goal is to provide a more flexible solution by enabling multiple payment options on the payment selection page for courses with \"Enrolment on payment\" enabled. Specifically, I would like to display options such as installments, iDEAL, SEPA, and other payment methods directly within the payment selection modal. I would greatly appreciate any guidance, suggestions, or resources that could help me achieve this functionality. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.

For example, in a class 5 extra students are enrolled (according to cron output). They are not listed as being in the course in the XML file that was processed then. There appears to be no real relation between the students -- 2 are in another class together, 1 is not even in the XML anywhere, and 2 are in different classes. I'm baffled. Anyone experience this?

However, we've just created our new students for the year, and they weren't automatically imported. I tried running auth/ldap/auth_ldap_sync_users.php manually and got the message \"No users to be added\". However, when a new user logs in, it authenticates them and imports their data without a problem. It just wont find them automatically, which we need it to do so we can import their enrolments. Does anyone have any suggestions at where to look for the problem, either in Moodle or in the LDAP tree itself? The bulk of new accounts were created in a different context to the existing ones, but there were some created in the same contexts as before that don't show up.",

To find out more about this Gateway, please go to: http://www.paymate.com.au What you need to do: Copy the attached zip file to your harddisk - paymate.zip. unzip the files. you will see that the files are already in the directories that you need to create and/or copy them into. after all files have been unzipped, copy/ upload the files to your website, don't forget to make a paymate directory under moodle/enrol. You may also wish to change the wording in: moodle/lang/en/moodle.php for the wording which appears when the student has paid for their enrolment. once uploaded, run admin to activate database e.g. http://www.mywebsite.com/moodle/admin . Then login to moodle and go to enrolments under admin to select your new enrolment plugin. If you have any problems, please let me know? Kind Regards Penny Lord",

Currently, there are nine teachers managing the instruction with help from guest lecturers and tutors. Soon we will be introducing an online writing feedback element so that students can get feedback on individual writing samples they submit. Enrollment is the first issue we need to tackle. I'd like some advice about how to set the course up so that a student can only choose one of the Business English 1-8 courses, while maintaining the ability to take the courses out of sequence, and filter them through a metacourse (e.g. Business English 2) to a child course (e.g. Mr. Lange's Business English 2 10:00-12:00) with a self-enrollment that would prevent them from simultaneously self enrolling in other courses in the metacourse. In other words, I need to allow them to choose their instrcutor/class time while not allowing them to enroll in multiply child courses or metacourses (e.g. Business English 2 and 3) within the same semester. Could someone with experience in this sort of set-up help with advice about the architecture needed? Thanks, I hope this hasn't been covered before. I did use the search feature but didn't find what I was looking for. Best wishes, Ned",

Our moodle site is an open suite of six SCORM packages. I have put the SCORMS on the front page so that when a visitor comes to the site they can see them right off, and when self enrolling, they can jump right into them. I am not using any kind of course structure. While self enrollments can do the activities , we cannot see if they have completed the SCORM activities in the reports unless they have been manually assigned the student role in that SCORM activity. We need to be able to track some specific users but not everyone who comes to the site. I have fiddled with settings to try and get anyone who self enrolls to automatically be assigned student in all six front page SCORM activities but to no avail. Is there a way to achieve this? I do not want to use a course structure because I have built the eLearning based on exploratory and intuitive learning so the idea is the icons are scattered about the page, they can complete them in any order, but just need to finish all six to be considered as having completed the eLearning. I hope someone can point the way. Thanks!",

We have had hundreds of problems with the confirmation email that is sent out as part of the email self-registration process. Recipient email servers unpredictably block Moodle's automated emails as spam , AOL will not deliver ours at all, GMail sporadically rejects them. We have worked and worked to prevent this, without success. Our email server does not appear on any of the major spamblocker blacklists, but Moodle's automated confirmation emails are, nevertheless, often rejected. Here's what I think I want to do. Is it feasible? Is it possible? -- I want to to have students sign up using the email based self-registration, fill out a ReCAPTCHA, and go straight to Paypal, without having to respond to a link in a confirmation email first. The ReCAPTCHA and Paypal should keep spammers from going any further, right? The confirmation email does nothing except confirm the email address of the student enrolling, right? Am I missing anything? Is this a plausible approach to enrollment for courses like ours that use Paypal? Can it be done? Is there some other magic we can apply to get our confirmation emails to go through and not be blocked by spam catchers?",

I can't figure out what we may have done to cause this, and am hoping someone will have some insights. Students are still able to access courses they self-enrolled in even if self-enrollment is disabled (in Enrollment Methods). It's my understanding that in 2.4.8, self-enrolled students should no longer be able to access a course once self-enrollment has been disabled (this is how it works on a local server I'm running). It's possible that we may have done something to our installation beyond what can be configured in the administration options, but before we begin to investigate this, I want make sure there isn't something obvious I'm overlooking. One other piece of info... when self-enrollment is enabled, students can unenroll themselves from a self-enrolled course (that's how the student role is configured). But when self-enrollment is disabled in Enrollment Methods, and students are still able to access the course, the option to unenroll is no longer present. Thanks very much in advance.... Brian",

According to the definition of the \"moodle/course:view\" capability in http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Capabilities/moodle/course:view , a user with this capability should be able to view this course without being enrolled, but the behaviour seems to be opposite. The current behaviour is that if the user has never been enrolled in this course, then s/he will not be able to view this course. But if s/he has enrolled in this course before (even the enrollment has turned off after), s/he will be able to view the course. I think the correct behaviour should be if the user has this capability (moodle/course:view) set to allowed, s/he should be able to view this course whether or not s/he is enrolled. Thoughts?",

          "Text": "I have had a situation happen twice to me in quick succession where: A user has gone to pay for a course (using Stripe), but has run into issues (not sure what exactly), and they have finally paid for the course more than 2 hours after their last interaction on the Moodle site (based on the logs for that user). The consequence of this, is their session has then timed out, and as a result the payment hasn't been allocated to the user that has paid, but instead is allocated to the generic user id = 1 (the default guest account). This means the user that has paid isn't enrolled onto the course, even though they have paid for it, and no other users can now purchase the course, as the fact there is a guest user effectively enrolled on the course, means that anyone else coming to the course will be able to access it as a guest, and therefore misses out the enrolment screen for the course. Note - the course doesn't have guest access enabled as an enrolment mechanism. The first time this happened, we were using this plugin to manage the enrolments: https://moodle.org/plugins/enrol_gwpayments I assumed the issue was plugin based, so switched to the core enrolment on payment mechanism, but it happened again, so I assume this is not plugin related, but is due to the fact that when paying by Stripe, the payment window is effectively a new page, and this can still take money of someone even if their main Moodle session behind the scene has closed. Is there any way I can stop this from happening again in the future? The implications of this are massive, as I have people accessing the course as Guests who haven't paid, a user who has paid but isn't properly enrolled onto the course, and loss of sales due to other people not being able to purchase. We are using Moodle 4.5",

          "Text": "Hi John, The accreditation from the awarding body for my elearning site customisations was for IOSH - Institude of Occupational Safety & Health. I believe OSHA is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is pretty much the American equivalent to the HSE - Health and Safety Executive and IOSH combined from my understanding. I am unsure of OSHA's particular requirements to satisfy compliancy for elearning courses. You really need to ask them directly, however I would suspect that OSHA would prefer a SCORM elearning format, but don't quote me on that (we don't use SCORM btw ). The main issues for my part was ensuring that on-line examinations were in their words 'un-cheatable' which I satisfied by creating an on-line exam module based on the lesson module. Some changes were made for to prevent users accessing any other site contents whilst the examination was underway. That IS of course only applied to each users individual elearning account and IMO is not an effective way of prevent cheating as no-one is necessarily around to invidulate examination attempts. Unless of course the exams were taking in a controlled environment. Again my opinion was quashed as it is left for the tutors which marks the exam attempts to filter those students which have 'word for word' perfect answers. Due to the marking criteria the modle answers are worded in such a way that is unnatural for a human to phrase, so it becomes very obiovus when a user is somehow 'cheating' based on these modle answers. The modle answers are particularly concise, almost bullet points even for essay (long answer) type questions/answers. They were also particularly interested in interactivity for questions / quizzes within the content. I had (again) created another module based upon lesson mod and integrated new questions types that are found within the HotPot module, which allowed for drag & drop, jumbled sentence and a number of other question types not natively found within the lesson module. So i'd really look in to securing your site while students are under going examinations and making sure you have plenty of interactivity, however you wish to acheive this. We recently had an audit by IOSH and have recoded an upgraded version of our customisations from a 1.6.4 to a 1.8.8 moodle. IOSH were very happy with how we handled everything in terms of administration and we have built up a good relationship with them. They did stipulate that ALL exam attempts should be recorded, even the failed attempts, which we were not doing until our recent audit. Apparently we had a 100% pass rate, the highest out of any accredited provider. The reason for this is due to that fact that with the courses we provide students are allowed to reattempt if they have failed so long as a 10 day grace period is adhered to before a re-attempt. This effectively meant that we simply informed the students they failed and could retake a different exam in 10 days. As we send a monthly report to IOSH containing the results it was only the passing students that were sent as failed attempts were removed from our system; and any failures were not required to be sent. Originally IOSH did not stipulate they required ALL attempts pass or fail until our recent audit. I must say though, the inital accreditation was particularly difficult to satisfy and IOSH were very thorough in testing our elearning site in terms of both technical requirements and course content. They did however provide great feedback as to what exactly they wanted to see in the elearning site and their suggestions for improving content. Once the accreditation was gained everything has pretty much been smooth sailing .... I'm not sure if i can help you further, but you can always ask and I'll see if I can shed any light from my experiences. PS. Sorry for the length of time taken to responde, i've only just spotted your query. All the best and I hope you can satisfy their requirements. We have had an interest in providing OSHA courses ourselves and would be very interested to know what you find. Perhaps a collaboration may be good idea? Steve",

I have sent one of my managers to the OSHA Outreach Trainers Course and interested in providing the 10 Hour General Industry course.

          "Text": "Not every enrolment method has a 'max enroled user' setting. So limiting all enrolment methods will not be that easy. One sample is the enrolment on payment: what will your plugin do if 2 users pay at the same time for the last seat? You will have to implement a refund for the person who lost. Another sample is the enrolment on course completion: you promise your students that if they complete Course A, they will be enrolled in Course B. But then your local plugin pops up and shows that the user completed the course but the maximum is reached, so the student cannot access Course B. Have also a look at the Cohort enrolment method, how will you implement a maximum when this maximum should be defined in the cohort? There is indeed not a \"before user enrol event\", first the enrolment record is created and next the user_enroled is fired. So you could modify the core code to implement such an event. but I have the impression this method will add more frustration than functionality, if students take the step to access a course, you should encourage them, not show some discouraging message like \"Maximum number of students reached\". Why do you not remove the enrol permissions (for each method) for these teachers?",

Since our school is over 50,000 students, doing this by hand is not an acceptable proposition.  As far as I can tell, I should upload this via the Upload Users screen, but I have a question (we're live; I don't wanna screw anyone up). If a student has reset their password, and I upload with \"update existing accounts\" set to \"yes,\" will the system update ALL fields, including the students' passwords?  Also, does moodle REPLACE the contents of \"course1\" if it's new?  In other words, if the student was uploaded once and \"course1\" was set to CIS101, then they added CIS102 and got uploaded again, will they be unenrolled from CIS101?

So you want guest access on all of your Moodle except you want the teachers to log in so they can put work on? Bearing in mind that with guest access anyone can see your courses - and that all you can do is put static resources on for them to read/watch (and nothing interactive such as forums or quizzes) if you go to site admin>users>user policies you can set your Moodle to autologin guests -and then you need to make each course in its course settings \"open to guests without the key\" However, I am not sure you mean this really.. is it perhaps 2) you only want your students to be in one particular course rather than assigned system wide? If your students are going to have safe (private)access to any course then they need to be enrolled onto your Moodle - but once you have created them a login you can then assign them manually to the course you want them in (course admin block>assign roles>student) What you don't need to do (in fact, shouldn't do)is assign them the role of student globally via site admin>users>permissions>assign system roles - this just makes them students throughout the whole of your Moodle and is not necessary. 3) Alternatively, just manually create Moodle logins for them and let them enrol themselves on their chosen course, rather than you do it.",

Alternative I you have PHPMyAdmin installed you can import the profile amendments only thru a CSV 'in file' (select the users table in PHPMyAdmin and then select Import) change the fields delimited by ; to , (CSV= Comma Seperated Values)",

Where my problem comes is that we use external database enrolment using the ID field, but we have a number of course IDs.  Unfortunatly, you can only put one ID in the course, so we once again use Meta to create a number of 'empty' courses with ID numbers which enrol the students, then meta those the the home page course, so we have the set up like below. ID course 1    ID course 2    ID course 3 Main home page course Unit 1    Unit 2    Unit 3    Unit 4 What I was hoping is that the enrolments from the ID course would flow through to the main page, and then the meta link from the units would take the enrolment form the Main page (which came from the ID courses) This isnt happening on our Moodle and i want to know if this is a limitation on moodle or a bug?

When a new user purchases access their are enrolled in a course and set to expire after a set time period (usually one year) but may renew for successive periods if they choose. Here is my question: what happens to the users' data when they are \"un-enroled\" from the course? I am asking the question because based on what I read in the forums and elsewhere quite -- quite consistently I might add --  is that if the action on expire is set to \"unenrol\" then all user data (quizzes, assignments, grades, completion, etc.) will be PURGED! We would like to make sure that all the users' data is PRESERVED and that any user may re-enrol at any time and pick up where they left off. Is this possible? What is actually happening when a user is \"un-enroled?\" We have tested this and we find that we can un-enrol a user, then re-enrol them a day later and they seem to recover all their work -- including their completion data. So what actually happens seems to run counter to what everyone says will happen. (We do have disablegradehistory unchecked and gradehistorylifetime set to \"never delete,\" which may be helping.) However when they are un-enroled they disappear from the gradebook and all of our course reports. (As if they never existed, which is not desired.) Heading off the suggestions... we have also tested changing the action to \"disable course enrolment and remove roles.\" However, this seems to be even worse because re-enroling users requires two manual actions: changing the user from \"suspended\" to \"active\" and (re)assigning them the role of \"student.\" I can see no advantages to this method over \"unenrol.\" Am I missing something? What is our desired action? When a user \"expires\" they should no longer have access to the course. However, we would like to maintain their grades, activity, assignments, etc. for two reasons: 1) to run usage reports that accurately reflect course activity, and 2) to allow them to re-enrol at a later date and pick up where they left off. Is this outcome possible? If it is, I have yet to find the solution. Thanks so much for your help!",

          "Text": "I have an update to my own question. We are testing amember to control member access to moodle (as our ecommerce back end). If you're not familiar with amember, they have a Moodle plugin that allows it to connect directly to the Moodle database. Essentially it can tell Moodle which courses to give a user access to. We have tested setting enrolment expiration action (in manual enrolments) to \"unenrol,\" \"disable and remove roles\" and \"keep user enroled.\" In each case, the outcome is the same : when their subscription expires in amember, their access to the course is removed and they are removed from course reports. When they renew or re-subscribe their access is restored and all their old posts, grades and activity are restored. Am I barking up the wrong tree by focusing on manual enrolments? We don't have ANY other enrolment plugins activated, so I had assumed this one was controlling expiration actions. But perhaps all this time we've been bypassing manual enrolments anyway? If anyone has any insight I would appreciate it. I wonder if the outcome is different if we set the user to \"expire\" in moodle? Again, our preferred action is that the user data is always maintained after expiration and restored upon renewal.",

All my users are simply sitting below the 'Moodle' OU. I'm getting nowhere with actually enrolling people in courses, and I'm struggling with getting my head around how to create that. I think I just need to create groups under 'Student' and 'Teacher' to match each of my courses. Should they be global groups or universal groups? Security groups or distribution groups? What should their naming structure be taken from? Also, I can't create a group of the same name under both student and teacher; what am I doing wrong with that?

In our case, we have several videotime videos that are \"hidden\" activities for students, but then referenced from within a content page inside a lesson by ID number of the hidden items.  The lesson can play those videos and the student has full visibility of the lesson.  When we copied our courses for this year from last year's courses, the videotime videos get copied into the new course as well (and receive new ID numbers).  The new lesson, referenced the previous course's videos.  Because our admins have access to all the courses, we never saw this error popup, and the videos played right away for us.  However, a student only enrolled in this year's course, would see the error because they are not enrolled in the previous course (where the video is being referenced.) The fix was to go into the current lessons, and update the video reference IDs in the content pages to point to the current course's video assets. For what it's worth, This error can also appear if you have a block like a calendar, or message block, set to appear inside your course content, that the user doesn't have permission to access. In short, it's telling you that something your page is calling is outside the permissions scope of that individual user.  A tricky little issue to diagnose unless you're logged in as a student.  I hope that helps someone out there!",

So if you turn the setting off (never) then even new users that have never logged in will NOT be un-enroled, but will be left in the courses they were in. If you are using email based self-registration there is a seperate setting to delete unconfirmed users, but once they are confirmed, the above setting takes over. Christopher- What I belive happens, is if the longtimenosee setting is turned on, and the student/teacher has not logged in for that period of time, they will be un-enroled from the courses they were in. I am pretty sure they can still log into Moodle, but just can't access any courses any more. You would either have to manually re-enrol them or they would have re-enrol themselves into any courses that they need to be in. To answer your question (or what I think you are asking), yes the enrolment recordset is deleted and no a flag is not set, meaning there is no way (that i'm aware of) to see what courses they were enroled in but are now not enroled in.",

If you place the mouse over it then you get a popup that says \"Self enrollment\".  However, this is not clickable.  I am not sure if it should be or if it only notifies that this course allows self-enrollment.  If I click on the link to the course I am sent to a log in page but again there is not a button that says \"Enroll me in this course\".  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Some students enroll in all three courses, and if they successfully complete all 3, there is an overall certificate that they receive. I am planning to create a 4th course that contains the overall program certificate activity, which will be available once the other 3 courses have completed. I believe this will work OK but the part I am uncertain about is whether there is a way to automatically enroll students in that 4th course once they have completed all three courses. The complexity is that they can complete the required courses in any order, so it's not as simple as relying on sequence. We are using competencies in the courses but I have not found a way to use competency detection to control enrollment. Thanks for any assistance or guidance you can suggest!",

I tried to achieve this by using the customint2 and customint3 for in enroll table for storing other prerequisites and shifting their previous values to customint4 and 5. And in the classes/observer.php I did this: public static function enroluser(\\core\\event\\course_completed $event) { global $DB; // Get the event details $userid = $event->relateduserid; $completedcourseid = $event->courseid;  // The course that just triggered the event (customint1). // SQL to get the enrolment instances that require course completions $sql = \"SELECT * FROM {enrol} WHERE enrol = :enrol AND status = :status AND customint1 = :customint1 AND (enrolstartdate = 0 OR enrolstartdate < :now1) AND (enrolenddate = 0 OR enrolenddate > :now2)\"; $params = [ 'enrol' => 'coursecompleted', 'status' => ENROL_INSTANCE_ENABLED, 'customint1' => $completedcourseid,  // The course that has just been completed (this triggers the check).

Later on I deleted the extra roles for them being obsolete in the future and with the hope to get student back into the options using the standard-set of roles. Now for the Setting enrol_self | roleid I have only manager, teacher and non-editing-teacher left as options, still no student. How can I fix this? This is a major problem since one wouldn't want to have every student enrol as teacher or manager! In the dialog for manual enrolments I get no option to enrol as student either... Can I prevent this bug by changing something in the 1.9 environment before Upgrading or fix it in the upgraded 2.03-environment later on? Sincerley, Andreas",

Their courses are all in the Physics category and they can choose which courses to do via self-enrolment.

And now, the problem: One of our clients has a moodle installation that authenticate users via LDAP . The fact is that they don't know (neither do I) why users cannot enrole themselves on a course. They aren't using LDAP for enroling users. Teachers manually enrol each student in the course, but they would like to allow authentcated users to enrol themselves on courses. Could it be the configuration of user enrolment being set to LDAP instead of Internal? (I'm not sure of this, but I'll try to find the actual configuration) By the way, Is it possible and what are the implications of setting the enrolment to Internal and the authentication to LDAP? Thank you very much in advance, V.",

The database is therefore not even slightly authoritive for courses - there are many courses that will not be in the moodle site and that's ok. So, I really don't want to see those messages. I certainly don't want students to see them. I'm thinking of fixing this along the lines of: * Log the messages (to the log) and add some sort of interface to display them (like failed logins). However if every student logging in causes 100s of skipped courses logs (as we would here) that might not be good. * Tie the messages to the debugging level and tidy up their appearance. I am leaning towards the latter - any thoughts?",

I added the following changes if anyone has ideas for more pleas speak up: Set course template per course (This allows handling of different terms, school etc in different ways) Set Startdate (this one just seemed obvious, we use Moodle for in class course pages as well which are tied to a date.) Link cross listed, joint courses from the database (I realize this may not be the best way to do it however database enrol already created courses so it seemed a logical step that will save some time some code was used from the block created previously.) If these improvements fit your school please vote it up so we can get them tested and added to the core. Again if you have further ideas we could add more. Jason",

I think that I have a basic question, however I could not find an answer in the documentation or the forums. My question is this: I have an external system that is capable of supplying user information and course (username, firstname, lastname, password and courseId) and load it into a discrete database table. What I would like to do is use the enrollment plugin and connect it to the database to reference and/or load these students.  I would prefer that Moodle upload this data and become the authority. Is this possible?  It seems as though there is a separate plug in for authentication and one for enrollment, however I would like to do it by populating the table once. If this cannot be done, what is the proper way/sequence of actions that need to be performed to retrieve data from a separate database.  We have complete control of the design of the database, therefore we can create several tables if necessary and design the table to any specification. Perhaps I am missing something in the documentation, however it looks to me like the enrollment through an external DB requires that the student is already setup in Moodle.  Also, I hope that I have framed the question appropriately as I am unsure of underlying Moodle processes. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Peter",

It was a very straight forward process and the documentation was very good. I have one additional question that I think I know the answer to, however I am hoping that perhaps there is a way around it. Is it possible for an student that is externally enrolled through the database can setup a course expiration similar to a manual enrollment? For example use a course setup to be used for manual enrollment to expire in 30 days is also enrolled through the external database process and all users, regardless of their enrollment method would expire in the 30 days identified. From what I can see, I would have to run a cron job every day and suspend the manually  enrolled users.  This is less desirable as I would also have to manage courses of variable expiry dates (and related emails). If you know a better way, it would be greatly appreciated. Peter",

Related to security, what is the best/most appropriate owner, group, and permission for Moodle files? Currently, the owner and group appears to be apache.apache for most of the binaries.  Given that apache is owned and grouped by apache.apache, what is the best recommended owner and group of the files in the installed directories?

We have courses linking to other courses having more than 1 000 students. \n```text\nSELECT COUNT(id) FROM mdl_enrol WHERE enrol='meta';\n```\n 593 meta-course enrolment method used. \n```text\nSELECT COUNT(id) FROM mdl_enrol WHERE enrol='meta' AND timecreated > UNIX_TIMESTAMP ('2020-03-16');\n```\n 106 meta-course enrolment method created since i saw the big time needed to execute. enrol_meta\\task\\enrol_meta_sync execution time evolved from 240s (4 minutes) on 03/16 in\nthe morning to 1000s the evening, then 1800s on 03/18, 4000s on 03/22,\n5800s on 03/31, 7200s on 04/10, and 11000s today... If i can't find any solution, i plan to execute this task only in the nigth, to avoid charging server all day long. Is there any risk, appart from enrolments not being done since next day?

That behaviour makes the execution of the task longer than expected and inserts a lot of non-meaningful registers to the log (and then it leaves the enrolments just the same). If you find any recently created/modified disabled meta-enrolment methods on mdl_enrol it may be the reason of your issue. Cheers.",

And when you mean Moodle 3.7, i suspect you mean from Moodle 3.7 (and still in 3.8 and 3.9)? Talking about \"disabled\", do you mean enrolment method installed on a course, but \"greyed\"? There was a bug like this previously, but it should have been corrected by MDL-52186 some years ago. For what i see on my Moodle (3.7.6), it creates lot of enrollments, and then deletes them, leaving related users not enrolled. I've not found (for the moment) which enrollments are created/deleted like this. Do you have some pointers on other discussions or tracker item about that? And perhaps a good idea/solution? This is a real pain for us. Séverin",

Here's what I'm trying to do: I've put together several courses for different groups, each of whom have a separate enrolment key.

I need to know how many people at least went in (i.e., viewed) with that key. I've tried everything I can think of and keep getting \"nothing to display\", even though I know people are using the key to get in. I can see in the logs the number of hits, but that could be people going in several times. Is there any way to do this?",

Guests don't use the enrollment keys because enrollment keys only pertain to proper enrollment of normal users using self-enrollment. Once used and enrolled, the enrollment key is not needed again by that user. The password you set for Guest access on a course is separate from that (and should be different.) The way to get information you want is from the site logs. You could search the logs for that specific course for guest access and then by counting the number of unique IP addresses, you will have a rough number of distinct accesses to that course. (Provided of course you are logging guest access, which you should be). If your site is using something like Google Analytics, that will give you similar data.",

Issue 2: If I remove a student from the root student group they are prompted to \"enroll\" when they go into the course.  If they click \"Enrol me in this course\" and then click \"Yes\" the screen will refresh back to the module but will not enrol them. Alternatively if I assign a Key to the course, they enter the key CORRECTLY and I get the same results.  It just asks over and over for the key. - This almsot seems like some sort of permission issue?  Is removing a student from the root student group the problem?  Is this not best practice?

Before trying to tackle issue 2 it might be worth sorting issue 1 - make sure that your default user in site admin>users>permissions>user policies is set to \"authenticated user\" and NOT student you do not have any students assigned the role of student globally via site admin>users>permissions>assign system roles That will stop them being automatically enrolled. As for issue 2 - what are the settings for your courses? In the course administration block>settings of the courses? Are they set to allow guest access? Just a thought - because once you have sorted out issue 1 then students should be able to enrol or enter a key and get into the course, and if they cannot, it suggests there is something amiss with the set up of the courses. Alternatively -though I don't know if this would apply to you -you could enrol the students yourself into their courses directly via a flat file so they dont need to self-enrol.",

Always very helpful, thanks for your suggestions. 1.  I have double checked that the user policy is set to \"authenitcated user.\" 2.  So it is best practice to remove students from the root student group.  I'll make sure to keep doing this. 3.  I have some courses that are allowing guest access and some that don't.  It seems as though now that I understand that issue 1 I've already sorted out issue 2 is really a problem. I don't have any strange settings set up in the course as far as I know.  Other than what was suggested what would cause students not to enroll themselves or use a key to enrol? I CAN enroll them manually through each individual course but I'm REALLY hoping that I won't have to do that and instead just use the enrollment keys, manual enrolement.

As example: Cohort 1 -> Course 1 Cohort 1-> Course 2 Cohort 2 -> Course 3 Cohort 2-> Course 4 And so on and so forth, there will NOT be more than 1 cohort enrolled to the same course only 1->1 As you probably figured out already, each cohort will be enrolled to 15 courses. So making this manually will be a pain. Is there a faster way to do it? I'm thinking CSV but any other technique is welcome. Thanks!",

At the moment we have no automated enrollment running.  We do use our own plug-in but it has been off for a few weeks now.  So manual is the only method at the moment.  I can see in the course accees logs that students were in the course until 12:51 AM.  But today the roster is empty. I have nightly backups of the database and a full copy of the site from a few weeks ago.  This course shows all the students in the backup (of course).  When I check for the records in mdl_user_students with the ids for the enrollment entries I can see in the backup, they're of course not there. This might be happening more than we know as the auto-enrollment would have corrected these drops in the past. Auto-enrollment will be back on soon.

The only pattern I can find is that the enrolments were all from Feb 2016 when the courses were likely created. The data is not in the enrolment database and because the students are auto-enroled by the external enrolment plugin I can't manually delete them either. We meta-link a number of courses and some of these phantom enrolments are only 1 or 2 students per course but add up to whole classes worth in the meta classes. This is causing issues with course messaging and emails out going to the wrong people. We are on Moodle 3.1.2 20160929",

The only solution to this error that I found is to manually enroll the user without defining starting and ending dates, then edit the enrolled user's starting and ending point and that will work. Is there anything I'm not aware of? Another thing: when the calendar is set to Gregorian, the problem is solved, but with Persian calendar, it's not. Any ideas?",

We would like to enable public (guest access) to particular courses, however we still want any other access redirected to the login page. i.e. accessing a non guest access enabled course should go to login page (rather than message page with this course does not have guest access) going to the site main page ( /. ) should got to login page (not site main page or my page) guest users should not be able to browse course lists there should be no guest login button on the homepage All they should be able to do is go directly to a course url, and be allowed to view the content as a guest (i.e. auto logged in as guest or similar) All this can be done by customising different parts of moodle, i'm just wondering if this configuration is available without customisations. The closest i can get is: enabling guest access, auto-login for guests, enable guest login button -> this enables guest access for course but also allows users to browse main page and course pages and doesnt auto redirect to login page, also the login as guest button is displayed on the login page disabling guest login button, means that auto login as guest doesnt work anymore and users cannot access the course as guest any more and all queries are redirected to the login page.

Having looked through the code i have identified a few different places which prevent the behaviour we require. 1) the config item \"Guest login button\" must be set to \"Show\" for guest access to work I have logged this misnomer here: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-47634 2) Once logged in as a guest user the base url \"mymoodlesite.com/\" will show either /my/ for guests or the site home page. i have made a quick customisation for our purposes on /index.php \n```text\n+    /* LTU Custom Disable site page for guest users - sends them to login page*/\n+    if (isloggedin() and isguestuser()) {\n+        redirect(get_login_url());\n+    }\n```\n 3) I am now working on customising the course pages so they dont show the message \"this course does not have guest access enabled\" rather they forward to the login page.",

Option 2: If not, I can write a script in asp to pull the information out of informix and stored them onto a ms sql table and point external Database to that. I would like to just be able to connect directly to informix. Also how do I check if the external db is being executed?

I have written an enrollment plugin that can create new course shells and execute enrollment Adds (and Drops) based on data coming in from an outside source, but I have not been able to figure out if Moodle has any exposed hooks for metalinking such courses to a \"parent\" course, even if I know which course that should be and that it exists. Creating metalinks manually is just not scalable. Since this feature would be of obvious utility I am surprised that it does not exist by now. Did I miss something in plain sight? In any event what do you recommend as a strategy most likely not to break in a future Moodle release? Thanks.",

To achieve this, we have set up a couple of things on our site: A custom profile field (dropdown list) to specify the support agreement the user (client) is on: PPC, Sub, Premium. An instance of each course for each of the support agreements is set up, with the relevant course and costs. Using restriction rules, users only have access to the relevant instance of the course based their support agreement. We use the Auto-Enrol plugin to auto-enrol users if they are on the Premium support agreement. This is working well for us in terms of course enrolments. However, clients sometimes change support plans. Where the user's support agreement was either PPC or Sub and they change to any other support agreement, they can continue accessing the courses they were already enrolled in under their previous support agreement. If the client was on Premium and they change to either PPC or Sub, they should no longer have access to the courses they were enrolled in under their previous support agreement. We don't want the users unenrolled, we only want their enrolment status changed to Inactive. Is there a way to achieve this without manually changing the user's enrolment status to Inactive? Importing a bulk update would suffice too. We don't have the facility to install additional plugins at the moment, but this will change in the new year when we leave our current Moodle Partner.",

Our agency employees need to take trainings when they are hired, as well as annual intervals. I believe I have a pretty good handle on how to present course completion information to our HR/Training department, but I have a question and would appreciate any insight! Is there a way to auto-suspend a user from a course after they have completed course criteria? I know that if you unenroll a student, their grades are also removed. Our HR/Training department would love to see the course grade remain after a user has completed a course, but the issue is the student would continue to see the course. Suspending hides the course from the student, but keeps grade history. I think this way their grade remains for HR to see, while the user doesn't need to see an overwhelming course list. Manually suspending users would be quite tedious, so a criteria from suspending users after completion would be fantastic! Does such a plugin or feature exist? Thank you for any information!",

          "Text": "Hello! I am very new to using Moodle (I believe we have V.3.8), and I am trying to learn as much as possible as we continue to make use of the platform in lieu of in-person classes during the pandemic. I am wondering if it is possible to do the following: 1. When a new user is enrolled in a course, they are assigned the role of a student, and given an enrollment period of 365 days. 2. However, once the user has completed a course, we would like to be able to change their role to that of \"graduate\". This is a role site admin has created that is very similar to that of a guest (ie., they can look at the materials, but not participate in the course), but still requires the user to use their username and login to access the course. 3. When a student's role is changed from \"student\" to \"graduate\", is there a way to automatically remove their past assignments, lesson submissions, etc. from the course? 4. Does Moodle have a function where a user can be automatically changed from a \"student\" to a \"graduate\" after a certain period of time (that also removes their contributions, and just leaves them with general access to course material)? Essentially, what I'm trying to do is give users one year to use our Moodle resources. When they first begin, they are students, but once they have finished their program (typically about five weeks), I still want to them to be able to come back and look at the material over the course of the remaining year. However, we have new program enrollments every six weeks, so it gets cumbersome sifting through current and past submissions without just manually deleting things each time I login. I hope this all makes sense, and I hope someone is able to provide me with some insight on my question! Thanks in advance (and remember I'm not super technologically inclined. hahaha). 😊",

NO A lot of what you try to do is possible, except the automatic removal of student data.  Plugins normally stay far away from removing information (you do not want that someone installs a plugin by mistake and all the submissions of the students are gone).

The problem I am having is that for one course (that was originally created by the LDAP enrollment plugin) keeps getting duplicated. If I delete the duplicate then it re-appears as soon as someone logs in that is a student or teacher. The Short name is the same for both courses (which I thought was supposed to be unique?). If you go to the settings page of one of the two courses and then click \"Save Changes\" it will complain that there is a course that already exists with that Short name. Has anyone had this problem? Are there any ideas as to what I may be able to do about it?",

If I upload users, can I add them to a cohort? 2. What is the difference between users and cohorts? 3. I need to manually add students to my site (around 3000 students) who will have access to all the courses on my site. I need to keep my maintenance as easy and smooth running as possible.

Users once uploaded are granted the student role by default Cohort on the other hand can literarily be referred to as grouping (note that moodle has grouping in a course thats not what i am referring to). Lets say you have a set of students for a certain course, instead of you enrolling them to the course one by one, just add them to a cohort and you then then enroll that cohort. That way when you are done with those set of students you can just disable(or unenroll) the cohort and all the 3000 students will be affected. In your particular case, all you need to do is create a .csv file and include a column with cohort. I am attaching a sample template for your use. Once you upload the users, the cohort will be created and users will be added to that cohort automatically. You can then go to your course and enroll the cohort name. Regards",

I'm going to link a few things as I explain to help future readers who might be trying this. Installed Facebook Pixel - added the code from Facebook Events Manager to the header at additionalhtml in Moodle's admin settings. Confirmed the Facebook Pixel is working - by using a Chrome extension called Tag Assistant (by Google) . I had to disable my ad blocker across the entire domain for it to function correctly. I now need to add a conversion event so that I can tell when users have completed purchasing a course via the PayPal plugin. I've tried: Using Facebook Event codes in the body of my site but this appeared to totally lock me out (did this on a test server in January and had to scrap it). Can't remember the error code but it did not place nice with Moodle - absolutely nothing loaded on the page. Hesitant to try again without some advice there... Create a custom conversion using URL recognition of the PayPal enrolment return URL ( http://yoursite.com/enrol/paypal/return.php?id=# ) as described in this post , but it doesn't seem to fire. I wondered if anyone had any advice? Thanks Ollie",

Our students arrived this week and the self enrolment plugin failed 'You can not enrol yourself in this course' - even though site and course self enrolment settings seemed fine. The solution seems very strange but, with lots of trial and error as I couldn't find the solution on this forum, goes like this: Go into the course (logged in as teacher/admin): Course admin>users>enrolment methods>self enrolment> set 'Unenrol inactive after' to 'never' rather than our default '365 days'. Save. Self enrolment now works and students see the 'enrol' button when they click on the course to enter. Even more strangely, self enrolment continued to work even if I put the setting back to 365 days later!!!",

All the 'Unenrol inactive after' dates were set to 'Never' and setting them to 1800 days then gets self-enrollment working again. So it looks like just changing the setting will then \"correct\" the issue.

          "Text": "The straightforward method would be: search the users in the left container one-by-one and move them to the right container. However, that is a time consuming job. My suggestion would be: Create a new and temporary cohort. Go to Site admin / Users / Accounts / Bulk user actions. Try to formulate criteria to select the users who should STAY in your original cohort. Go to the bottom of the page and add the selected users to the new temporary cohort. Add an enrolment method for this cohort to all the courses where your original cohort was used AFTER completion of the previous task,you may delete entirely the original cohort next, you rename the temporary cohort and give it the name of the original cohort Why these steps? I assume that selecting the staying users takes less time, than removing the \"wrong\" ones manually. Further, unenrolling and handling user data are complex issues. I want to avoid mistakes by misinterpreting the documentation. So, I add the new cohort first, and remove the old cohort later. By the way, this suggestion seems to fail if your cohort has been enrolled in many courses. Then, adding the cohort enrol method many times becomes the bottleneck. The good news is that Moodle 2.6 has an interesting \" upload courses\" feature, comparable to the well-known update users feature. The \"upload course\" feature also works with existing courses. It can be used for uploading enrollment methods as well. Unfortunately, uploading the cohort enrolment method is either not well documented or buggy or both. Please, vote for mdl bug tracker https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-43127 to have this solved asap en make this power tool available for us all.",

The reason for this feature is that we run physical classrooms and students sign up for our Courses that run for a specified time. Part of the course includes access to our Moodle online courses and resources. Of course we canm set enrollment periods for each of our online courses, but there seems to be no way to mark the end of the students tenure system-wide accross Moodle. This feature is required not necessarily to restrict student access to the system once their tenure is up, but be able to managed/filter students who have completed their term at our schools.

We are looking to do some mass enrolling (could be as many as 10,000 users), and unfortunately the site may not have been set up properly.  After reading about how to do mass enrollments, I determined I need to add a txt file with the following: action, role, student ID, course Id add, student, 4285, C130 However, when adding new users over the past 2 years, customer service was not adding a Student ID to any new users.  I want to assume that it can be found when editing a users profile such as: http://www.mysitename.com/user/editadvanced.php?id= 1887 &course=15 Where the 1887 could be their studentID? If so, is there a way to get a complete list of all StudentID's without having to edit each individual student? If not, any ideas on how to add StudentID's to all current users? If none of the above is applicable, are there any other ways to do a mass enrollment?  I've read up on some solutions in this forum, but a lot tend to deal with the studentID.

In fact, 1887 is the 'id' of the record for the student in the mdl_user table. What you are looking for is what we call the 'ID number' (that is called 'idnumber' in the mdl_user table), that will be probably empty as you say above. If you have direct access to Moodle's database , you can set the 'idnumber' field directly to anything you want. For example, the username. With something like the SQL sentence below: \n```text\nUPDATE mdl_user SET idnumber=username WHERE deleted <> 1;\n```\n This way you can use the same value of the username for the enrolments.

Lately however, I created some courses where students are only supposed to download a file or two, so I desided to give them access only 24 hours to have their downloads done. To avoid the 24 hours elapsed before students have read their notification emails, I do not enrol them myself, but send them enrolment keys. Now I´m just wondering if there wasn´t a more convenient way for the students not having to enter enrolment keys, but to provide them with links including the \"door-opening-string\". Just like the form in manual_enrolment_plugin does. I played around with it, but for any reason didn´t get it. Any ideas? My second question is, whether anybody has a script what does enrolment for more than one courses at one click. Background is: I do offer some bundles that include different courses. All of this courses are also regular courses, so I can not work with meta courses. Currently I make students that pay via paypal to enrol in an empty \"master course\" and from there enrol themselves with enrolment keys in every single regular course. But this is not very convenient. A one click solution was just great. Does anyone already have a solution on this? I appreciate your help,",

Teachers or course creator of a category, should also have the possibility to remove a course if it's finished. Now it's not possible, because the course will recreate after cron or sync job. But it's not possible to remove the course in the ldap, because the connection between ldap-enrolment an moodle. The same issue I have with IMS-Enterprise ( XML ) or external DB. Only flat-file for enrolment works like wished, but not for course-create. It would be nice to have a system for once course-create an course-enrolment and deleting afterwards in the system (ldap, IMS, DB). I'm not shure, if my request is clear enough, but hopefully I get some ideas or hints here. Thank you very much. Stephan",

I am currently exploring cohorts and cohort sync as I want to enrol students onto a range of courses. I currently upload users with CSV files, generated from a database adding users to courses, with set expiry dates. the CSV files are getting quite cumbersome and I would like to simplify things. My organisation has a high volume of students (thousands) with a high turnover. Students within courses have very varied enrolment dates and each week students are starting, leaving and changing courses. So this isn't for example like a university where students on a course start and end their studies at the same time. I am posting here, as I am wondering if when using cohorts with a CSV file I can set enrolment dates for individual users? So could I have a cohort with say a thousand students, each with their own individual end date, which I could update and manage via regular csv uploads. From what I have read and tried this doesn't seem possible.It looks like I would need to manually remove students from cohorts, which isn't practical because of the high numbers involved. I did look at the meta course link, but when a student expires in the parent course, they don't expire in the child courses. I also looked at category enrolments, but there is a warning to avoid this in the documentation. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Tim",

          "Text": "Hi, I installed Moodle on my server and everything running quite good, but I think my understanding of manual enrolment is wrong. I created a user A and set up a course and choose manual enrollment. I thought manual enrollment means that the user A can see the course title, but can't see details. In order to registered and see details of the course, there will be some links or buttons that the user can tick. If the course is free, he will automatically get in. If the course costs some money, he will be redirected to some paypal page to take payments and then he will be allowed in. However, I can't find anywhere in my course that I can set up a enroll button or a page to redirect to paypal payment. Can someone help? Many Thanks",

Unfortunately, we must keep both plugin enrollments enable inside of our courses, the users may enroll by themselves if they want to and teachers need to be able to do the same with some users. I think the only thing to do here is to ask to the teachers to make sure that the users are not yet enrolled in the courses. Thank you Helen",

Any account that has read access in Active Directory (any regular account), will suffice. 2. You need to use NTLM instead of Kerberos as the auth format (unless you have configured apache and the moodle server to use Kerberos, which you would know :-)) 3.- If you have a proxy (or any kind of source NAT) between your desktops and your Moodle server, you need to take that into account when setting the client subnets. Moodle won't see the clients' IP addresses, but those of the proxy (or source NAT device). 4. You need to make sure you Moodle server URL is part of the \"Intranet Zone\" in Internet Explorer settings. Otherwise Internet Explorer won't send the credentials for the logged in user. Make sure you are not using GPO's that block additions to \"Intranet Zone\" in IE, or that otherwise configure that setting. Regarding the \"NTLMsso <directory> < file> settings </file> <directory>\", this is what I use in my test environment. I don't use a .htaccess file, I put the configuration directly in the httpd.conf file instead.

I was missing some directory instructions in httpd.conf. Thank you changed/added couple of lines and it logged. Problem Description Now it does the authentication but only if I go stright on the /auth/ldap/ntlmsso_attempt.php. Even if it does authnticate the user program goes into fail rutine in /auth/ldap/ntlmss_finish.php Then the fail routine redirect to /login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1 next: In login page it say 'You looged on do you really want to log off?' / cancel / continue. My head is sore! To 'correct' this situation I chenged $CFG->alternateloginurl to point string to /auth/ldap/ntlmsso_attempt.php and in /auth/ldap/ntlmss_finish.php last if{} blok where it check the failer I redirect from /login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1 to $CFG-> wwwroot but still the default login page doesn't engage the out-login routine and also this way I loose the 'Login Fail' page. Question: Please, advice, what would be a good aproach to engage the autologin routine at the website entry? Would it be correct to have in the root/index.php a line header('Location: domain.com/auth/ldap/ntlmsso_attempt.php'); so it goes first there then it comes back into home page with user logged? and how do I handle the situaion where it authenticates the user but still goes into ntlmsso_finish.php into fail if{} block and exits with /login/index.php?authldap_skipntlmsso=1 That page doent seem to have a 'success' situation explicitely in code as it has for the fail situation? Checks I followed I followed one of yours posts to check again our settings (from here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=186661#p813594 ) 1. NTLM is enabled (in the LDAP auth config settings) 2. You have configured one or more subnets (IP ranges) for the clients you want to use NTLM with. So yes, it's mandatory 3..You haven't specified the 'authldap_skipntlmsso' parameter with a non-zero value in the requested URL . 4. You are the guest user, or you are still not logged in 5/ The IP of the client machine (as seen by the Moodle server!!!, so you need to take into account NAT, proxies, etc.) is inside of one of the configured subnets. 6/ It's a GET request, or a POST request from another page (not the login page itself). This is to handle a couple of corner cases. 1. Since it does an authentication to any user in the network - it works. It is in use all stuff and pupils use their AD accounts for ldap. 2. All network settings are correct. proxy is on the same subnet as the clien our settings are specified as 10.220/255.255.252.0 this would meet the entire network ip settings. proxy 10.220.44.249 it works if set as 10.220/22 as well so it seems ok. Locally reqests to moodle are treated as trusted/intranet requests so it would be 10.220.45.88/22 to proxy server server would localy forward to moodle the request. and back. No public ip addresses are involved. 3. Didn't get that but we got it as it is 'authldap_skipntlmsso=1' at the moment in working / production environment. I think I am missing on number 6.",

The only possible solution that came to my mind was to put a different enrollment key for each course, and on the enrollment page (the one where it asks you for the key) add by code a button that if pressed calls an external script ( like an ajax call) which sends the key to the user's email, the problem is that I realized that maybe it's not possible to retrieve the secret key on that page. Does anyone know of another way to perform this action? Solutions that require coding are also welcome. Thanks in advance.",

We are successfully using the LMB digester with our SUNY Delhi Luminis Message Broker/Banner with our production server at Moodlerooms. It is working for both WebCT and for our Moodle instance. One thing I've noticed, and I don't know if this has anything to do with the digester, all the users come in with the default preferred language of \"Arabic\" - does this happen for you? I wonder if it's possible to do things with the digester like set a default preferred language for users when first created. It also seems like the xml out of the LMB provides parameters such as term start/end dates, and it will create categories for those terms in Moodle, and put courses into them, but doesn't put the start/end dates into the courses. Is that something that can happen? I'd also like to be able to make all newly created courses have defaults such as \"this course is not available to students\" or to have all newly created courses be based on a template course rather than the default Moodle course. Is something like this possible down the road? I should probably start learning to code so I can contribute.. Well maybe one day... Best, Clark",

So, I go in an manually set her status to \"student\" for the course and it still won't let her get access. I created a test account, set the status to \"student\" for the course and I can access it just fine. Help? Thanks!",

One tip that I can give you is to add a column for the moodle role id in your external table. This is documented as an optional field, but it seems to be required. See if you can find some of my external database posts. I remember showing specific steps that you can take to debug this particular thing.",

The administration effort for creating and managing users is big and we are thinking to stop the LDAP authentication. We would like the authentication to take place using only the moodle users table. The moodle setting is currently not to store passwords in the moodle database . I have a though but don’t know if it will work. 1. Execute an SQL query that will write the md5 of the passwords to the moodle database. We have the password as we gave it to the clients and as far as I know they can’t change the password stored in LDAP. 2. Change the records of the user table from LDAP authentication to internal. I su Any ideas if this will work or any other ways to do it?",

When a user clicks on the results box, it gets a highlight border as if it were a text-entry box with the focus, but it's not. This confuses some users, who think they should be able to type into it. They do not immediately recognize they should type into the Search box due to the red herring of the border. Perhaps if the border could be made zero pixels, or the same color as the background, or removed entirely, that would help. The reason I bring this up *in this forum* is that I have created an Issue for it in the tracker, and I want people to comment and/or vote on this issue. Here's the issue in the bug tracker: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72197 To Reproduce: Go to a course, any course Click Participants Click Enrol users Click \"No selection\" It highlights with a border, as if it's a search box.

We have set up automatic enrollment of students into classes from subject/sets in our MIS but I can so no way for the whole year group other than student by student! Additionally I want to be able to group the students within each year group by Registration forms - this I think I will also have to do by hand as well.

The upload and download of excel files is inelegant and inefficient! I think that somebody needs to give greater thought to the management of the enrollment of students on courses - particularly for the school environment. An immediate improvement would be to recognise that the Course ID Number of a course does not need to be unique in Moodle and then take advantage of this. This would allow the automatic linking of two courses in Moodle to 1 group of students in the school MIS timetable. At the moment the first course is enrolled but the second and subsequent course are ignored. We link to Subject and year to enroll all students studying subject X in year Y into a particular Moodle course. Of course there is usually more than one class in each year but there seems to be no way of creating groups in the Moodle courses using this information. So a lot of this has to be done by hand which is not efficient. Sometimes we want two years to access the same course and this again requires manual intervention. I realise that Moodle came out of Higher Education but surely there are sufficient schools now on board who would welcome these sort of facilities? Maxwell Wild Manchester High School for Girls",

Obviously, when the action runs the user's grades no longer appear in the gradebook since the user is enrolled, but no longer has the role or 'student'. So, the question is can we force the gradebook and completion report to show all participants, including those with no role?

My students enroll from an external list of dozens of courses, each linked with that course's Moodle URL . Students click on the course they want. The linked URL takes them to the Moodle sign-in page. They choose Create a New Account and fill out the form. Here's where the problem happens: After they fill in name and email, and click Create My New Account, they get sent to the HOME page, instead of to the URL of the course they initially chose. The home page contains a long list of courses, displayed differently, inside Moodle, from the external page they started from. They have to find their course again and click on it. This is confusing, and this is where students are likely to enroll in the wrong course. In Moodle 3, this step took students to the URL of the course they clicked as the first step in this procedure, thus directly to the course they want to enroll in, where they then click to pay through Paypal, and thus enter the course, enrolled. How can I get back Moodle 3's operation that takes a student from a course URL, to \"Create My New Account,\" then directly to the course whose URL they clicked to start with? Or have I created this problem with some setting? Thanks for your patience and attention.",

We do a nightly dump of both Moodle and Campus DBs for a semester and compare the differences on an intermediary server . A list of changes is then created and fed by IMS Enterprise XML to Moodle. We're currently making a couple of tweaks that will allow for hourly updates. There is likely a more efficient way of linking the systems, but we have a legacy process that was modified from a previous competitor's product, and with the generous help of Dan Marsden, the IMS Enterprise module in Moodle has been kept to a workable level for our needs. If you're interested in the approach, I can try to convince the DB team to share their wizardry. Cheers, Adam",

Users who haven't yet enrolled in any courses are likely to be confused when they log in and are presented with a list of all available courses, especially when it's under the heading 'My courses'. The use case for users to be able to click on a course and be prompted to enrol is already taken care of by the front page setting which allows a display of courses and categories in a combo list. Please could you tell me where to make feature requests? I would like to make a feature request to change the behaviour of the 'My courses' block in the center of the front page to be empty if users are not enrolled in any course, rather than showing all available courses.",

I want it to jump out loud and clear so the student knows what to do.  This should then lead them to a place to pay via Paypal which is theoretically activated but I cannot see it either even though the \"eye\" is also open. At the moment I am manually enrolling them and have no clue about how to get them to pay. So the student should be able to : 1. Intuitively see where to enrol 2. Intuitively see how to pay.

I know the student is truly enrolled with active enrollments by looking at Enrolled Users listing in each course. Yet on the student's Home page and dashboard under \"My Courses\" she sees only 1 course listed! The enrollment method is through a custom plugin but before you dismiss this as due to a bug in the plugin, keep in mind that the student CAN participate in each course once she navigates into the course, e.g. by following a link from the Calendar (or, of course, by using external links that are handled by the custom plugin). It seems rather to be something about My Courses that is \"off\". This is Moodle 3.2. I would appreciate any suggestions how one might examine this in the database or through any other means!

Today I realized, that users who are suspended in a course still have access to that course. This is the case all over the whole platform. I never tested this before today, as I am not the only admin and was never confronted with this aspect, so I don't know if it ever worked on this moodle instance, but I suppose it would have shown up earlier if it had never worked. We are now on Moodle 3.5 branch Edit: When setting the status to \"suspended\" the role \"student\" does not get removed. Only when setting the status to \"suspended\" AND manually removing the role of \"student\" the access to the course is blocked. That results in data being kept and having the student without any role listed in the course. So: role:student + suspended = accessible no role + active = accessible no role + suspended = blocked",

Of course I would expect them to be able to access the regular content when logged in as a guest, but not to be able to access the group-content when logged into their account, as they would be suspended for - as I'd expect - all course content including group-content.

However, when a student registers for a course and completes payment, rather than being taken to the course classroom as in 1.8, the student is taken to the main Moodle login page and is logged out. While the student can login again, if he/she selects the course just registered for, instead of allowing the student into the classrooom it takes the student to the payment gateway again as if the course was not paid for. The student cannot enter the course classroom.

PayPal accepts their money, but they don't get auto-enrolled in the course! I always have to go in and manually enroll them.

          "Text": "Is there a way to change a user from one course group to another using a CSV upload file? Our situation is that we are using Moodle 1.9 and have no student management system or LDAP ability. We are uploading new users using the bulk upload CSV file. I am happy about initially assigning users to specific courses and groups within those courses. Labels: username, firstname, lastname, email, institution, department, course1, group1, type1, For example: 123456, Mary, Smith, mary@hotmail.com, FMC, ward5, Fire Safety, ward5, 1 My difficulty is that significant numbers of our users move from department to department where there roles may change. For example: A nurse may be a participant/student in the \"Fire Safety\" course and then move to a new ward. They may change roles such that they become a non-editing teacher within the new ward, but still within the same \"Fire Safety\" course. If I resend their details via CSV  (see below) Labels: username, firstname, lastname, email, institution, department, course1, group1, type1, (same as above) For example: 123456, Mary, Smith, mary@hotmail.com, FMC, ward2 , Fire Safety, ward2 , 3 the department will change in line with the new ward move, and they will be added to a new group (ward2) They will be elevated to the non-editing teacher role. I believe they will not be removed from the initial ward5 group. Is there a way to remove Mary Smith from the initial group (ward5)? (Other than manually removing Mary from the ward5 group) Any assistance will be greatfully accepted! Mark",

It seems likely that work is permanently coded to a student and group based on the group that the student is in when they first submit.  If the student is in more than one group, the work seems to be assigned to the first group that shows up in the list. Hence, the work may not be visible if you look  at the student through a different group, and if you change the groups completely the student seems to lose access to the group. This is counter-intuitive to me as I would expect ALL work to be coded to the student, with the question of the group then being addresses through a look up table. I don't see why a student (and their work) should not be visible in any number of groups that they are attached to (which seems to be the case with groupings). regards Paul",

He wants to have some courses made free to everyone, but some courses must be payed for before use. This is quite straight forward. The problem is, the free courses should only be *partially* free. That is, if a student enrolls to the course, he will only have access to some of the content/assessments. Only after payment has been made, the rest of the course will become available. Either non-payed for content/assessments will be blocked, or all content/assessments will be available, but only the feedback will be blocked until payment is made. The whole idea behind it is to allow some sort of trial access to the school, and if the student wants to go further with his/her studies and make it official, he can simply pay, and continue where he/she left off. I am completely new to moodle, so please bear with me if I'm unclear. Thanks!",

          "Text": "The following is with Moodle 1.9. I guess I misunderstand the settings enrol_db_ignorehiddencourse in the external database configuration page and the settings Course enrollable and Availability in the Add/Edit Course Settings page. According to the Help for these settings and pages I should be able to set a course to Not Enrollable without impacting enrollment through the external database plugin, right? (The courses are not set to unavailable, and in any event the \"ignorehiddencourse\" setting is left as \"No\".) But my testing reveals something different. When I log in for the first time as a student who is enrolled in the XYZ course (in the external database) I see the XYZ course listed under \"My courses\" but cannot get into the course! (I get the \"course not available\" message.) Only if I set the XYZ course to enrollable am I offered the self-enrollment option; if I say yes I can subsequently login in to the course without a problem. But here is the really bizarre thing: Until I \"self-enroll\" in XYZ, when I log in I see ALL the courses (on my test system) -- even those that are set to be Not Enrollable and in which I am not enrolled in the external DB !! (If I try to log in to any of these courses I get the \"Course is not availble\" message. That makes sense-- they are set to Not Enrollable and I am not enrolled in them in the external db.) But as soon as I do self-enroll in the XYZ course in which I am really enrolled, when I next log in I do not see any of these other courses! They are simply gone from my Moodle home page. I see only XYZ listed under \"My Courses\". This raises the obvious questions: 1. Why do I initially see these other courses in which I am not enrolled and which are set to \"Not Enrollable\"?",

They have the teacher role in the courses and they can see the links to their courses in \"My Courses\" once they log in; but when they click on the links an error message appears: You are not enrolled in this course I checked the enrollment plugins, both self enrollment and manual enrollment are active. Their accounts were created manually in the previous server and the enrollment had been set to never expire. In the current version of Moodle those settings are the same. The expiration date is disabled.... I also changed it to several days.. and even years... to no bail.  I un - enrolled one of the teachers and enrolled him back with both the editing_teacher role and student role usinf the manual enrollment ... but it did not work. Then I enabled the self enrollment plugin and logged in using his credentials, then clicked on the course link, it showed \"you can enroll\" so I clicked on the enroll me button, and the next screen showed again the same message... you are not enrolled in this course. I even deleted completely the Moodle database and restored the one from the old server back to observe if there any errors happened in the process, but nothing, everything went fine, no errors, the upgrading of the database was done smoothly. We are running Moodle in a dedicated CentOS 6.4 Final 64bits. Apache 2.2.15 PHP 5.5.1 MySQL Server version: 5.6.12... The only part I am finding a bit intriguing is that when I checked the PHP info from site administration/ server/PHP info, I found this under my sql : Client API version mysqlnd 5.0.11 -dev - 20120503 - $Id: 40933630edef551dfaca71298a83fad8d03d62d4 $ Would this be causing the problem?

We cant just copy all of the students from one cohort to another because not all of them finish study year. Manual method ( D ashboa rd → Category: School year 2020/2021. → Cohorts → Assign) works fine, but it takes to much time to assign each student manually, so i was wondering if there is a way to assign them by using CSV template,  let say by username or email address?",

If there were some collected documentation on these sorts of things I think a lot of small colleges (like mine) would try moodle out -- a cookbook of sorts for enterprise configuration.

It processes the payment, but a student would have to then click on the course title in the upper left side of the page. I can envision potential confusion since there's also not a message that says payment was received. I believe a student would still get the \"This course requires an enrollment key\" message which I don't typically use. I know I can change the message that's displayed in the language files, but I'm wondering how/if it's possible to get this to work like it did in 1.6 so with payment they'd be automatically forwarded into the class itself. That just seems like a much smoother process. Todd",

          "Title": "Meta courses help please!",
          "Text": "Hi eveyone, Ive been assigned the role of setting up Moodle for a college of about 400 students. We offer about 10 different certificates and Diplomas have around 100 courses/units within these, many of which are compelted by students in several of the certs/diplomas. The units/courses are provided to per term - roughly 10 each. I have worked through 'Using Moodle by Cole and Foster, and have deciphered much of what I need to know. However, it is metacourse information and I have been upable to find clear answers for on old forums, though I am sure it is in there somewhere! Heres what I want to do - set up Moodle so that the student of a diploma/cert can set up an account, then enter 1 enrolment key and have access to all the courses they are enrolled in for that term. Each term the student would be sent a new enrolment key for the courses of that term. I'm not clear yet how I can do this with Metacourses, but this is my processes so far: I enter the 100 courses/units Set up metacourses for each term for each diploma/cert with each of the 10 courses for the set as a'child' course for the term added e.g. meta .Dip Nat Term 1. If a student has an enrolment key for 1 child course will this give them access to all courses in the Metacourse or just that 1 course and the metacourse? Im not sure this works. So then I am thinking, of the 10 courses in a term the first should be a child of the second as a metacourse, which is a child of the 3rd and so on so they are all accessable with the key for the first. I think this would work, but then I strike the problem that several diplomas/certs do the same course/unit and this would give them access to the wrong courses. From one forum I read the answer would be to create a separate version of courses for each Diploma/unit and then link them as above e.g. for course 12702 taken by 4 diplomas/certificates I would create: 12702 Cert Nut 12702 Cert A&P 12702 Dip Nat 12702 Dip Ther. Massage This I can do but it would quadrule my work! Help Please! Is there a more efficient way to assign students to courses in different diplomas/certs so that they get one enrolment key only? Your help is much appreciated. I dont want to get this wrong and have to start over...If there is no option then I may send students separate enrolment keys for each course in a term. I would prefer to avoid this as I can forsee lots of \"I cant enrol in the course online\" type emails coming in the more work they have to do to. Smiles, Laine",

I looked at the source for the setup_enrolments function at /enrol/database/enrol.php, which is where the queries are taking place. The logic of this function doesn't make sense to me. Rather, I understand how it works, but I don't understand why it was written this way. I did a pseudocode outline of the function: \n```text\n$roles = get_roles();\nforeach($roles as $role) {\n if ($rs = $enroldb->Execute(\"SELECT course FROM table WHERE id and role matches\") {\n do_enrolment_stuff();\n }\n}\n```\n It gets a list of all possible roles, does a query for each role, and for each query, it updates any course roles for that user for that particular role. This seems excessive to me. Wouldn't it work if the entire recordset for the user were retrieved in a single query, and then each course that appeared in the set were given the appropriate role for that user? Like this: \n```text\n$rs = \"SELECT * FROM table WHERE id matches\";\nforeach row {\n if (user doesn't already have this role for this course) {\n grant row->role to this user, for row->course;\n }\n}\n```\n It could be that we're overlooking something here. Therefore we decided to ask you, the Moodle community, if this sort of change: a) would work b) be beneficial to us Thanks, Keith",

However we have added the PLP module and turning subject reports on shows up all the courses a learner enrols into. What I wondered is is there a way to have learners wander through the courses without specifically enrolling to them, but still restricting access to specifically authenticated users only, i.e. no guest access. I don't think it is possible, but I'm not sure. Alternative thoughts are that the tutors will just have to use the group feature for the PLPs and group up learners and ignore those not in groups and thereby leaving the enrollments alone. Any thoughts appreciated.",

Now I have two ideas of how this could be done: Customize the database enrolment plugin, by editing the SQL query which gets the currently valid courses, but I'm not sure if that's all I need to do. The enrol/database/enrol.php looks complicated enough to easily screw something up big time. Set up a cron somewhere which would create another database table which would look like what database enrolment plugin expects Actually my first thought was to modify the mdl_user_students table directly from the external application; it seems to have timestart and timeend columns. However I didn't find anywhere what these columns actually mean? Can I just add an entry with userid, courseid and the starting and ending timestamps, and moodle will let the user log in at only those times? What do the time and timeaccess fields do then? Any issues in this approach I didn't come to think of? It seems that with plan 1 things would get less complicated, however I'm not sure of all the changes that need to be made. Or am I approaching the whole problem from the wrong direction? Please help? If it helps, the system that adds the entries in the external db makes sure there is only one entry per user for a certain time - that is, a user can only be enrolled to one course at a time.

In AD we have users in two OU's which are called 'staff' and 'students'. I want to be able to automatically enrol users onto courses and assign roles depending on whether the user is a student or teacher. For example if little Johnny the student (student OU in AD) logs into the site it will automatically let him access courses as a student, whilst if I log in (staff OU) I'll have teacher rights to all courses. I hope this makes sense and that someone can help. cheers Dan",

          "Text": "Yada, The Course ID field on the Moodle course set up screen is used to associate the Moodle course with a course (subscription product) in the external database. In the external database you relate students to subscription products. In the external database a student could be enrolled in any or all subscription products. This really is a function of the external controlling program as to how a student can enroll into which program. As far as a course ID string this would come into play when a given Moodle course is related to more than one subscription product in the external database. For instance you might have MAT 101 in Moodle, but offer two subscription products to it in the external database such as \"30 days access to MAT 101\" and \"90 days access to MAT 101\" So in the external database you have two subscription products that relate to the same Moodle course. In this case you would need to use a course ID string to relate the one Moodle course to both subscription products in the external database. As far as the nuts and bolts to how to set up the database I can't help you with that. When you say external database you really are referring to a stand alone program that will manage the users and class enrollment. This is best suited for a subscription/membership type script that saves the information in an external database that can be accessed by Moodle. Good luck with this. Grant Swaim",

I want do modify the e-mail the inform my customers, that the  have to go to my online-shop and fill out an order form. Otherwise I get their payment but have no chance to create an invoice.

Now, my institution (Srce, University Computing Centre, Croatia) tries to make Moodle instalation for our University. My problems are: Is it anyhow possible to automatically enrol users to one whole category according to some field from user profile (eg. Institution, or some user field)? Or, is it possible to automatically enrol users to course according to some field in user profile and some field in course prefs? If one of those above is possible, is it possible to limit users view just to that category? My Moodle is not an option, because it lacks functionality of first page, ans has ONLY one advantage: it shows enrolled courses only. If that can be made on first page, that would be great.\nNot related to problems before: is it anyhow possible for first page to display just parent categories, without subcategories and courses? For now it is possible to display just categories without courses, but WITH subcategories.\nWhat should be changed on course index.php page to show only category, without subcategories and without courses?\nI'm not that good in programming, that's why I need help with this problems.

After re-reading the FAQ, I am still unsure if internal enrollment satisfies my customer's requirement. The requirement is that each student will have her own enrollment duration per course. So student A will have 5 days, student B may have 6 days. Put another way, the default enrollment duration for the course is not relevant. The current way we \"think\" we are accomplishing this is that when we go to the \"Assign Roles\" -> \"Students\" page, when we move students over to the left-hand side, we also specify the students enrollment duration in the combo box above. Is that correct? Lastly, is there some interface/report where I can see the current time remaining on individual student's enrollment periods? (eg. \"Mike's enrollment in course B will be expiring in 7 days\") Thanks, Roland",

This is on a windows server, and here is how I am running the script from the command line: SET logdt=%date:~4,2%%date:~7,2%%date:~10,4% X:\\php\\php -d log_errors=1 -d error_log=X:\\scriptlogs\\enrolllogerr\"%logdt%\".txt -d error_reporting=E_ALL -d display_errors=1 -d html_errors=0 -d memory_limit=768M -c X:\\php\\php.ini X:\\moodle\\enrol\\database\\cli\\sync.php >> X:\\scriptlogs\\enrolllog\"%logdt%\".txt I tried adding the -v flag, but that didn't help and the script didn't run properly after I did that.  Any suggestion on how to make the logging work again would be appreciated.  I'm running cron and LDAP the same way and they are logging in pretty much the same way as 1.9.",

The attached enrol.html (located in root_moodle_directory/enrol/paypal) is an example of offering both PayPal and Interac e-Transfer payment options. I included the $courseshortname variable in the security question as a way of identifying which course was paid for since, at the moment, the user who pays via Interac e-Transfer needs to be manually enrolled. The answer to the security question is easy for us since we have the same Teacher Assistant for all courses.

          "Text": "Hi All, Very new to moodle and to this community. I have been tasked to upgrade a Moodle installation and \"Integrate\" it to a custom system for our school's registrar. The moodle was ver2.5 and is now ver3.5 (a big leap because it was ancient since last updated by an ancient developer.) My problem is the \"integration\" part of the Registrar system, we call it GenecSys. Moodle and GenecSys are used separately to this date. GenecSys is capable of exporting the whole records it has, students, courses etc to an XML file. And when imported to the upgraded Moodle, it duplicates all entries, as if importing all data from GenecSys as a new one. Example: We have user101 on Moodle, we also have user101 on GenecSys, instead of merging or skipping (not overwrite) it, it is being duplicated, the same to the courses. I am attaching the sample XML file, every entry has thousands of that, just added the skeleton of it. Also, GenecSys has LDAP settings, but I will check that on other section of this community and that's my second option. Plus, the developer of GenecSys is hard to reach. Thanks in advance!",

I would guess that the tool is not configured (nor designed possibly) to re-import or update records, and it treats every file as a new batch of users. If there are configuration settings for the tool, best to look there. I do not know how familiar you are with the formatting of the XML message, but it's IMS Enterprise , and there happens to be a built-in enrollment plugin , by the same name, to handle such files. Settings in the IMS Enterprise enrollment plugin allow you to configure whether new users can be created, or just updated. When this plugin imports the user, it puts the external system's id value for the user (in your example file, the GenecSys id value 210001149) into the Moodle user's IDNUMBER field, displayed in the Optional section of the profile. That's how it links the external user information to the Moodle user information, therefore, you should make sure users are prevented from editing the IDNUMBER field of their profiles using roles/capabilities. Hope this is helpful. Regards...",

GenecSys and Moodle do have different IDs even though they are the same user. It was suggested before (which I do not know of until now) that we have to manually change each IDs of the users to match it from the GenecSys ID in order to prevent duplication. Same with the courses I think. Since there are developments in our upgrade, the upper management decided to have two Moodle Installations (1 for the incoming semester and 1 to retain for previous students). With this, we will only sync users to the new moodle install with a clean database . The easiest and a wise solution to all other problems with the existing Moodle installation.

Today there was a problem with the external database - the server was up, but it didn't respond to data requests. Since our Moodle server is configured to request user data from the external database on every login, and because the external database wasn't responding, our users couldn't connect to our Moodle system. Is it possible that the function (in the codeof Moodle) that controls pulling data from the external database, only checks if a basic connection can be made to the external database server, but isn't prepared for a situation that the server is up but is not responding to the data requests? And because of that there is a loop of data requests that Moodle sends to the external database server? If it's indeed so, it would be great if a timeout could be added to this function, or a \"X tries and than just move on\" mechanism.",

We have a course (the equivalent of an \"Album\") that we would like to make available for say $50. But we would also like to allow users to purchase an individual lesson (equivalent of a song) I know how to use meta courses but when I created all of my meta courses a user could not purchase each individual one, it said that the course was not available to the public.

Only once I removed the Category mapping are courses created by sync.php. 2) The login process does not seem to be syncing enrollments. Logging in as a user or using the Login As feature does not enroll a user in a course, only running sync.php works for enrollments. I'd like to create bug reports for these 2 issues as they are essential components of this functionality as I understand it to be designed, but wanted to confirm it wasn't my error before doing so.

More info - http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=169016 We are using 2.0.2 connected to a Power School Oracle Database using oci8, and running the sync.php script seems to be working perfectly, but the login enrollment part does not work and it actually removes the student from all external database courses on login. Is it possible to disable the enrollment check on login? Judging by this discussion I'm getting the feeling this is a Moodle issue, other it could be related to our Apache /PHP environment not talking to Oracle the same way that the cron sync.php does. If our students are removed from all their courses on login this will be unusable for them.

There are several commercial solutions out there, at varying price points. I use ' aMember ', which does all I need and a lot more besides. I'm not on a commission form them, or anything like that, but have really been impressed with what the system does. It takes a bit of thinking about to set it up, but ultimately all of your Moodle courses become 'products' in what is apparently a 'shop'. You protect the products with registration forms and you can have as many forms as you need all pointing at the same 'product'. You can add various fields and so on... it's up to you. You end up with a whole new member management system - it sits 'beside' Moodle and integrates with it, but is not like a Moodle plugin or block that becomes part of Moodle - it will give you an 'admin' login for member management tools, which is not your log in to Moodle, and which replaces the membership tools in Moodle itself. If you can live with this kind of arrangement, you can do all you need.",

Is it possible for one user to enrol multiple people at a time (e.g., a secretary enroling multiple people at his or her organization)? Is there any kind of system for handling scholarships that would reduce an individual student's price (e.g., coupon codes, discounts, etc)? If the class is a hybrid class, both face-to-face and online, is the Moodle/Paypal enrolment smart enough to keep people from overbooking themselves (i.e., signing up for two classes that take place at the same time)? Can optional fees be attached to enrolment (e.g., room & board, transportation, etc)? Thanks for taking the time to read my question and respond!",
