I am teaching an environmental science course and want the students to each create an \"executive summary\" about a person, place, organization or issue of note in env sci. I would like the students to post their summaries to moodle in such a way that they can all view all the summaries. I envisage them creating their summaries as word files or powerpoints ( they will likely contain images). I was looking at creating a forum for them to post their summary to, perhaps with an overview in the posting text and then the rest of the document as an attachment. This would allow me to rate each summary and for the other students to comment on and/or discuss the summaries. Is there another tool that would work better? Any other suggestions?",

I tried the Javascript settings, but I cannot get it to work.  The video always appear in the Label resource.  I'd really like the behavior of videos when implementing them using the File Resource, unfortunately, I don't think I can use File Resource in this case because I cannot add multilang when adding a video file.

I have a collection of videos with solutions to exercises that are hidden. When they cannot solve a particular question, they can give me a playing card to 'pay' for a video. Is there a way I can do this in Moodle? Now I just add the group to the resource using the 'restrict access' functionality, but I want this done automatically. There are much more videos available than playing cards, so in essence it comes down to this: say I have 5 videos and the students have 3 playing cards. How can they view only 3 of the 5 videos?

We considered the certificate module, but it is a bit slow to be upgraded at the moment. https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_certificate We have considered cohorts, one a fortnight, with manual checks each week to look at progress.  On this line of thinking we thought of getting a custom report made to provide a report each Friday for managers. Of course Totara LMS has this sorted with their learning plans. http://www.totaralms.com/feature-a-benefits/89-learning-plans (I have no association with Totara) Another simple way would be to use the checklist plugin. https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_checklist This is one of the plugins you can rely on with upgrades, with a new version not coming as a suprise to the coder With core Moodle, manually watching the Activity report (Course administration > Reports) is also quite good if you choose your activities carefully to limit their number.  You can then carefully have some dependencies and just have a few to check.  There is no decent image in the ehlp, I can post one if you like. Just my 2c worth, and I'm sure there is a better way. -Derek",

          "Text": "After a year of successfully running a Moodle server for my four classes off a dusty (but beloved) Mac in my living room, I changed up this summer to moodle.com and invited my colleagues to offer classes from my site. Now we're running with 430 students (with courses being fleshed out for another 200 students) and are working across borders (connecting classrooms from independent schools in Michigan, Minnesota, and Maryland). I realized this cross-border approach was possible after I carried on more frequent and successful conversations with Martin (who is on the other side of the planet from me) than I had with any of my department members down the hall. In one school, teenage students are using Moodle all day long at their \"compu-desks\" (individual work desks with computers inside), at another school older students are using Moodle on \"smart-boards.\" In my classroom, I just use a projector to throw the image of my laptop on the wall, but I think all of these different configurations are appropriate to the tool. Although my school is still paying for and serving Blackboard, the Moodle site will surpass their users and usage in the next three weeks. The price difference between the two is pennies on the dollar. I spend approximately three minutes a day \"administrating\" the site (fixing a password, offering a tip), and the rest of the time I enjoy the collaboration of peers. Alongside the regular courses the site offers, we created a \"faculty\" room for teachers. This course offers the chance to share classroom ideas and to share tips (like \"Using Moodle\"). We are now engaged in the process of developing a few \"no borders\" courses that will allow cross-enrollment from the participating schools. I wonder what else we could do? Out of the excitement this project has generated, I have former professors as well as former students (currently grad students) volunteering to be guest teachers (by contributing assignments or by facilitating one or two activities ). I know my planning as a teacher is more thoughtful now that I'm using Moodle courses. I tell my students that the interactivity of the courseware requires both the teacher and the student to be more accountable. In the past 15 months, I feel that using this software has broken down walls between classrooms that will probably never go back up. Students that enjoyed Moodle in my courses last year have been the ones that convinced their new teachers to come aboard this year. With the help of the Mark Kimes Library module, I feel as if the classes are also gathering shared resources that will be stronger and stronger each term. The Library is not a dusty filing cabinet in the department office. Good ideas get recorded there and saved for the future.",

Now, after release 3.3, this is not working anymore. Even with that capability set to 'deny', all teachers became able to see all sections. Do you have any idea of how that could be achieved now?

And if you try to do a lot of video editing on a laptop, you'll eventually \"burn out\" the graphics card, which usually costs more to replace than a new laptop, and/or the DDR memory cards (cheap and easy to replace yourself). If you don't have sufficient hardware, an online option if definitely a good idea. I hope this helps!",

They arre using two camera soften and they have to edit this raw material to an attractive new video. This means some scenes have to cut out, To make it more interesting it should move from one camera perspective to they other and sometimes it will be required to show the perspective 1 (lecturer) as a small area into the main perspective (presentation slide view) - picture in picture mode. The editing process is team work. The team members are working from different location. That means that the raw material has to be upoaded to a web portal and the team members get access to it for working on the same project. The raw material and the final result is not for public. Only students will get access to the video in a Moodle plattform. Hope you can understand better  what is required. Ralf",

Video is definitely more complex that regular documents (be them, word, excel, etc.) and editing requires more resources (e.g. memory, processor speed). As I see it, the team should use a cloud service like dropbox, sugarsync or related ones, so the video can be shared to everyone, eventhough only a group could work on it at a time. Then, they could use skype or a similar service so while one group is actually editing, the screen is shared to the whole team and so everyone can suggest about the edits to be done. If two groups were to open and try to edit a particular video at the same time, the cloud service would create two different physical versions, just as it happens with regular documents. GoogleDrive is a similar but different concept, and that's why GD allows simultaneous editing, but not for video, at least not yet. --- edit Not exacly what you need, but it may cover part of your requirement (i.e. just the editing part, not the collaborative one): http://www.videotoolbox.com/",

Psych and I want to use Moodle for a class project.  I just downloaded the software for the first time last week and have only started playing with it. I need to provide a Math lesson using pre-existing online math content to two 8th grade classes.  I would like to conduct a 5 day training session as follows: Day 1: Walk-through of logging in and performing Moodle activities Day 2: Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3 and have them perform the pre-existing online activity (math game).  Instructions and Link from within Moodle. Day3: Have each group create a Wiki using a provided template explaining the how to win the game (ie. explain the math strategies necessary to win). Day4: Have groups review other groups Wiki's, posting comments about what was helpful and what could be added. Day5: Have the originating group, evaluate feedback, update Wiki, and submit to teacher as final. My question is ( and it is rather open ) is how to accomplish this using Moodle?  My thinking is to create a single lesson such that each topic contains the content for each possible Math game.  Each group can select their topic of interest.  It doesn't matter if they overlap - the Wiki activity will be separated by groups. If I take this approach, how do I make the Wiki's more public on Day 4?  Would each group have to export their wiki as an html doc and submit it back to a folder?  The downside of doing this is that the resulting html file is no longer a wiki. If they do resubmit their wiki as an html file, I could create a forum for them to discuss it rather than having them update it directly. I would appreciate comments from more experienced Moodlers.  Like most students, I am behind and need to get this done rather quickly. Thanks, bob",

Irecently used it with Year 7 who worked on a project to create a leaflet. They decided on the assessment criteria themselves, developing them it using a wiki, they then produced a leaflet according to the assessment criteria. I created a workshop activity and the associated rubric from what distilled through the wiki, and they assessed each others' and their own work via the workshop. For next time, with more time and a tad more planning, I would run the different elements of the workshop at different times - they need time to reflect on their own assessment of their work and on the comments that others make when their work is assessed, and to then have the facility to make amendments and have a re-grade. Unfortunately the National Curriculum doesn't leave a lot of time for this! Another great AFL tool is the blog . I use both the Moodle internal blog and external Wordpress blogs (which allow commenting) for pupils to reflect on their progress and invite constructive comments from others. The RSS feed block allows the feeds from these to be included in individual's courses or My Moodle pages. Elsewhere in Moodle, the Lesson module allows for creation of individual learning plans based on level of attainment, as a module of lessons can be prepared that create an individual learning pathway from the responses the student gives. Quizzes give opportunities to give feedback on wrong (and right) answers so that the student giving an incorrect response might be shown a url for the resource that they need to look at to get the question right. I have found it useful to look at the logs after a quiz to see who actually spent time reading the feedback and acting on it, rather than just quickly having another go at the quiz in the hope that they got the answers right the second time! Inevitably, those spending more time to research their incorrect responses get them right more reliably the second time. Hoping this helps, drop me an email if you'd like to discuss this more.

The reason I am asking is that I am also assigning videos to my students, but each video also has a corresponding \"textbook\" chapter.  If the student wants to just read the textbook and looks at the examples in the textbook, then personally I do not really care if they watch the video or they don't watch the video.  I just want them to absorb the material and demonstrate that they know the material through their homework assignments.  It does not really matter to me how they absorb the material. Unless it is something where the material really can't be presented in a traditional paper version, then I do not think that watching a video should ever be a requirement.  If there is something in the video that can't be presented in the same way in a paper version (for example, listening to the original \"I Have A Dream Speech\"), then you need to explain in the description the benefits of the video over just reading the text, and why you believe the video is a benefit over the just reading the text. How many times do you personally go on a news site and just read the text of the video as opposed to watching the news article?  I almost never watch a video on a news article site.  I am just saying this to present a counter argument to requiring the student to watch a video.

It's quite tiring because every quiz I've done is, at least, three pages long, and so I don't have the time to post it all, I know I have to begin all over again the following day. My second question has to do with the type of exercises the quiz allows us to prepare. Is there any demo or pdf where they show us how to? I've only been able to work the multiple choice option so far. Thank you very much. Leire.",

Until Moodle provides built-in quiz \"templates\" for common (useful) configurations, I (sort of) created my own. I make a blank quiz (with no questions) that has been configured the way I want. This can take a long time to configure (trial and error), as there are so many options. You might have to add one or two questions to see how you want it to work. For example, I like my students to get feedback immediately after they answer a question. I have limited time quizzes with limited tries (best score is the one that counts). Once you have that working the way you want it, think of that as your \"template\" in Moodle. Keep the \"template\" invisible on the site, since you don't want students seeing/taking it. You can copy the quiz to a new quiz and use that one for the quiz the students will take. This method saves me a lot of time (although I lost a lot of time to get to this point!). Good luck!",

          "Text": "A few of our teachers have now started using Moodle, and are busy creating their courses. One thing that they have found annoying is the way that although they can upload resources into a folder on the administrative side of things - they have to deploy each resource individually. They have asked if there could be a way that they could select the folder as a resource - rather than each individual file? Thus they can post a set of Resources, without cluttering up the homepage of the course. Has anyone else found a work-around for this? Or is there any way to display a list of resources in a folder (for students on the course)? One idea that I have got is to somehow produce a HTML Resource with hyperlinks to each resource in a given folder - this is still manual, and time-consuming.. but does remove clutter. The drawback of this is I dont think many teachers would be capable of finding the HTML link to the files. Matt",

The whole idea of a rubric is that you'd have more of a description for each quality level / criteria row. In that way, Medical History - Complete would have to contain some sort of description, for the students to understand what is expected of them to achieve.a complete mark there. Using rubrics is a very good way to provide additional information to foster and improve 'notion of quality' among your students. At least, that's how the scholars in Formative Action approach rubrics for feedback and assessment. A description should be concise, clear and unambiguous. One thing a rubric isn't: a basic checklist that will leave the assessment process in its blackbox process as with simple direct grading.",

I have fairly simple courses - they are really just topic containers that link to reading notes and a quiz. Completing a quiz with a given score percentage completes that unit. Completing the required number of units completes the course. However, we now have to throw in electives. i have a client who needs to be able to base a course completion on completing core topics + any X of Y elective topics; e.g. 5 core plus 2 of 5 electives. The course itself is then used as a conditional requirement to taking other courses (e.g. you have to either have done a cert3 course to start a cert4, or otherwise marked rpl). It seems that some people set these up AS courses themselves. But I don't see how that works to give you a \"completion\" record, which is for a given course. So I don't see how you would base the requirement of starting a cert4 course on the completion of multiple other courses. With elective units, the learner can open them and then take a look to see if that's what they want to do, and choose to start it or not. As long as at the end they have a completion against the X of the Y of these electives then that's considered part of the completion - even if they start unit 1 then choose to skip it and do all of unit 2 instead. Is there going to be a way to set up completions for a course that can be based on \"all n of this list\" plus \"any n of that list\" rules for objects?",

In other words, Instructor A has a Topic.  Instructor B has a topic.  Instructors A and B should be able to add any learning resource they want (not just a folder, which I can customize access to) to their own topic, but not be able to edit another instructors topic. Maybe it's connected to roles?  Not sure ... Any suggestions as to how to achieve this? Thank you.",

For that reason, in Moodle core you will not see usernames used in many places as that is a deliberate decision.  If you want to use the username rather than the user's actual name, you could look at the fullname function in /lib/moodlelib.php and see what you want to do. I might be tempted to add an optional parameter (for example, username) to the fullname function. When username parameter is true, then print the username instead of the user's full name. Otherwise, behave normally. That way you could do a grep of the code and see when fullname is being used and simply add the additional parameter to fullname function and get what you want. In any case, that is just one idea off the top of my head. As I said at the beginning, it is not really recommended. Peace - Anthony",

Since Moodle version 2.8, there is a flexible grade aggregation method named Natural. I configure many grade books and have found Natural aggregation to be the best way to implement any grading scheme.  Refer to https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Grade_aggregation#Natural In your case, I would create a grade Category: 'Topic Quizzes'.  Move all the topic quizzes into the Topic Quizzes category. You don't need a separate category for the Global Quiz since there is only one item. Set the Topic Quizzes category weight to 40 and set the Global Quiz weight to 60. Done! No formulas needed.

          "Text": "Hi Pablo, As already has been suggested, I'd use the Gradebook setup to get this to work. Here are the steps to follow to make this work. In site administration > Grades > Grade category settings make sure to have the following aggregation methods enabled: Mean of grades Weighted mean of grades Simple weighted mean of grades In addition to the natural aggregation that was already discussed. Then go to your course, open the Course settings menu and go to Gradebook setup. At the top of the gradebook setup table, there will be a folder icon and your course name. To the right of this, you'll find an Edit link with a menu. Edit the settings at this level to set up the proper aggregation method. I'd select Weighted mean of grades. Then use the Add category button to add a grade category sub folder, to move the 14 topic quizzes to. Set the weight of this sub folder to 4,0. Next, set the weight of the global quiz to 6,0. This will result in the following: The average grade of the 14 topic quizzes will be counted 4 times, the grade of the global quiz will be counted 6 times. 4 * av grade Topic Quizzes + 6 * grade Global quiz / 10 = course grade -- All in all, setting up the gradebook is quite a challenge, but I hope this will help you. In any case, refer to https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Grader_report for all information on this very interesting topic.",

Everyone signs up for a metacourse, which enrolls them in all of the courses, which are available to whoever wants to take them, whenever they want. As a result of this, anyone who has ever signed up is perpetually treated as an active student in the course. This poses a problem because it means that if I add a gradeable activity (like a quiz) to a course, it immediately lowers all of the previous students grades. What I want is some way for students to take a course, and then have Moodle know when they are done, and \"freeze\" their grade so that it isn't affected by subsequent changes to the course. Is this possible?",

The educational program has a policy that penalizes the student for every hour of class time missed.  The policy reduces the students overall grade by 2.5% per hour of class time missed. My question based on this is, is there a way to set something in the grade book or someplace else to do this calculation for me.  This would have to be on a student by student basis. I tried creating an off-line assignment called attendance and played around with the grade settings until it lowered the students grade by the appropriate amount, but this doesn't satisfy the requirements of the educational program.  Attempting to do it in this manner only lowers the grade at that instance and as more graded activities are added that particular activities overall effective weight becomes less and less. If anyone has any suggestions on how I might be able to comply with this it would be appreciated. The program is using moodle 2.0 Thank you.",

Q1 Is there a way to create one course i.e. Course A and have 4 runs of the same course and enrol 4 totally different batches of learners. Q2 In addition, these 4 runs could have minor changes i.e. some topics/ contents are updated and outdated as time passes . Any suggestions on how to do version control? One of the solution to the above 2 problems will be to create 4 independent courses. However, it wasn't so desirable since I still deem the learners from the 4 runs having completed the same courses. Any ideas on how else I could configure them? Q3 Lastly, if we have course A, B, C & D, is there a way to sequence & bundle them together and create a Programme/ Curriculum X out of it? These courses could also be part of other Programmes/ Curriculum Y, Z etc",

You could name the first course \"Course A - Q1 - 2020\" and then duplicate for Q2. In the Q2 course, make your changes. Duplicate Q2 to make Q3 etc. Students will be associated with the course that they did, and their grades will be linked to that course. \"I still deem the learners from the 4 runs having completed the same courses\" You could create a course called \"Course A - Master\". Students who complete Course A - Q1 etc are then enrolled in Course A - Master using a plugin. You then manually enter their grade for their Q1 course as their grade for Course A - Master. Over time, all students who complete Course A will be listed in Master with their final grade. The details of their participation will still be accessible in the course that they did. Programming a learning path and dependencies can be done using plugins, but the viability strongly depends on how much automation you hope to achieve, and the logic of how students flow from one course to another. You'll have to be really clear about your workflows and rules, and then investigate using plugins. Regards Brendon",

It is at the bottom under the question, as you've found out. One way to prevent students from getting confused is to keep a question page small. How about including only the question and the response choices? This way the feedback (after the question is attempted) can probably be seen even on a laptop screen without the scroll bar. I think keeping a question page small is also good for reducing cognitive burden, compared to presenting students with a lot of content and then a question all on one page. Ravi",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I manage a training platform where participants receive one of four possible statuses: Approved – Passed the course and final exam. Failed – Completed the course but didn’t meet the passing requirements. Absent – Enrolled but never accessed the course. Free – Completed the course content but never took the final exam. The challenge comes when I download the grades and try to upload them to Moodle. Currently, I can’t find any way for Moodle (or my platform) to clearly separate Absent from Free in the exported grade file. Both categories end up mixed, and I have to run a time-consuming manual process: Filter the list of participants who never accessed the course. Compare them one by one in Excel with the “Duplicate Values” function to identify the correct category. This manual comparison works, but it’s inefficient, especially with large groups. My question: Is there any way in Moodle to export or process grades so that these four statuses appear clearly (Approved, Failed, Absent, Free) without having to manually filter and compare in Excel? Thanks in advance for any tips, plugins, or workflow suggestions!",

          "Text": "As you imply, you don't have any problem between \"Approved\" and \"Failed.\" Students get the grade that they get. Of course, you still need to set the \"failed\" grade. In my case, I use letter grades. Any \"F\" means that the student has failed. This is usually a final grade below 60%. For absent, you would still need to define it. What if a student does the first week assignments, then nothing else? You might want to define this as a grade below 5% or 10%. If the registrar need more information, you might have to look at the student's last access date, which you would see in the participants listing. That \"free\" category is the tricky one. What do you do with these \"free\" students? I don't use a free category like this. If a student doesn't take the final exam, they get a \"0\" for it, and it is weighted into their final grade. I don't try to get into the students' heads to figure out why they choose not to take the final. But I teach adults, and I expect adults to be responsible. I normally need to export grades into Excel to prepare them for uploading grades into the university's system. So if I had to do this, I would incorporate some Excel logic that says, \"If final exam grade is null, then final grade = N/A (or something like that, whatever your system uses). I don't use Moodle's \"course completion\" features. I just use the grade book. My school wants me to document why a student \"failed.\" For these students, I just send the Registrar a copy of the student's grade book and let the grade book speak for itself. Again, I don't try to get into the student's head.",

As you mentioned, my issue is not differentiating between a student who has passed or failed, nor the subsequent entry of their grades, since that is specified in each student’s final status when they are graded for the course. The organization I work for specifically requires these two distinctions between “absent” and “free” (i.e., those who did not attend or attempted the exam). If it were up to me, they would all be grouped the same since they are still considered failed students. These are short self-managed courses that provide immediate certificates afterward. I am looking for a way to differentiate those students who did not enter the course or never took the final exam in Excel, so that it is easier to load their grades accordingly.",

I am sure the Moodle API have some 'event based' alerts to manage classroom.  Doing some googling I found the following: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Events_API#Users Another item is the use of messaging in moodle which has also been revamped and now is event_driven as well. http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Messaging_2.0#Enhanced_messaging_system",

Here are the few things I am hoping to achieve. 1) Students can reflect on the courses and add entries. 2) The Teacher can filter the students in a course to find their entries and accordingly add feedbacks to it. There is no grading involved here so it all about managing entries by each student in a course . The students cannot see each others entries - its only the teachers that can see the entries. At the moment I have only been experimenting this will the journal activity and it does not seem to let me filter students to view their entries. Any other ways to have a reflective journal in moodle courses ? Thanks, V.",

Have students go to http://www.spellmaster.com/ , where they may create simple, interactive vocabulary practice activities in Flash. 3. Students then upload their Flash activities to the forum, so that other students may access them. 4. Students may provide feedback in the forum about the activities. Of course, there are other modules that you might prefer to use for this. I just really like the forum module.

This way, students can no longer see the course and teachers can still access the records if a student questions their grades. We keep the course in place but hidden for at least one more term. Then, we download the backup and archive it offline. If the same course will be used in the following term, including all resources and activities, then we make a Backup of the original course shell and Restore it as a new course. This gives us a \"fresh\" course shell for the teacher to use. Why don't we re-use an existing course shell? If we re-use the existing course, then we no longer have easy access to logs from the previous term. We may need such access if a student questions their grades. We sometimes have a student who re-takes the course because they dropped out or did not complete the course in the previous term. If we enroll that student into the course shell, then all of their previous work and logs show. I hope this is helpful.",

AL's suggestion is the one-to-one translation. Here the summary becomes an activity of its own. The method Joost proposed is the modern \"instructional design\" approach. It eliminates the \"journal\" alltogether, but forces the students to do those tasks through https://docs.moodle.org/en/Activity_completion .",

Only when they completed the module, if they come back, they will be in 'Review mode' and will be able to open any step in the sequence by clicking on the corresponding item in the menu. We would like to have the same free navigation for the non-editing teacher without forcing them to first complete the module. They should be able to go directly to, say, step 14 of the module if a learner tells there is something unclear in that step. I don't see any SCORM setting to get that. Is there a moodle permission to change? or some other trick? All the best, Th.",

For example, I sometimes teach geography and use the drag-and-drop questions for labeling continents and oceans.  However, I cannot figure out how to create a question that requires students to identify all 50 of the United States.  Even doing a small subset of the 50 states quickly clogs the map with labels and it is difficult to label small states like Rhode Island and Delaware. One work-around is to label your image and then ask students to match the labels on your image to items from a drop-down list.  In my case, I could label California as 'A', Texas as 'B', and so on.  I would then ask my students to tell me (matching, multiple choice, short answer) which state was labeled 'A', which was 'B', and so on.",

          "Text": "My college doesn't use e-Learning at all, and we do everything the good old way. Now I want to introduce e-Learning, and I came across moodle during my search for a solution. As there really is no e-Learning system, everyone will show resistant to adopting new approach, and I can only convince others, if I can show how e-Learning will REALLY help them (teachers and admins). The best way seems to be online exams, as currently, teachers and admins are too much overloaded with exam works. Then, I will gradually add (or start using) other functionalities. So here is the workflow I propose, and would like to know can moodle handle this, or rather, can I handle this using moodle? There are six semesters to be cleared for a degree (B. Sc.). There are 4 subjects. Physics, Chem, Bio, Maths. Students in Semester 1,2 will have 3 subjects out of above 4, in each semester. Students in Semester 3,4 will have 2 (from previous 3) subjects, in each semester. Students in Semester 5,6 will have only 1 (from previous 2) subject, in each semester. The number of papers will vary from 4-6 every semester. Respective subject department will conduct tests for their subject. Now, with this background I expect the following workflow. 1. Student will enroll/register when he/she enters Semester 1. His credentials won't change until he/she gets degree. 2. Student will use his/her login credential only for online exams, which will be open for a limited period say 3 hrs, and conducted within campus on intranet (college LAN) 3. After each exam, a collective mark-sheet of all the students who took the exam can be obtained from moodle stats/reporting. 4. Students can be promoted to next semester upon completion of required grades/credits in all subject papers manually or automatically. I don't wish to use any other moodle functionality, except student registration and exams/automatic grading, for time being. Can this be done with moodle?",

A couple of years back I campaigned for Moodle to be introduced in the international development charity I worked for, and I was successful - but since then administering our Moodle has become a big part of my job (but I don't have any problem with that). If you don't have access to any Moodle system, you can install a Moodle package on your own computer (a local installation - won't be on the Internet), and you can play around with the different features. You can show your colleagues a demo from your computer. Best wishes, Ravi",

Let's cover all the generic open source Moodle questions you can use to troubleshoot the issue: Have you checked whether the access restriction for the WP Course Certificate was set up properly? Have you checked whether the participant qualifies for the new WP Course Certificate (i.e. does he/she meet the requirements set up above)? Have you set up the WP Course Certificate to automatically release a certificate when a user meets the requirements? If you haven't, the user is required to open / click on the activity to receive the certificate. Have you checked whether the maintenance scripts are running properly? As far as I know, these are the steps to follow to troubleshoot the issue you're describing.

I can answer 'yes' to all your questions. This is a rather unique situation as we are migrating courses, completions from another LMS and having some issues. What I found after a lot of digging in the database is that Moodle does not delete or flag the certificate when you delete an enrollment. So, a user could not be enrolled in a course but have a certificate of completion for the course. To get the result I was looking for, I had to delete the certificate in the certificate table and then delete the enrollment. I do appreciate that you did try to help - thank you!!",

Essentially students would be required to find / upload a photo, tag it (in the way described above) and then they would present this during class. The only problem is, I cannot think of a way to assist this teacher in doing this in Moodle.  Does anyone know of a way of accomplishing what I've just described? Thanks, Jamie",

I have done some work in this area, and I will be glad to share my ideas and experiences with you. Thanks!",

Teachers are doing it during school hours, and companies are doing it in after school programs. At the high school where I taught, every 9th, 10th, and 11th grade math teacher's lesson plan was required to have an NCLB component. There were actually teachers (such as myself) whose entire job was preparing the at-risk students for tests. There are over 500 companies providing \"supplemental educational services\" (funded through NCLB) in after-school programs. Is it really possible that none of these is using Moodle? And if so, is it because Moodle (and its social constructionist philosophy) is at odds with accountability-based ideas about education? Or is it because Moodle's technical feature set does not lend itself to this application?",

I have been looking for a way to use the metacourse function to enroll a single group of students in 24 separate courses (each course being a single weeks module of a 24 week course.) I had added all 24 courses to a single metacourse, thinking that each child course took the student enrollment from the parent metacourse. Now I have realized that the opposite is true, the metacourse takes the student enrollment from the child courses! My problem is how to turn the child courses into metacourses. I have deleted the single metacourse but the option to change the child courses into metacourses is not available, I get the following message: Is this a meta course? No - This course already has normal enrolments. The message still appears even after I have removed all users. I do not want to start adding courses from scratch again, so does anybody know of a way to change the child courses into metacourses please?",

If I plan on teaching a course and I only want my students to see the calendar and what they're supposed to be doing, how can I accomplish this? I know i can set up a \"weekly\" format, but then everything is just pushed in that week, similar to a topic. Basically, I have 21 different HTML pages that are integrated into moodle as Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, etc. I wanted to have a course that starts on April 1st and that when they login, they will see their calendar (Day 1) on April 1st. Then, on April 2nd, Day 2 will be released and so on and so forth. However, I don't want them to be able to advance a day without it actually BEING that day (if that makes sense). I need them to be able to go through the course as I design it. I know, technically, a way around this would be to just add an even to the calendar on April 1st with a LINK to the HTML page and do that for 21 days, but that's not even using the system at all. To sum it all up, I'm looking for a way to assign certain resources to certain days of the week. End of story lol.",

It would be really nice to see some of these available directly from the ATTO editor, by using the Generico tools set for instance. One remark though on the use of FontAwesome in Moodle. Somehow the '<i>' tag in HTML is still being used, where a <span class=\"icon fa fa-...\"></span>would make more sense from an accessibility point of view. The Brickfield tool (and others) will incorrectly identify the '<i>' tag as an old-fashioned way to refer to text in italics, and recommend using the '<em>' tag instead.",

I placed myself in the shoes of teacher doing just a \"copy and paste\", but indeed, span and aria should be recommended. 👍 Another accessibility issue is about colors. It seems some tools do manage perfectly \"bootstrap variable names\" and successfully change the whole page into white on black, even if primary or secondary was in the code... On the other end, some other tools are definitely not bootstrap ready/friendly (although boost and classic themes rely on bootstrap since version 3 I think). For accordion, I have mentioned the bootstrap long explanation on accessibility under my video... but visitors rarely unfold the description on youtube. *I just added your remark on <i> in the description of the \"icons\" video* Thanks for your answer.",

Better to put it in a assignment where it is alone. you took the code from bootstrap version 5 or more that is all I can think of. Hope this helps",

If anyone could help, we would very much appreciate it. The questions are: 1. Can Moodle courses be setup so that individual students progress through the course at different rates? i.e. Student A starts the course in March and is confronted only with lesson 1, they complete lesson 1 then lesson 2 becomes available to them. Some time later Student B joins the course. We need it to be that Student B can only see lesson 1 (until he has completed it). Is this possible some how? Student A and Student B both need to be able to see each other on the course and communicate in common forums. 2. One of the course templates in moodle is a weekly view. How do you configure moodle to release each weeks content at the start of that particular week? i.e. when it is week 1 the students should only be able to see week 1, and as soon as we move into week 2, week 2 becomes visible. 3. When a student submits something to an assignment the teacher then is able to comment on that submission. That's great, but is there a way for the student to be able to reply to the teachers comment? In other words how can there be a dialogue between teacher and student on each assignment.",

          "Text": "Part of an internship I'm doing for my masters program is helping the teaching faculty do online teaching more effectively including use Moodle in more dynamic, creative ways. A professor I'm collaborating with asked me if there was a way to create an 'anticipation guide' so as to orient students to think ahead of the course material/lecture. Specifically, she would like students to be able to 1. Type in questions they think they have or will have about the content, 2. Have them watch pre-recorded lecture, and afterwards, 3) Their original questions are shown, and they are able to answer their own questions they asked at the beginning. One person suggested it might be possible to use make a link to a google form for them to write their questions and have that automatically turned into a spreadsheet. Then for the second prompt, pull the questions from the spreadsheet and create a 2nd form where they could then answer their own questions. I've been playing around with that as well Lessons and H5P, but I haven't had much luck into seeing if this is possible and, if so, how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

A glossary would also do. Visvanath's proposal is another alternative.

          "Text": "Hi DaVinci, Coloring a picture can be done with Poodll Assignment Submission. There may be other plugins to, but I have no experience with them. You set it up as an Assignment with submission type of, Online Poodll, with Poodll Rec. Type of, Whiteboard, and a Poodll Whiteboard Background of the picture you want the student to color in. You also need to set the Poodll Whiteboard size to fit the background picture size. When each student clicks, Edit submission, they see the whiteboard drawing editor with your picture already there for them to color in. The picture remains even if they need to erase part of their coloring. I know this works with png backgrounds, but will probably work with others, too. This works pretty good with just a mouse, but, much better with some kind of tablet and pen. The only downside to all this is that Poodll Assignment Submission also REQUIRES Poodll filter and Poodll filter DOES cost money. When I was actively still teaching, I just paid for an annual subscription out of my own pocket. However, you can do a 30 day free trial to see if it does do what you want, before committing to any payment. Just don't be shortsighted enough to think the money is not worth it for your students to color one or two pictures. The whole set of Poodll plugins that you get to use with the filter is simply staggering when you figure out and see what all you can do with it, especially when it comes to audio and video capabilities for teaching a foreign language, such as English. Along with the whole set of plugins, there are literally DOZENS of widgets available for use to enhance your site, lessons, quizzes, assignments, etc. A simple for instance, you can add a user or username filter that will personalize your site so each student is greeted by name when they log in. The Poodll developer, Justin Hunt, is active here in the forums, and is always quick to help, if you have any questions. What always impressed me the most, is that he is also quick to respond to feature requests, if at all possible. I can remember once making an idle remark, \"It would be nice if......,\" (can't remember exactly what I wished for) but four hours later there was a new version out with the new capability. https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=13 https://poodll.com/plugin-poodll-filter/",

This would be particularly interesting if completing course A is a requirement for access to courses B and C. The automatic bit I wrote about, does refer to the combination of activity completion and course completion. You can only add activities with completion enabled to your list of activities to be tracked for course completion. If your courses are marked as complete without a proper justification, I'd say an evaluation of that process would be more than just a nice to have. Are the conditions for course completion valid in these courses?",

The internal messaging works fine, but not for all use cases.\n(At least I am not aware of a solution for my problem)\n\nImagine a teacher A is teaching his language course for a certain time. She can easily exchange messages with her students, give advice to single students or inform all of them about urgent dates. Fine.\n\nBut what happens, if she abruptly is absent for a certain time. You need a substitute teacher. How can the new teacher be assigned to her course and read all the old messages and get pending messages addressed to the original teacher. I am fine with the internal message system. For us there is no need to setup our own mail server .\n\nHow do you manage this use case? I am a programmer from Germany, not a teacher. So I might miss the obvious solution.\n\nThank you in advance\nEnno",

I have watched your video and it seems that since our district controls the site administration to Moodle, then they would have to create the Dropbox account and teachers would have to store their videos on the district Dropbox and not their own personal Dropbox. Any information would be very helpful. This workaround is needed because the district firewall blocks all video storage and sharing sites so students cannot watch teacher created videos.",

Submit new attempt What is the difference and is there a requirement to use one over the other for certain situations? If the student selects option 1 does this alter the original submission? Is it useful to select this option if the teacher wants small additions to the original work? What I don't want is for the original attempt to be altered in anyway. I've read that selecting a new attempt stores the original submission and feedback and allows for new feedback to be added to attempt 2. Thanks for your help. Mel",

I've been going through the moodle website and its tutorial, but I got a bit confused. Is it possible with Moodle to create an online one-to-one tutoring website? I'm not concerned with the platform( chat+whiteboard+webcam), since I may use AdobeConnect. But the other features like: -I have some subjects (math, physics, ...) on the website. - For example a user (student) with a math problem, search for math tutors and then choose one tutor among them and message him/her. If their negotiation results in agreement, then the tutor can schedule a session to meet each other on AdobeConnect(or other platforms). Then, the fee should be paid by the student as well. -each tutor has a profile page that is open for everyone. It includes his/her experiences and the comments (like & dislikes) of the students who already had courses with him/her. Any advice would be appreciated.",

For example, supervisor competencies, leadership competencies, all employee competencies, job specific competencies. But, we don't need a supervisor enrolled in all of the courses we offer because they may have taken them already, they may have evidence of prior learning to show that they meet those competencies. How does one create a list of courses that has the competencies in that course, so the learners can go in and enroll into the courses that meets their needs? I hope this makes sense.

So when you are trying to provide evidence or look at progress or provide employee guidance we do not have that functionality. If employees must have the competencies in the Leadership learning plan, instead of making them find the course and self-enroll - enroll those employees in those courses. They will complete the courses and achieve the competencies related to the course. Otherwise, you will need to educate your employees - each one to look at their Learning plans (I use the excellent, visual Monitoring of Learning Plans plugin - https://moodle.org/plugins/report_lpmonitointring ) which adds a block on each employees Dashboard page with access to their Learning Plan(s). Without this plug-in the employees would have to navigate to their Profile>Learning Plans page. For courses that we offer for self-enrollment (skills buildings courses), I add to the competency \"select this link to self enroll in the ABC Skills course\" with the appropriate URL to the course.

          "Text": "I'm going to be running a blended learning experience next summer that will combine a weekend in Chicago to visit the Tutankhamun exhibition at the Field Museum as well as two other local museums with Egyptian collections. The students will meet online first and have a follow-up period after. The question arises, how long should these pre- and post-trip periods last? I want participants to have plenty of time to do preparatory reading before the weekend and get to know eachother a little but don't want to have to spend a huge amount of time leading discussions beforehand. Likewise, I want to allow for sufficient time afterwards for follow up discussion online (and sharing of photos etc.) but need to take into account the fact that most participants will probably spend a day or two extra sightseeing in Chicago on their own before returning home so I can't assume that post-trip discussion would pick up immediately. On the other hand, I don't want to drag these on for a long time as this is a short trip (and I will hopefully be running much longer trips to Egypt itself in the future) and in order to make my fee reasonable and in proportion to the amount the participants will pay for the hotel, entrance fees, transport and food (I am currently working with a tour company to arrange a package) I don't feel I can run the course for too long. How would you handle it? Perhaps stagger the pre-trip portion? Open up the reading material somewhat early and then allow for discussion only in the period immediately before the trip (like 1 or 2 weeks)? And how long would you allow for follow-up? I may actually wind up running more than one of these trips a month or less apart if the first one fills up quickly so I don't want to run the risk of overlapping the online portion of the course and be too busy or worse yet, have an online portion of one course going during the weekend when I will be running another tour and be too busy to monitor what is going on online at all. You can read more about this trip here , but be aware that you will need to register at my site to view the description.",

There are the obvious things: links to the websites that students go to over and over, uploaded documents your colleagues has been using for years, carefully selected NLN packages using the object module. Have your colleagues already invested time in a website or intranet? The glossary remains my favorite tool in moodle; you may find it useful, if mercenary, to tailor your definitions to the kinds that appear in exam mark schemes. I developed a moodle course for A level physics (information and communiction) which can be found on the LSDA Q projects round 2 DVD, that should have made it into your college; that included lessons, quizzes, hot potatoes quizzes. [ I've got another project on the next disk (developed primarily for using Access in A level computing) that should be in colleges some time in the future - ask your eLearning manager. In the farther future, I'm developing materials for a physically realistic car racing game (Racing Academy), which will also be a free moodle course] Wiki's are great for group research tasks - e.g. energy resources in physics is a good area for a task to share between a group a students I've written a few sequences of resources/ activities that draw in material from a number of sources: e.g a recent one in physics had an intro (a web page), part of an NLN package to study, followed by a short assignment on it; then the rest of the NLN pack; a simulated practical using an applet on a website;  a discussion forum to post the results and a final assignment, being a report (that could potentially be Key Skills evidence).

I produced a chemistry intranet many years ago, gave it a major update once, and decided there must be more to life than underused web pages! Moodle seemed to be the answer - it doesn't have to be all my work, most of the resources that have been produced by all the teachers here can be used in Moodle, or modified for use in Moodle as a more interactive exercise, and it has loads of cool tools so students will use it (I hope). I had already decided that the Glossary would be a very useful tool, and like the idea of linking a topic using various different modules.  I haven't quite known how to use wikis or blogs, but will try and find bits of the course that might get discussion going - possibly CFCs and the ozone layer. How often do you get students to use Moodle?  I assume that this will have a direct effect on the success of the website, and don't want to cause death-by-Moodle or get to the end of the year and have students asking what Moodle is!

My way to get students to look at moodle for physics was simply to post homework assignments there exclusively; as a result, many of them spent time looking at the other resources. Specific moodle based activities are also part of it, but less common at the moment as there is so much else to fit in; maybe once a month or less often for moodle things that are not merely resources or assignments. Research using a wiki was successful. I stopped developing the intranet site ages ago, moving the best content over to moodle. [It was easier with my A level computing - all the sessions are in a computer lab, pretty much all tasks/materials/notes come through moodle, apart from textbooks! Evem there, they take Moodle for granted as a vehicle, not an end in itself, and the key phrase is blended learning] I think you are definitely taking the right approach to take bits and pieces to try out over time; a couple of well-structured activities will raise the profile for your students. All the best, Andy D [I asked about Hills Road, as it would be great for moodle to be associated with the best sixth form college in the country; the nearest I got to it was a couple of Open University tutorials I delivered there, in one of my several dim and distant pasts]",

A skeleton of my site is up at <dabih.org>.  You can enter as a guest with a key (perkin for Chemistry and feynman for Physics). One of the reasons I switched to Moodle was to supplement the Socratic dialogues from class. Students prepare whiteboards and discuss these with the class. I'm planning on students posting a summary of the discussion online (I'll post the digital pictures to make it easier for them). In the Chemistry Unit 1 Forum, the sample student work is from last year. I don't know if others will respond to boards that weren't theirs to prepare but I'm mildly optimistic. It is a requirement that students post to their boards so I expect that to be the bare minimum participation (and their grades are linked there as well). At the very least, the forums will be a digital record of the whiteboards from class. When kids are absent and they miss whiteboarding, I usually hear groans as they understand this was important and they can't make it up. It is not as good as being there but it's better than nothing. -- Sherry",

          "Text": "For anyone who might find this interesting or useful: Zhang, Y., Zhao, F., & Mayer, R. E. (2025). Effects of Feedback Providers’ Positive Emotional Tone and Gender on Learning From a Multimedia Lesson . Journal of Computer Assisted Learning , 41 (3), e70052. https://doi.org/10.1111/jcal.70052 Abstract Background and Objective : The positivity principle states that students learn better from instructors who display positive rather than negative or neutral emotions in multimedia lessons (Lawson et al. 2021a). This study extends this work by exploring the role of affective and social cues displayed by feedback providers, such as their emotional tone and gender, on multimedia learning. Method : In this between-subject study, 160 college students received a five-section video lesson on human vision, with two practice questions inserted after each section. After each question, students received explanatory feedback videos presented by either a male or female feedback provider who displayed either positive or neutral emotion through gesture and voice. Results : Students who received feedback from providers with a positive emotional tone rated the provider higher on perceived positive emotion, supportiveness and competence, as well as on their own feelings of positivity. However, the emotional tone of the feedback provider did not impact posttest scores. Additionally, female feedback providers were perceived to be more negative, less supportive and less competent than male feedback providers, but the gender of feedback providers had no effect on posttest scores. Conclusion : This study expands the positivity principle (Horovitz and Mayer 2021) and the cognitive-affective model of elearning (Lawson et al. 2021a) by showing that positive emotional cues from feedback providers enhance learning, similar to the impact of the instructor's emotional cues in presenting the main lesson. These findings highlight the broader role of positivity in creating engaging and supportive multimedia learning environments across contexts. Summary What is already known about this topic ○ Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement. ○ The instructor's emotions impact learners' learning experiences and outcomes. ○ The instructor's gender can affect how students perceive and evaluate instructors. What this paper adds ○ This paper examines how feedback providers' emotional tone and gender affect learning. ○ The emotional tone strongly influences students' emotions and connection with providers. ○ The gender type affects students' negative emotions and connections with providers. Implications for practice and/or policy ○ Positive instructors are viewed as more supportive and competent. ○ More strategies are required to address gender biases related to female instructors.* ○ In-person learning settings are more effective than unsupervised online settings. * This has already been shown in multiple studies to be an issue for organisations that attempt to evaluate teacher quality via student opinion polls. They discriminate strongly in depressingly predictable ways!",

          "Text": "Re: \"○ In-person learning settings are more effective than unsupervised online settings.\" - At least on the affective dimension, there's an interesting workaround for asynchronous feedback on students' work; The teacher makes a video screen recording of themselves reviewing the work & narrating their assessment of it as they go. Any notes that the teacher makes on the document during the recording can also be viewed by the student when the document is returned as part of the feedback, e.g. in the Assignment module. Students reported that they felt it was like having their teacher leaning over their shoulder & speaking to them while giving the formative assessment. Studies have also shown greater uptake of feedback, e.g. more likely to redraft & resubmit, & more engaged in subsequent assignments. However, few studies measured the difference in effect from screen recorded feedback vs traditional written feedback (Typical written corrective feedback has many issues & that's another important topic for discussion*). Those that did returned barely significant effects so, in short, great for engagement but little evidence of effects on grades. *I suspect that if combined with more evidence-informed (i.e. effective) formative assessment practices, there could be a measurable, perhaps even worthwhile, effect size on students' learning & therefore future academic performance.",

I have linked the scale to the outcome. 4. I have create a quiz with a single multi choice question relating to the chosen outcome (I.e state standard) 5. The question only has one correct answer and that has been awarded 100%. The other answers are awarded 0%. 6.

          "Text": "This is just an advice question. I appreciate all thoughts on the pros and cons. I have a yearly event with lots of volunteers. We train these volunteers with a series of videos contained in a Moodle course. Love it, provides tracking, competition etc. Every year, some number of the videos get updated and need to be viewed again. Of course, there are a lot of volunteers that come back each year, but we always have those that are no longer active and those that are new. So the question is, would you create a new (duplicate) course with the still current and new videos, or would you just update the videos in the current course? If you suggest the latter, would you make a new activity for the new videos, or just update the video in the current activity and use the update student notification, to alert them of the new content? This brings up another question, which admittedly I have not researched. If I update the content of a video what happens to the \"completion\" flag? Does it get reset to off, is that something I get to do myself? Thanks for providing any thoughts you might have on this. Just working thru how I want to update the course content for this coming year and years ahead. Ken",

          "Text": "Hi Ken - There are different ways to approach a solution, and I think this is how I would do it: I would set up a group in the course for each annual group of volunteers. I would make the videos available to the current group of volunteers using the restrict access feature . Once the current group has gone through the videos and the volunteering work has ended, I would download the activity completion report and any other relevant data for this group. Then I would remove access to the videos for this group. I would then update the videos and any other course materials -- whatever I have to do -- before the next group of volunteers signs up. I would give access to the updated videos to the new group. This group may have people who have volunteered previously, but that's not a problem. All volunteers in the current group can access only the up-to-date materials. With this approach, I wouldn't have to maintain multiple copies of videos on the course homepage, keeping the course layout light and manageable, and there's no risk of current volunteers accessing old videos. However, past volunteers won't have access to the videos they once saw. If you want past volunteers to have access to the old videos, you'll need to use a different process. Anyway, with groups and the restrict access feature, you can do a lot of creative things.",

This signals to markers the student may have dyslexia, for example. The problem we are having is \"Eligible for sensitive marking\" status means students can complete submission without uploading a document or other file. Our in-house IT support say Efsm is treated as a submission type, therefore those students can submit without uploading their work. This puts them at risk of disadvantage. Ironically, some of these students have more need for support when submitting via Moodle. Is this unavoidable? Is there really no solution to this? PS I am aware the teacher can Revert submission to Draft -- I need the student to be unable to submit without uploading a file in the first place.",

After the class or session, you'd ask your students to take a picture (or pictures) of their work and upload these using the Moodle Mobile app directly to said assignment. By the time your grading and feedback should start, you open the assignment and annotate the work directly in Moodle. With the 'notify students' set to Yes, the students will receive your annotations and feedback as soon as you're done. And, using the grading workflow bit, you can even make sure to bulk release all the annotations at once, so you don't get the 'Have you checked my work yet?' questions from students.",

          "Text": "Merry Christmas Everyone! May I humbly offer my experience with installing, running and teaching in a one-teacher, 105 students, 2 subject installation of Moodle in our college.  Apologies in advance for grammar or whatever.  This paper is for my own use and has not been presented to a panel of experts yet (aside from you), and has not been edited by another person except myself. Following is its abstract: An exploratory study on use of the Learning Management System Moodle to two social science subjects. By installing a one teacher-105 student scale LMS, this research was interested in the LMS management and teaching experience it would provide. Furthermore, it intended to survey the students' level of participation, and factors that affect students' acceptance of online courses. Three classes in the College of Arts, Sciences and Teacher Education at Philippine Christian University participated in this study. Online activities were given in their subjects \"Life and Works of Rizal\" and \"Economic Philosophers\". Findings showed that one teacher can install, manage and teach in an LMS. It was affordable, easy to use, and easy to maintain. Problems can be solved with existing documentation and help from a community of Moodle users around the world. However, teaching online involved additional workload. It was also found that student participants had low participation in the online courses mainly due to lack of computers and internet connection. Furthermore, most students had a negative attitude toward stand-alone online courses because of a perception that it lacks reality. This attitude was found to be associated with ownership of landline telephones. It was conjectured that landline telephones may condition students into accepting virtual reality and thereby accepting online courses. Improvements to the course were proposed to increase participation, and further study on the conjecture regarding telephones, virtual reality and acceptance of online courses. The full text of the paper can be found here: http://tagalog.ws/mod/resource/view.php?id=335 Roel",

          "Text": "We are looking for a tool for program assessment and I am trying to figure out whether metacourses might provide a solution. Programs are interested in identifying courses at the beginning and end of the curriculum to use for assessment. Students in these assessment designated courses will be asked to complete assignments to be assessed by program faculty All students in these courses will complete the assignment A selection of these assignments will be chosen at random for assessment A panel of program faculty will assess these assignments against a standard rubric My thought is to create a metacourse for assessment. For example, if Psychology 101 were designated as an assessment course, we could create a PSYCH101_Assessment metacourse with all the Psych 101 sections as child courses. We could then embed the assessment assignment in the metacourse. The assessing faculty would be the instructors in the metacourse. Is it possible to embed the assessment assignment as an activity in the child courses? This would be ideal so that the students do not need to go to the metacourse to complete the assessment activity. Now to complicate matters a bit, we would like to have this assessment \"trickle\" up. That is, we would like to use the assignments for assessment at the departmental, college, and university levels. Is it possible to have metacourses where the child courses are, themselves, metacourses (Social_Science_Assessment with PSYCH101_Assessment, SOC101_Assessment, etc., as child courses)? If so, is it possible to have assignments completed in these child courses also available for assessment at the next level up? Thank you in advance for your thoughts.",

          "Text": "Hi, Amy.  How long have you been a Moodler?  I have wrestled with various levels of computer availability for the past 3 years that I have used Moodle regularly.  I teach in a very small high school in Gary, Indiana.  The poverty level is high and even public access through libraries is irregular.  I firmly believe in giving any access and exposure I can.   The time spent in a Moodle course or any other use of technology  in school is all that some of these kids will have.  I have at times done all of the following to help kids without computers at home and/or internet access: 1) scheduling computer lab time for the really important activities that I wanted the whole class to do by a specific time (like watch a video, answer a choice, forum, etc)  2) making the forum discussion a lesser grade than classroom discussion and combining both for the final grade for a unit, 9 wks, etc.  3) If it's only a few students per class, I have made my computer available for students when they are done with the classwork.  4) I made myself available before and after school so students could access the activities through lab/my room.  5) Provide  many resources and activities for your units of study and require students to do/access/read/participate with X of theml, then they have control over which ones and the student builds his or her own learning.  6) And, this year, I discovered that if a parent knows that internet access/computer access is an issue, they WILL help all they can to get that student to the library, a neighbor, etc.  SO KEEP THEM INFORMED ABOUT YOUR ATTEMPTS TO INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGY. Basically my best advise is, until the playing field is level and all players have equipment, don't base your whole curriculum on the Moodle course you create. Have fun exposing students to what is available.  Perhaps the more they get to do it, the more likely the parents will explore ways to help their kids get the technology. Whew, sorry I was so long-winded.  I hope my ideas help. Charlie Wierzbicki",

Here is the requirement: When a user completes a course with passing grades, he is awarded graduate role(removed from student role). This graduate role has limited access ie. read-only rights for most of the activities /modules. Currently we are able to restrict most of the activities (except quiz,lesson) according to the requirement. We need the graduate to be able view the lesson (questions/answers) without participating just like the preview mode . The graduate may view/refer these in the future .

You either have to: when using the rich text editor, edit the links in the source code write everything up in HTML source in an HTML editor such as Dreamweaver - a good freeware one is http://www.w3.org/Amaya/ (click on this link and you will see the target=\"_blank\" in action!)

          "Text": "How can computer-marked quizzes help students learn? A presentation by Tim Hunt as part of our series of workshop on \"All about conducting on-line tests with Moodle\" [1], 15 November 2023 (21 min) video1936226816.mp4 Abstract 1. As teachers, we cannot do the student's learning for them. All we can do is to provide scaffolding and feedback to help them. Online quizzes let you do both. 2. I want to talk about the two fundamentally different types of online questions: Selected response questions - like multiple choice - the student need only recognise the right answer in the possibilities given. Constructed response questions - like short-answer or formulas - the student must work out the answer without hints, but are harder to mark. 3. Different ways to use questions, like exams or practice. I think you covered this in a previous session, but I want to say it again. In this section, I will probably demonstrate our embedded question plugins. I will probably also highlight interactive with multiple tries behaviour. 4. Finally, I will talk a bit about academic integrity - which will start to move in the direction of what you will cover. Note that the above home for the video is temporary. Once the work finds a permanent home for the talk, we'll publish the new link here. Irrespective of that you are allowed, and encouraged, to download it and use it respecting the open license below.

Does not belong in this list, but it is pretty essential for me, to put courses in multiple categories and keep students registered therein. The ones I am considering are 4) Chardelle Busch 's Forum anonymity - to make some forums anonymous 5) Harry Smith 's quiz auto email - to send mail automatically, to one recipient or another, when students get above or below a passmark in a quiz. I don't think that these are openly available so please contact the authors. I have also always been considering the use of ActivityLocking / Conditional Activities which allows you to set some activities as being accessible dependent upon a quiz or lesson (?) grade and John Ryan 's hack to allow completely seperate groups.

          "Text": "Hi Drew, You can't directly set a minimum value in a specific grade category as a completion criteria. AFAIK , you can only require a minimum course grade value in Course completion. If these quizzes are the only graded activities in your course, the course grade would naturally reflect the aggregate of these grades. But an 80% average score over all quizzes is not the same as the 80% passing grade of each individual quiz. There may be another approach to this challenge, if you are willing to use the mod_checklist activity module ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_checklist ) in your course. With this, set up to record completions of associated activities, you can track the overall 80% completion of the course as well. And since this is a completion criteria in the Checklist activity you'd use, you're also able to have the its completion as a cource completion criteria: the course is completed once the Checklist activity has a grade value of 80% or higher.",

I wanted to share with you a tool I've developed that might be beneficial to other teachers. This tool was created at the Institut Obert de Catalunya, where I work. It's a spreadsheet that simplifies the grading of assignments by automating evaluation and feedback generation. It also prepares grades for export to Moodle, streamlining the entire grading process. In the shared folder, you'll find not only the spreadsheet but also a PDF manual that guides you through its use. Additionally, I've written an article that explains the tool in detail and where you can free download the spreadsheet: Article : itrascastro.github.io/moodle-offline-task-grading-spreadsheet/ While the tool supports the use of rubrics, their use is optional. You can evaluate with personalized comments, and although it was designed to integrate with Moodle, it can also be used independently. All you need is the list of students in the corresponding tab. If you find it interesting, please feel free to use it or share it with others who might benefit from it. Warm regards, Ismael Trascastro",

We hope to have the faculty complete the assessment over winter session, so that our support team can plan workshops and support for the spring term. If you've developed, used, or know of any tools like this, I would greatly appreciate it. We are a small graduate university (Fielding Graduate University) using Moodle 3.7 and I am the new Manager of Academic Technology. Thank you for your help!",

Your self assessment should always start with asking a few basic questions, like: what information would I want to collect, and how will I use this to support my faculty. Is this about pedagogy of online and blended teaching, or is this about knowing where to find appropriate tools in your Moodle instance and then how to use them? Also, you may want to consider upgrading your Moodle to a more current version with actual support and bugfixes. 3.9 is the current LTS version with bug and security fixes until well into 2023.",

For reference, here is the page I'm talking about: http://borntogroove.org/course/view.php?id=2&topic=all So, for something like Section 4, Simple Salsa I'd like to make the pdf, HTML, and MP3 available, with pretty icons (perhaps) all on one line.  (as easily as possible, of course.)

So, off the top of my head, might be worth investigating some of the html-pdf scripts out there (such as HTMLDOC - no endorsement as just did a quick google but will give you an idea. Note, there is an open source version hiding here .) Thoughts being: rather than multiple links, one html page per topic with embedded mp3s using one of the tabbed themes or book module one source file to maintain/update making things easier for the admin side of things (html) if pdf required, user can print (convert) on as needs basis hopefully (haven't looked) the pdf created would maintain links to mp3s Like I said, more a train of thought dump rather than concrete help but may have possibilities. There are a few on the fly pdf creators out there, pretty sure must be one that would suit. Regards H",

          "Title": "Learn Moodle 3.7 Basics Feedback and Actions",
          "Text": "Our Learn Moodle 3.7 Basics MOOC has recently ended and Helen and I are busy going through the participant feedback to improve the course for its next run, starting on 13 January 2020. Here’s a short overview of how the course went this time: Some\nfacts and figures: 3425 people started the course and of these 51% were awarded a Learn Moodle 3.7 participant badge for posting in a forum. 25% (845) went on to complete all 32 activities and obtain a certificate of completion and badge. 36% of participants chose to progress through the course one week at a time, while 64% chose to see all the activities at once. 31% of participants used the Moodle app when accessing the course. In the week 4 final feedback, 92% of participants said that their overall impression of the course was good or outstanding. In the week 4 final feedback, 88% of participants said that the tasks in the course were just the right level for them. What we did well: In control of your learning Participants appreciated being able to choose whether to see the materials all at once or have them revealed one week at a time. They also liked seeing the activity completion boxes and later, the course completion status: For me personally, it was a very good option to choose whether to do the course week by week or when ever I want! That's great because then everyone can decide which time is the best to do the course and I think this increases the number of participants.\nMoreover, I liked the ticking boxes next to the tasks! It allows a good overview. Alternative options Presenting the videos both online but also for download , along with the transcripts was welcomed particularly by participants with poor internet connections or where YouTube is banned, and is also recommended for accessibility . Everything was explained very clearly and pedagogically. Absolutely loved the fact that information was given in an audio-visual format! That kept me focused in a way reading wouldn't. Forum participation and collaboration Along\nwith an Introduce yourself! forum, each week had an Any questions? forum where problems were quickly resolved through discussion with other participants, not just the facilitators. Even though I dislike participating in forums, due to my own insecurities, I really enjoyed the forums in this course. The forums and transparency help to give confidence and show that there are others who are just learning as well. Despite the course being aimed at new Moodlers, experienced Moodlers return regularly to help out, in the spirit of Social constructionism upon which Moodle is based: Super content and great participants. I liked having some experienced folks in the class and appreciated their comments in the forums. Five\nparticipants received “Learn Moodle Basics helper” badges for their invaluable support in the MOOC. Thanks to John Bennett for being our “doorman” welcoming every single participant to the course - some feat! Thanks to Hart Wilson and Domenico Recchia for\npatiently responding to queries (in several different languages) and thanks to Twahir Hussein Kassim for motivating participants with his infectious enthusiasm. Grateful thanks finally to Michael Milette for enrolling in and highlighting\na large number of practice courses. Other regular MOOC participants are also appreciated and valued - please come again! How we can improve: Supporting learners in other languages The course is in English, but we make it clear people\nare welcome to post in their own languages. This seems to work quite well in Spanish but participants speaking other languages sometimes struggle. The videos have English transcripts which are available to download and read but we do rely on volunteers\nto translate them into other languages. If you are reading this and you’re a native speaker of a language other than English, please read our page on Translating Moodle video subtitles. Clarifying workshop instructions We’re getting there,\nslowly! This time fewer participants were confused about the different phases of the Workshop activity, but some were uncertain whether they had submitted or not and whether they could edit their submission. We’ll make a short screencast to explain what\nto expect as a participant. Big Blue Button help The new Big Blue Button HTML5 option allowing participants to join in our live sessions from their mobile devices was very well received. However, some people still struggled with the settings,\nespecially sound. We’ll include some simple tips for new users to read before they join the sessions so they get a better live experience, and don’t need to rely on watching the recording afterwards. Bug fixes! For us at Moodle HQ, one of\nthe benefits of running a large-scale MOOC with the latest version of Moodle is that it highlights bugs and improvements that developers can fix. Here are some of the bugs recently reported or confirmed: MDL-66090 - Confusing analytics upcoming activities due notification email MOBILE-3086 - Title on database not linking correctly MDL-64598 - Emojis are very big when emailed MDL-65803 - Invalid record error message from deleted item in recently accessed items block - already fixed in Moodle 3.7.1! MDL-64935 - Jump to button interferes with activity/resource links - already fixed in Moodle 3.7.1! If you missed the MOOC this time or if you didn’t get to complete it, we’ll be opening the Learn Moodle 3.8 Basics course up for sign up during December ready for our January 2020 launch. Keep an eye on our social media accounts for updates.",

Each row includes a URL field, and an issue description, and also a resolved/unresolved value. This way there is a direct URL back to the Moodle page where the issue occurs. You could do similar things in a project management application. I would love a way to add review comments to a Moodle interface, as only visible to a teacher or admin permissions level... that would really enhance content development process. I've experimented with custom database fields to that effect, but couldn't get customers to use them. But for now we find that the Web-based environment allows us to work faster, because more than 1 person can work on the course at 1 time, and so it's worth whatever trouble it brings, for that reason. Better than passing a proprietary file format back and forth over email. Best, A",

For instance you can have a 30 minute quiz but allow a student with an IEP 1 hour.  In the course you can have 3 assignments which vary in skill level.  Based on what group the student is in can determine which assignment they see. Using the Group Choice Activity you can allow students to join groups based on a test score such as NWEA.  Then each group might have a course topic which is only viewable by members of that group.  In that topic you would have activities designed to increase their skills so that they can move up to a new level. Moodle is awesome at restricting access based on conditions or sets of conditions defined by the teacher at an entire topic or single activity level.",

The idea that a low functioning kid would somehow devalue a silly badge that is to show progress and learning is like saying the kid who starts on the 50 yard line should score the same touchdown as the kid who gets the ball at the goal line. The best way to handle this is to make sure each kid is learning and moving closer to the goal. I don't want to sound mean in this post but I am putting on my parent hat.  I see my child in your post on the low end due to no fault of his own.  He was born this way on the low end of the spectrum and while brilliant in many ways he doesn't always learn the same way other kids do.

BUT: He's been doing generating the team scorecards manually for each of his 10 class teams, each of which receives a score for \"accomplishments\" and \"attributes.\" Accomplishments include winning the (Moodle-integrated) TurningPoint clicker quiz (scores stored in the Gradebook), having the best class attendance (stored in the Gradebook). Attitudes include mindset, grit, knowledge (e.g., each team's Gradebook test scores are summed and added to this figure). WANTED: Moodle-automated score keeping for such team-based gamification. We'd REALLY, really , Really like to see weekly scorecards automatically populated with up-to-date team scores. Much of the required data is in the gradebook. But I am not sure on a conceptual level how to use the data to auto-generate weekly team scorecards. The gradebook does not, by itself, seem like a good tool for aggregating such group scores. Does it? Nor do I know how to build this on a technological level . Hence, I turn to you, Oh Wise Moodle Community, both because of your knowledge and because of your celebration of progressive pedagogy. I look forward to hearing feedback! Sincerely,",

          "Text": "I have spent a lot of time in the Moodle Gradebook  trying to coerce it into a gamification platform. I can offer a few tips: Use the configurable reports plugin to generate a leaderboard based on criteria Use custom scales (regular intervals) and letters (irregular intervals) Use weighting to convert scores Use exponential scores in the gradebook to level up  Level 1: 40 level 2: 80 Level 3: 160  level 4: 320 level 5: 640 TOTAL: 1240 Use a wiki and allow participants to rate each other  on specific aspects- scores go in the gradebook Use the assignment module with group submission Use subcategories within the gradebook to aggregate results for each level - this forces scores to stay within the current level I teach a few days a week and do Moodle admin/consultancy the other days so I have real students to test out my ideas on. The time involved in keeping scores is laborious and as much as a simple spreadsheet can do it, I am in search of making Moodle do this for me. Wherever I can get students to enter their own scores, or peer assess saves me entering and aggregating the results. The release of Outcome sets in 2.8 (hopefully) will allow us more flexibility in matching activities to outcomes and grades.

What we'd like to do: Create classes/courses on Moodle so that each class has one teacher and only the students in the class can view the content. Teachers can post messages to students in that class. Students will be in multiple classes and should be able to see English 101 and Science 101.

If you believe that any content on WiZiQ infringes your copyrights, you can simply report to us, using the \"Flag\" button on top of the content player, with proof, on support@wiziq.com, and the needful shall be done. Dear Arun, Thanks for your interest in WiZiQ. Our engine is not open-source, and although WiZiQ is very different from Moodle, we might well meet your requirements. As an individual teacher, you can explore the \"Plans for Individuals\" tab on our Premium Services page. If you run an organization, the \"Plans for Organizations\" tab has detailed information.

I'm finding that creating a dummy course set up like I want all my courses, then IMPORTING it to another course, then deleting out what I don't want to be a time-ineffective method. It takes days. I've used other systems that have csv/excel importers that build course content including activities that automate the building of many complex courses. It's particularly slow to have to edit every single topic to have the same set of activities, completion rules, and conditional release rules, and custom pages, etc. google hasn't brought up anything for me yet, I'm hoping someone might know of a good way to build courses using some kind of automation or external process.",

In other words: Course 1, Activity A is completed by the student and when Course 2, Activity A (same as Course 1, Activity A) it already shows completed status. Would badges or competencies be best for this? This is the case where you have multiple corporate trainings where the review of an external document is necessary.  You only need to indicate that the student has clicked on the link but you want to be able to mark as completed between courses.

          "Text": "Ca 10 years ago, I constructed quizzes for the course, including a number of Cloze multichoice questions. Each quiz is designed to be finished before submitting, marked and returned with feedback. I recently moved from Moodle 2.4 to 3.6.  A student has raised a problem which I think is new. The Cloze question is \"Choose the appropriate state for the material applied. sand in sand blasting {1:MULTICHOICE:%100%solid#sand is used as a solid~%-100%liquid~%-100%gas} solution of ammonia gas {1:MULTICHOICE:%-100%solid~%100%liquid~%-100%gas#the ammonia gas is dissolved in water, which is a liquid} \" + 5 more multichoices. The new (?) error is that a wrong answer not only gets scored 0 but has a penalty of -1. On previewing the question in editing mode, the technical information informs me that the behaviour used is deferred feedback, which results in this behaviour.  There seems to be no way to change the \"behaviour\" of this question within the question editing screen. If I alter the behaviour in the quiz settings to adaptive mode (no penalties), it has no effect on the behaviour of this question. So- How can I achieve my requirements of Submit all> mark & feedback, plus have no penalty applied? Thank you",

This is not the first time that an existing syntax and output has been modified, so affecting my existing questions and their underlying purpose, without any effective warning or workaround. It would be sensible if a new feature was given a new name and process, so the existing feature in existing courses are not modified. Version control in any programme of work is necessary to avoid glitches such as these. I can see the potential need to support negative scoring of answers, but that is only one of many didactic tactics. As its implementation is so deep in your soul, did you provide a switch so it can also not support negative scoring? It seems as though the deferred feedback facility has got mixed up and confused with negative scoring so I may need a way to separate them. Can you suggest a way forward?",

Once the research was done and they were ready to go public with their findings they took any remaining sensitive material off the site and asked me to make the remainder publicly accessible.  The Project Co-ordinator tells me that Moodle was a great help in the project, so if anyone wants to see how Moodle helped to uncover the secrets of an object which is well over a thousand years old have a look at http://www.lichfield-angel.net/",

          "Title": "Learn Moodle 3.6 Basics: Feedback and actions",
          "Text": "Sunday 3 February was the last day of our latest Learn Moodle Basics MOOC. From this week the course is in read-only mode (using the new Context freezing feature!), and Helen and I are busy preparing for the next run, Learn Moodle 3.7 Basics, starting 10 June 2019. Here’s a short overview of how the MOOC went: Some facts and figures: 3005 people started the course and of these 46% were awarded a Learn Moodle 3.6 participant badge for posting in a forum. 21% (624) went on to complete all 33 activities and obtain a certificate of completion and badge. 32% of participants chose to progress through the course one week at a time, while 68% chose to see all the activities at once. In the week 4 final feedback, 93% of participants said that their overall impression of the course was good or outstanding. In the week 4 final feedback, 86% of participants said that the tasks in the course were just the right level for them. What we did well: Course design The course design was well received, both the short videos and explanations and the social constructionist element. Here’s a summary from one participant in our anonymous feedback: Following are the things which I liked in your course so I am writing this. These were implemented at different points (before, during and at the end of the course): 1. flow and the way you have designed the course which gives scope for both novices and advanced user of moodle to learn many things. 2. learning activities eg course creation which applies the principles of active learning and utilizes the power of peer learning. 3. collaboration and evaluation of content by the participants across the globe. 4. reflection on how the course meets our learning preferences. Thanks for the well-designed course. I hope to learn more from the future course. MOOC management One of the MOOC’s strengths is in its diversity, again something mentioned in our anonymous feedback: Given the large number of participants with different languages, skills, backgrounds and knowledge of Moodle, I think the course went very well indeed. Great support from the tutors and others online. It is always a challenge looking after so many people, but we are grateful to our regular attendees, experienced Moodlers who like to help out. Along with the Participant and Completer badges, we award a “Helper” badge to those participants\nwe feel have done a great job helping us. This badge is only awarded to a handful of Moodlers. The Learn Moodle 3.6 Basics Helpers are below: many thanks to them all! John Bennett Gisele Croce Joost Elshoff Varenne Riocha Alejandro Vásquez Hart Wilson How we can improve: Clarify the workshop times and instructions Although we try each time to make the deadlines and instructions clearer, participants still get confused. Confusion arises because the activity is not marked complete until the very end of all stages of the Workshop, and there is confusion\namongst some about the final deadline time. We do encourage participants to make sure their timezone is correctly set in their profile, but we plan also to include times as well as dates for the workshop submission and assessment deadlines. We're also changing the instructions for submission from 'Add a picture...' to 'Attach an image...' and setting the maximum number of submission attachments to 1. Notify participants via email about their certificate In future, once participants complete the course, they will be emailed their certificate. This should help people who have struggled to understand the instructions for locating and downloading the certificate on the course page. Make more of Moodle’s new features While the MOOC is designed for complete beginners, people also join to discover the new features of each new version. We’re going to try to highlight these better in the next MOOC, for example with new quiz questions or activities or a dedicated\nsummary page, to ensure there is something for everyone, new or experienced. Bug fixes! Participants are great at finding the occasional bug in in the web version or the Moodle app. We make sure these bugs are reported so they can be fixed not only for our next MOOC but for all Moodle users. Here are some of the bugs recently reported\nor confirmed: CONTRIB-7589 - BBB session times different on timeline from in the course MDL-64571 - Duplicate 'This is a copy of a message sent to you...' in message notification emails MOBILE-2876 - Error in the Moodle app when assessing workshop submissions MDL-64625 Odd display of Book TOC in MS Edge/ IE https://github.com/markn86/moodle-mod_customcert/issues/266 Custom certificate should state the number of certificates awarded In April, we’ll be opening up the site for sign up to the Learn Moodle 3.7 Basics MOOC . Follow us on social media for news of when sign-up will be open!",

As many of the assignment s are quiz based that although can give just answers there is an extensive section dedicated to how answers are arrived at - as well as normal uploading of student prepared presentations with notes this will be a huge task. Has anyone got any best practice they can share - that saves time/paper . As I am not an educator  I was wondering about letting them access the learning directly but wanted to see if others went down this avenue ? Currently the Moodle version we have is 2.7.7 and the department has numerous groups set up as they are made up of part-time and full time students thank you in advance",

          "Text": "Hi all, I've recently started playing with Moodle (there's been many trials already!) and had a quick question. Background: I teach IB Chemistry which is a 2 year course with 11 standard level topics, 10 higher level topics and a choice of 1 out of 4 option topic (with standard level and higher level aspects). Each of those topics has a number of sub-topics. Some students are SL while others are SL+HL. Question: Would it be better to have 1 course, with all the topics (I was thinking about the collapsed topic plugin or grid plugin) OR to have each topic as a course and break down the sub-topics as topics? Pros and cons that I can see immediately: 1 course: All grading available in one area, but huuugggeee! Plus I will be rolling this out slowly (roughly each topic just before it's started in class). Not sure about hiding HL content from SL students - or whether I'd want to (let them explore further if they're interested in the subject) Many courses: Can keep courses hidden while work in progress. Grading (and other information from plugins) cannot be easily carried between courses? Can restrict access to HL courses (to avoid information overload / confusion... sometimes the HL have a different method due to exceptions that get introduced!) Any thoughts on this? How would you set it up? Thanks Michael",

I teach adults literacy and numeracy, and have found moodle most effective when I can make a page my own for a particular group of students. This is especially so as when I use courses over again, I adapt and improve them based on students' responses and on my new learning. I rarely like using other people's materials or ideas without at least some adaptation - whether they are IT based or not. Also -do you think we all reach a point where we've had enough learning - it's just one thing too much. Or we're not motivated because we can't see the benefit (there's a lot of IT for IT's-sake). I can't be doing with programming the video... I'm sure I could learn, but I'm more interested in other technologies than spending time learning how to use that. Interested in what you find out!

I'm making myself familiar with Moodle and I don't foresee any problems in the near future getting acquainted with it. My question is: Is there a way to have our course running on our own Moodle installation (our server ) while the foreign university enrolls the students, gives them access to their Moodle server, and then the students use those credentials to access our course without the university being able to have any control over it? The course would never be installed in the university's servers, just ours. Any advice or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

On the learning design side of things: I'd recommend having a good look at building a question with 40 (!!) answer boxes in the first place.

I'd like to make the words \"module descriptor\" link to the relevant files. ( I suppose I could tweak the Glossary to do this). Other links could include a Quiz or Tool list and so on. I suppose my question is: Is there a way to Hyperlink in Moodle...and can it be used in imported texts? PS I see from this form that there is a chain logo for a link button.

They should only use their admin accounts when they need it, and use the regular account for teaching or participating in a course.

Automatic Mapping is a illusion: Not all cars will be black. (Starting with database -structures and moving to XML is a good survival strategie?) By the way, how many Martins are there working on the system in this \" robust development and user community..\"?? Fle3 is a nice option to have as a module inside Moodle, so is D3E, not mentioned in the Article but a nice product from Britisch Open University: It's the combination of a source on the left and a discussiontree on the right. Some of my D3E-mockup-imitations, top be recreated in Moodle: https://elo1.hetstedelijk.org/board/toep0.html (sorry in Dutch, but you will understand) https://elo1.hetstedelijk.org/martin/dubbelhotpatatoes1.html (= read the text and answer the questions, idea from hotpotatoes) https://elo1.hetstedelijk.org/board/toep4.html (a movie, but worth the waiting: question for the discussion in a multimediaclass: is this real or manipulated, please discuss..) https://elo1.hetstedelijk.org/board/toep3.html (a 3D object for discussion, and so on)",

When you add the block to Site home or Dashboard, it only lists announcements accessible from there, but not from the courses the user is enrolled in (Or at least, I haven't found a way to make it do that). Depending on your Moodle version and theme, there are a few other ways to display this information to your users. Most used is the Notifications icon available in the top bar of your Moodle, if you're using a Boost-based theme. The course announcements forums have been set up to force subscription, which means all enrolled users will receive notification of posts there, via email or in-site notifications (or both). The notifications box will display a row per post and will send the user directly to the corresponding forum when he/she clicks on it. Alternatively, the user receives the full text of the post in his/her email.",

Our medical students undertake a number of placements at different hospitals. Each placement covers a different specialty – for example, students go on ‘Surgery placements’ and on ‘Paediatrics placements’. I am planning to set these up as Moodle courses. There are also 'longitudinal' themes that are studied in all three years, and which are relevant to every placement. Examples might be ‘Ethics and Law’ and ‘Leadership and Management’. Course Coordinators want students to have access to all material on all placements and themes, both past and future, at all stages of their course. I could set the Themes up as Blocks.  I wonder if this is the most intuitive way to handle this or if there are other approaches that would make the cross-curricular nature of the Themes more transparent.",

I'm not sure how much of your question is about how students travel around their course/s, but it seems to me that you are setting up a number of courses and students will enrol on the course for their placement specialism when and as they commence it. I think I would have approached this slightly differently, with the longitudinal themes in a meta course, so that students had to complete part of that (the 'fundamentals') before going on to the specialities. You could add key 'issues' in the meta course and send them back to look at 'key issues in Surgery' 'key issues in Paediatrics' from the placement courses. It's probably too late to make a meta course, but you can achieve the same effect by putting links to the longitudinal course (put all of these 'fundamental' themes into just one course - there are interactive) within the placement courses, and set up some forums for discussion about the application of theory/models etc. within the placement courses.",

It seems sensible to show your students how themes link, and to do so as simply as possible from both the admin, the teacher and the student point of view. So I would suggest putting them into one course. You can, of course, put them into different sections (topics) within one course (when I say 'course' I mean it from the Moodle point of view) I think this is the advice we are all giving you - to think about the curriculum you are teaching in a more unified and joined-up way.",

          "Text": "I don't know if my understanding of what you want to do is correct but I would approach it like this. Set up categories for each of your faculties. Then set up courses for each of your main topic areas (or potentially group topics together). Your decision on this has to do with where you plan to go with it. If you only ever want to stick with assessments on Moodle then I would say group the assessments to keep things central and simple. If you plan to extend later and add course material as well as other collaborative activities (wiki's, forums, databases, etc) then I would say split them out so that later you can easily add material. Then set up your quizzes. Create pools of questions so that they can easily be reused etc. Easiest way to do this is to get all your teachers to work on it. Set a target such as each teacher must contribute 3 questions. This will force them to get involved and create ownership. After you've run a few classes through, go over the results and tweak questions (some will be too hard, others too easy etc).",

There are a couple (or more?) potential methods. Set up the \"master\" course with the separate deadlines for each Part after 1, 2, 3, 4 elapsed months from the starting date, which is chosen when the iteration is activated. Or less efficiently when the course has been made available to students, bulk edit the deadlines of each activity in a Part to the appropriate date and time.

          "Text": "The \"Subcourse\" plugin can help you organize your course into separate Parts while managing deadlines more efficiently. With this plugin, you can create a \"master\" course for each Part, and then link them as subcourses in a main course. The deadlines for each Part can be managed individually within their respective \"master\" courses. Here's how to set it up: Install and enable the Subcourse plugin in your Moodle site if you haven't already. You can download it from the Moodle plugin directory: https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_subcourse Create a \"master\" course for each Part of your main course (4 courses in total). Set deadlines for activities within each \"master\" course. You can use either the \"Restrict access\" method or the \"Dates report\" method described in the previous answer to set deadlines more efficiently. Create your main course where students will enroll, and divide it into 4 sections corresponding to the 4 Parts. In each section of the main course, add a Subcourse activity and link it to the corresponding part Repeat step 5 for all 4 Parts. Now, when you start a new iteration of the course, you only need to update the deadlines in the respective \"master\" courses. The main course will automatically reflect these changes, as it pulls the content and deadlines from the linked subcourses. Note that the Subcourse plugin only helps in organizing the course structure and linking content and deadlines. It does not provide a direct way to set deadlines based on a variable starting date. You still need to manually update the deadlines in the \"master\" courses for each iteration. HTH",

This also allows recommended or, pre-requisite courses that are required before progressing to the next course. This is possible from activity to activity within a course, as well as needing course completion to advance to the next course. The learning paths are coded into the courses etc, but would not be a custom path each time done this way. You might be able to do this as Basic English >> leads to >> Advanced English. Course A leads to Course B. Course Z and Course X are standalone courses. Each of these could perhaps be set up for course completion and then be used in a final course needing completion of other Courses to be accessed.",

The teachers want all the records for all the students in one place, whether they took the course online or in the classroom. So I know we need to manually 'enrol' them into the course, but how do we go about making sure they get credit for the classroom version? I have activity completion working, and the online users get automatically credited, but if I change that to manual self completion then the online users can 'cheat', can't they?

          "Text": "Dear Kate, I understand your situation and I do not think there is a technical solution to it.  If you do change it to manual self completetion then the students can 'cheat' unless a teacher operates a separate tick sheet to confirm through questioning that the student has completed the task before they click on the completion and any ticks without teacher confirmation is cheating. The issue here is running two parallel systems, IMHO either you operate the online system or the classroom system for all. However, you could choose to ignore activity completion and set an end of course / topic test as the metric of assessment.  And any students who did not complete the tasks required of them will get lower marks.

Anyway, I have a teacher in Moodlle\nversion 2.3.  She has used a Standard forum with grade settings using maximum rating (grade 5 points) She reports that Moodle entered a grade of 5 into the gradebook automatically after the student made 5 posts. She never even looked at the posts or gave any ratings and was surprised to see the 5 show up in the gradebook.  I have never used this rating so have no experience with it.  When I read the info it seems different than the result reported to me. I just need to know  ... Is that the way maximum is suppose to work ... as soon as 5 posts are made ...the grade 5 is entered into the gradebook? I am attaching a file that shows settings, report and grades. Thank you for taking the time to reply. Ann",

As far as I know nothing has been altered with the forum or ratings ...  It does return the grade of 5 (maximum setting) when the learner has made 5 posts.  Nothing shows up in Grades until 5 has been reached. The thing I can't wrap my brain around is ...  I had thought that the teacher would be issuing a grade for the student's posts, and then \" The highest rating is returned as the final grade.\" Especially since in the documentation it says, \"This method is\nuseful for emphasizing the best work from participants, allowing them to\npost one high-quality post as well as a number of more casual responses\nto others.\" However, the way it works on this site is that there is NO evaluation, by the teacher, of the learner's post ... it is just quantity not quality being recorded. Which is more like the sum of ratings! I have checked the teacher's settings and everything appears correct ... just not getting the expected result for the maximum rating.

These teachers are not regular employees of our school, they run they own business and just collaborate with us for the time of the training session. Each of them will use her/his own instructional material and they would like to ensure that it will be kept private. In other words : each teacher should not be able to see the two others's teaching resources, but students should be able to access activities of the three. My idea was to create four groups : one for each individual teacher + one for the 24 students, then create one grouping that will include the three separate teachers groups + the students group. Do you think it's a good option, or is there any other way ? I'm not sure my explanations are clear, but if you could give me some advice on how to manage that challenge, I would be very grateful. Thank you in advance. Laurine",

Why didn't you create separate courses per teacher Typically a teacher is teacher on course level. This means all elements are visible for the teacher. You can add the teacher as student to the course, prepare a topic per teacher with some activities and give the teacher teacher permissions for this elements Its not possible on topic level. Now comes the trick. Create a group for all students. Define that the teacher topics have limited access to the teachers topice. As long as the teachers are not in the students group they will not see the elements. Hope its clear. Ralf",

Is there a way I can link to the next page at the bottom of the pages as in Moodle 3.9 and Moodle 3.11 (There I have seen the functionality). I'm looking for an option to do a \"next\" and \"back\" inside the page, so the students don't have to navigate to side menu all the time. I can't use the URL -function because the course will be set up on different servers from time to time. So I need to link within the Moodle Course and not a URL solution. If there is a fix for my request then I have another question: -  Is there a way for me to hide some of the pages or activities but still for the students to encounter them? some of the content works best as \"surprises\" for the students. I know there is a Lesson -activity where the content isn't shown in the side menu, but the problem is that I need URL variables for specific content, and I can't seem to get access to them once I start to make the structure of a lesson as I only can put in content or questions.",

This can be enabled by default at the site-level, or made available at the course-level.  For me, it's available under \"More\" in the course menu at the top of the page, and then selecting \"Filters\" from the drop-down list.

In addition to the various plugins that we used\nto create the conditional route based on the assessments and\ncompletions , we added badge and ranking; we would like to\ncreate a kind of interface mask that depicts the path so as\nto make the most of the game idea. For example an image with a pointer that moves\naccording to the package to be carried out and detects the\npath with the resources already completed. The result that we would like then , is not a\nsimple course held vertically by unlocking the blocks ( scorm resources ) of the arguments. Is there anyone who has already done a project\nlike this or someone who can recommend any themes or plugins\nto complete the game platform look like? Is there anyone who has a website to share? We\nexchange some ideas ? I hope you can help us Thank you all , greetings , Walter",

And also note that being in an online meeting doesn't necessarily mean the student actually participated in it. Best way to measure and mark participation ( IMHO ) would be to set up some course activities to synchronously take part in, as part of the online meeting.

It will hold images of 15-20 subjects (over 100 images in all) that physicians will view. After they review each subject, they are required to complete three PDF files (the forms will be filled out and electronically submitted to a third party). Once they have seen an image set and completed the PDF files, the Principle Investigator does not want them to have access to the set again. Also, if possible, to randomize the order of the PDFs for each subject (one time PDF1/PDF2/PDF3, then PDF3/PDF1/PDF2, and so on). Terms and Agreements Another issue is the site policy. It is currently in a window, but they want a full page so that the user has to view the entire file prior to submitting a Agree/Disagree choice. I considered a Choice Question as Topic 2, but how can I make it so that the remaining topics (each subject is a topic unless there is a better way) are not viewable until the user Agrees? So I used the Site Policy but the widow thing is not what they want. Current Configuration Currently I have each subject as a topic. Is this the best way? Would a lesson be better suited? If so the some seriousl guidance per the first paragraph would be needed on my part. I have two items per subject/topic: image gallery with the PDF forms and then a Lesson asking if they completed the PDFs. This is not available in following subjects until they have comleted the one previously. The problem is the images are still viewable and there is no way I know of to embed the image gallery into the lesson so they can see it and open the PDFs at the same time. Conceptual Flow Welcome Screen User Agreement Subject 1 Opened Subject 1 Image Review (images available during PDF completion) PDF1 PDF2 PDF3 Subject 1 Closed Subject 2 Opened Subject 2 Image Review (images available during PDF completion) PDF3 PDF2 PDF1 Subject 2 Closed Subject 3 Opened... ...And so on I hope this makes sense.

          "Text": "Hi everyone. This is a request to larger schools/universities or organisations that use Moodle to manage courses with large numbers of students. I'm currently trying to \"sell\" the use of Moodle as a CMS/LMS to my company. Their reluntance was based around the \"free-ness\" of Moodle (what's the motivation/agenda for producing free software) but I've now overcome that. Now, though, its a rather different issue. Though I've demonstrated that Moodle will do all my organisation needs at present, its still being compared to the expensive, though somewhat more flashy, commercial products. The fact is, these commercial products are accompanied by very good salespeople, adept at demoing the products and making them sound compelling. And I'm not a salesman! So, I guess what I'm looking for is help, from those people who administer large numbers of students in multiple courses. Can you let me have some case study material that I can use to position Moodle up there with the commercial products (stuff like ease of use, administration time reduced, money saved, numbers of students etc, stuff that'll help bring Moodle to life for my management team). Any help you can give will be very much appreciated.",

How you organise your students and teachers varies from school to school. In my old school for example we used categories for subjects (eg English, Mathematics) and then had a course per year group - Y7, Y8 ( I am in the UK) and then used Groups to separate the classes in the courses. Students and teachers were added to their groups by a csv file at the start of the year so it was easily managed. So all the Y7 English teachers and classes were working in the same course but if they really wanted to , they could use Restrict access features to only show work to their own classes and hide it from other classes. However ... this is just one way of doing it and hopefully you will learn some other ways of organising your K-12 school Moodle and you will be able to make your own decision. Also take a look at our Admin quick guide and our Teacher quick guide",

A WP Program consists of one or more courses, whereas the Learning Plan consists of one or more competencies, that can either be assessed directly or through completing course activities . It would be nice to see a feature such as programs in Moodle LMS, but that's probably a roadmap thing for the future. You could, however, use the course custom fields to mark a set of courses as being part of a specific program. That course field can then also be used in the My Courses / Course overview area to filter courses that belong to the same program. Also, you could use the subcourse activity, combined with a course set up to be a 'Program Hub course' to group all the courses in one of those programs.",

The approach I would suggest is to use a Database activity within your course. Add a field for uploading a picture, and set the maximum file size at something small, say 200 KB. Then ask your learners to resize their images, along with some advice on how to do that using readily available software, before they upload the picture. https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Database_activity https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Database_templates",

I am using the topics within a course as \"stations\"...but students are not required to do every option within a station (topic)...I do have requirements daily of specific stations that must be completed. So, for example, stations A, C and E might be required on Mondays, A, B and D on Tuesdays, and so on. But within each station they have a variety of options to fulfill that station for the day. And at the end of the week, they will not have completed all options...there's far more than are necessary (intentionally so, to allow for more choices.) I need to figure out a way to make it clear what they've completed already and what is still an option to do. So as the week progresses it's easy for them to easily see at a glance what's still available....and for me to be able to see at a glance what's been completed, as the week progresses. It seems like there should be a way to make the completed assignments just disappear or appear greyed out? I had tried out a checklist plugin but I'm not sure that's the way to go...I don't really like the way it works. I'm also still learning how to configure assignments so that students can mark them completed. How do I do this? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!",

In my case, there was a multicomponent grade, derived from several specific sub-component grades. I did override one subcomponent, but all components became browned out. My theory was that due to the complex calculation of sub-components to the multi-component grade, overriding any component browned out all sub-components. With my students, the overridden grade differed from the inherent rubric grade in the specific overridden component grade. But... that did not hold true for other faculty, in another section of the course, the rubric and the gradebook grade have the same numeric value. I will try to find out if this faculty person manually entered grades into the gradebook, then went back and clicked on rubric slots, instead of simply clicking the rubric first.

          "Text": "Hi Tawanda, The short answer is that, in order to view/listen to media in Moodle, is has to be downloaded into learners' browsers in order for the browser to display/play it to them. It is possible to use a 3rd party media streaming service which would make it more difficult for learners to save copies of the files for themselves. However, even with restrictions such as this, which can introduce a number of other issues that can inhibit learners' ability to study, it is still possible for determined learners to save copies, e.g. with browser extensions or audio output/screen recorders. Sony, Disney, Microsoft, Adobe, etc. put a lot of time, resources, & effort into preventing people from copying media & they haven't been able to find a way yet. All they've managed to achieve so far is to make it more difficult & inconvenient for people to view their media legitimately. In short, there just isn't any way to prevent copying media from the internet. I hope this answers your question. All the best,",

That seems to be pretty complex as is, because Moodle does not allow you to set a minimum grade for an assignment. So Moodle grades between 0-10 always. We use rubrics to catch that problem. For example, if you make sure the minimal score of your rubric will always be 10% of the total, you will always grade between 1-10. But this leaves us with another problem. The rubric does not respect the 'grade to pass' setting. A rubric will always set the grade to pass to 55% no matter what you set it. I have created a tracker for this 2 years ago: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-66105 Unfortunately it has not been picked up. Does anyone have a work around for this?",

          "Text": "We have  a Moodle 2 site which is being used significantly by many departments and has a lot of material that has been added to it over the last couple of years. We have a corporate general layout with a standard banner and, unless departments have altered them, a standard heading format. However many of the departments now have long lists of links which can result in a bit of death by scrolling. We have a main drop-down menu system with up to 4 layers but, at times, this gets a bit large so I am possibly looking at having something like a second indexing or menu system within the course itself so that I can reduce the levels in the main drop-down menu at the top of the site itself If this problem is familiar to anyone and they have found a solution I would be grateful for some ideas. If I can't get access to sites you may be talking about would it be posible to send me some screen shots. As ever in education I doubt there will be any money for external professional re-programming so whatever I do will need to be within the limited abilities of me as a teacher. Our site is kevigsvle.kevigs.lincs.sch.uk. Much of the site requires a log-in but the Broader Curriculum drop-down menu and then the Careers option should allow guest access. Any help or ideas greatly appreciated Thanks David",

There are assessments in the book that I'm trying to replicate in the digital world.

I want to capture the answers and allow the students to come back to them at a later time and make changes, and if they choose to work with a consultant, I would like to allow the consultant (in the teacher role) to see the answers. I don't want grading. Most of them are essay type questions for personal reflection, though there are a few that lend themselves to multiple answer. Does anyone have any suggestions for which activity type(s) would work for this? I thought about the online text assignment, but a coworker suggested that having the students copy and paste the questions into the submission field was a little hokey. I've tried the quiz activity, but the proliferation of buttons seems to confuse some of the older students (by older I mean some in their 50s and 60s), and I really don't want grades, so there isn't any reason for them to ever \"submit\" their answers. Am I missing something, or do I really just need to hack the quiz thing to show fewer buttons and try to get rid of the grading?",

I agreed the time line and the fee for the work.  He suggested to me to open a user account in Guru.com and the payment will be made in the escrow account I engaged the developer who earlier worked on waitlisting feaqture in moodle to modify the code.Every day he came through Skype and I guided him to upgrade his current moodle version to 1.8.2 and set up moodle sites in two of my test servers and demonstrated the working of the program He further insisted that I have to part with paypal integration and shopping cart code for his use.  Added to this he wanted me to upload his moodle instance in my test server and incorporate the code with his code that he already added to certain files. When the work was completed, I asked him to send a mail to Guru to say that the work is completed to and the money be released to me. But he kept quite and stopped contacting me. Next I got a mail from Guru saying that the project was closed by the client with a request to release the money back to him. Guru further asked me to go for a dispute resolution and later arbitration I sent Guru the entire trascript of the conversation between me and the developer where he admitted that he is new to moodle. Now the matter is pending for dispute resolution.  I have his full site perfectly working in my test server. Every day he is sending a message to me to remove his moodle instance from the test server This is my first experience I am in a fix and I wish to know whether I am wrong or simply stupid Nagarajan",

If his Moodle is on your webserver, and there's traffic coming to it, then I'd modify it by putting a big banner on the front page saying that the person you helped to set it up is refusing to pay you so all his potential customers see that he's a con man. I don't know how the law works in India, but if he's in the same country as you I'd be inclined to take him to court as well if you can.  You can make life difficult for him, damage his reputation so others will be warned from making the same mistake, and possibly affect his ability to borrow money if he needs to. To avoid being ripped off in future then rather than waiting till the end of the project and then trying to get the money I'd insist on staged payments, ie you do part of the job, you get part of the money, you do another bit and you get some more, and so on.

For example, if a teacher wants the students to see only some of the topics in the course, the only way (I think) is to set the number of visible topics on the course settings page. This solution, however, has two disadvantages - 1/ the teacher cannot see the other topics, either, so s/he cannot add content to invisible topics, and 2/ the tools from the hidden topics are still accessible via the \" Activities \" menu on the left. I think the teacher should be able to hide/show topics to students (they would still be visible to the teacher) using time (date) criteria or on demand. Naturally, the tools located in invisible topics should not be accessible through the \"Activities\" menu on the left. What do you think, Martin?",

There is a Students heading in the Navigation block under the Course but it only shows the current user. if you are logged in as a non-editing teacher you can click the Students heading and it will show all the users including students who are not enrolled in the current course. I looked at the People block but it does not appear when logged in as a student and for non-editing teachers and up it shows a link to students. Thanks",

          "Text": "Hello! I'm designing a course that will be mostly self paced with little teacher involvement. Probably about 6 units/topics. The majority of the material students need to study is on an external website. Perhaps 30-40 links. I want to be able to provide some context for each link (meaning information in written form). I also want students to be able to tick off each link as they read it. At first I thought I would use the book resource so I could have a page introducing a link and then have the link at the bottom of the book page. Each book would be including about 4-5 pages like this. But... There is no way for students to keep track of where they are in the book. To me this is a mind boggling shortcoming of the book resource. Bookmarks are not new technology! Anyhow, for that reason, I feel like the book is quite useless if the students need to keep track of what they have read. So I thought about using the Link resource and including my intro/context in the description of the link. That would allow students to check off what they have read. If I wanted to give a general intro to a topic, I could have a page resource at the top of the list of activities . Is this the best way to do this, keeping in mind that I want students to tick off the links as they read them?",

Another thing about URL resources is that \"groups\" are supported. For example, you might have three links to newspaper articles, and divide your class into three groups, giving each group a different URL to go to.

We could change the course end date (and make the courses last 2 years)\nso the teachers could peek/pick past work and use it in the present. Anyway, I don't like this solution : you'll have to hide everything\nconcerning the past year, and it will display useless empty weeks. Is it necessary to create a brand new course and duplicate almost everything ? I don't like this either : a given course should remain \"one\", it should not be cloned each year... (imho) Of course, from one year to another, students may understand some points more quickly, or more slowly. The teacher should be able to adapt the way the course goes.",

We all know that Moodle has 4 types of forums: \"A standard forum for general use\" \"A single simple discussion\" \"Each person posts one discussion\" \"Question and Answer forum\" For example, for \"ice-breaker\" type of \"introduce yourself\" type of activity, I found that using \"Each person posts one discussion\" would probably be most effective (each student \"owns\" their own \"thread\" and other students could comment it, etc.). Also for \"larger\" discussions, \"a standard forum for general use\" probably would be better. How about other types of forums? Could anyone please post your stories of using different types of forums to achieve your \"instructional goals\" or \"learning objectives\"? Thanks a bunch!! Wen",

This isn't suitable for everyone of course but when you want one discussion only and you want your younger students to be focused then this is the one I prefer. I also like this single simple discussion for sharing resources -playing games. I have seen on the internet an excellent example of the so-called Photoshop Tennis using this type of forum - one person posts a photo which is then changed slightly and reposted by another student and then another student continues the story by editing the photo yet again... and so on..",

So later when I want everybody to have a \"conversation\" and reply to each other in discussing a subject, they ignore each others' contributions and start a new discussion. But in the last few weeks I've stopped using the standard Moodle forums because of all the advantages of the Open University's ForumNG developed by Sam Marshall. There are a few disadvantages because it's not fully integrated into Moodle (for example, the forum search engine doesn't find ForumNG posts) but these are minor compared to the all the plusses.

Another way would be to use a quiz, with question category available on a site wide basis.  The teacher requiring a consent form would build a quiz.  Hint: If you put a number in the question title they will always import in alpha order into a quiz.   The first question could be the instruction.   The second question \"Do you agree to being recorded?\" Get clever with you custom scores.  One answer might be \"I agree to being recorded\" and it gets 5 points. A second answer might be \"I do not agree to being recorded\" and that gets zero.   You could also give some feedback with the second answer and allow the student to take it again.  Then there is the assignment module.

Design around what students are going to DO rather than what content you want to deliver 4. Whizzy things I would therefore go for '2' in your option list if I have to choose:  streaming stuff leads to complications (suddenly not robust).  Number 1 sounds as if you are thinking how to deliver content to them and are a bit vague about what they will 'do' (hotpot tests', '..go through lecture'). Can I suggest another approach?  Since this is about writing you could really do some great things with forum work, e.g. give students some text to edit, have them post their different versions in a forum.  When they are used to this do the exercise with another bit of writing and, publish thier edits and then get them to assess each others edits.  This is a very powerful teaching technique - you will have to police their feedback carefully though - make sure they know how to feedback politely to each otherwise you could have some flaming wars on your hands. The advantages of the above:  Forums are v robust and simple, students will engage carefully with the 'doing', you should get some interesting results which can be further discussed with the students.  For further reading Gilly Salmons books should be of use.

I've heard a lot about adult learners dropping out before the end of their e-courses because they found the content boring. I agree we have to get a lot more activities into the course. It's interesting that you advocate the 'page-turner' model ... I thought  that's what would kill student interest. .Your idea about using forums to discuss student work is very interesting. How would that be different or better than the workshop module? rahman",

You can compress the MPEG files further and output them to web friendly formats with this free and open source video encoder/transcoder: http://handbrake.fr/ It includes a task scheduler to encode lists of video files unattended; line them up, hit start, and go and do something else. Oh, and don't do too much video recording and encoding/transcoding on laptop computers, it's very demanding and tends to put excessive wear on GPUs (They overheat and eventually break down).

          "Text": "Hi Jackie - If I may chip in and reflect on my own experience as a site admin of a large Moodle site, users who have a system-level role as a teacher (or manager) sometimes get confused about why they can't experience a course as a student would. This confusion is more likely to arise if they're not a regular user of the Moodle site. On the other hand, if they use the site regularly they might remember that they have a high-level role across the site, and what the privileges and drawbacks are of having this level of access. I agree with Mary about asking high-level users to use a completely different account for student rights, and perhaps they could use a slightly different name on their account profile just so they know this is their student account, eg, John Doe (student). If they need an account with student rights simply to test things out and not actually be a student, the profile name could explicitly identify this as a test account, eg, John Test Account.

Some with pictures, etc. I teach in a US middle school. so I use a new course for each quarter to keep the amount of material managable for my kids. Is there a way to have a library of resources (web pages) that I as the teacher can pull from (or potentially share) easily and put them where I need them in my course. Right now the pages are all hidden on the tenth week of the courses. But, I will have to move them into the quarters I plan on using them. ----------------",

And its the later supported scorm versions ( The articulate site suggest that an LMS operating to SCORM 2004 4th Edition, is the best option, and perhaps assume then that version reports the scores too ? )  you require: https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/SCORM_FAQ#Supported_Versions You may want to ask this question on the articulate support forums too, as well as in the scorm section of these moodle forums.

Pax Populi, which is Latin for \"the People's Peace,\" is the people-to-people peace-building program of the US-based nonprofit organization, Applied Ethics, Inc. For 11 years, the main work of Pax Populi was its peace-through-education program in which fluent English speakers would provide English tutoring to students in Afghanistan via videoconferencing. After the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, we have suspended our work in Afghanistan as we were concerned that if it continued we could put our students at risk. Instead, we are in the process of setting up a tutoring program for the influx of Afghan immigrants arriving in the USA every day. To act on this we need an English language curriculum that is specifically geared to newly arriving immigrants. It would cover such basics as going grocery shopping, counting money, telling time, etc. Does anyone know if there is an open-source curriculum for teaching ESL to members of a refugee community? Similarly, we presume we are going to need to teach some of them how to use a computer and the internet. Is there an open-source curriculum that would teach the very basics of how to use a computer and the internet. Thank you.",

Thus we would have the following categories:- Standard 1 Standard 2 Standard 3 Standard 4 Standard 5 Standard 6 Standard 7 Standard 8 Subjects are; Maths, Science, English, Kiswahili, Social Studies and Religious Education. These appear to fit in to Courses in Moodle, however we have 8 difference syllabuses for each subject. Would it then be prudent to have each subject as a subcategory and then have different courses for each year within the subcategory?

          "Text": "I have interest in this area as well. I wouldn't say that adaptive learning is native in Moodle, but the tools in Moodle and in course build tools outside of Moodle that can work natively within Moodle can be adapted to that use with some strategy in the design stage of the course. Captivate 9 can build SCORM lessons that can be used in Moodle. You can build in pretests with the results controlling what sections are skipped or complete by the student. The nice thing about this option is that it goes beyond just quiz questions and lets you customize the lesson too. Infosemantic is coming out with some new HTML plug ins that also let you pass custom data to the browser cache to be held and picked up in the next SCORM lesson. I plan on using this to even bypass some of the pre-testing because student level data can be carried forward into the next SCORM. As far as how to customize within Moodle with tools that already exist within it, we have put the random/pools, hint levels, and redo feature to good use toward a psuedo adaptive learning method. It has taken a lot of work to reorganize all of our questions by type (over 40,000 of them), but it is worth it and would have to be done in a fully adaptive learning environment anyway. Once the question banks are organized by question type, we start to build the quizzes themselves. We label the sections using information labels so the students know what question type they are working with. A student that knows the question type well will get the question correct and move on to the next type. If a student misses, they have two hint levels with point reductions of half at each miss. The second hint where all the points are gone will show a work through for the student to study and they are directed to click try again and then redo to replace that question with a new one of the same type to take what they learned from the walk through and try again for full points. They can keep working at new problems of that type all that they need to until they can get at least one question correct from the pool. Even if they do get a question correct, they can still select the redo for added practice to nail it down. We set a required 80% mastery (activity completion) on practice assignments, so even lazy students that might not take advantage of the redo feature at will find they must do so just to move on. If they do not pass at 80%, they must retake the practice and that retake will be a new random combination of questions from the question sets, so they cannot just copy and paste answers in from their last try. Students are also encouraged to retake the practice assignments as part of their exam study. Even if they passed, the retakes are valuable. We have ours set to highest grade so students are not fearful of retakes possible dropping their score. Note that at the moment there is a bug in activity completion where teacher score over-rides or hand-scoring does not automatically show the next assignment. There is a work around even if it isn't an elegant one. You just enter the student that got a score over-ride into the exceptions in the next assignment and then they can see it. There is a feature that let's you show and hide activities by groups. We looked to split out students into groups by overall skill this last year in a course or two and use that to add an additional layer of customizing the course to fit the student. It didn't seem to extend into the grade book though, unless we did something wrong. We found that the grade book expected both levels of the assignment to be done instead of just the one they were assigned. It has caused some confusion. To really make good use of restricted access as an adaptive learning tool, the grade book would have to show only the assigned activity and ignore the alternate. Good design: When you set the question pools up, organize by type and difficulty. For instance, in chemistry I have questions of the same type broken out into a formula used directly as being grouped into an easy level, medium would be using that formula but solving for a variable that will require some algebraic shuffling, and hard would require students to realize they need that equation in combination with something else they have learned forming a multi-step problem beyond rote procedural knowledge. All three types would be in the quiz for all student, so it isn't 100% like an adaptive quiz which would have kept lower performing students in the simpler questions, but we have found that it has worked well for us nonetheless. I do like that the lower performing students do get a glimpse of how the next levels up differ so they know what they are aiming toward with growth. The walk through at hint 2 lets them immediately study how it is done so that they can grow with each attempt. They can get extra live teacher help if they are still struggling and student and teacher know exactly what to target when they look at the questions that were missed (thanks to each type and level being labeled).",

          "Text": "Hi, Im using 1.9 I have the typical  leesons to build with multimedia components comprising video, images, mp3 and text. My weekly lesson may have 4 or 5 short videos, pdfs etc Ive looked at each resource and tried to determine what its best used for.   Ive built/structured my weeks units like this.  Can you please comment if you know better methods or for-see any problems with what im doing. On the main lessons page that lists all weeks of the course, im using brief text with headings, This page is basically a launching pad to strings of webpages that interlink with weblinks at bottom.  (BACK and NEXT) Im adding my video link, text and images etc in the page itself using the links function in the text editor along with image insertion. Q1 On a webpage, you cannot create a resource...like add a label.  As i see it that is only available on the main lessons page.  WHy would some-one create a \"label\" as opposed to just writing the text on the page?  How do you use Labels? Q2 Is this the best way of doing this.  ie Covering/teaching by a series of  interlinked webpages? Q3 When i add a video, via a text link etc  How can i get this to embed in the page itself instead of opening in a whole new page.  A new page, when it finishes playing has no naviagational way to return to the webpage it launched from.  Can it be embedded.  Is there a plug in for this.  Any recommendations? I appreciate any thoughts given.  Its taking me forever to build, and id like to minimise having to redo chunks becuase i used the wrong resource to achieve somethings.  All the best, John",

          "Text": "Hello John. I will have a go at your questions; Q1.  A label is basically just a piece of white space that acts as a separator between activities /resources. So you might for instance on your main page (ie the course main page which in your instances is weekly format) have a pdf link, a link to a website and then a directory of files. You can insert a label with some explanatory text or even an embedded image and put it in between the link to a website and the directory of files to give some detail about the files. So you could use a label to split up your weekly/topic section into subsections for example. You can set up your webpage as you wish so you don't need the label's bit of white  space. Q2: Your way seems fine to me although it's not necessary to have weblinks \"next\"/\"back\" if you set the webpages to open in new windows and explain to the student that they close the page with the \"X\" to return to the main course page. The other option is a Lesson which actually gives you a series of linked pages which has its own built in navigation. It is however quite complex to use as a beginner. (I did a video demo of a lesson in 1.9 here http:// ) There is also the contributed Book module which is simper - just linked pages again with its own navigation. You can embed video/audio and images into that too. My school's archives are all done as Moodle books - see here But you would have to download and add this as a plugin; it is not standard Moodle 1.9 ) Q3: If you go to Site administration>Modules>Filters>Manage filters and ensure Multimedia plugins are enabled and then to the Multimedia plugins page you can enabled embedding of a variety of video and audio formats. The when you add them via a text link in the page they embed automatically on the webpage.",

The original idea was to ebolish paper material also word documents and to have it all in one centeralised area on a back end database and a web front end. Now, we use moodle as a \"second point of call\" between students and teachers. The teachers can upload their course material (lecture notes, assignments, etc) on to moodle and students can then download the course material.

In the final step the teacher has a grid with all the elements, can edit them and create the course. LAMS is very much based on the ideas of Learning Design working with course patterns that are abstracted from real courses. It would be fine to create a similar modell for Moodle.",

Not everybody will agree: there's always some goody-two-shoes who thinks that we should all starve or eat lots of lettuce and organic cow droppings just to ensure that the people who live in silly places and can't grow food can have pizza for dinner. Still, maybe they'll go and join the war and that'll be yet another problem solved. However, is this really a question for a moodle forum?",

I use my institutions instance (still couldn't figure out how I can get the Moodle version... Checked source, but didn't see the version, I expected a \"meta\" mention or something, but...no) The error message says that the file I am trying to import is of type text/html and does not match the expected type: text/plain (original message is in french). The gift file has indeed a lot of html in it, but AFAIK this is perfectly valid: \n```text\n::q123::[html]\nThis is my <strong>question</strong>\\:\n{\n=abc\n}\n```\n I am using Ubuntu, and what I don't understand is that it appears to be ok from the OS part: \n```text\n$ xdg-mime query filetype myfile.gift \ntext/plain\n$ file myfile.gift \nmyfile.gift: moodle gift file, UTF-8 Unicode text\n```\n So? Is there some kind of file analysis by Moodle itself, before uploading? I must say that this happens only on Linux platform, same file with Windows imports fine. So it could be an OS-related issue, but I just can't understand what is going on here. At what step is the file type checked, and what part does that? The OS or Moodle?

          "Text": "As far as I can tell Moodle relies on PHP's FileInfo extension to determine the MIME type. So it looks like: The file is uploaded by the browser in a POST request to the Moodle web server . Moodle's PHP source code writes the file and uses FileInfo to get its MIME type. Moodle adds an mdl_files row for the file with mimetype set accordingly. Exactly how FileInfo determines the MIME type could be affected by changes to the server\nconfiguration, such as operating system files such as /usr/share/file/magic or PHP's configuration. But In my tests on both Fedora and Ubuntu your file is detected as\ntext/plain: when I upload your file named myfile.gift from my Fedora workstation to Moodle the question import works as expected. And that's what is returned if I use the attached test script to get the MIME type of that file. But you say that there is different behaviour depending on whether the browser is on a different operating system? Perhaps you could use your browser's developer tools to check that the POSTed file is the same in both systems. If it's exactly the same file that you're uploading in both cases (and remember Microsoft Windows text editors will use CRLF instead of Linux's LFs) then you could check to see whether the uploaded file has the same hash, for example: \n```text\nSELECT filename, contenthash, mimetype FROM mdl_files WHERE filename = 'myfile.gift'; \n\n\n+-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+ \n\n\n| filename    | contenthash                              | mimetype   | \n\n\n+-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+ \n\n\n| myfile.gift | 9f0b7dd0fc4fd778306945d336364c6d86a3a406 | text/plain |\n\n\n+-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+\n```\n Also: file types can be overridden in config.php by setting $CFG->customfiletypes . Also: to determine Moodle's version from the source code check the $release value in version.php in the top-level of your Moodle source code folder.",

What I forgot to mention in my initial post is that I did indeed create a new \"magic\" type for gift files, before posting. The problem was probably related to some \"reloading\" of that new type in some OS database . A couple of days later (maybe I rebooted? Can't tell...), I am now able to upload the same file without any problems. For those who ran into the same issue (and as the format of .magic files is barely documented), I just created a file ~/.magic holding: \n```text\n  \n0 search/16 CATEGORY moodle gift file\n!:mime text/plain\n```\n (I use CATEGORY because all my gift files hold that item on the first line for easy handling of questions sets.) What puzzles me is that you mention that Moodle uses the mime-type (as provided by xdg-mime query), and that command identified the file as \"text/plain\" from the beginning ! I don't know what happened... So, I guess, as it works now, I'll stop my investigations and leave that mystery floating.",

I'm wondering if I need any further specific skills to say I can support it as I am an IT Trainer moving into e-Learning. It seems all too easy. I started about 5 years ago looking at it, more as a personal development but its become something of an obsession. I have got a working version of Moodle that I keep 'tweaking'. Of course its developing all the time too so getting into practice with upgrading between versions. Good to know that there are NHS people using it! Best wishes. Shona",

In NHS Borders we decided we needed a fresh approach to education. In the past we relied on key professionals attending a seminar to discuss new vaccine developments. This was augmented by a powerpoint presentation and endless email updates. They ticked boxes for us in the Public Health Dept as having tried to enlighten colleagues but in truth their impact was questionable. Small numbers of health visitors, even less practice nurses and next to no GP's attended. Phone calls kept coming in for answers to q's that were addressed in the seminars. With the new HPV programme Moodle came to the rescue. With the help of E-Learn Design Ltd (a Moodle partner in Scotland) we planned an interactive programme to better engage people with the topic. It consists of three modules covering key topics, forums, quizzes. It also acts as a repository for important documents that all too easily get lost when delivered as email attachments. Well watch this space to see how it is received. So far so good. Lots of positive feedback. One or two grumbles from some who took a dislike to being offered this free resource without being asked first. Well you rarely can please everyone! Several hundred people were sent enrollment details. We can track the uptake as well as get a handle on how much of the content has been absorbed through the quizzes. More programmes planned for the near future........",

Moodle would be a great way of having each students work in one place rather than hundreds of bits of paper that get lost, squashed, ripped etc. There seems to be no way of losing anything online. In addition, with the recent flu outbreak, both teachers and students are having to stay away from school.

If it is for revision notes, try individual (or collaborative) wiki, or even blog . If it is not being graded then feedback activity would be fine, but you could use the quiz still. It depends on the purpose of what you are asking the pupils to do. If there is no grade, will the teacher be giving comment based feedback? Will a teacher look at it at all, or just check it is done? You could set up the questions as individual Q&A Forums for students to post what they find out then carry on the discussion. If you want them to 'submit' something you could do it would be via an Assignment (online text) - which would be one of the easiest to set up. Hope that helps. Vinny",

Any suggestions? cheers, Erik",

          "Text": "In secondary schools we now have Vocational Education & Training courses that require a student to be assessed as either Competent or Not Yet Competent. This means a student can keep resubmiting an assignment until it is deemed Competent. This raises the issue that once the assignment is graded and commented upon (Not yet Competent) then currently the student cannot resubmit the assignment. Has anyone confronted this problem - if so what approaches have they used? I thought of suggesting to Martin that the drop down grade box include the options of Competent and Not Yet Competent (followed by if statement etc), what does everyone think?",

Site's main purpose is to provide information about adult education, organized by local educational institutes. Site contents are made in cooperation with several institutes, as well as local labour administration. Site is also used as a our project's intranet. In our website planning (links, texts, navigation) we have modified some of Florida State University's user- and need-based website planning guidelines (Sampson et al. 2001, Panke et al. 2002; see http://www.career.fsu.edu/techcenter/ ) for user-friendly site structure. Site itself has been builded using Moodle's courses, modules and blocks. Moodle courses has been used as \"user profiles\" to provide different contents and links for different user groups. Expect intranet, all courses are open to guest user - logging in is not needed. Most of Moodle's functions are hided to keep user interface as simply as possible. In front page and inside side each profile (course), most of the contents has been made by Nwiki. Nwiki provides great blocks like content block and search block. There has been some technical problems in Nwikis backup/restore in Moodle 1.6.x, but otherwise it's a great tool for our purposes. We have reported these problems to Wiki discussion as well as to Moodle Tracker . Our Moodlesite called Akkuna (a Finnish word for window) is http://www.akkuna.fi . Unfortunaly, it's in Finnish only... Please feel free to add any comments here or with email jani.lemmetyinen@joensuu.fi",

If the purpose of the activity is to create document translations, then I suggest using a word processor in split screen mode.  Or, you could post the original PDF document in Moodle and instruct the SMEs to open MS Word for their translation (resize the Moodle/MS Word windows so both can be seen).

But you could look at the Install notes in the documentation. http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle You can use activity locking (for now) and conditional activities (coming in 2.0?) to send students to relevant links. I've never heard of a custom plugin or block showing learner progress. Maybe someone else knows of something. I very much like the idea. While it requires a linear course, certain courses/learners could really benefit from it. SCORM courses (composed of several elements), when loaded into Moodle, do this automatically, in the sense that they show a checkbox with checkmark beside all completed activities. The gradebook will also show this if your landmark activities are graded activities. The student can view his or her own progress, but no one else's. Let us know what you decide to do, and how you go about it. A block might be a good way to implement, if you do. A",

Please do visit the general and see the questions I have posed on today concerning the gradebook's calculations for assignments in my class. It appears that that the system is ok with whole numbers but has a problem when it has to calculate with a decimal. For example: Student 1 received 35 DQ 1 and 30 DQ 2. the gradebook total is 35. That is correct. But, for Student 2 who has 35 or DQ1 and 40 for DQ 2, the average is 40 in the gradebook. So it is not averaging those grades; but apparently picking up the DQ2 grade as the total grade. This is a technical problem with the program. Please do follow up with your technical people to correct these problems, as they are serious in that the students are not receiving their proper grades due to this. Another problem, the weeks for my case study assignments in the grade book are: Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3. This is so confusing; and, the students are especially confused when trying to determine which week they got the grade for. Although correct when they enter them; the gradebook does not have the weeks in order. Please do advise. I am not sure what Moodle system we have; but, please do respond back to me so that we may correct this problem with the gradebook. Dr. Verta Midcalf vertamidcalf@sbcglobal.net (618) 303-9898",

A 6 hours difference would also allow her to translate the trainer's inputs before the participants meet the next day. Have you ever had to address a similar language issue? If so, how did you do it?

Using a translator to improve the feedback from the trainer is going to be essential here, and using the time difference to turn around the material will help, but this will be a tough task for the trainer. The only suggestion I would make to the OP is to make sure that the translator is also very familiar with the subject matter.  If not, a lot of small but significant points could be missed which will make the trainer's job even harder, and the experience for the learners will be deprecated.

          "Text": "Hello Moodle Community, I’m reaching out for help regarding an issue I’ve encountered with tracking attendance for videos inside SCORM when using HLS or embed stream links from a third-party video hosting service. The Issue I’ve noticed that if I embed a video stream link (HLS or iframe) from an external video hosting service (e.g., Bunny.net, Vimeo, AWS S3) inside a SCORM package, Moodle does not track whether the learner actually watched the video. The SCORM package seems to have no way of detecting: •If the video was played •If the learner watched the full video •If they skipped or fast-forwarded Since the video is hosted externally and not inside the SCORM package itself, SCORM only tracks whether the module was opened, not the video completion. What I Need Help With •I do not want to add logic conditions like “Click to Confirm Completion.” •I only want the video to be watched, and SCORM should automatically mark it as completed when the video ends. The Dilemma: Should I Upload Videos Directly into SCORM? To ensure proper tracking, one option is to upload the video file directly inside the SCORM package, instead of embedding a streaming link. However, this raises concerns: •LMS Performance Issues: Large video files inside SCORM may slow down Moodle. •Storage Consumption: Hosting videos inside SCORM increases the size of backups and restores. •Streaming Performance: SCORM loads the entire video, unlike HLS which streams efficiently. Questions for the Community 1.Is there any way for SCORM to automatically track video completion when using an HLS streaming link? •I do not want students to manually click any “I’ve completed this video” button. •I just want SCORM to detect when the video ends and record it as completed. 2.Should I upload the videos directly into SCORM, despite performance concerns? •Will Moodle handle large SCORM packages efficiently if videos are embedded directly? •How do other users manage video-based SCORM tracking without affecting LMS performance? 3.Are there alternative methods to track video completion while keeping the SCORM structure intact? •Has anyone successfully used xAPI/Tin Can API for tracking externally streamed videos? • also I don’t want to integrating an H5P Interactive Video inside SCORM be a possible solution I really appreciate any insights, solutions, or best practices from those who have tackled this before. Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "Hello Makseem Mak! Tracking video completion inside a SCORM package with external streaming can be tricky, but nothing that a good technical adjustment can't solve! If you want to keep the video inside SCORM, the most effective solution is to create logic that listens to playback events from the video player. Some players allow triggering JavaScript events when the video starts, pauses, or ends. With this, you can send these events to SCORM using `SCORM 1.2` or `SCORM 2004 API` ( `setValue('cmi.core.lesson_status', 'completed')` ). This approach requires the video player to support this JavaScript communication. On the other hand, if you don’t need the video to be inside SCORM, I recommend using the SuperVideo plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_supervideo ). It allows for more efficient control over student progress, ensuring that the video is watched before unlocking the next content. SuperVideo offers advanced options, such as mandatory full viewing, progress blocking, and integration with detailed reports within Moodle itself. This way, you keep the experience smooth without compromising LMS performance! If you need any more help, we’re here for that! 🚀 Eduardo Kraus Innovation and new products",

The problem with that is that if we push a reading back by a\nweek, then I have to adjust the text on each week's page, which\ninvolves odius amounts of cutting and pasting.\" We treat readings somewhat differently, as they are usually associated with an assignment. Therefore, in order to keep the main Moodle page from being overwhelmed with reading items, as well as to make sure students see that the readings are related to assignments, we put the readings directly into the assignments. I have a CSS class that I use to highlight the readings so they are always displayed in a separate colored box. This way, when I move assignments around, the readings go with them. This may not respond to your specific context if your readings are attached to a topic rather than assignment, although you might also think about creating a single assignment called \"reading\" and then putting all of your readings in that one assignment.",

If Moodle would look after both environemtns for us that would be ideal, rather than having two systems. Any thoughts about how this could be achieved within Moodle? Regards Andrew",

I just tweaked the title of your post as not everyone understands the term \"shell\" (myself included, until recently) I think you mean courses or maybe empty or customisable courses. One problem with student training courses is that your site might be a theme specific to your organisation and so any navigation/student training materials made elsewhere might not be applicable. However, let's see what our community comes up with. As for teacher training courses, if you mean training teachers how to use Moodle there are the Moodle HQ Learn Moodle videos. 30 + on basic teacher needs. The but there are other playlists for earlier versions of Moodle on the Moodle HQ YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/moodlehq/ I think in terms of verifying faculty and students have completed the courses, you can simply use Activity completion and maybe even award a badge or certificate once they have done all the activities?",

That way it doesn't show up in the gradebook. I would put in a graded item in the gradebook named the same as the Forum (that way students think it is the same thing) and make it worth however many points you want.",

I am working with a school and I want to show them this format but can't find it. Could someone please help me?\n\nThe format was more topic based. It presented the content in pages with back and forward buttons that allowed you to work in it more like a book. An added advantage was that as you built up the learning activities on each page, a menu on the left hand side was generated. When the student worked through the activities, the relevant page title on this menu was highlighted so they could see where they were. The menu allowed students to work through each page or go directly to the page they wanted.\n\nEach 'page' could support video and all the course activities could be added. I liked that learning could be presented more flexibly and sequentially to assist with scaffolding, revision, etc.\n\nHope someone can help.\n\nAndrea",

However, there may be advantages to including social elements, such as shared tasks on discussion forums, for example to reduce the perceived social distance among cohorts of learners, improve teacher presence, & to improve course completion rates. For a course that is intended to last 14 hours, I doubt that there'd be much time for effective \"community building\" & it's unlikely that the students would feel that it's worthwhile unless the course is part of a larger programme in which whole cohorts are studying together. Even for \"Carnegie unit\" courses (i.e. 12-14 weeks), community building tends to be brief, shallow, & not all that beneficial in terms of students acting as useful resources for each other, e.g. recommending useful resources & helping each other with academic issues.

The corollary is that if students have to go back and find information, if the books are large it might be harder to zero in. If you're using activity completion, individual pages will give you greater granularity in terms of seeing who has looked at what. This often isn't necessary.

Let's say your 'Pass, Fail, Absent, Excused' scale is being used, it'll work as follows: No score = 0/4 points Pass = 1/4 points (25%) Fail = 2/4 points (50%) Absent = 3/4 points (75%) Excused = 4/4 points (100%)",

If i tought the course 10 times, i could potentially have the same content 10 times in Moodle in 10 different courses. This takes up space. Now i cannot use the same Moodle Course page to teach different classes as it may contain assignments marks and possibly exams marks and files from the previous class which must be maintained for 3 years per the University policies.

          "Text": "Case: For the practical exam, each students need to get assigned a random IP range to use in their virtual lab setup (I teach computer networking). In the exam instructions published on Moodle, it says \"use the randomly assigned IP range to you\". So now I wanted to create a quiz with just 1 random question of type \"description\". I created tons of these description questions, each with another IP range mentioned in it. But that is not working, questions of that type cannot be randomly included in a quiz. I tried a multiple choice question where the IP range is in the question, and where there is only 1 answer option (= \"I understood, and will use this IP range\"), but question type multiple choice requires at least two answers. I would prefer that student does not need to type or click anything as answer, since I do not need an answer from them. I just need a way to assign them a random piece of info that they need to use in their lab. I tried the essay question type, but also an answer IS required (either text or an attachment) I tried the Cloze question type without any answers, but that is also not accepted by Moodle. I do not have site admin rights to add new activities to our exam Moodle. Otherwise I could try to create groups (their names would be the different IP ranges) and assign students randomly to those groups and use the group choice activity to show them their assigned IP range. But that group choice activity is not present in out exam Moodle. Who has any suggestions to achieve what I am trying to do????",

It would then be easier to just hand each student a piece of paper with the IP range they should use for their exam when they enter the auditorium. I am of the opinion that a platform such as Moodle should make life easier on lecturers, not more complicated by draining away extra time in setting up stuff like this. I found another workaround: as a teacher I only have a limited set of activities that hae some kind of random function built-in. Such as the generation of groups and assigning members to these. But there is also a random aspect to the question types formula and calculated multiple choice. I have solved my dilemma (although not as elegant as I would like) by creating 1 calculated multiple choice question with the variables x and y in them in the following string which has the same font color as the background (ergo white): 172.{x}.{y}.0 The question also contains the text (in black): Below you can find the IP range you have to use during this exam. Please check that you have been informed of this IP range. Answer option 1 is then set to: 172.{x}.{y}.0 with mask /24 (incorrect answer) Answer option is set to: I have been informed that my IP range is 172.{x}.{y}.0 with mask /24 (correct answer) And I have set the variable x and y so that is x randomized between 16 and 31 and y between 1 and 254 I then created a quiz with this 1 calculated multiple choice question with the display name \"click here to know the IP range that needs to be used\". Thanks for thinking along with me. It is appreciated.",

But they would need to know that of each other, be able to see each others laptop screen, communicate with each other in some way for this to be a problem. So it serves my purpose of giving my students a range that is not hard coded on the exam instructions but is given on the spot by Moodle. Thus reducing the risk of fraude. I have other systems in place to, to make sure that each student has a unique set of configuration parameters for their virtualized network components. Each student a unique IP range for them alone would be nice, but is not necessary for my purposes.",

Or the grouping Classes will contain two groups Class A and Class B . You'd use this grouping to manage class forums, like the Announcements one, where erveryone in the class has access, but the students aren't distributed into groups for this activity. You'd also need to set up a grouping for the Project work or In-class groups. Any activities where these groups are relevant, need to be set up to 'separate groups' with a grouping listing the In-class or Project groups. This would make sense for Assignments or Wikis in particular. The Moodle Docs on groups and groupings is a good point of departure for what you're looking for: https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Groups",

          "Text": "Okay, let me focus on the \"sections\" first. I would create two \"groups.\" You can name them whatever you want, such as Section A and Section B. Then, put the appropriate students into each section. That's about it. If you want to, you could create a grouping called \"Sections,\" but I don't see it doing much. Maybe someone else will see an advantage of creating a grouping for these two sections. For your \"teams of two\" I would create a \"group\" for each team, such as TeamA, TeamB, TeamC, etc. Then I would also create a grouping called \"Teams\" and add all these Teams to the Teams grouping. See if you have success doing this. You can create a bogus course with bogus students to experiment. Sometimes it's a little awkward when I do this because I think you create the Grouping first, then create the teams. I'll let you experiment on your own because this will give you good practice. One advantage of having these Teams is that you can create discussion forums for each team to share ideas, and the other teams can be excluded from seeing individual team discussions. So each team can have \"private\" discussions, yet you can see what they are discussing and even participate. I haven't used group \"Assignments\" (meaning submittals), but you will want to explore this on your own to better understand how it works. I also haven't used \"group\" quizzes. I don't know if this would work. Others here on Moodle.org might provide other approaches to your situation. I do want to warn you that Groups and Grouping are pretty powerful features in Moodle, perhaps an advanced topic, so make sure to practice with your bogus course and bogus students. Sometimes, you will have to log in as a specific student (not switching to a student as admin or teacher) to see how your Moodle really behaves. Many of Moodle's Activities and Resources provide group features. Here's a suggestion for your end-of-semester team presentations.  Use the Pecha Kucha method and limit each presentation to 6:40 minutes.  Use voice-on-PowerPoint, and have students upload their presentations.  Then create a discussion forum and require the other teams to view and comment on each teams presentation.  This is all done asynchronously, so give students a week or so for the final discussion.  I know I have overloaded you with this idea, but I have had great success with it.  I would even convert their voice-on-PowerPoint to 6:40-minute videos.",

Whoever has power in Moodle - tell them to revert this Advanced Forum back... they have just tripled my workload in grading to grade individually instead of the way it was.  When I realized this change - I was livid.  I think Moodle needs to TALK to teachers prior to making changes so drastic like this.  Taking away an appropriate grading feature like this makes the forum useless and pointless.  Discussions in the online world are VITAL to creating a dynamic and interactive course.  To force teachers to go into each post and blindly grade EACH submission with the drop down is INSANE.  I cannot see if that student posted another time, or what kind of responses.  I need them ALL in one place as they were in Moodle 1 - Now I am having to figure out - is there some other discussion forum I can use outside of Moodle that will help me see ONE student on ONE forum and ALL of their posts and be able to grade and comment.",

          "Text": "Hello, We offer online wine courses with lots of content in each course (scorms, videos, live webinars, etc) and, so far. We run each course 5 or 6 times a year and so far did not find a better solution than duplicate a course each time there is a new intake. I understand that using cohorts (ex: spring 2024 cohort, summer 2024 cohort...) might be a way to go for us. But I anticipate it to be extraordinarely complexe to manage each activity (synchronous and assynchronous ones... including live webinars whose recordings then gets posted for those who light have missed it live) in one course when you have different cohorts of students, all at a different step in the course. Would there be someone here very much used to these situations and could offer support? We'd be open to having someone come on board as a consultant... Thank you! Julien",

Also agree re 'red flags', especially around \"select your own completion date for a course\" - I think such ability would need to be severely restricted and certainly should not be up to the user to select their own completion date for a course!",

I will be delivering this course to five different groups and each group will start and finish their course at a slightly later time, so every group will be getting their materials on timed release at different times. Now that I've built Group 01's course, is there an efficient way for me to set up the courses for Groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 and migrate the entire content from 01 to 02, 03, 04 and 05?  That would only leave me with the need to enrol the students onto their course and change the release dates.

I build 70 location admins that are responsible for managing users at each location. Each admin can only see users built at thier location. Each franchise admin can assign training / view reports on all employees at the location The corporate administrator can run reports for all users at each location Please let me know if this is possible.",

I did this so that I could assign a manager to a number of employees who could monitor their team's progress (or lack thereof). This doesn't address the issue of being able to assign training at franchise level, but with a bit of tweaking in the roles (as you'll see when you go to set up a mentor/mentee relationship) you should be able to work something out. Hope this helps, Mark.",

In earlier versions of Moodle, you could add a manager as a non-editing teacher, and assign them to a group. I believe in older versions of Moodle if a non-editing teacher is assinged to a group in separate groups mode, they can't see the other groups. Alternatively, you could make each location a course and assign the local admin as a teacher on that course.",

There is https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_embedquestion but not sure if that would create a usable grade restriction for the content.

I was wondering if anyone had a clever way of using the grade book to show completion of the task. How about Any ideas? Thanks Vinny",

The side benefit could be that you can also provide stuff which is specific for each group without other group knowing about it.
