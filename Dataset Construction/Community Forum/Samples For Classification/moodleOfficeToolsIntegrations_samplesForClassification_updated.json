          "Title": "Microsoft Teams Full Integration with Moodle 4.4.5 – Missing local_msgraph Plugin?",
          "Text": "Hi all, I’m working on integrating Microsoft Teams meetings with Moodle 4.4.5+ and have successfully set up the following plugins: ✅ `mod_msteams` v1.5 – working for meeting creation/joining ✅ `local_o365` – installed and connected ✅ `auth_oidc` – enabled for potential Microsoft SSO ⚠️ `local_msgraph` – missing and appears to be deprecated from GitHub The core functionality I want is: Admins/teachers to create Teams meetings directly from Moodle Students to join meetings from Moodle without being prompted as guests Ideally: user sync, calendar sync, and team creation per course Right now, meetings work fine, but students are prompted to “Enter your name” when joining — meaning Teams sees them as guests, not authenticated users. I understand `local_msgraph` previously enabled Graph API features like calendar sync, user matching, and authenticated meeting join — but I can't find a version that supports Moodle 4.4+. Is there an updated version of `local_msgraph` for Moodle 4.4.5+? Or are there alternative ways to enable full Graph API support in newer Moodle versions? Any guidance, links, or insights would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance! Shameer P",

We have users in different countries in Europe and in Americas and for all of the users country is synced as it is in Entra ID. The exception are users from Romania who in Entra have Romania as country but in Moodle it syncs the country as Oman. I have manually changed country from Oman to Romania and then run the sync again and the sync changed it back to Oman. What can have caused this? Second question is how can i remove already synced fields if I am not interested in syncyng them anymore? I have synced telephone numbers but now i want to remove them from Moodle. I have set field_map_phone1 & field_map_phone2 to not mapped but phone numbers are still there. How can I remove them?",

We put the plugin collection of Microsoft 365 ( https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=72 ) onto our Moodle a couple of years ago. I've recently noticed Microsoft now have an LTI integration. Can you put both into one Moodle or will they interfere with each other? Or is the LTI supposed to replace the plugin collections? Basically I don't want to break something that is working as the authentication mechanism only to find the LTI version means all the current accounts suddenly won't work etc. I've read it all a couple of times, but I just can't work out whether I will be making more mess than I'm solving. Does anyone know if you can put both on at once or whether it should be one or the other and never both? Thank you",

There is an older, similar posting: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=422237 , but there were no answers to this and it was closed.

This instructor is finding items in her Sent folder in outlook and they're meeting requests for events in Moodle. They're also for last year, not an active course/semester. So my question: Is this expected (the meeting request from an instructor)? If so, do you have any ideas why it's running on closed courses? She's not accessing the courses to trigger anything.

We had hoped that we could make existing Moodle courses link to existing MS Teams. I can't seem to make it do that. If I choose to make one Moodle course sync it then creates an MS Team. We don't want the Moodle courses replicating in Teams -we do want the OneNote Notebook to link up to an existing Team. We populate Teams from our MIS system - as in Team creation and students going into and being withdrawn from. We don't do that in Moodle. Moodle is more a self enrolment and we just want the OneNote Notebook to link through from the Moodle course to a specific MS Team. Is that possible does anyone know? Thank you Heather",

The School Data Sync is becoming a better tool for creation of educational groups in Microsoft 365, and the microsoft 365 plugin now facilitates well the creation of teams based on cohorts/courses in Moodle. But it's becoming more and more interesting to have the source for groups (organisational and educational) in Microsoft 365 and let apps plugin to School Data Sync api. So is there anyone who has succeeded in creating cohorts based on the School Data Sync structure, so  the education groups in MS 365, Azure AD are primary source and then used to create also the groupstruture an enrollment of students and teachers into it within Moodle? And so the question, is it working, how well?",

          "Text": "Hello everybody, I'm actually considering an office 365 and teams integration with Moodle. We are using active directory for authenticating users.  My uderstanding is that users has to be logged via OpenID Connect to his Office365 account to be able to have a full integration with Office365 / Teams. I saw that there is a script to change the authenticating method of existing user matching his username in Azure but we are not quite ready to change the authentication methos of all our users to openid Connect. This is would be a too heavy change for our users. I understand that tere is a possibility for a user to link his actual moodle account with hos office365 one. But this I would want to avoid too because this is complex. So my question is what feature of Moodle teams integration do actually need the user to be logged via OpenID Connet or having his moodle account linked to his Office365 one? Reading all the documentation I could and a little bit of the plugin code,,  here is my present uderstanding : -  The moodle course synchronization to teams does not need users to be connected with his office365. It just needs the opeindc plugin to be configured and the link between Moodle and Azure to be established - The moodle tab inside teams. I'm not sure but here I thing that the user has to have an openIDC acount to use it. Or is it a simple iframe? - Notifications of moodle course to teams. This is done by the moodle bot (if i'm right) but I d'ont know if users have to have an openidc moodle account Do I forgot some features of moodle teams integration? I'm a little lost here and I can't test this integration by now. If someone could clarify for me which features do we lost if our users log in with manual auth. Thank you very much in advance. Best regards. Noel",

I have actually tried it both ways - updating a user and then tried the sync thing, and also not updating the user and trying the sync. The sync just doesn't happen. I've even tried a manual match on the sync page and that just tells me to log in with the Moodle user first which I can't because I've changed it. Basically I'm beginning to think this won't work unless the user goes to the Microsoft block and does half of it for themselves which is a bit over complex for my learners. Is it possible to do without the user going to the Microsoft block?",

          "Text": "The stable release of the Google Chrome web browser (build 80, scheduled for release on February 4, 2020) features a change in how cookies are handled. This will include two changes: Cookies without a '''SameSite''' attribute will be treated as SameSite=Lax. Cookies with '''SameSite=None''' must also specify '''Secure''', meaning they require a secure context . The changes are explained in https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained and https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html . Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration will be affected by this change, because the integration requires embedding Moodle pages in Teams. There is an open item in Moodle Tracker about this change in broader context at https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67175 , but the code change proposed in the tracker item didn't get integrated in time for the last minor Moodle upgrade before Chrome 80 release date. As a result, all sites using Moodle and Microsoft Teams integration feature are strongly suggested to apply the patches proposed in the tracker item so that users with Chrome 80 can keep using Moodle tabs in Teams after upgrade. Patches are provided for all Moodle versions that are supported for core feature and security issues, i.e. 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. Patches are only required before this is integrated into the next Moodle minor release of the Moodle versions, which is scheduled at March 9th, 2020. After the next Moodle minor release, the patch should be removed as it would be integration into core Moodle code.",

We were all previously set to 'en_us,' but now everyone seems to be automatically switched over to 'en.' When looking at the user field mapping for Office 365 integration, it does show that Moodle's language setting should map to the Office 365 language setting. In my case, I have verified that my language settings in Office 365 are set to 'English (United States),' but my Moodle language always reverts to 'en' instead. I've tried manually changing the setting back to 'en_us,' but the next time I log in, it goes back to 'en.' Is this a bug in either Moodle or the Office 365 integration? I'm not sure why the language setting does not seem to be respected. I suppose I could just delete the language mapping, but I'm curious why it's not working.",

You can then use an enrolment method of a \"Cohort Sync\" in the course, and et voila.

After investigating and going to Gear>Plugins>Local Plugins>Microsoft Office 365 Integration>Advanced>Manage User Connections. I noticed that User 2 is still showing a connections to email address kson@school.edu. I enabled the Match button on User 1 and User 2 clicked Unmatch for User 2.

We use Office 365/Azure Active Directory for identity management. Each school in our group has a separate tenant in Office 365/Azure AD. I'm trying to set up a testing environment in Azure AD to test out the O365 plugins on our staging environment. When I get to \"Step 3/3: Admin consent & additional information\" of the Office 365 plugin setup, I click the link, it takes me to the O365 signin page, I click to sign in but nothing happens - the signin page stays on 'pick an account' - if I click the account that I set up as admin of Azure (free trial account) the page either just reloads, saying that I am signed in. Anyone else had this issue? I'm currently using my personal old hotmail account for this - I guess it might be worth setting up a new trial O365 account. Any other thoughts? Cheers Chris",

I thought that, at its simplest, the concept was, for example: You have, for example, a Word document in your OneDrive or Google drive or Drop box, that you want to submit as your Assignment. Instead of downloading the file to your desktop, then reuploading it, if you Moodle site admin has set up the right plugins, you can just select the file directly in the file-picker (after logging in to the other system.) What acutally seems to happen is that, for example, a student can only pick a file from OneDrive if it is an institutional onedrive that you are providing to students. If the student is already using a personal onedrive account, they are out of luck. Have I got that right? It seems a bit disappointing if so.",

REQ 6: As above, if the admin has auto-approved this across a domain you shouldn't be able to manage this (or even see this?).

In that case, I'd expect the student to be given the option to log in to their existing account and link the OAuth details to it.

Does anyone know how teachers will be able to feedback on documents submitted by students? I assumed that the documents uploaded by students would be converted to PDF, to make them accessible to the plagiarism plugins (for example), and that they would sit nicely in the Moodle grading interface but it seems my assumption was incorrect. If the ability to give feedback easily, and in a manner that is familiar to Moodle users is not available, I am worried this project will be a lot less exciting and useful from a teacher's standpoint.

The login with OAuth, addition of files from Google Drive, etc. all worked well. When I added a file from Google Drive, I was expecting the file to then show in a 'Google Doc' frame inside Moodle, so that if I wanted to continue editing the document - then I could (e.g. similar to the work Nadav has done). Instead a simple link to the Google document is presented to the user. Is what I experienced the expected behaviour? In an assignment, if a student uses a Google Doc as their submitted document, the left-panel of the grading interface attempts to convert the document into a PDF/image to launch the Moodle PDF annotator. Is there a way to only show a Google Doc editor on the left-panel instead, so that the teacher has access to the full set of Google tools for commenting, and the power of Moodle rubrics (and other Moodle grading goodness) at the same time? That way, teachers have access to the best of both worlds. Cheers, Fred",

          "Text": "Hi, At our institution, users have different email addresses for their AD and Google accounts. Their main Moodle email address is the one stored in AD e.g. 12345678@student.school.edu and the Google email address is *nearly* the same, but not quite e.g. 12345678@google.school.edu. We store the Google email address in a custom Moodle profile field. I am able to set up a Google OAuth2 service successfully, but there is an issue when users attempt to login to Moodle using their Google account, as the email addresses don't match. To avoid this issue, I probably *could* change the main email addresses stored in Moodle to the Google ones, but I am concerned this will cause more issues than it solves (Moodle is integrated with more services than just Google). Also, it would affect the way Moodle accounts are created and maintained. Does anyone know if there is a way to avoid this issue? Perhaps by specifying an 'alternate email' address in the OAuth services. Cheers, Fred",

In this particular university: we use LDAP authentication for Moodle we setup the Office 365 integration, but did not change the authentication method we use the Microsoft Block on the dashboard to manually link to Office 365 My question is this:  what will happen to the established link if the username for the account changes in Active Directory? This can happen with a marriage/divorce, or an adoption, for example. The username and email address will change for authentication, but will we have to make sure the old account is un-linked in Moodle first? Otherwise, with a different username, Moodle may report that that the account is already linked. Related to that, is there a way to view all linked accounts in the Office 365 Integration local plugin?",

I seem to re-call someting for version 1.9 that did indeed work, but since Google now has Google Classroom, development on a Moodle SSO and greater integration seems to have lost interest. However, there is a plugin that does work ... I do use it. https://moodle.org/plugins/auth_googleoauth2 May not require much on the Moodle end *IF* your school has GAFE and syncs users in GAFE via LDAP but due how either/both handles user accounts, the time to do this 'conversion' would have been before the current school year started. The above plugin, for example, would allow students to login using Google credentials but that would create a new user in Moodle whose actual username is social_user_# and not (for example) john.jones (student login like in LDAP).   So this student (in the example) would actually have two accounts in Moodle ... as the year has begun and student accounts have been either manually assigned student role in courses or students have enrolled themselves.   Any work, assignment submissions, etc. would be associated with old account and not new. Google uses EMail addresses where as Moodle doesn't by default. It would be possible, however, to set install the auth plugin, then manipulate a CSV dump of student users on your system to change the fields that need to be changed ... same sort of thing done when entity has accounts already in Moodle and want to switch to LDAP. Comment: for schools that have 'gone google' it is the way to go IF continuing to use Moodle. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

          "Text": "Docs page says this: Credentials stored in Google Users can login to Moodle using the Google Apps stored credentials\nthrough OAuth2 sign in method. Remember that OpenID 2.0 authentication\nmethod is deprecated and it has been migrated to OAuth 2.0 (OpenID\nConnect). In this case user and mail fields must match in both\nplatforms. Moodle has a third party plugin that has been already\nconfigured to support Google Apps service. The auth plugin link provided to you earlier does use Google Oath2 for authentication. The entire package you found was supposedly supported up to version 2.5+ of Moodle from what I've read of it and included a GMail block.   Nice little feature but not really necessary ... one could create an HTML block OR use drop down menus for school district (GAFE) links. Don't think they'd mind ... here's a link to an ISD that has GAFE domain for the ISD. http://eagles.wisd.net/moodle2/ Note at the top the drop down menus which all point to the ISD Google Domain.  Login does use the auth plugin previously shared.   That doesn't really restrict attempts to login with gmail.com creditials but due the restriction of acceptable EMail domains, a student cannot use their private gmail.com account or hotmail.com or aol.com or other ... must use the Google ISD Domain account. Admin of Google domain gets a notification/request to allow user X with a gmail.com addy or other addy to join the Moodle.   Not a bad thing as this is also a way parents could gain access.   Admin user would have to setup a parent role and assign parent accounts that role so they could only monitor their childs work/courses, etc..  and not participate in activities . I also lurk on the Google Group for Google Classroom.    Been interesting to watch as teachers using GC ask if features could be added that Moodle has had for some time now. Anyway, advantage of using Google Auth for a Moodle means very few files need to be stored in Moodle .... even the videos could be stored in Google Drive and linked to with special permissions like, 'users from domain only'.   Storage is unlimited. Do give up controls over players of multimedia, but you won't miss them. Backups of courses are reduced greatly but they are not 100% restorable to other Moodle servers that are not part of the same ISD Google Domain. Besides that, no teacher or student needs to have a computer or device that has any commercial office suite or viewers installed.    Thus saving tons of $$$ $$'s.   All of what is done is done inside a browser and can be done on smartphones as well as tablets. For an example of  a site that's google but more open ... no ISD domain, go to any of the sandbox sites on: http://sos.tcea.org/ They all allow Google Oath 2 authentication.  If you want to see what it looks like as a teacher, let me know ... and have been known to grant users seeking temporary admin levels to see the backend ... as long as they promise NOT to break it! ;) So your pursuit of Google integration is worth the effort and time. It is, for all practical purposes, single sign on *but* NOT signout - which is the only thing I've found lacking.   That's why the sanboxes have a Google SignOut link in drop down menus.

          "Text": "Hello, We've been running the Office 365 integration plugins since last summer. At some point during an upgrade, new (or old accounts that never previously linked their accounts), non-admin users lost the ability to connect to Office 365. Users that had already linked their Moodle account to Office 365 can open their files on OneDrive for Business but new users don't even have an option to connect their account to Office 365 in the Microsoft block. If I log in as a new user and browse to https://ourserver/local/o365/ucp.php , no connection status shows up. If I browse to https://ourserver/local/o365/ucp.php?action=connecttoken as a new user, a permission error is generated. and the following error is logged: local_o365\\oauth2\\token::instance local_o365\\oauth2\\token::get_for_new_resource:174: Cannot retrieve a token for the base resource. Data: (null) If I browser to https://ourserver/local/o365/ucp.php?action=connecttoken as an existing user that previous linked to Office 365, I just get a screen asking to log into my Office 365 account. I'm not getting any errors when I run the health check in the Microsoft Office 365 Integration settings. This looks like a permissions issue but as far as I can tell, the users that previously linked their accounts to Office 365 have the same permissions as new users (and users that never linked their accounts) in Moodle. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks -Travis",

I actually have done this twice, the first time I thought i broke it by playing with permissions, so i did a fresh install, locally and on my server . Locally was a test and is fine, but on my server I install the plugins by git with the relavant branch. The site acknowledges and installs them then loading the next page \"moodle/admin/upgradesettings.php?\" errors. From here when I try to access my site I get a blank page. The page I seem to be able to load is moodle/login Strangely I can manually delete \"/moodle/auth/oidc\" and when I load the site it detects its missing and goes through the install bit again, then the upgradesettings page errors again. I also can't go anywhere else as i;m stuck in the install dependency loop I've check the server error logs but they are empty, I tried to add debugging to my config.php nothing comes out as the page doesnt seem to load.
