When I create the Wiki and use the same format for the title, the HTML is not only ignored but it is removed from the title.  It looks as if any other entry after the Wiki is also devoid of HTML.  Could it be possible that some enablement is needed in another section of the theme setting to allow HTML in the title for the Wiki?  If so where is it?",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I am a research assistant for a professor and I run my prof's Moodle, which he uses for one of his classes. Both of us think this application is awesome - it's very versatile and based on feedback from his students, many of his students think the same. We do, however, have a recurring problem with the wiki part of the Moodle. Students are required to add content to an overall course wiki, which helps students collaborate and brainstorm with each other and serves as a good central point for study material for the entire course. This is the second semester that we are using the Moodle for a class, and in both semesters once we reach the end of the semester the wiki fails to load. What I mean by fails to load is that the wiki does not load and it seems like the user session \"dies\" - once you click on the wiki link the browser will sit there loading forever. You cannot reload the Moodle in the same browser/same computer, you have to go to a different computer and login (either as that same user or a different one) to load the Moodle up again. I've noticed that after about 20 minutes, you can reload the Moodle page from a 'crashed' session, so I believe it has something to do with user sessions. Furthermore, by the end of the semester, the wiki gets pretty damn big - maybe it has something to do with this size? We were thinking of setting up two wikis for next term: one containing information for the first half of the course, and the other for the second half of the course. We are using Moodle 1.7.1 (I think). I'm not at my web server right now so I cannot give more details right this moment, but if anyone is willing to help I will gladly dig up logs and do anything else. I am running the Moodle off of a Power Mac G5 (that's our web server) running Apache , PHP and MySQL . One more thing. I went digging through the My SQL console and I see that the wiki content is all there (and there's a lot of it!). I know I can dump the contents of the wiki SQL tables out - is there a way I can use this to re-create the wiki? I just want the students to have access to the information they contributed, as the final exam is coming up and it would be good study material for them. Thanks a lot to anyone who can offer insight and help, Fil",

I beliebe that security issues need to be addressed here before we start building features. - markup and page behaviour - There will be a team working sole on the parsers (ewiki for backward compatibility, HTML(whateever editor) wiki, and Mediawikilike markup, and a new VerySimpleWikiFormat. We will use Unit tests to guide de parser development and be sure the things work as they are suposed to. We need you to send (as reply to this post for instance) wikipages with the page content (wiki format) and how is it suposed to be viewed ( XHTML ).

We use version 2.0.5 and appear to be experiencing some strange things going on in the wiki with groups.  After reading some of the posts here I can't find an exact replica of the problems we're experiencing but there's certainly some similarities although some date back to last year now. I have a tutor using the wiki with separate groups.  After thinking we'd lost content we noted that the tutor has to add himself to a group which then enables him to view each student groups wiki.  The alternative was for the tutor to create a new page which then enabled him to view each groups wiki contributions. We got through this... As students are now getting familiar with the wiki and developing they have requested to view each others groups in the wiki.  Of course the wiki settings were changed to visible and then the tutor is unable to view any wiki content again even though he is allocated to a group!  So we change the setting back to separate groups but I am trying to clarify if this is how the wiki should work and whether if a student contributed to their group wiki whilst the setting was visible and then the setting was changed back to separate would that content still exist. I am still carrying some testing but would apprecaite any feedback! Thanks Kate",

Let me explain: I've been using Moodle for about 6 weeks now with 3 of my classes. In a very small class of 5 students I've used 2 different wiki's successfully having 2 separate groups of 2 and 1 group of 1. Each student adds the definitions of words I listed in a text document. Each student saves their changes without renaming the file. However when I used this method with my larger class of 27 students I ran into problems and had to discontinue using. In this class I set-up 13 separate groups of 2 and 1 group of 1. Each took a text file of terms and had to split the list so that the 1st member of the group looks up the 1st half of the list and the 2nd group member looks up the last half. Students have been advised not to try to make changes at the same time and thus have been coordinating when to make changes. The 1st two groups to use it this week in the larger class could only see their changes when they went to history. Do I have to instruct them to save the page each time they change it using a name framed with brackets something like [student 1 version 1]? Currently, they only hit the save button after making their changes. My smaller group worked successfully without naming their changes.",

Are you using Moodle's group feature to set up your groups or are you assigning groups in your directions? Ie. Johnny and Sarah: Terms 1-12 Jessica and Tony: Terms 13-24 etc.? Backing up a bit, do you have the wiki set as a group wiki, separate groups or as a group wiki, no groups? A group wiki, separate groups would necessitate using Moodle's group feature; a group wiki, no groups would simply allow everyone in the course to edit the wiki. I'm also wondering whether you might be running into an upload limit issue. I've never tried to upload multiple docs to one page. I usually set up a new page for each of my groups. What about trying the option of copying and pasting changes directly into the wiki?",

There are php scripts and now a python library for use at command line, but they are not for newbies and would have to be tweaked hard to work with erfurtwiki in moodle. There are ways to play with httrack or wget, but getting such to work inside moodle could be painful. It might be easy enough to write a script to run the wikis tree inside moodle, saving the pages as HTML in a target directory (there are quite a few site rippers around). For moodle it would have to handle moodle file access but that should not be a major obstacle. So.... double ck modules db and if there is nothing there ck to see if this will be a feature of nwiki (if not suggest it-though I think export to odt makes most sense). In the interim you can a) print to PDF pg by pg , b) copy and paste from htmlarea pg by pg, c) dump XML and try to make sense of it or you can install moodle on your workstation and backup and restore wiki to new moodle in new course",

In the case of using [internal://image.png] for linking image in Wiki the IIS server sends the reply to browser's image request with status 302 in the header. Since there is no Locaton field in the header IE doesn't display the image as it wants to redirect. Other browsers apparently ignore the status 302 since there is no Location field and the image (which they actually expect from the server) is in the body of the reply. In the same scenario Apache sends the reply with status 200. The setting to change, in order to get things working is enable cgi.nph and set it to 1: from php.ini ; if cgi.nph is enabled it will force cgi to always sent Status: 200 with ; every request. cgi.nph = 1 Additional information: nph stands for non parsing headers. In our particular situation it would allow CGI to print Status: 200 header, which is normally skipped as it is not needed in most situations. Source link. With cgi.nph = 0, no status header is output unless you invoke header(), and then only if your status code isn't 200. With cgi.nph = 1, a status header is always output, defaulting to 200 if header() is not invoked. Source link. Should I create a bug report for this or there is nothing to change in Moodle code?",

There are no backwards links though and the lower pages are shown as orphans in the list. What are we doing wrong? Thanks Lindsay",

          "Text": "When I first started using Moodle years ago the forums were very helpful to me. Now that I consider myself somewhat skilled in some of the aspects of this powerful teaching tool, I like to share my knowledge whenever I can. If anyone is struggling (like I did) on how to create a wiki with groups, I hope this step by step tutorial helps. Create a Wiki with Groups (Subject: American War Battles) Create Groups 1. On the course page select “Groups” under “Administration”. 2. On the groups page click the “Create group” button. 3. Fill in the following info for this group: · Group name: civil · Group description: Civil War Group Project · Enrollment key: civil · Click the “Save changes” button. 4. On the group page, make sure the civil group is selected and click the “Add/remove users” button. 5. Add users to the civil group (move them from the right box to the left box by clicking the “Add” button). When finished, click the “Back to groups” button. 6. Repeat steps 2-5 to create three additional groups (vietnam, world1, world2). Make sure to make the appropriate changes to Group description, and Enrollment key. Note: Enrollment key is optional. 7. Return to course page. Create the Wiki Turn editing on. Click the drop-down menu for “Add an Activity”. Select “Wiki”. On the “Add a Wiki” page fill in the following: Name: American War Battles Summary: American War Battles Group Project Type: Groups Print Wiki name on every page: Yes (optional) HTML mode: HTML only Allow Binary Files: Yes Disable CamelCase linking: Yes Group Mode: Visible Groups Visible: Show Grade Category: Uncategorized Click the “Save and return to course” button. On the course page click on the Wiki link. This is where you need to stop for a moment and get yourself oriented. Most likely you are on the “Groups wiki for civil” page in the “American War Battles Wiki (since this was the first group you created). If so, you are ready to begin created your Civil War page Wiki. If you would prefer to start with another war, simply click the drop-down on the top-right of the page labeled “Other Wikis:” and choose the wiki group you want to start with. On the lower portion of the page you should see a bold header: Edit this page ‘American War Battles’. ( I chose to start with the civil group so I will begin editing for the Civil War). Type the following: [The Battle of Shiloh] [The Battle of Gettysburg] [The Battle of New Orleans] Click the “Save” button On the top-right of the page choose the world1 group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from World War I. On the top-right of the page choose the world2 group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from World War II. On the top-right of the page choose the vietnam group from the drop-down menu. Repeat steps 7-8 but replace the battles with battles from the Vietnam War. Now the Wiki is ready for students to work in! Student Access to Wiki Go to course page. Click on the “American War Battles” Wiki. Select your group from the top-right drop-down menu. Click the ? to the right of the battle you want to begin working on. Get to work! Note: Students will only be able to edit within their group. Because the Group Mode was set to “Visible Groups” by the teacher, students will be able to view every groups work but will only be able to edit their own.",

          "Text": "Hello, I am using the standard wiki in moodle 1.8.3 +. This bug has also been replicated in the Demo Moodle site (username \" teacher \", password \" demo \"). On older versions of moodle, e.g. moodle 1.8, it was possible to export a wiki as a zip file, which could be saved on a users hard disk. The zip file contained an HTML version of the wiki. This was a great feature since it allowed students to keep an off-line 'portfolio' of their work. This feature ( along with other features of the Wiki module ) now appears to be 'broken'. In order to export a wiki, the user clicks on the -- Choose Wiki Links -- pull-down menu, and selects 'Export pages'. Then teachers or admin can choose where to export the wiki: to a directory in the course files, or a Downloadable zip archive. Click here to see an image of this export page . Students can not choose, and are only able to download their wiki as a zip archive. However, on clicking on the [Export] button, the following appears at the top of the page (this is just a sample): \n```text\nPK ����LR70�������� ���group.htmleQ�n� ��W2SZ��V�cKQG0�F��2$rT�� g�D����;�c�M>j ...\n```\n Click here to see a screenshot of this page . Teachers can still successfully export wiki pages to the course Files diretory. I do hope that this can be fixed (see MDL-11816 ) since it appears the new wiki (NWiki) will not be a part of the standard Moodle release until the end of next year - version 2.0 . Or, should I take the plunge and install Nwiki now?",

I've done extensive searching in the forums here and in the Moodle issue tracker, but haven't been able to find anyone else describing the same problem (my apologies if I overlooked something). We are currently running Moodle 2.2.4 and the Wiki is set up to use Separate Groups. What are we are finding is that comments are not always posted in chronological order. It seems to be triggered by editing a comment, though this does not immediately re-order the comments. The edited comment is generally date-stamped correctly with the updated date and time, and is placed at the bottom of the comments. However, subsequent new comments are often inserted somewhere in the middle of the comment thread. To date, in testing, we have not been able to determine a pattern for the misplacements. All new and edited comments appear to be correctly date-stamped. Has anyone else experienced this problem? Thanks, Trevar",

I find that talking through intermediaries is problematic as I rarely get the whole story.... If you are the Moodle Admin and have yourself replicated the issue that is fine, otherwise I suggest you have the user follow my suggestions, to wit: create a new wiki from scratch and take a screenshot at every setting, saving the screen shots as png files, then zip up the files and attach to a post to the forum..... You'll notice that there is an image icon in the editor toolbar in this forumto embed images, but if there are multiple images it is best to avoid the impact to the forum and attach a zip..... There is nothing wrong with setting a wiki to \"student\", but once you do that you create individual wikis, and if you as teacher try to edit the wiki, you are not editing the student wiki, but your own..... But, since you said that IS NOT what the instructor did (you said the instructor edited the summary, not the actual wiki) that is not an issue. The other alternative would be to have your Moodle admin give someone access to your Moodle to look at what the situation is. I'd be happy to do that for you as would, I am sure, others...... I did note that you are at 1.9.2 and while I am not an advocate of beating oneself to have the latest release, it might not hurt to upgrade.",

On the other side of the coin, the student does not see the material the teacher added to the wiki unless the teacher edits that specific student's wiki.

          "Text": "Hi Gary.  I've done something similar except I kept each group's work private.  I don't think there's a way to assign pages to specific groups, so that's something to keep in mind and pushes you to many wikis, which you can assign to groups.  Here's my recommendation. Let's say you have 3 groups.  You can create a wiki, call it \"project\".  In the setup page choose \"groups\" type with \"visible groups\" mode.  By doing this, you're automatically making as many wikis as you have groups. When you save your setup, the HTML editor will open up so you can compose the main page.  If you look at the top left of the screen, you'll see that you are actually editing the home page for one specific group.  On the top right, there is a drop-down box labeled \"choose other wikis\" or something like that which allows you to create a main page for each of your groups, one by one.  Cutting and pasting works well if you want the main pages to be the same. Students will see only one link on their main course page - it will just say Project with a wiki icon.  When they click on it, it will open one group's wiki - I would hope the one they can write on, but I'm not sure about that because I've never done visible groups.  They should have a drop-down box that would allow them to navigate among the different wikis. One caution -  you want to make sure that you don't have duplicate page names.  For example, maybe you're thinking about setting up each group with a main page that links to pages called \"overview\" \"outline\" and \"resources\".  You need to individualize the page names to, say, \"overview-1\" for group 1, \"overview-2\" for group 2 and so on.  Otherwise, unexpected things happen when you try to navigate to your own  overview page - you could easily end up on some other group's.  Even with separate groups, duplicate page names were a problem for me, and I can only guess it would be worse with visible groups. Good luck with it.  I think wikis are a great collaboration tool.",

One other point in case this is not clear already:  When you set\nup wikis in groups mode, every group in your class will automatically\nhave the wiki with the same name.  So you need to give it a\ngeneric name.  For example: suppose your project is about flowers\nand you have groups working on petunias, sunflowers, and tulips. \nIf you set up a group wiki named Petunia, EVERY group will have a\npetunia wiki - even the tulip folks.  I would call the wiki\n\"flowers\" and use the specific flowers as group names.  Then, the\nchoose wiki drop-down list will be clear because it gives the wiki name\nand the group name: Petunias: flowers Tulips:flowers Sunflowers:flowers Not very elegant, but it is clear and I think it gives students the navigation tool you seem to want. Hope this is not too confusing. Russ",

I'm trying to create Wiki's for three Year 8 classes enrolled on a Year 8 ICT course; the three classes are enrolled on the course as three seperate groups. Now, whenever I create a Wiki it only ever assigns it to one group and doesn't give me any options that I can see to change this. This has the effect that only that group can access the Wiki's properly and get all the edited pages; the other two groups can open the Wiki's but they get a blank Wiki displayed instead. They can edit this and it saves the changed for themselves only. The Wiki's are set for \"Groups\" and \"Seperate Groups\". At the top of each one it says \"Groups Wiki for 8AL\" (8AL is the one group that everything gets set to, the others are 8CP and 8GH). Please can anyone offer any advice, as I am stumped!?

          "Text": "Hi, I am trying to find a solution for being able to grade Wiki entries and tie them to Gradebook. From an educational point of view, we are trying to motivate students to create a Wiki (because of the Wiki nature of allowing to build content over time) but also have the capability of grading what each student enters in the Wiki. The grade should be reflected in gradebook and be able to be aggregated as part of the overall grade. Is this possible? I have searched a few hours and have not found any information or plugin about this. I'm currently working with the standard Moodle eWiki installation but am open on upgrading to nWiki if that's the case. Would Moodle 2.0 have this functionality? Is it even worth considering building a plugin? I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction on finding a solution for this. Thanks.",

According to all the documentation, if I put two equal signs around the text that I want as a main heading, it should be done automatically. However, when I do that, it seems as if the wikiwords is getting the signal to turn it into \"preserve formatting\" ie. everything inside the equals signs appear in \"courier\" or some sort of typewriter-based font.

If I open a version for editing, and before I save, someone else saves a new copy, I won't be able to save mine. It will tell me to use the 'back' button on my browser and cut my changes out of the editor. Then I can open the new copy and reapply my changes. mike",

A. yes, but only with a valid excuse. 3)Q. Do parents and legal guardians retain their educational rights if the 18-year-old student still lives in their house? Who ultimately makes the final decisons? A. No, Even though the student may still live with the parents or legal guardians and is claimed as a dependent, parents or legal guardians only have access to records, but can no longer make any decisons for the students. 4)Q. If an 18-year-old student needs to be transported to the hospital for further medical treatment and is denying treatment, can that student make the final determination or should his/her parent be contacted? A. Since the student is now considered an adult, he/she has the right to make the decision to refuse treatment. 5)Q. Can parents or legal guardians have access to their child's student records even after the child turns 18 years of age or becomes an emancipated minor? A. As long as the parents or legal guardians claim the child as a dependent on their federal income taxes, they retain the right to access their child's student records.",

I want them weekly to submit their latest translations including the new lines for the next week, but also any revisions they make to their previous efforts. I want to be able to see any changes they make, and to be able to trace any versions back to their original efforts, in case I suspect plagiarism. I considered using the multiple file option of the assignment task, and allow them to resubmit any number of new files (versions), but it seems that a better option might be to use the wiki and have history to show me the versions. A couple of issues occur to me: Will I get notifications when they change things? And will this be too much, if they edit online? Is it possible to compare arbitrary versions of a page, like on mediawiki, or is it just two sequential versions? Can I take a snapshot on the due date, to be sure that assignments are properly characterized as on-time or late? Is this the best way to do all this?",

We use OU Wiki because the NanoGong HTMLArea works with it (Moodle 1.93 - you should test this first in other versions) allowing audio annotations which might be useful for translation feedback. The wiki allows comparisons between any two previous versions (not just sequential versions), and it also allows you to revert to any previous version. The only downside is that it doesn't have a mechanism for assessment/grading, but then perhaps taking a snapshot copy and submitting it in a proper assignment might be better as it would generate a gradebook entry. An alternative to the wiki might be a forum (which is gradable), but this would only be practical for shorter texts. Regards, Mike Smith, Brisbane",

          "Text": "Hi Ted, Does this mean that all your links in all blocks turn back to grey text after you have visited them? If that were the case your theming could be better! I'm not a Wiki expect but it sounds to me as if the css theme settings for links aren't doing you any favours. If the colour (color) setting for a:visited is the same as your ordinary text then they will certainly turn to plain text after the page is defined. If you are using Chrome browser then you can right-click (or CTRL-click) one such link and choose Inspect element to see what the settings are. You should also be able to change the colour temporarily here to see what effect that has. Similar things are available in in Firefox if you have Firebug installed as an add-on. To make permanent changes you need to edit the css. But if you do that in the theme's style.css you may affect all links. You can also work with the wiki's style.css in /mod/wiki/style.css. You should not open this file in a word processer such as Word, but in a text editor or a special css editor (a text editor will do fine). Start by saving a spare copy of this file (in case of disasters). Find the entry that begins: a.wiki_newentry and replace it with: .text_to_html a:link { color:purple !important; } a.wiki_newentry:link { color:deeppink !important; font-style: italic; } a.wiki_newentry:visited { color:turquoise !important; } Save the file and refresh the page. Do you get strange colours now? This should allow you to narrow down what you want. But note, you may also have to go into the Admin settings -->Theme settings and switch on Designer mode, otherwise you may not see the changes. This is one of many good reasons for not doing this on a live site, it will slow the site down. Hope this helps a bit. --John",

Most of the groups prepopulated OK, but some (who logged on for the first time yesterday) found that the prepopulation had not worked - they just got an empty page. Today I've been trying to add the template content into the pages they edited yesterday. (It's just a table containing heading and empty bullet points.) When I save it the document appears to have been cut in half and reordered. The \"Thank you for your contribution\" occurs half-way down the page with the top half of the document below it. The rest of the document comes above the \"Thank you..\" message. When I go to edit again, a number of tags have been added, similarly to Bug 3721 ( http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=3721 ), but I'm using version 1.5.3+ not 1.6 [Edit: just noticed that the break is happening just above the \"referring links\" text. Anything from then on, until halfway down the document is going to the bottom of the page. The split then happens just above a set of bullet points]",

I have found that it is best to create the first page of the wiki and include every students name in [] brackets so that when they click on the ? after their name a unique page is created in their name. If they add further pages to their page each page name should be unique, so perhaps get them to add their student number or initials to the page name. Hope this helps. Nigel",

It has been simplified to the point of banality I am afraid, and apart from basic functions, there does not seem a lot else available. At least we can add an image.",

We have a project\nwhere it is necessary that all people participating in the creation of\nmaterials can keep track of the codes and names given to documents that\nare created by other members of the team. This is necessary because we\nwant to build some sort of database with information about the\ndocuments and the documents must have a unique code number. People who\ncreate new documents must know whether the code already exists for a\nparticular document and assign a higher number if this is the case. Excel files work very well for this purpose but the great inconvenience\nis that one must download them and upload them again once they are\nmodified. Since there might be many people working at the same time\nthat might be a problem. I thought that creating a table on a Wiki\ncould be a good solution. And here is the reason for my question. Every\nonce in a while we would like to export the data in the table to be\nable to feed it into an excel file or perhaps some data base aplication\nbut I don't know whether this is possible with a Wiki. Does anybody know the answer to this question? If this is not possible,\ndoes anybody know of some possible solution to this problem? Thanks very much. Josep M.",

One of the sources of continuing confusion with respect to student wikis is that once the teacher creates the student wiki, and attempt to edit the wiki's first page will only impact the teacher's instance. Can't tell if this is what you are confronted with, but this is often the source of confusion. As Kate suggests, there is a method that is, well, a bit obscured for creating student wikis that allows for multiple pages, but it also might help you to see the difference.",

You do indeed set up an initial folder, with one or more of the pages that you would like the wiki to be pre-populated with in that folder. The files must be text format but they should have no file extension. You then upload them to wherever you need, create the wiki activity, select the specific file you want to start with. All pages created with the links in square brackets work because they point to files with identical names (e.g. [foo] will successfully create and link to a file called foo, but not one called foo.txt.

Is there a place I can go to read documentation on the wiki.  Back in 1.7 we had installed dfwiki and while there were certainly some usability and stability issues that concerned us, but there were many features I liked - I figured that with Moodle 2.0 the wiki that had been integrated would have been an improved version of the original dfwiki.  It appears to me that the current Moodle wiki (wiki2?) actually now has less functionality than the previous ewiki ... (i.e. can not support attachments).  It also does not seem to include the one feature that I know our users (students and faculty) really want - the ability to subscribe to a page - which dfwiki had.  Where can I go to read up on differences between wiki2 and ou wiki?  And is there a current roadmap for enhancements of wiki2?  I am still a bit confused about where Moodle is heading with regards to wikis (which I think are fundamental tools if you are trying to teach in a social constructive environment.) Many of our faculty go to external appliations (like pbworks) for their wikis now - we would prefer if they kept their learning activities inside our LMS as much as possible so our users have a more consistent experience.",

The problem is that I have already created a wiki and I cannot change the name for the first page that was given by default. What you suggest (again, if I have understood you correctly) wouldn't really help because, while it would perhaps solve the problem for this particular wiki, it could create worse problems in the future if I forget again to change the default name for the first page. The name I want to give to the first page in this particular wiki I'm working on is too specific to be the default name for all future pages. You see what I mean? The logical solution is to allow users to change the name of the first page after some content has already been introduced in the wiki. By the way, were you already in Barcelona?

I'm using Standard Moodle Wiki in vs 1.8+ 1) When I create my first Wiki page it takes sometimes 1-2 minutes for it to save. When it does save it then gets stuck on a blank page. I did notice that the webaddress has the words \"thank you\" added into it but it times out instead of continuing. It doesn't always do this and it does it regardless of how many users are on. 2) I have a course (German 1) which has two sections . So I have one moodle course with two groups. I would like to create a wiki that both groups can edit and see both groups pages. Since I have seperate groups enforced this doesn't seem possible. Is there a workaround (ie. temporarily changing my course settings to have no groups, then setting up the wiki to have groups visible, and then going back to the course settings and changing it back to forced groups. I'm guessing that won't work...but I thought I'd ask anyway) 3) Is there a way to get rid of the Wiki Discription box that appears on the first wiki page...it takes up unecessary screen realestate 4) Is there a way to change sub page titles and still preserve linking? Is the only way to change the pages to create a new page title and then copy all the content from the bad page title into the new one.",

So we don't support it... Yay! But... there are separate student wikis out there in Moodle 1.x wikis and even on nwiki setups. So... We cannot throw away that content or somebody will be mad at me.

          "Text": "My reasoning was that other modules also need this mode of operation - \"separate students\". Since 1.9 we have the groupings that were designed to extend the uses of groups and allow exactly this. It is still marked as experimental, but groupings will be enabled in all 2.0 (only groupmemebrsonly will be kept experimental). The workflow would be pretty simple, first go to group admin UI and let Moodle create new grouping with one group for each user in the course. Then create a new wiki and set the grouping there. Everybody will have his/her own wiki. This should be fairly easy for upgrades too. If we decide to implement separate student wikis the problems are: * a lot more access control + more complex db structure * we need new UI for user selection so that teachers may actually access the user wikis * we need to handle cases where users are enrolled/unenrolled in the middle of the course * we can not change the mode of wiki from user to group * other modules need to do the same in order to keep consistency The coding and maintenance costs would be higher, on the other hand we would have a feature that probably no other wiki has and probably very few ppl use in the real life, also the UI would be cluttered with extra controls and the wiki would not be consistent with the rest of our modules. I personally think we should stop abusing modules for something they are not designed for, wiki is by definition a collaboration tool, so we should imo encourage group work in wiki and just describe potential workaround in case somebody really wants to use them in a different way. If somebody needs a personal notepad with wiki syntax support, it could be a My Moodle(dashboard) block. We should also concentrate on grading of work done by students in wikis, this could be best done as new gradebook reports that other modules may share. Another example is the Forum module, it could be hacked to support one-on-one teacher-student communication, but it would be an ugly hack with many problems, so instead I created the new consultation module. News forum type is yet another example of problematic - there are so many differences in news and forum discussions that it will be significantly easier to create News module instead of trying to fix the current new forum subtype. We had a little disagreement with Martin over this issue, unfortunately I do not remember if I managed to persuade hit the last time we discussed this ;-)",

Students would have to take turns to download the spreadsheet, add their dadta, and re-upload. At least the wiki organises things with date and time stamps so that the latest version could be downloaded and editted. Another alternative would be to have a table in your wiki with the format you have in the spreadsheet and have all the students enter the data. When all the data has been enetered you upload the spreadsheet with the formulas and they copy and paste the data from the wiki into it. Cheers, Sally Mack",

The copying worked, but without an instance in a course, they're no use. I'm going to try fooling with mdl_course and mdl_course_section. I'll delete them in the copy installation and import or copy them from the production installation. I'm not convinced it will work, but it's worth a quick try. Can't hurt.

I mean, they are the only ones to produce information for the wiki in order to deliver it to their students (and sometimes to other teachers). And it is true that creating and editing information in a wiki is much easier than doing it on a set of linked webpages (and using the 1.9 fab html editor ;) ). The problem here is about reusing the wiki. They are not able to import it and they are not able to backup/restore because they do not have permission to create new user records. Did anyone experience the same problem? Do you have any solution, workarounds...? Thank you in advance. Cheers, susana",

We have recently upgrded from 1.8 to 1.9 and installed nwiki When working with a wiki imported from 1.8 constructed in the html editor the tags caused a lot of problems adding a tag to one page overwrote the other pages. However when working with a nwiki or dfwiki created from scratch no problems. Not sure why but it would have saved a lot of time sorting out how the tagging system works if we realised it earlier! Other points it took a while to figure out It was also not clear that tags work across multiple wikis that there is a difference between the tag block (which \"administers\" tags) and the wiki-tags block (which links to them). hope this helps someone else.",

We think Moodle would be probably best platform to our environment and we are starting our own development work. We are very interested about Wiki and its development like dfWiki. In dfwiki there seems to be some very interested features. Wikiexport is important feature to our project. So, I am asking your help in following questions: 1) When exporting Wikipages, is it possible to include ALL links in Wiki? We have tested Moodle's current Erfurt Wiki, and there is a problem because you can only import \"downward\" links. Referring links (breadcrumb trails) are not included when we have tested wikiexport. So if you look your exported wikipages in browser, you can go from one wikipage to another, but you cannot come back via wiki's links. 2) It would be useful to export wikis to pdf- or rtf. Is anyone developing solutions to this? 3) When exporting wikipages to html/pdf/rtf, it would be also useful to replace Wiki's CamelLetters with normal text. Is there solutions to this? TIA ,",

I've been doing this on a test Moodle installation and I'm not particulary worried about  keeping  Wiki activities intact -- I have a backup of these and I figure that I can always restore from this backup (correct assumption?). I have read all the entries in the Wiki Forum going back to Aug 29th but I'm still flummoxed. I followed Ludo's instructions but alas the result was that courses that had contained a wiki opened up without showing the Outline. So, following some else's advice I deleted the wiki module from the Admin : modules section. This removed the wiki tables from the database . Subsequently I managed to retreive the site but now adding the Wiki module back in has no effect (the module does not appear on the Admin : Modules) because the tables have disappeared. Soooo, is there a piece of SQL code somewhere that could be run to create the New Wiki tables in the MySQL database? If not, is there a description of the table fields so that I can create it manually? Any other ideas? TA MarkPea",

The advantage could(?) be that it would be a solution valid for all parts of moodle. I would dream of something like \".. and here you see my source code §§format(sourcecode) int i[100]; ..... §§format \" or something similar. (There would be a textfilter with syntaxhighlighting, references to a glossar0 (what is 'int'), all this configurable, there could be other options for special area in chemics, physics, .....) only an idea - don't know if this could be possible.

Two problems remained, however: formatting - pages created with the wysiwyg viewer lost the carraige returns between lines so all the text runs together. (~1000 pages - yikes!)

I'm trying to explain it to teachers and while I think I understand it, I'm at a complete loss to *explain* it and all the bits I've seen use very unfamiliar vocabulary to me (I think it's a special wiki dialect, I'm not sure). 4. other modules - every once in a while I see mention of other modules in development and yet when i go into the Moodle modules site it's all the same old stuff.

You might contact him and see if he has a new version 1.4 coming out and could he send you an early draft. To explain wiki to other teachers and students, I simply call it a \"group document\". In other words, a group of people can individually edit and re-edit the content. 4. New modules (such as Form, blog , etc.) under development are mostly available in the nightly build of Moodle version 1.5dev. If you have a separate server which you reserve exclusively for experimenting, then you can go to Downloads and try this one. It is unstable, which is why they are not available for general download yet. A few modules which have been under development for a while and are fairly stable (Book, Hotpot, Questionnaire) are available for special download under Add-on Modules in the Download section. By the way, I have another question about wikis. If two or more people edit a wiki at the same time and then save it about the same time, what happens? Which version gets saved?",

So now comes the real challenge. We have a new wiki we can improve and maintain, so we can make it a great learning tool. So, the current todolist: - NWiki migration. New wiki does not migrate from nwiki at this moment. I'm commited to make this migration happen before summer. My best option is to publish a pre-update migration script that will convert NWiki tables into old wiki tables, so the standard New Wiki can migrate it without changing its code.",

If you're having problems with template images you should check they are in the template zip file (assuming the template is a zip file, if it's just xml you are using a version of the plugin that doesn't support images in templates).",

After some boasting and showing off, our moodle people are interested, and I've hacked the ewiki code a little to add a 'view as slideshow' button to ewiki pages, which takes the wikitext and converts it to an s5 slideshow. I'd really like to get this off the ground, it provides a simple way for groups of students to collaborate on creating presentations, gets away from needing powerpoint, and pushes users towards focusing on content rather than form. HOWEVER, the default wysiwyg editor is not really appropriate for this, as it is slanted towards html rather than wikitext, and our moodle people rightly think wikitext is something of a barrier to non-tech people using it. I'd like to use wikiwyg , but I'm a bit lost as to where is the right place to cause the appropriate javascript to be loaded. Can anyone give me some hints? Or set me right as to why this is a bad idea?",

It appeared from our testing that setting up a wiki to have separate groups kept everyone except group members out of the wiki (including the teacher). In other moodle assignments an instructor is not limited by enabling grouping - which is why you do not put a teacher in a group! 2. Visible groups enabled all others to see other groups' wikis, but also appeared to give them editing priviledges in another groups' wiki. What are the plans for updating dfwiki group features to enable a teacher to be able to view and edit all wikis and to keep the visible group features supported so that if visible groups are used, students can view (but not edit) another group's wiki. We like the group features that were supported in efurt wiki in moodle and would like to see the same type of support (including individual student wikis as has been mentioned in other forum posts). Again - I love dfwiki but the support of groups at this point does not seem to be fully implemented yet - do you have a timeline on any of this - or is there a new version that has been released that addresses some of these issues? We are using dfwiki in our courses now and can not just upload a new version each time it comes out without testing first ....",

It's not immediately obvious that, when a Wiki is set up on a course that has groups enabled (either Separate Groups or Visible Groups), the default setting of the Wiki also inherits the groups setting, and once students have created content under the Groups setting, converting to a true individual Wiki makes all of that content unavailable.

Otherwise, you can, of course, simply depend on the ability of a wiki to revert to an earlier version to protect existing content.

Your response also needs to take heed of what you are trying to accomplish in the course - not just the learning outcomes, but the processes involved along the way. That should determine what tools you use. I am currently developing alternate responses to these questions and finding a set of solutions, not just one size fits all. Essentially, Moodle does one job, another tool does another job that Moodle is not designed to do. Seems to be working so far... but we shall see.

          "Text": "Perhaps that might be possible David, but for the moment, I am not sure the other tools I am using are not all available outside Australia. Most are, but some are local products - you may have equivalents though. One of the tools is called DayMap, from a Melbourne company. Essentialy an SMS, it also has a small LMS module that is more or less a credible wiki and not a lot else. I am not sure that they will be selling internationally yet but I imagine it won't be long. I am developing a solution that meets our local laws regarding storage of data, as well as promoting positive learning outcomes. It also uses MS-Sharepoint which we are turning into a local repository - so not a lot is going to be stored externally. Moodle is, hopefully, going to be used for resources and online testing, If they can get Mahara up in that environment, then that will be for eportfolio and social networking with other common open source tools for more specific purposes - Wordpress for one. All locally stored and we can develop them to suit our need. One snag, Sharepoint 2013 is not being co-operative right now so the whole strategy could be brought undone by it. As I said, we shall see.",

If so is there a way to break up sections and pages within a wiki so you could print off specific areas instead of the whole document? I understand what wikis are but my experience is limited, Any help would be appreciated. cheers, Mike. PS. if there is a better mod for this I'd love to hear it.",

I suggest you come at this from a different angle - instead of thinking I want to use a Wiki, now where can I use it IN MY CLASS?  Why not think of a series of scenarios where you think students could collaborate OUTSIDE the classroom and set a task that requires that to be done, say, before the next lesson . It's 'horses for courses'. Also to lessen the impact of your problem - you could always try creating GROUPS within the Wiki.",

The problem I am encountering concerns the way videos are linked to student wikis. My videos are created on Mac as a \".mov\" file, and Moodle is automatically embedding them in the body of the wiki. This creates some problems loading each wiki and presents problems if I want to place multiple videos on one wiki. It also messes up student formatting of their wiki. I have tried a number of solutions to try to prevent video embedding, but none (at the code level and otherwise) has yet to work. Anybody have any ideas about how I can still used \".mov\" files but prevent automatic embedding? Thanks, Kevin",

You can use QT Player Pro to Export your .mov to mp4, don't recompress, just \"pass through\" the video and audio. iTunes can also convert .mov to m4v (same as mp4), use Advanced>Create iPod or iPhone version. But the data rate will be about 1500 kbps. Change the m4v extension to mp4, Moodle seems to like it better. Then the href link to the mp4 will not embed the movie, it will just provide the link to the movie in same window or a new window. At least that's how it works on our install of Moodle. Of course everything needs to be tested on Mac Safari and Firefor, and Win XP/Vista IE and Firefox , but I think it will work.",

On the bar at the bottom is the word \"done\". I can edit the set up of the wiki, I can create a new wiki in this course, and wikis in other courses seem to be working fine.

It would be good if all materials and discussions related to a particular case were kept together. So far I have tried the following: set up a discussion but the discussion activity doesn't allow uploads of PowerPoint or PDF files set up a wiki for each case. I'm concerned about the number of wikis that would need to be created. Students can upload files and start a new discussion but these are all related to that particular case. Tried to have a multiple page wiki but it didn't allow files to be attached to a particular page/case. Any suiggestions??",

I have successfully used Wikis on sevral occasions, but today something odd happened. Firstly, I gave a Wiki the title ' Q - Input/Output devices' where Q represented the word 'question'.  When I saved the Wiki and went to edit mode  it said 'Q - Input' ONLY as the title! Secondly I tried \"Q - Input & Output devices' and it did the same. Thirdly, when I typed in my first text it would not allow me to put [ or ] around numbers as I needed to - they did not appear, instead a '?' appeared in plase of them. Fourthly, when I completed my first entry, and wanted to retrun to edit it - to remonve the [ and ] which did not look right, there was no text to edit, the box was empty.

We have developed a resource (using a wiki 1.8) for staff as part of our work e-learning program (this is for a Cancer Services department of a public hospital in Australia). The wiki now comprises over 320 pages. Evaluation from staff is indicating they want to use the search bar to access information as it is too cumbersome trying to find information by tracking searching through the wiki. However the 'Search Wiki bar is not specific enough and hence not user friendly. We are in the process of going to 1.9 with Nwiki and so thought this would be a great time to fix this problem. Are there specific design strategies we need to employ to enable the search bar to work? (I am comparing the search userfriendliness of Wikipedia to ours and there is a stark difference).

Install went without a problem but when I created a new wiki in my course I found that I had a correct list of students but when I selected a student and clicked the continue button it all went back to the student whose name was originally selected as the default. Actually I've just checked again and it does go to the new student's wiki but there is no indication of whose wiki you are looking at as the dropdown list reverts to showing the first student's name. Is this a bug or have I set something up incorrectly? Thanks, John",

As long as the behaviour matches or betters the ewiki version, then you will be onto a winner!

I then replaced the Nwiki code with nwiki2.0_Moodle18rev2008031201 and restarted Moodle.

          "Title": "Wrong words (eg. \"++\") are matched as CamelCase in spite of \"Disable CamelCase Linking\"",
          "Text": "Hi, Moodlers. I've been in the face of two strange phenomenons under using ewiki on Moodle1.8. Under checking \"Disable CamelCase Linking\" on ewiki (Moodle1.8, 1.7, ...), Camel case words (eg. UsingMoodle, WikiModule...) does not match as Camel case. On the other hand, unexpected words (eg. a++, a]+[, ...) will match as Camel case. For example: for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++)    : HTML editor ->  for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i ++ ? )  : View page (ewiki) '++' is linked for new page. I don't expect! Another phenomenons is as following. For example: a[] is an array. a[1]   : HTML editor -> a 1 ? : View page(ewiki) : I want to avoid. a![1]  : HTML editor ->  a[1]  : View page (ewiki) : That's right. a[]   : HTML editor ->  a ? : View page(ewiki) : Oh? a![]   : HTML editor -> a![]   : View page (ewiki) : Oh No! a![ ]  : HTML editor -> a[ ]   : View page(ewiki): huum...O, OK? (How to correct these problems?) The cause of these problems is on following code, in mod/wiki/ewiki/ewiki.php if ($moodle_disable_camel_case) {<br /><font color=\"#006600\">        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"\");<br /></font>    }  else {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"a-z_??$\\337-\\377\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"A-Z0-9\\300-\\336\");<br />    } EWIKI_CHARS_L/U are used for detecting Camel case words. These constants are used on regular-expression as follows, \"wiki_link_regex\" => \"\\007 [!~]?( \\#? \\[\" style=\"border-right:0px;border-top:0px;vertical-align:middle;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;\" alt=\"[^<>\\[\" src=\"http://moodle.org/filter/tex/pix.php/25443382e01c0fa744dccb716a12d8bc.gif\" /> \\n]+\\] | \\^[-\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]{3,} | \\b([\\w]{3,}：)*([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]+){2,}\\#?[\\w\\d]* | ([a-z]{2,9}://|mailto：)[^\\s \\[\\] \\'\\\"\\)\\,<]+ | \\w[-_.+\\w]+@(\\w[-_\\w]+[.])+\\w{2,}   ) \\007x\", and $value = preg_replace_callback(\"/((\\w+：)?([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"] +){2,}[\\w\\d]*)/\", \"ewiki_link_regex_callback\", $value); Most important part is ([\".EWIKI_CHARS_U.\"]+[\".EWIKI_CHARS_L.\"]+){2,} . If we set that the \"Disable CamelCase Linking\" is On, both of EWIKI_CHARS_L and EWIKI_CHARS_U become null (blank?). Therefore, regular expression will become to ([]+[]+){2,} . [*] (eg. [A-Za-z0-9]) is meta symbol that means character class. [*] is not allowed that the inner part of brankets is null. /[]+[]+/ is interpreted as [ ]+[ ] + , then the render of ewiki view page will misinterpret non-Camel case word as Camel case word in spite of Disable CamelCase is On. /[]+[]+/ means that a word matched with the pattern consists of a character ']' or '+' or '['. I propose a modification for this problem. if ($moodle_disable_camel_case) {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"<font color=\"#ff0000\">\\t</font>\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"<font color=\"#ff0000\">\\r</font>\");<br />    }  else {<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_L\", \"a-z_??$\\337-\\377\");<br />        define(\"EWIKI_CHARS_U\", \"A-Z0-9\\300-\\336\");<br />    } This patch means that CamelCase word consists of 'Carriage return' and 'Tab code', for example : '\\r\\t', '\\r\\t\\r\\r\\t'. This experssion is safe since these strings shall not appear in plain text generally. I'm using ewiki in Japanese. After applying this modification I have no trouble under setting 'Disable CamelCase Linking'  On. If you are also in face of this problem, let's try this patch.",

I have slash arguments disabled in my site, since my hosting provider has it disabled in apache and does not allow overrides. (EDIT: I've just seen a bug in wiki has been corrected in the last days. I'll check that). Second problem deals with international chars. I have no trouble with putting wiki links with accented chars in moodle 1.4.x in my local server , but the exported wiki does not work in moodle 1.5.x in my hosting provider. I think it deals with url charset, but I can't find a way to make moodle unaccent every wiki link (i.e. I know wikipages with accented names will be inaccesible, but other users of this wiki could forget about it).",

The old wiki generated lots of superfluous code after each edit, especially if using tables. From my experience OU wiki works best in firefox . Firefox and IE work in different ways when you use tables and the full screen editor. If you are going to write user guides you will probably need an IE version and a firefox version. In general, we are happy with our move to the OU wiki. Hope this helps. Nigel",

Would an individual wiki work well for a individual portfolio, where an each assignment gets an individual wiki page? Could I use a group wiki for the entire class where they each post there assignment under the corresponding assignment title?  What I am thinking is that this group wiki would have several main pages, such as Applicant Cover Letter, Obituary Assignment, Internal Memo etc... Then each student would get an individual subpage.  So then there would be say 25 sub pages for each main page.  I want to organize the student work in a way that I can access easily in the future. Any advice would be much appreciated.",

Apart from being attached to a different course, I would like each wiki to be identical - same name, same default first page, same description.

I thought manually editing the MySQL database might be the easiest way (generating some nice big SQL file which would create everything in one go) but it seems more complex that I'd hoped and could easily mess up the whole thing (in addition to tables mdl_wiki, mdl_wiki_entries, mdl_wiki pages and mdl_course_modules, there's a fairly obscure entry in the modinfo field in mdl_course and probably some others I haven't tracked down). I've also had a look at hacking the php code to create the wikis, but tracing through the code is proving tough (it starts with course/modedit.php?add=wiki&... but my php isn't up to tracing it all through). I'm using Moodle 1.9.2 with ewiki. Any ideas? Thanks,",

If it's just a simple idea of how it works then you could put a simple guide (or make a simple webpage) for topic 0, the heading, in your course. If it's an institution front page then there's usually space to modify the greeting (right-hand side on the standard Moodle).

          "Text": "Hi everyone! We are using the wiki activity extensively in our site due to its collaboration and version history features. However, the page editing experience is a pain for many of our users, especially ones who are experienced with HTML and would like to add more advanced styling to their pages. We have noticed that wiki pages in HTML format don't accept various HTML elements added using the editor (from HTML/code view button). For example, we would like to use the HTML tags <details> and <summary> to embed collapsible blocks of long text or pictures (\"accordion\")  that can be easily shown/hidden in order not to impair the page appearance. See: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp These tags work perfectly in standard moodle pages and other activities. They are also displayed properly in the HTML editor when editing the wiki page. However, as soon as the wiki page is saved, the tags are completely stripped. Plain text and simple tags like <p> and <div> remain. It looks like the wiki doesn't recognize the tags at all, or there is a list of allowed elements where they are not included. The same behavior can be reproduced with Atto, TinyMCE and Plain text area editors. All our wikis use HTML format. Can anyone please advise how I can enable the use of these tags, or at least hint at what functionality may be responsible for stripping them from wiki pages? We use Moodle version 3.10.1+ (Build: 20210226) with the default Boost theme.",

The situation is that they had created a single page wiki at the end of September. sometime in the last week, it appeared that all of their changes were gone and it had reverted back to the original entry. After looking around, I found that there were now 2 pages in the wiki and that the \"first page\", the one you go to when you click the Wiki link from the course, was now this newly created page. The same thing happened to all three of the wikis that they had in the course. Can anyone figure out what may have caused that? We did just recenly upgrade from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3, but I think this happened before the upgrade. It's possible the problem could have been caused by that though. I've fixed the \"problem\" for now by copying the content from page 1 to the new first page. It works, but we essentially lose the earlier history. I want to be able to tell the user why this happened and what they should do to avoid this happening in the future.",

So my comment here is that I think teachers should have always access, because we are an educational setting not a wiki community. I use Swiki as a stand-alone program until this eWiki is fully integrated in Moodle. I like this integrated eWiki now very much: And I prefer the HTML-editor above the Wiki-simple-text-philosophy.. But this Swiki option (coomentbox) was very nice: the only thing a user had to do was place a commentbox symbol on the page, place his email in a \"send me an email\"\" -field and lock the page. (Students can take ownership of a page when they put a lock on a individual page of a group-wiki.) A visitor sees then the locked page with the commentbox. As soon as the visitor types his comment and presses the comment-button under that box, the owner gets an email.There is no database behind it, pages are stored in XML -format. Another option I did like was the possibility for a webuser with editor rights to create a webform instead of the standard fill-in screen. The page-storing mechanism makes collecting the content of the forms to difficult, no database.. Swiki is a standalone server that runs on Mac,  Unix, Windows.. We used it for several years at our secondary schools to collect experience with collab-work on a website. Works great. http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki The program Swiki is written in the Smalltalk version Squeak. The pioneer Alan Kay is one of the founders. Their children project eToys is inspiring http://www.squeakland.org/ During meetings they play the game to install and run this Swiki-server in less then ... seconds.",

You should be able to see any student wiki though, so I'll try and recreate your problem. I can see any student wiki. I'll double check with groups and fix it as necessary. Other activities , such as assignments and exercises work the same way - the student enters them and the teacher looks at them. So just to be clear, the way it should work: - teachers can see any created wiki, - students can see their own wikis, teacher wikis, and group wikis (according to group rules) - teachers can edit teacher and group wikis, - students can edit their own wikis, and group wikis according to group wikis. We can modify it so that teachers could edit student wikis, but I'd appreciate some feedback on that to make sure that makes sense.

That would mean that teachers could see and edit Their own wikis Any student group wikis - Teacher's student groups Teacher's Assistants student groups, along with Teacher Assistant's wikis for that activity and assignment Any individual student wiki which is part of an activity (assignment) or side work in a group. I also believe that personal wikis which no one but the students, teachers, admins maintain, view and edit should be allowed, I think however they should be limited to a certain number determined by the main administrator. If it is only a few students, teachers and admins and the institution has a large amount of diskspace they may not care how many personal wikis a student may have. Of couse an administrator should have the ability to see all public wikis including any public Teacher wikis. There is one other thing however, I feel instructors/teachers and administrators should be able to have group wiks and individual wikis that administrators cannot view. Again the question of how many may come up. In essence, I feel that there should be much fexibility in how the wikis permissions should be determined with a policy sent out to other admins and to teachers as to what they are for a particular instrution so it is clear just how public their thoughts and work will be and if private personal wikis will be allowed. Probably needs a Control Panel which addresses the following, STATUS TARGETS Creation Status Main Admin, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?) Type Status Individual, Groups Number Status (of each type for....) Main Admins, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?). View Status Private, Public, Group, [Parents (?) - To check if student is doing assigned work - Eventually]. Edit Status Main Admins, Admins, Teachers, Teaching Assistants, Students, Others (?), I am beginning to understand wiki's more and more and see what great potential they have in a classroom. The ability to post notes as Ger has indicated and have an e-mail sent out to all involved in a group or individual wiki to notify them or the individual of a change or some type of intervention sounds really cool. If this cold be added it would be nice. Swiki however appears to need a special server to accomplish that function. Time to step back and let the MASTERS work. WP1",

          "Text": "Alright, I double-checked the code and tested it. I was wrong; I implemented it such that teachers can edit any wiki - even student ones. So, if you're not getting that functionality, something's wrong. Now, there is an issue with changing the group mode on an existing wiki. I haven't figured out how to resolve this yet. If you were to change a group wiki, that was previously set to 'no groups' to 'separate' or 'visible', and it already had wiki entries, you would orphan that pages that were originally created. The effect you would get is that the teacher would always see the orphaned wiki first when they looked at the wiki. The teacher can see the real wikis by selecting them from the drop-down list. If the teacher edits the orphaned one, only they will see it. No students from the course would ever see the orphaned one. So, to summarize: A teacher can edit and view all wikis, regardless of type and group setting. Group wikis can be edited by anyone in the group. If the group setting is 'no groups', then anyone in the course can edit them. Group wikis can be viewed by anyone, for 'no groups' or 'visible groups', or by members of the groups for 'separate groups'. Teacher wikis can be edited by teachers only. If you are not seeing this functionality, make sure you have the latest code from CVS , and try a fresh wiki. Don't change the group setting once you have entered wiki entries. Let me know any anomalies you see. mike",

Now, some other questions: Do we want to handle this differently for groups? Should the teacher be a member of the student's group to create the student's wiki? Should teacher editing privileges affect this? Should a teacher from a different group be able to view a student's wiki if groups is set to 'separate'? My thoughts: Editing teachers and administrators can view/change/create entries for any wiki. Non-editing teachers not assigned to a specific group can view/change/create entries for any wiki. Non-editing teachers assigned to a specific group can view/change/create entries for any wiki in their group, and view wikis in other groups for 'visible' groups. Make sense? mike",

The group mode in Wikis often requires teachers to enroll themselves into groups to view individual student contributions within those groups. This setting is meant to simulate the group environment from the teacher's perspective but can indeed lead to misunderstandings. You might want to check the settings under Group Settings in the course admin panel. There may be an option to view all groups at once without needing to join them. If not, perhaps enabling \"Separate groups\" and granting teacher permissions for group-wide visibility could be a workaround. Hope this helps! Let me know if you find a different solution! BR 🤔",

I then got the idea to try and export some pages from a MediaWiki site (WikiBooks) to be precise, and try and import them into NWiki ... Well you can all guess ... it did not work, however, after closer inspection of the MediaWiki XML file I realized that it should be possible to write a parser that would take the MediaWiki XML tags and replace them with NWiki replacements. There are many tags in the NWiki XML file that are LMS dependent, these are what makes NWiki more suited to our educational needs. I am guessing that if there is no corresponding tag in the MediaWiki file then they can be simply inserted with defaults. I am imagining a stand alone parser at the moment but I'm sure that this could be written into the php scripts that read in the XML files and it could be implemented transparently in NWiki. What do the rest of you wiki'ers think? Linds",

The words \"Change to one of the following editors\" tells the new user to change to an editor other than the default editor.  As this works now, the choice cannot be changed once selected. In order to avoid this confusion, the teacher should be able to make the default editor the only choice. In the meantime, the option \"Change to one of the following editors\" could be moved down below the buttons: save, preview, cancel. That way new users will be more likely to use the default editor and not lock themselves into one of the other options. Again thanks for all that you are doing, John",

May be what is needed is a check box in the wiki settings next to \"preferred editor\" which says \"Force preferred editor\"?

In order to test a new separate group course, I am logging in under multiple user accounts, my teacher (I am also admin) account plus several fictional student accounts -- made-up names with real yet unique email accounts. I have tried this using both single instances of IE , and multiple instances, each with unique account. One of my wiki resources is set up so the teacher can read/write, students read-only. I find it a great place to create teacher \"space\" for structured resources. When I log in as a fictional student, I can read wiki entrys. If I attempt to edit them as the fictional student, the edit tab disappears, as expected, I think. When I log out as the fictional student, and log in as me again, the teacher, I cannot edit any wiki entries that were tested by the fictional student -- the student is shown as still logged in for the pages in question. However, I am showed as logged in for other wiki pages untouched by the student. I am using Internet Explorer on the same computer for each session. I closed all instances of IE, and tried again. No luck, the student is still logged in. I repeated the experiment with Mozilla Firebird and was successful -- the student was not logged in. However, when I again repeated the test with IE, the student was still logged in. I restarted my computer, suspecting something \"sticky\" with IE, but restarting did not solve the problem, the student was still logged in. Does anyone know what is happening here? How do I clear the \"sticky\" student login? -Ron",

They show up fine at first. Student saves the page and all seems fine. However, when they return a day or so later to their page, their picture is no longer there. Students are blaming each other for deleting their pictures. Using a Wiki has been a complete disaster as the reason for using a wiki is to foster collaboration. Instead, I have several angry students and parents. After viewing the Wiki forum it seems this is an issue that is affecting more than just me. Has there been any resolution to this issue? I really want to continue using Wikis, but if there is no resolution, my principal wants them to be removed from the class. I have looked at two or three Moodle trackers, but they all seem to get closed since the issue cannot be reproduced. I'm not sure if I should open up a new one or not. Fingers crossed someone out there can let me know what I can do to resolve this. Thanks!!",

We're running 2.6.2 and we've had this problem for over a year: the reports last fall that cmoore added were us, too. It's difficult to reproduce because it happens when there is a class all working in a wiki at the same time, but not when only one or two people are editing a wiki. This means it _looks_ fine when one or two staff test it out, but when students are getting close to deadlines they have their image links break and freak out and come banging on our doors. We're considering testing out OU Wiki as an alternative but we would far rather use the regular wiki if this bug can be chased down. Here's a roundup of the relevant links for the infamous draftfile.php bug . https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=170655 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=185839 And this Moodle Tracker issue: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-26782 ...on which you'll see us reporting the problem last fall around this time. We don't think it was ever fixed in 2.4. We're certainly still having it. John, please do open up a new tracker issue, I'll both add to it and encourage others who have had the problem to speak up. It's a leading source of frustration about our install right now, and we have faculty with a long history of wiki projects under our previous CMS and we need to find them a solution that behaves at deadline time.

You will see the blue question mark next to your desired link. When you click on that blue question mark in the view mode, it will take you to the page for that link. Once you name the linked page, your link is established. Hope this makes sense. Mike",

To do this you should 'display a directory'. Here's how: Go to the Files area of your course (in Administration block) Create a new directory. It doesn't matter what it's called, but you might want to call it 'excel documents' click on it to enter the directory. Now you want to browse and upload the Excel document that you want to make available. Having done this, return to the main course outline and make sure that Editing is switched on. Find the weekly or topic block that you want to present the file in and choose Add a resource -> Display a directory Give the resource a name, perhaps, 'Excel files' and in the summary say what kind of spreadsheets are going here. Pull down Display a directory and choose the 'Excel documents' directory. Click Save changes. Now the contents of this directory will be displayed to your students when they click the resource link.",

          "Text": "A group of people at our college use a wiki to collect names and addresses of people who have signed up for part-time courses. I originally created an empty table structure that they could use and each course (a page on the wiki) uses this table structure which they fill in as somebody enrols. From time to time my original template for the table is not big enough so they use the wiki toolbar tool to add new rows. OK so far - I'm guessing there are a whole load of people who already think I am mad. Tables in wikis? Is he asking for trouble? Well as it happens it has been working fine up to a day or two ago. Suddenly one of the people with editing rights discovered that she could no longer add rows. The toolbar icons still exist (in the expanded view) but when she clicked on the icon to add a new row absolutely nothing happened. I couldn't understand that but put it down to something odd with her PC. Today the others in the group are reporting the same problem and now it also affects me. One bright person suggested that everything was OK until the updates and she was referring to automated Windows updates. I thiink she is right because those updates have just been applied to my PC as well. The questions are 'What update could have caused this?' and 'Is there anything I can do about it?' A long shot I know but I hope somebody can help Dave",

The same course with less wiki files could be saved and restored correctly. Making a second copy with all the mentioned  settings set to 64 M, the wiki files were gone again, so I had the upload the wiki files seperately as well. Is this a bug? Cheers, Monica",

I can see changes using history for one single page which is not enough because my students would like to have a \"1 click - see all changes\" solution. Then I discovered \"recent changes\" somewhere close to the sitemap of the wiki but the recent changes can be shown only once, after that they aren't recent anymore and don't show again. What I am looking for is kind of a remaining Changes-History I thought about writing another Wiki page called \"Changes\" but then I would have to write everything twice - once on the wiki site and once on the changes site. I also thought about making a database for this (enter \"What\" did you change and \"Where\" => date + nickname are added automatically via db) but this seems to be too oversized for such a simple task? I also read the wiki changes don't appear in recent activities - is there a fix for that already? Thanks for any help!",

          "Text": "I am trying to implement MOODLE as a support and training site for my company. On the support side, I had been using PHPBB as a place to enter and store hints and fixes we have found for the various systems problems. So right now I have a phpbb forum for the phone system, and entry for the voice mail system, software, and so on. what I would like is a place were anyone can record the steps the have found that will fix a particular problem and have a place were others can add to the solution if they find something else that works. I tried using the BOOK module, but that is too restrictive in that others don't seem to be able to add to it. I have played with the wiki module thinking that would allow others to add to the entry but it looks like i would need separate wikis for each system, that is on for the phones, one for the voice mail, one for the hardware and so on. Am I correct in my thinking here? I have also looked at using the forum module in the same manner as I did with the PHPBB installation. Here again I seemed to run into issues in that when created on the main page, it seems only the admin is able to edit or add to the forum. Perhaps my problem is in my understanding of how MOODLE works and in how I have it set up. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Regards Rick",

          "Text": "I would say one wiki would be enough, with separate pages for each issue. The front page should be the 'forum overview', with links to each issue. The problem with wiki as forum is that it is mainly a tool for collaborative writing, so it allows several users to write on the same pages. This is also one of the problems you see e.g. on wikipedia, where several authors write on each page, and thus creates a kind of discussion that can be very unstructured, commenting in between each other etc. Forums do not allow other users to change what another user has written. So for a wiki to be successful as forum tool, there has to be some guidelines easy enough for all to understand, and some moderators to ensure compliance. If you create separate wikis - this might make it easier for the users to handle different issues - you should add links on the pages between the wikis so it is easy to navigate between them. But it is important to design the forums/wikis with the users, to see how it best suits them Forums in moodle can be used the same way as forums in phpBB, depends on the settings. It looks like your forum is restricted who can reply - but this is not your fault, the standard news forum is normally for one way communication. Moodle forums have two settings that control who is allowed to post and reply, check them out. And one great thing with Moodle forums is that your users can subscribe to them to receive postings with email or via RSS feeds. So forum or wiki? I think it depends on how much effort you want to use to structure the communication. The forum tool is more focused, the wiki is more open. But to me it sounds like you would be best helped with the forum. /Ian",

          "Text": "Hi all, We have discovered that the edit protection in the wiki of Moodle 2 is not watertight. Normally, if a (student) user tries to edit a (collaborative) wiki page that is being edited by another user, they would see an error message: \" Someone is editing this page right now. Try to edit it in a few minutes. \" However, experience has shown that nonetheless it is sometime possible for users to edit a wiki page simultaneously with as a result that the data of the user who saves first is overwritten by the one who saves last. Our tests have so far identified three possible scenarios: An interruption in the Internet connection. If a user, for instance using an unstable wireless connection, suffers a short interruption in his connection, another user can open the editing mode of the same page, provided they click at the right moment. A mix up with open browser windows or tabs If a user leaves the wiki in editing mode in one browser tab then opens another with which he/she also surfs to the wiki and then gets the view mode, another user can open editing mode for the same page even though the first user still has it open. Using the back button If a user edits and saves a wiki page, the pages becomes editable by another user, but the first user can use the back button of his/her browser to reurn to editing mode without encountering the error message. We wonder if anyone else has noticed these and other cases where the edit protection fails? And also if anyone has suggestions for improvements, apart from instructions to students for proper use of the tool. We use Moodle 2.3.2+ Rgrds, Paul.",

Students then access their Wiki and use the icons in the HTML editor to either add links to files in the 'File Bank', or embed images that have been saved in the 'File Bank'.

However, having trialled it in 'individual student' mode, where it worked fine, going live with a class has proved a problem: The teacher can select an individual student's wiki by choosing their name from the drop-down menu on the right of the page. If the teacher then tries to use the index-block on the left to navigate through an individual student's pages that have been created (e.g. 'Page 1' which links to 'Page 2', and then 'Page 3' etc...), when the page refreshes it brings up a blank 'edit' pane as if the page doesn't exist... The only way to navigate thourgh the various pages a student has made is to use the 'back' arrow of the web browser... which isn't ideal. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Has anyone found a work-around? Any help would be gratefully appreciated... jayne",

'/pre' 'tags' for a paragraph of \npreformatted text, that still allowed to use WikiWords and \nsimple markup\n\n# with 'code' ... '/code' instead you would really see text as \nyou typed it, with square brackets and other escapes not \ngarbaging your text\n```\n could someone of the developer team please think about activating the 'code' handling as in ewiki? ps. the 'pre' implementation seems to have a bug in the moodle wiki. empty lines in the 'pre' block make the interpreter close the block before reaching the '/pre' tag.",

For example any table settings imported simply collapse. Using tables to create charts and simple forms is an excellent way of sharing student attainment amongst tutors and the student concerned. Formatting text also will not work so we cannot use bold or colour distinguish between student and tutor entries which is so helpful to us.

          "Text": "If a wiki page is created or edited with the HTML editor, it appears that all subsequent edits must use the editor as well.  At least on my moodle/wiki combination, if I attempt to edit a page with the simple text form (no HTML editor...my preferred method), all the html markup is inserted and the simple wiki structure is indiscernible.  Is this \"just the way it is\", or can one reclaim\" simple text markup that respects the ewiki syntax? A second question: if a wiki page is created using ewiki markup (i.e. no HTML editor so no html markup in the first place), it seems to ignore blank lines when there should be paragraph breaks.  I can force a line break with \"%%%\", or insert a <_p>, but of course this defeats the purpose of wiki markup.  Have I missed a setting? I'm using the wiki module that ships standard with Moodle 1.4.2+(2004083129). If it matters, I have the TeX, algebra, wiki autolinking,and glossary auto-linking filters on. Thanks for any insight.

Then I can start grading/evaluating. The comment tab was available to me in 1.9. As for moodle 2.2.x, I still have access to the Comment tab.

          "Title": "Standard version 2 Wiki doesn't seem to understand groups and groupings",
          "Text": "Hello, Is anyone else having problems with groups and the standard Wiki module in Moodle version 2? I'd like to be able to set up a wiki on a version 2 moodle system in which, \"there is one wiki per group, students can change the wiki of their own group only, and they can view the wikis for all groups.\" When using moodle 1.9 and the standard issue Wiki I often set up a wiki so that small groups of students could collaboratively edit their own group wiki, and view the wikis of other groups (see the yellow cell in the table below). This does not seem to be possible in version 2. Either students are able to edit both their own group's and other groups' wikis, OR they can only edit their own group's wiki and not even see other groups' wikis. The settings for a 1.9 wiki to make this group collaboration possible were (also see yellow cell in the table below): Type: groups Group mode: visible Grouping : Grouping-A (this setting not necessary, but useful in courses with lots of groups) The Wiki settings in version 2 are different. These settings; Wiki mode: Collaborative Group mode: Visible groups Grouping: Grouping-A result in a wiki in which students can edit their own group's wiki AND those of other groups. I was hoping that these settings would emulate the 1.9 version described above (and in the yellow cell below). These settings: Wiki mode: Individual Group mode: Visible groups Grouping: Grouping-A Available for group members only: checked result in a wiki in which students cannot edit a group wiki (to be expected) but can edit their own wiki. They can also see the wikis of other students. The strange thing about these settings is that even with the \"Available for group members only\" checked, students can see a menu of all students and groups in the course, not just the groups in the relevant grouping. I have tried other combinations of settings, but none get the result I want and used to be able to get in 1.9. i.e. \"one wiki per group. Students can change the wiki of their own group only. They can view the wikis for all groups\". This is a bug, surely? For your reference, here are the Wiki types available in 1.9, copied from the help files of a 1.9 system: Wiki types (in 1.9) There are three wiki types: Teacher, Groups, Student. In addition, like any activity, the wiki has the Moodle group modes: \"No Groups\" \"Separate Groups\" and \"Visible Groups\". This leads to the following matrix of nine possibilities: No Groups Separate Groups Visible Groups Teacher There is only one wiki which only the teacher can edit. Students can view the contents. There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wiki of their group only. There is one wiki for every group which just the teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis for all groups. Groups There is only one wiki. The teacher and all students can view and edit this wiki. There is one wiki per group. Students can view and edit the wiki of their own group only. There is one wiki per group. Students can change the wiki of their own group only. They can view the wikis for all groups. Student Every student has their own wiki which only they and their teacher can view and edit. Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of other students in their group. Every student has their own wiki, which only they and their teacher can edit. Students can view the wikis of all other students in the course. Unless the group mode has been forced by the course settings, it can be set with the groups icons on the course home page after the wiki has been created. So how can this group wiki feature be emulated in version 2? _______________________ Environment: Moodle 2.0.2+ (Build: 20110413) php 5.3.3 MySQL 5.5.9",

          "Text": "Well, the wiki module is listed as possibly being replaced by OU Wiki at some point in the future in the Roadmap . The question I would ask here is why was this not done in the transition from v1.9 to v2.0? I know I am being unfair, the amount of excellent work done by a lot of people, (none by me), should not be so casually dismissed, but as a fan of wikis, I am actually appalled that the Moodle wiki is so.. so... dowdy.  It was poor in v1.9, and did not fare any better in v 2.0. I understand there was a substantial debate around a new wiki for v2 but really, the end result is disappointing. I know the perception has always been that MoodleWikis should be course specific, but I would ask why? This may have been desireable a few years ago, but is it still so? For me, Moodle wikis can work at two levels, one is site wide, much the same as Forums and Docs do here, (but with a single login). The other is at a course level. Most educational institutions, and businesses for that matter, could well use a tool with that kind of flexibility. Wikis can be specific, and general, and as a place for all sorts of information. We are now well used to using Wikipedia as a source, but what if a school, for example, had the opportunity to develop a school wide Moodlewiki? What if a class of students had the ability to develop a single wiki for an ancient History class, and their teacher could use that as a fully annotated and referenced demonstration of student learning. Better still, could the teacher then not allow continued development of that wiki at a site level?  Over time, it could become an incredibly valuable resource for a school. Is this not what wikis should be? Rather than OU Wiki, why not use MediaWiki as Moodle Docs does? Why not fully integrate MediaWiki as a part of Moodle.

Flexibility should not always mean just within Moodle. The other important thing too is that there needs to be a single login policy. That does not happen in Moodle.org, and I do not understand why? It is likely if there is a embedding of mediaWiki into Moodle that the login process will be taken care of. Currently, in our circumstance, our students log into their computers/network, then to the internet, then to Moodle, then to a wiki (if we had one). Now, to me that is just putting barriers in place. (I know that there is a couple of programs that will change this, like iChain, but that assumes all network techs have a high skill set and that is not always the case.)",

It appears to be connected with setting groups and also the 'forced format', say HTML format, at the same time. MDL-35653 applies I believe. You could just try UNTICKING the 'force format' box and see if things return to normal, HOWEVER, I wouldn't alter ANY settings on ANY module that already contained student work without first using Backup in the Course Administration and backing-up everthing - especially WITH all the User data settings ticked (on some sites this requires an administrator!). I offer this caution because on some modules changing settings may reset the activity data. So this is either good practice or total paranoia! Regards, John",

Students can view the wikis of all other students in the course. \" which is what I would like to do. I tried this second method, creating it as an individual wiki with a group mode of Visible Groups, However, the student is able to create content once on his first page, and then has no more ability to edit his wiki.  The edit tab isn't there at the top.  He sees a drop-down menu for the other students' wikis, and can see them, but he has no edit ability on his own wiki.  The teacher can edit all wikis. Any advice or insight one can provide would be most appreciated. Thanks Joe Amatrucola Moodle 2.6.1+ (Build: 20140131)",

It works with the HTML editor instead of wiki markup and is designed to be user-friendly and simple.) I have done an updated release of the OU wiki today. Read information and get it here Not many new features but it does include bugfixes, including the one Glenys posted about in this forum! If you had problems trying to install an older version, please give this one a go. For those wondering what's happening in future, there are no major changes on the horizon. We are planning to add a couple more administrative features - including the ability to revert to a previous version without having to copy/paste it - in the autumn. Also just a note - I am posting this to the wiki forum because it seemed most appropriate, but I don't actually read the wiki forum (obviously, we have our own wiki, so most of it is not relevant). I'll try to remember to keep an eye on this post for the next few days. However, if you need to report a bug, please contact me directly by email/Moodle private message. --sam",

I had a student inserting an image (that resided on the web) with an address that ended Laughing_buddha_statue_Buddha_gift_m.jpg The image showed up correctly in the editor but only the alternate text showed up in the preview. I tried shortening the name and then it showed up correctly. However, when I experimented to find out the length at which it failed I found I could add letters and numbers until it was way past its original length. Further experimenting suggested length was not the issue but it was to do with the use of upper-case. In particular, if the name began with an upper-case letter it could not move away from upper-case and then back again; if the letter began with lower-case there was no such restriction. So, these are OK... ABcde.jpg ABCDE.jpg abcde.jpg",

I do understand this is not the spirit of WIKI, however I wonder if it could be used to achieve such feature and if not, which other tool could be used to achieve mentioned mechanism. To recap: a student edits an article and \"submit it for review\" Teacher reviews article and approves it then publishes it. new student or the same one provides a modification of the same article and submits his version of the article for review. Teacher reviews modified article and approves it therefore publishes it. etc...",

I have created the Wiki, but for each article read I would like the student to have a Summary page, a Inquiries page and a Contributors page. I am relatively unfamiliar with the terminology used in wikis so I do not know if I need to create the article name as a category and then create the Summary, Inquiries, and Contributors pages as sub-categories (pages). I had tried simply using the brackets; however, then other articles link to that page. I would appreciate any advice on how to accomplish what I am trying to do with the wikis which could be outlined as: Class Reading Wiki Article #1 Summary Inquiries Contributors Article #2 Summary Inquiries Contributors Article #3 etc, etc. The reason I want the inquiries on separate pages is that I want the students to be able to edit at the same time. In other words a student could be working on the summary page while another is simultaneously working on the inquiries. If this could be accomplished by keeping it all on one page (as it appears in Moodle Docs - which I realize is a different type of wiki) that would be fine. Thanks again for any advise as I try to incorporate this in to my class. Peace.",

My attempts at using [Article1Summary | Summary] have not worked since even after the page is created I see the wiki new page question mark. When I click on it, then it takes me to the page but it is clear to me that something is not working. I am wondering if on a page, could I have sections ? Where students could modify one section at a time. I want the student doing the summary and the student doing the questions to be able to be writing and working at the same time without interfering with one another.

C) I will have to check out nwiki and see if that might not be the best solution since the likelihood of having students simultaneously edit the same page can be reduced. I was trying to avoid some user frustration of being told that someone else had edited the page since them. But I do like the idea of being able to provide a style guide or template. D) Since I am working with high school students in the U.S., disciplined though they may be, it is probably best not to rely too much on a naming convention although that may be my best long term solution.

You should warn your students to be careful that they don't accidentally remove existing text with each successive edit. I always recommended that students keep a backup in a Word document just in case! An alternative is the Dialogue module with allows private Teacher to Student communication however students can just keep adding entries, which are all date/time stamped. I hope this helps Cheers Teresa",
