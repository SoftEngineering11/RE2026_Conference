          "Text": "We are running Moodle v3.0. We use Moodle for High school from September-June.  During that time period there are four quarters, and within each quarter categories of assignments (Tests, Quizzes, Homework, Labs, Participation).  So, each of these quarters and grading categories show up as folders in the user report. By this time of year and beyond, the user report can get VERY LONG.  For example, just to print the data for one user it is 3.5 pages long. Right now we are in the third quarter.  There are many inquiries regarding third quarter progress.  It would be useful if I could close the other categories as folders on the user report screen, so that all I see is the total for the first and second marking periods and not all of the assignments.  This feature currently exists in the grader report where I can collapse or expand categories. I would want this functionality because when parents come in for conferences I don't want to print the details of every single assignment when I run the user report for all participants.  All we need printed is the totals from the prior quarters and a snapshot of the current quarter. I was wondering if there is anyone else that would benefit from this functionality, perhaps in a future release of Moodle?",

One thing that could help is if you group your assignments to different quarters. This way, if the students are all placed in a \"Quarter 3\" group, then only the assignments grouped to Quarter 3 will appear in the user report from the students' point of view (students would still see the categories for the other quarters, but not the assignments). Note- as a teacher or parent (via the mentee block), you'll still see all assignments in the user report...",

I also tested importing all the activites and then deleting them after the import, but the gradebook is still cluttered with dozens of items.

So, if student A is targeted to achieve 80% in the final assessment, each Moodle quiz should not be marked as complete unless they have achieved a minimum of 80% in that quiz; whilst student B is targeted at 50%, so they have a lower threshold to pass by. I have a Profile Field with each student's target grade. Yet, the Restrict Access option that offers Profile Fields does not treat them as numerical in any way. The actual quiz Pass grade is a simple value (50, for example) and I cannot direct this at all to a grade in the gradebook or a field in their profile. Can anyone think of a way to stop students moving on unless they have achieved a grade tailored to their own, personal target?",

I have looked in grade\\edit\\tree\\index.php and think the table is generated by the code on line 306 (i think?). I dont understand much about PHP but I am getting there. How can I stop the inserted style tag from making the table width auto and get it to take on my theme css of 100% width?",

Teachers have set up categories and items, but now, after they input the grades and try to save them, they get the following error: Forbidden You don't have permission to access /grade/report/grader/index.php on this server . Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. Just to be sure, I completely reinstalled Moodle, but the same problem appeared. I also turned on debugging, but after I click on the Update button, the aforementioned error page is displayed. Then I recreated the same essential course environment (separate groups, with groups and groupings) with a couple of students. This was done on another installation (same Moodle version) under the same site; here I didn't have any problems when saving the grades. So, I backed up the course from the first installation and restored it on the second one. I got the same error. Finally I restored the course on my local installation (same Moodle version), and here I was able to save the grades. Thanks in advance for any help, it will be truly appreciated. Guillermo",

Sometimes, for example, an incorrect e-mail address will get entered in your e-mail settings, which messes everything up. 2) You may need to configure the php.ini file on your database . If #1 doesn't work, let me know and I can try to walk you through those steps. Peter",

It was generated by an SQL report that dumped out the data. It contains a user ID, course ID, assignment ID, grade and a date (and probably some misc fields). I am trying to figure out if there is a way to import all of these gradebook items at once. I can preprocess the CSV file to make sure the user ID, course ID etc are valid in the moodle system. I am aware of, but not familiar with, moodle's built-in import functionality but I was under the impression that tool only imports the grades from one particular course. That would mean I have to break out my CSV file into 300 smaller CSV files (one for each of 300 courses) and run them one at a time. This doesn't seem reasonable so I'm looking for alternatives. If I have to I could probably write a perl script to parse the main CSV file and insert the appropriate records into the database directly using SQL. Anybody done this before or have any ideas how I can get the data into moodle in the most straightforward way? -- Andy",

I've done some testing, and the problem seems to be in grade\\lib.php in the following block of code: // add extra grade tables if necessary $ sql = 'SELECT 1,1 FROM '.$CFG->prefix.'grade_events LIMIT 1'; if (!get_records_sql($sql)) { if ($CFG->dbtype=='postgres7') { require_once('db/postgres7.php'); } elseif($CFG->dbtype == ' mysql ') { require_once('db/mysql.php'); } else { print \"DB not supported.<br />\"; } create_tables (); The problem appears to be that the create_tables call (which is drawn from db/mysql.php ) is executed every time you go to the Gradebook, instead of just the first time if the tables grade_events and grade_events_grades don't already exist.  This results in Moodle attempting to create tables which already exist, causing an error message for each table.  If I drop those two tables from the database and go to the Gradebook again I get 'Success' in green twice instead, but then the next time I go to it I get 'Error' in red again.  I suspect that the line $sql = 'SELECT 1,1 FROM '.$CFG->prefix.'grade_events LIMIT 1'; is faulty in some way. Having created the tables I could bodge the code so that create_tables isn't called again, but that seems rather inelegant.  I'd prefer the code to work properly, if possible, and if there is a correction necessary to the code then it would help others in the future if it could be made available from the Moodle download s section in place of this one. Any advice would be welcome!",

          "Text": "Moodle core gradebook 1.95 or greater Try out this scenario (my actual scenario in a production course site): course category set to SWM three subcategories (for organizational purposes) set to SWM gradebook set to aggregate non-empty grades only 1st category has four grade items marked (so far) representing 85 points. 2nd category has three items marked (so far) representing 50 points 3rd category has one item marked (so far) for 90 points. The wrong total will be computed (real, percentage or letter) because... If you leave the category totals at the default (probably 100) SWM takes the percentage correct for three categories valued at 100 and averages them, disregarding the \"imputed weights\" of 85, 50, and 90. Potential Solutions? Sum of grades, except it doesn't exclude ungraded items, just takes the sum of grades and is therefore unusable for translating to accurate percentage or letter Change the  category total to represent the actual total points of the grades marked so far, except you have to mark all your grades and change the total in one fell-swoop, probably making the gradebook unavailable to students in the mean time and you have to do all this each time you mark another grade. You'd also need to go through and exclude (and possibly later re-include) all those students who haven't turned in their grades yet. Alternatively to #2, you could use Weighted Mean of Grades agg method for the course category and assign weights to each subcategory that represent the proportioned weights of the marked items to-date.  Like #2, all three weight proportions would slide every time a new grade is marked. Disallow the display of the course grade until all grades have been marked and implement #2 or #3 above to accurately weight the subcategories' contributions to the final grade.  A disappointing workaround at best.  Hope you have your version patched because most instances still hide the whole gradebook when the course total is hidden.  Some will also claim that \"Hide totals if they contain hidden items\" might get us some leverage here, but it really won't ( IMO ). A calculation for the final total?  Give this a try but don't waste too much time on it before you remove it from the list of candidates -- you'd be revising the calculation as often as #2 and #3 above. Moodle's help documentaiton's explanation for SWM is: \"The difference from Weighted mean is that weight is calculated as Maximum grade - Minimum grade for each item. 100 point assignment has weight 100, 10 point assignment has weight 10. A1 70/100, A2 20/80, A3 10/10, category max 100:\" As we have now found out, this of course does not actually hold true for nested SWM categories because we're locked into that category total that needs to move around. A REAL SOLUTION: The rawgrademax field in each grade_grades record for category or course itemtypes should be maintained as the \"maximum earnable\".  This would be the total of grademax for child items marked so far if aggregate only non-empty grades is on, and the total grademax for ALL child items if aggregate only non-empty items is turned off.  Consequently the finalgrade field in grade_grades would then represent the accurate number of points EARNED.  With this valuable information available the grade reports can calculate accurate category and course totals under all circumstances. I've put in a tracker item MDL-24554 .  Please vote, vote early and vote often (under assumed names).",

          "Text": "The issue that most people fail to see in SWM is that when the subcategories get normalized to their base 100 grade, the weights are already pre-baked in, so an average is all you need in order to calculate the correct grade. If you'd like the final grade for each subcategory to reflect the actual number of points earned, use SUM for those subcategories. This way the category total for each subcategory will be less confusing, mathematically. This will not work with excluded items. Another (simpler) way to deal with this and have all the benefits of SWM is to make each subcategory total to be the sum of the max grades for each item. This way the grades will not normalize and the weights more apparent. Do this when creating the item, to avoid confusion from students. But leaving the total as 100 still results in a course total that would be the same grade based on their 3 different subcategory totals as their normalized values are the same. Here's the math: 65/85 = 0.764705882352941 = 0.764705882352941 X 85W = 65pts 38.23529411764705/50 = 0.764705882352941 = 0.764705882352941 X 50W = 38.23529411764705pts 68.82352941176469/90 = 0.764705882352941 = 0.764705882352941 X 90W = 68.82352941176469pts If you SWM them to a course total, you get: (65 + 38.23529411764705 + 68.82352941176469) / 225 = 0.764705882352941 X 100 = 76.4705882352941 If you normalize those to 100, you get: 76.4705882352941 + 76.4705882352941 + 76.4705882352941 / 300 = 0.764705882352941 X 100 = 76.4705882352941 76.4705882352941 = 76.4705882352941 Whew.",

My personal concern is SWM discrepancy for  students who are excused/excluded on the assignment vs those who get points. E.g. - Get a category with SWM with 2 items. Do not use Aggregate only non-empty grades. - Exclude one student from item 1, and give 100% to second one. The first student will get less points for category total. - I believe it is unfair to him.

          "Text": "I'm looking for seom clarification on this. I have 5 categories, each weighted a bit differently (5% here, 10% there) but they add up to 100%. So the course is set to 'weighted mean', and within the individual categories are simple weighted means. The problem is that moodle is calculating the total grade by the \"percent of percentages\" and not the \"percent of points earned.\"  I know this because I was able to reproduce the scores using an openOffice spreadsheet. So, for instance, when I calculate the score for one of the categories for a particular students, she earns a total of 2% towards her total grade.  The category is weighted 5% of overall grade, and she earned 40 points out of 70 in that category.  5% of 40 points is \"2\". That's how I get the 2% towards the course.   But the way moodle does it, she earns a total of 2.8%  40/70 = 57.1%  5% of 57.1 equals 2.8. As far as I know, all of the assignments in all of the categories are based on a 'maximum grade'.",

          "Text": "We are using Moodle v3.1.3+ and for one course, every time a marker grades an assessment item (assignment) for a student, we get into Recalculating grades for the course. The course has over 2500 students and has about 20 assessment items (assignments, quizzes, lessons) in the gradebook. The recalculating grades takes several minutes and sometimes results in \"Error writing to database \". Trying to do a bulk upload of feedback files or importing marks via CSV are also failing. Its coming to the end of the semester and we can't seem to release marks to the students. This issue only affects one course. Other large courses are able to successfully complete CSV import and bulk feedback upload with a few minutes and recalculating grades only takes a few seconds in those courses. Turning on debugging, we've noted that whenever marks are updated, even for a single user, the needsupdate flag the assessment being graded or the course gets set. The error provided are : during bulk feedback file upload: \n```text\nDebug info: Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction\n\n\nUPDATE mdl_grade_items SET needsupdate = ? WHERE (itemtype='course' OR id=?) AND courseid=?\n\n\n[array (\n\n\n  0 => 1,\n\n\n  1 => '106754',\n\n\n  2 => '7086',\n\n\n)]\n\n\nError code: dmlwriteexception\n```\n or when accessing the assignment grading page: \n```text\nDebug info: Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction\n\n\nUPDATE mdl_grade_items SET needsupdate = ? WHERE id = ?\n```\n Is there any reason why the needsupdate flag is set for the entire course? Why isn't the userid passed so that the query only updates the calculations for the affected user? Is there any option to disable automatic grade recalculation and do it manually, when needed? Any advice on helping to find a fix will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, ...Rajneel",

Both the course id and assignment id are different - the only thing remaining the same is the userid. There are no submissions for the newly cloned course, yet the grade is populated with the previous course's grade and comments. Is there a bug with the context id perhaps?

So far just about everything is more intuitive in Moodle with a heap more features....except for the GradeBook. It seemes that this is still in its early development, which brings me to my question. We wish to run several 'Units of Work' within one 'Course\"  Eg: 4 x English 'Units of Work' within a Year 7 English 'course'. This seems to be the way many schools use Moodle and it makes sense in terms of the logistics of Administrating courses. However is it possible to run several units of work in the one gradebook, each with their own Total collumn? The only way I can see is to categorise every single Assessment task in every 'unit of work' and then hide those that aren't being used. Has anyone found another way to do this ? Any new Plugins (apart from gradebook plus) In WebCT you can create Calculated Collumns for this.",

          "Text": "John - I am happy to hear that you are moving toward Moodle and have found it more intuitive. The Gradebook is setup to be revamped in Moodle 1.9 and I would encourage you to stay active in the forums to give input about what features you think would best be incorporated into Moodle. If I understand you correctly, you have 4 quarters during the course of a year which produce report card grades. Fortunately I only deal with 2 semesters and the grade is a running total of the work for the entire semester. I create semester long courses in Moodle. So for your example I would have four separate courses Year 7 English-Q1, Year 7 English-Q2, Year 7 English-Q3 and Year 7 English-Q4. The advantage to this approach is that then the teacher can use categories for weighted grading each quarter. I realize that breaking up the course may not be ideal; however, if you categorize the courses by quarter (which I do by semester) you can hide the previous and upcoming material and keep the students (and teachers) focused on the current quarter. Unfortunately I am not familiar with WebCT and calculated columns. Perhaps others may have some more creative approaches. Happy Moodling!",

Each year is made up of several courses each with a final grade. I would love some easy way to track pupils progress across the courses, for example starting each grade book table with the final grade from previous courses. I haven't used any other VLE's but I have used other assessment tracking programs that gave us this ability and the ability to calculate columns (grades etc). I haven't yet found a way to do this in Moodle, so I too will be waiting to see what new features are added. At my previous school the assessment database was fairly well written and could import columns just using their column names from spreadsheets and you had the choice to upload only specific fields but this all relied on the pupils admission numbers or UPN numbers (national key for all pupils) but using e-mail authentication and now csv upload I can't find a way to include this info which is essential to successful transfer of data in and out of moodle.",

So, we’re very happy to see the outcomes available with our 2.1 upgrade. However, using them practically has been a bit of a challenge.  Hence, my forum post. I have several questions related to outcomes that I hope can be answered. As a teacher... I’ve mistakenly added some outcomes to certain activities . I can’t figure out how to un-attach that outcome from the activity. It appears to make no difference whether or not a student has completed it or not. I’m unable to uncheck this outcome in the activity itself or somehow unattach it in the gradebook. I’m unsure of how to add feedback to an outcome so that students can view this along with the activity feedback when they enter their gradebook. If they have feedback on their activity and how they did, it might be nice for them to also have feedback on how they met/didn’t meet the outcome(s) as well. We often want outcomes linked to a week’s worth of work, not necessarily a particular activity. Is the only way to do this to link the outcome(s) to the final activity of the week and mark the outcome there? We have three types of outcomes for our courses – course outcomes, weekly outcomes and activity outcomes. Is there way to order these in the gradebook, so that activity outcomes can be tabbed in under the activity, the weekly outcome can somehow be tabbed in under a gradebook category that I created for that week and course outcomes could be listed at the end under all of the previous gradebook items? Is there a way to make quizzes, wikis and lessons support outcomes? As a student ... When I go into my gradebook, I see the activities with the outcomes. The outcomes aren’t tabbed in under the activity. I don’t think it’s clear to students that the outcomes are related to the activity. Is there was way to tab them under? I can only see the outcomes in my gradebook. When I click on an activity, I see my submission, and the instructor grade and feedback.  I see nothing about outcomes. Is there a way to make this available to students here? Thank you again for your help in trying to figure this out. Sarah",

The quizzes are graded with a numerical, \"normal\" value (usually 100 points). Depending on the points, the student is assigned manually to a course: elemental 1, elemental 2, intermediate 1, etc. We are wondering if there is a way to do this assigning automatically, so that in the gradebook the results of the quizz (for instance 40 out of 100 points) are shown but also (or only) our customized scala (for instance \"elemental 1\" or a numeric value). I have created a scala but it does not work, since it is not possible to link the scala to the quizz' grade. Has anyone tried and implanted something similar? Thanks!",

As a Moodle Administrator I am somewhat of a grade calculation expert, or can at least confidently follow the docs. I would like consistency in the courses so I can be assured of the robustness of learner results. As a learner I want my grades to add up correctly so that I can continue to focus on the areas of learning I need to focus on. Before I release this on the Moodle plugins , I'd appreciate some further testing and feedback on the usefulness of such a tool. If you are interested you can download the plugin from https://github.com/noisyjerm/moodle-gradereport_calcsetup/archive/refs/heads/master.zip Install it onto a development site, not a production site as it is not ready for that yet. Install it into the /grades/report/ directory There is an example course included which will be helpful in seeing how it works. If you have any comments or suggestions please reply here. Thanks",

There are a few things you could try - you could set the gradebook to not show totals if there are hidden items and then make sure that there is one hidden item in the course.  Perhaps you create an end of course activity that the teacher unhides at the end of the semester and then the grades will show?  You could just not show the gradebook to students and hide it all.  (I have never tried this but I think the individual activities might still show the grade for each activity.) You could maybe use CSS to hide the column altogether and then just unhide it on a set day but this would be site-wide.",

          "Text": "Some teachers at my school were shocked to find that even though they had set \"Show grades\" to \"No\" in the course settings, that students could still see their grades if they looked at specific activities rather than going through the gradebook. Apparently all that the course settings selection does is to hide the \"Grades\" link in the admin menu. This might be useful if the teacher is in the midst of changing the weightings of the various components or hasn't set up the gradebook into categories, etc. and thus temporarily doesn't want to the student to view the grades, but otherwise, it doesn't make much sense. As you can see below, the help button implies that the students will not be able to see their grades, but this is misleading. What do you all think about having a 3-way choice for \"Show grades\": * Show grades * Hide grades link in admin menu * Hide grades link and all grades in activities Cheers, Tom Robb, Kyoto Help info for course settings/show grades Grades Many of the activities allow grades to be set. By default, the results of all grades within the course can be seen in the Grades page, available from the main course page. If a teacher is not interested in using grades in a course, or just wants to hide grades from students, then they can disable the display of grades in the Course Settings. This does not prevent individual activities from using or setting grades, it just disables the results being displayed to students.",

I agree that this course setting is ... er ... unclear. Actually, in our Moodle in French it says something more like \"Hide Gradebook from students\", which is more accurate. However, the \"grade hiding\" article in Moodle Docs is almost clear : http://docs.moodle.org/en/Grade_hiding So, To hide grades, teachers should mark them (individually or on a per activity basis) as hidden in the Gradebook, which would be ok ... But, Whatever the grade visibility setting is, the grades are still _always_ visible to the students under the \"Assignments\" page (as a student, go into any assignment, then go up to \"assignments\" using the navigation breadcrumbs). Finally, I hacked the mod/assignment/index.php file, modifying if (isset($grading_info->items[0])) { into if (isset($grading_info->items[0]) && !$grading_info->items[0]->grades[$USER->id]->hidden) { This way, grades here are only visible when not hidden. I have to ensure this actually works everywhere before telling my teachers everything is ok. I should as well modifiy the text string \"Hide grades\" into \"Hide gradebook from students\".",

Just a bit of background: my students keep their Word documents on their own Sharepoint website.

This means that (a) my Moodle account doesn't get jammed up with Word documents (b) students are able to include graphics and layout in their submission. So, I'm wondering, is there any software or other solution out there that will enable me to download all the student assignmnents to my desktop (without having to click through each one). I've tried a download manager but it doesn't work for PHP pages.",

The only reasons we haven't decided to fully switch from GradeMachine to Moodle is due to: GradeMachine has reporting features Moodle doesn't possess. Training our teachers on using the Moodle gradebook exclusively will be a hassle, not because of Moodle, but because of the Teachers lack of interest. I have discussed my little problem with my immediate supervisor, who came to the same conclusion: We must create a module/script/application/etc. that will take the grades that Moodle outputs and parse them into a format readable by GradeMachine. As of this posting, I am looking for anyone who has run into this problem and can help. I figure, worse case scenario, I actually write a Python script that will take the data from Moodle and split it into chunks that GradeMachine will handle. I have looked at several modules, but so far they all seem to be handling the grade entry or display of the grades within Moodle. I need something that will export them into a customized report. Now that I think of it, I haven't really looked to see if anyone has created a reporting module for grades within Moodle. That may be the next step from here. Thank you!",

Running 2.5.3,  the behavior we see on importing a csv file with a null field is that it will set the field in gradebook to null (even if it had a value).   For example - lets say the spreadsheet is - id, midtermscore, finalscore 4, 60, 58 5, 40, 47 6, ,  30 Here is a scenario Student 6 has a grade score of 50 in the gradebook for midtermscore. But, once the instructor imports this file, it will clear the 50 and set it to null. What we want change in the import program is to ignore any changes on the grades if there is a null value. The specific case that we have issues with is, we have a course with multiple sections where the instructor has empowered 2 tas up import grades.  Both TAs have access to all sections.  TA 1 upload scores for his students.  TA 2 uploads scores for his students (plus he has empty values for TA1 students).  All of TA1 students scores now get cleared.

Thus with two assignments: if student gets for one assignment 28 and for another 28, his grade is 100% if student gets for one assignment 27 and for another 29, he has still overal grade of 100% What is a proper way to do the same in 1.9? So far, I only found an option to set two assignments instead of one: one assignment with 28 points maximum and other one defined as extra credit with 2 point maximum. Moreover, it is the necessary to set category aggregation as sum of grades (no other aggregation type has a possibility of extra credits). This solution is not nice as teacher has to mark student twice at two separate places (activity, gradebook).",

There is a number of quizzes that need to be completed, the first attempt counts, the average outcome of all of these quizzes needs to be over 60% in order to be shown the final timed quiz / exam. Thus I created a category for the preliminary quizzes and if the necessary 60% are reached, the final exam, shows up. After completing the exam there is a feedback for the student if he has failed or succeeded and a notification is sent to the teacher about it. Now there are two points unclear to me: 1. Say there are 10 quizzes in the category and 6 have been completed with 100%, the 60% are reached and the final exam is shown. How can I make sure, all quizzes have been completed and only then the final exam is shown? I want the students to make one attempt in each quiz for sure, for learning purposes. 2. If the category is completed and the 60% have not been reached, now no instant feedback is shown and there are no notifications. I can't figure out how to achieve sth. like this: 10 quizzes are completed, the category-average is under 60%, after the last one in the category there is a feedback telling that \"Sorry, you failed the course\". Also the teacher should be notified that a student is done with the class and failed.",

On top of this some teachers have tried to manually add in the user id's in the spreadsheet before import but we have found that moodle rejects the entire import. For some reason, removing this students information from the spreadsheet allows all the other students to be imported and if we put this students grades in their own spreadsheet then moodle allows them to be imported. We have of course checked the id in the moodle profile of the student and everything is as it should be. Any ideas?",

The students have to get an 80% on the test or they fail the course. The students have to contribute 12 discussion items or they fail. I cannot seem to figure out how to set this up to work properly. Ideally, I'd like everything to calculate automatically and have the certificate unlocked once it happens.

So let's say the course has 2 electives, and I need to use a category to get the correct weights.

Up until now I had not been told of this problem. Here is the simplest description. A teacher has entered a group of assignments into Moodle . They are uncategorized. At some point a group of students have completed the assignment but not all. Grades are entered and saved but the assignment is still uncategorized. The rest of the students completed the assignment. Grades are entered and saved and the assignment is moved to the proper category. Suddenly the next assignment in Uncategorized shows zeros for all the students who were graded the first time. The zeros can not be deleted. They can be replaced with a grade. This is really bothering some teachers because it seemed to appear out of nowhere. As far as I can tell since uncategorized does not count it should not make a difference in the average but it looks bad to the students and parents. Any ideas? susang",

          "Text": "I have used the grade book successfully with Moodle 1.4.5. This has included using a variety of scales, pass merit distinction etc. We are due to roll it out across the whole college when we upgrade to 1.6 in August. However there seems to be a major problem in 1.5 and 1.6 unless I am missing a button somewhere to turn it off. (Quite probable) If you use a scale it still increases the total mark available by 100. So a student gaining 99 out of 100 in a quiz and two distinctions for assignments will be shown that they have gained 99 out of a possible 300. Not really a situation I would like to find myself in at 6.30 a.m. over breakfast. Moodle 1.4.5 has a much more sensible approach.(See Jason Cole's book for a screenshot) I have tried all kinds of permutations in the advanced features, but cannot find a setting that sorts this out. Can anyone help? as I am seriously considering sticking with 1.4.5 next year for this reason alone. However I do not want students to miss out on the new features. Mike McDermott",

There is a nasty hack - I'm really new to Moodle so no idea whether this is going to break other things. The problem seems to be in /grade/report/grader/lib.php on ~line 141 The call to setup_ groups () only fires if the pref \"showgroups\" is set. However, I think this will only be set if the dropdown display of groups is chosen. If not (i.e. in the case when the viewer is restricted to only one group), the whole list of student participants is shown. Taking off the if clause around setup_groups() seems to work fine for me, but I'm sure someone with a bit more knowledge could set me straight on this. I would be willing to try this, if only I knew how to do it.  Any one willing to explain it to me?",

Overflown grades (going over the maximum grade of an assignment) generally seem to only be done with an override, and from what I tested on our 3.9 instance, that's true in the previous version, as well. I believe some LTIs can pass in a grade that's higher than the maximum grade, as well. For instance, our Gradescope integration at NC State can provide a 105/100 and Moodle will take it with no issue.",

          "Text": "Recently, we upgraded to Moodle 1.9.9+ (Build: 20100707). It seems there has been a change with how rounding affects scores with an override. Example Have an assignment with a 10 point scale, and the student achieves 8/10. In the gradebook, the teacher overrides the score to 8.5. Since zero decimals are being displayed, it rounds the score to 9. (this I would expect) New Issue In the past, I simply adjusted the setting of decimal display from zero to one decimal to accurately display the 8.5 score. Now, the database seems to have changed the overridden score to 9.0, rather than what was actually entered. The rounding rules determine what score is recorded. The 8.5 is lost forever, and the new override displays 9.0. Have others seen this issue? I understand that the setting adjusts what is displayed, but the change I see is that the overridden score becomes whatever rounding rules were in place at the time of the override.",

          "Text": "Hello - I checked the forums and didn't already see this question addressed, but I'll keep looking in the meantime. I give students the option to use a type of contract grading system in most of my courses.  Most prefer to stick to the standard model, but a few choose the contract system.  Each student in the class who chooses that option negotiates (within moderate limits set by me) the weights of most of the required assignments.  For example - Student A contracts to have her two essays count for 10% each of her course grade, while Student B might contract to have them count for 15% each.  For each student, everything still must add up to exactly 100%, but the point is that within the class, it's possible that no two students have exactly the same combination of assignment weights. Is there a relatively straightforward way to set up Moodle's gradebook to handle this sort of situation, where the weight of the assignment depends on which student we're talking about?",

          "Text": "Hello, I have just read an article by Ido Millet and Suzanne Weinstein called, \"Grading By Objectives: A Matrix Method for Course Assessment.\" I was wondering if anyone has set up a Moodle gradebook to allow the linking of graded tasks (assignment, exam question, quiz, or project) back to learning objectives?  Is this even possible?  Your file size restrictions here prevent me from attaching the article, however, I was able to attach it in the \"General Help\" forum. Same question. Same title. For each graded task, the teacher needs to have the ability to specify the relative extent to which the task evaluates each learning objective: either relative weights or points assigned to each task allowing the system to compute the relative grading weight assigned to each learning objective. Also, the article suggests that when a single task generates separate grades for different criteria or subtasks, we should record and treat the grade for each criterion or subtask as a separate assessment with its own weight. Once tasks are graded we can then assess how well students performed on each learning objective.  This will allow teachers to investigate the reasons for poor performance on learning objectives and to change the design of the course to address deficiencies. If we added a way to distinguish between summative and formative activities (or, whether an activity was used for both) it would provide useful information such as the relative assessment attention each learning objective receives in terms of formative assessment, summative assessment or both. Is there a way currently for teachers to: 1) specify learning objectives. 2) allocate each task across these learning objectives. 3) classify each task as summative or formative. If there is not a current way for teachers to do this, what is the process to request that this be made available? Thank you very much! Annie G.",

          "Text": "Hi M2 users and experts, I'm sure I'm not the only 1 to face this issue Using Moodle 2 I would like to associate each assignment with a custom marking scheme so tutors can quickly mark/correct an assignment and let moodle keep track of it. The problem i face is each assignment has different headings under which marks are assignment and different values for those marks and I can't see how I can accomplish it in moodle In general you can think of it as Assignment 1 is a file upload task and the teacher needs to assign marks based on a structure similar to task 1 worth 2 marks task 2 worth 1 mark task 3 worth 5 marks task 4 worth 3 marks Assignment 1 total marks 10 Assignment 2 might have a marking scheme for another file upload task like task 1 worth 6 marks task 2 worth 3 mark task 3 worth 3 marks task 4 worth 3 marks task 5 worth 10 marks task 6 worth 5 marks Assignment 2 total marks 30 If i were to create a custom scale that would only allow me to create the actual structure(s) using the comma separated list but not to include the numerical conditions so tutors don't over allocate marks but also to allow calculations to be carried out later. In an ideal world moodle would prevent a tutor from entering 3 marks for assignment 1 task1 because it would know the max was 2. Is there a way to do this either in scales or by other plugins or did I miss something in how scales operate? All help welcome",

          "Text": "I hope that someone here can help me with this problem. We are using the moodle gradebook to display the marks for assignments that are collected and graded external to moodle. Our teachers perform a weekly grade import (we have written a slightly customized version of the CSV import format that automatically matches existing assignments and updates them). Everything is working pretty well (with the exception of the display order of the imported grades - another open forum post, and a display issue). Our teachers have two additional grades that their gradebooks contain: Exc - which is an incomplete assignment with a mark that is excused and does not count against the student as a zero Inc - which is an incomplete assignment with a mark that has not been completed and does count against the student as a zero We have been able to create a custom scale that includes these as well as the regular numeric values (and works), but the problem is, this scale has to be manually assigned to each assignment in the system in order for the Exc and Inc grades to display in the grade reports. If the assignments are created ahead of time in the moodle gradebook, the CSV import fails when the grade scale is anything besides the default scale. We also can't see a method of specifying the assignment grade scale in the CSV import process. So - it would seem the best solution would be to modify the core grading scale to include the Exc and Inc values and they would then be displayed. Anyone know of a way to do this?",

Since we do have gradebook history turned on, is there a way to have rankings and averages only reflect the currently enrolled students?

We are using the database sync. plugin to sync. enrollments from at table in MSSQL . The source MS SQL server had run out of space in one of the logging volumes when the Moodle participant sync. ran. The script apparently dropped everyone from the courses.  Once the issue was fixed on the MSSQL side of things, we are finding that anyone that logged in during the two hour time, lost the grades from the gradebook. Removing them from the course and adding them seems to bring the grades back. However, it seems that the issue was with 500+ students times 5+ courses which makes it tedious and not practical. Does anyone have any workarounds to bring the grades back in bulk through a script or some way at this time? I have been looking at https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-36024 but still no resolution. This is a major problem and are getting desperate.",

They could not figure it out. They maxed out the APC cache to 256MB and increased the timeout on my load balancer to 120 seconds. When I'm in the gradebook and click update, the next page continues to only load the text, \"Grade Report\" and then stops. This page includes an error in the code, stating that: A required parameter (id) was missing. However, when we looked at my post request, we verified that the ID parameter is included in the request. This also doesn't happened every time. I would say 90% it doesn't work, but then sometimes I click update and it loads the next page fully with the entire gradebook and my changes saved.

When configuring the course, I include certain items (usually scorm packages or forums) in a category of the gradebook and block this category from the date on which the course ends. What happens is that when a student accesses the activity again after the blocking date the category grade goes from 100 to 0, which causes a conflict with the integration we have of the platform with another grade saving system. The odd thing is that in the gradebook report the grade has not been modified, but only becomes 0 in the grades configuration view even if the category is locked. It is also important to note that by locking each item this problem does not occur, but I find it strange that the category lock does not work correctly. Does anyone have any idea what might be happening? Thank you very much in advance for the help",

My question is: is this actually what the student is seeing (a big bug), or is there a little bug in Gradebook when logged in as a student? ( Btw , the global student role is set to defaults, i.e. view user grades to allow, and view course grades and manage grades to not set. I've even tried a local override on the course page, explicitly allowing view user grades, without effect.) Thanks, Jim",

          "Text": "We are using Moodle version 1.9.8. We are using Sum of Grades for the grading method, which shows points and percentages.  We have the setting as \"show totals excluding hidden items\" in grade total. Moodle is randomly hiding grade items. When we have a hidden item, it is skewing the scores badly. When the item is UNHIDDEN, the scores really drop.  Today, I unhid ONE item of 70 points on a 2380 point course and one student's grade dropped from 72% to a 49%. All for ONE hidden item. This is a disaster for our students and our teachers and parents will lose trust in our program. Here are the specifics. Maybe someone can help solve why this is happening.  Joe is taking a course with a total of 2380 points with Sum of Grades as the Category & Course Total. In Categories and items, one 70 point item somehow gets hidden. Joe is showing a total of points as 1739.45 and a 73.09%, passing. One of the assignments is randomly hidden in Categories and Items. When discovered, we unhide it. The total points should go up 70 points, but it stays the same (2380). Joe made 46 points on this 70 point item, but when the item is unhidden, his total points actually DROP to 1127. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN??? Whey I manually add up the points, the 1127 is correct, not the 1739. So, in summary, ONE hidden item, when unhidden, made Joe go from 49% to 72% and his points go from 1739 to 1127. OBVIOUSLY, Moodle was not totally the gradebook correctly when it added up the 1739. When I try to rehide the item, I cannot recreate the wrong grade.  Why are items being randomly hidden? And more importantly, why would this skew the student's grade by giving way more points than he earned? Please, someone help me with this problem. I am the Moodle Admin and everyone looks to me for answers. I have no explanation! Thanks!! Sharon",

Indeed,\nwe have several teachers who manually add grade items in the gradebook but the s tudents in these courses complain that they are not made aware when a new grade is published. I\nknow that normally, notifications are handled on the module side and\nthat in this case we should maybe create an offline assignment instead but I\nwas wondering if the possibility of adding a notication system directly\ninto the notebook may be a good idea. Thank you!",

          "Text": "Moodle: 3.0.2+ (Build: 20160121) Hi, I found this discussion from 2014 that has the same topic: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=261407 As in 2014, problem is that we are unable to override a score on a SCORM activity. I have tried with all settings and nothing works. The only one that actually allows me to override it from the gradebook is by setting the SCORM \"activity completion\" setting at \"Participant must receive a grade to complete this activity\". However, this has another consequence: When a participant accesses the SCORM and gets a \"0\" in the Score because they have started on the course, it will give them a \"completed\" status then as well. So this is not a viable way either. So: Has anyone managed to override a score coming from a storyline SCORM, so it gives the participant a check mark on the course page? We have quite a few taking courses on our platform with poor internet connection, which is why we sometimes need to be able to manually override a wrong score from the SCORM. Thank you for your help!",

          "Text": "I just applied this patch to a moodle 1.6.2. It did not work on my first attempt, but on my second attempt I changed Xonclick to onclick as it seemed to be set up this way in the original 1.6.2 file. This seemed to do the trick with one exception. Stats for individual categories pop up, but the pop-up for the total category has labels but no numbers save a couple of zeros in the average and standard deviation categories. The reason I needed to use the patch might interest some as well. A couple of my students discovered that in the mode category, when no two students have the same cumulative grade (in my courses this is very likely as there are hundreds of points up for grabs), mode produces an alphabetical list of every student's grade in the course. It doesn't attach the names or anything, but they were then able to figure out who had what using a student list and a couple of phone calls to confirm their suspicion. I don't have much experience with this, but I think I should report it as a bug. Any ideas on how to get the numbers in that Total category to show? Thanks for all your help everyone. My students and I love the moodle! -Bob Stevenson",

This is what we did: 1) Go into the course \"settings\" with editing on and scroll down to \"hide grades\". This disables the \"grades\" function in the student view under their \"administration\" block. 2) Enter the individual topic or week areas and hide or reveal the marked assignments as desired. This will allow students to access their feedback or marks via the links to the assignments as they appear in the topic or week sections of the course. If you hide assignments, but still allow students to see their grades report--they will see any entered grade by clicking on \"grades\" in their administrative block. Julia Hengstler.",

Rather than shut off all the stats, in my hack I just commented out the lines that display just the mode on the moodle/grade/lib.php file. We are using 1.8.4 with the gradebook plus add it so I had to comment out 3 differant places. Here is an example of what I did: function grade_stats() { Several lines of code... // Mode diabled due to a problem with grade confidentiality MG // echo '<tr><td align=\"right\">'.get_string('mode','grades').':</td><td align=\"right\">'.$stats[$category]['mode'].'</td>'; // if ($preferences->show_weighted == 1 && $preferences->use_weighted_for_letter == 1 && $category== 'all') { // echo '<td align=\"right\">'.$stats[$category]['mode_weighted'].'</td>'; // } // echo '</tr>'; This may repeat 2 or three times down the page in this function in an if statement.

It's not for all students just for about 1/3 of them. I've noticed that with the assignments there is a \"status\" column and a \"Final grade\" column.  For the results that are missing in the gradebook this column is empty and for those that are present it is the same as the status column. For the students with missing grades I can click the update link and then just save and it now updates in the Final grade column. Is the a way of forcing a recalculation of the whole gradebook as I don't want to go through 30+ assignments updating each individual student. Also with the quiz there are fewer missing entries but I'm not sure how to force them into the gradebook -I tried recalculating and that did move most (but not all) into the gradebook.

My course has over 40 assignments spread across 4 categories. Students will be a little daunted if the first time they click on Grades they see 40 tasks listed. That is what I see at present when I log in as a student. The students see all the assignments listed even though most are not visible yet and have not been set yet. I have only set 3 of the the 40 tasks. The rest are not visible to students in the main course screen yet they show up in the User Report!! This is not what I want. The old gradebook was good as the student view and teacher view was very similar. Also can I have it so that students in the User Report see an aggregated grade for each category not a singe grade for the whole course? We don't give single grades for the whole course we give a separate grade for each of our 4 assessment categories?",

We have moved a larger portion of Faculty over to 2 this past semester so we have had a larger number of courses that were backed up in 1.9.8 and restored in 2.2.4+ with the help of our Learning Technologies group.\n\nWe are now starting to see a subset of gradebooks timing out and not loading successfully. After some research it seems like this is somehow tied to Grade Categories. It appears like the categories did not survive the backup/restore process and we are seeing a large number of these errors in our logs:\n\n:[31-Oct-2012 13:09:52 UTC] PHP Warning: array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /web/pscpages/webapp/courses2/lib/grade/grade_category.php on line 1168\n[31-Oct-2012 13:09:52 UTC] PHP Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$path in /web/pscpages/webapp/courses2/lib/grade/grade_category.php on line 1184\n[31-Oct-2012 13:09:52 UTC] PHP Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$id in /web/pscpages/webapp/courses2/lib/grade/grade_category.php on line 1184\n[31-Oct-2012 13:09:52 UTC] PHP Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$id in /web/pscpages/webapp/courses2/lib/grade/grade_category.php on line 1186\n[31-Oct-2012 13:09:52 UTC] PHP Notice: Undefined index: in /web/pscpages/webapp/courses2/lib/grade/grade_category.php on line 1168\n\nIt seems like these errors are pushing things past some php processing limits. There are references to some issues with Grade Categories within the backup/restore process in versions past ( http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-21045 ) but I have been unable to find anything with the specific versions we have in play.\n\nHas anyone seen anything like this? or have tips on ways to get those categories to come across in a backup/restore from v1 to v2?",

So they don't know how well they did on a given category overall (e.g. Exams 18% weighted = 90% average for exams). They ought to be able to do the math, but not always.

          "Text": "Hi all! I'm a Moodle supporter in my University, and I contributed with some plugin to moodle.org. I received some feedback from professors of my University that find advanced grading quite difficult, even more when have conditional grading or several opportunities for grading. For a long time, I'm thinking about a some kind of wizard to help teacher users in Moodle to define their course grading. The backend will be the same like the current grading structure, including the manual cualification like when a teacher uses the the grading calculator. So, changing nothing at all in the backend, but providing a user friendly, even drag&drop user interface, to build the final course grading. So, I think about this important new feature: new wizard-like frontend for easy course grading definition. Preconditions Having all ativitivies to include in the course grading already created into the course. Activities may appear in any kind of grading category structure. Postconditions: Having all activities structured in the gradebook, so that the final course mark corresponds to the final students marks. I know that most of teacher users in my University, use external documents (like excels or so) to manually build final marks of their courses, given that they find some advanced grading features (that Moodle already provides or may provide using calculator and specific formulas) very difficult. They find even the option of the calculator from the gradebook  difficult to use. At the same time, there are some teachers that makes an advanced use of the gradebook and their current features. Having introduced all my thoughts and my own experience, the question is the following: If we are to develop such kind of frontend, how this should be better addressed to be Moodle- and gradebook-conformant? I mean, I can see 4 kinds of plugin for gradebook, but none of them is similar to what I'm proposing here. Any though, any comment, whatever... will be very welcome!!! Thanks in advance!!! Jordi",

The gradebook is also recalculated when putting tutors in cohorts and in many other situations. Context : Moodle 2.8.8 (i.e., post 2.8.4), MySQL , courses with 300 studentes * 100 gradeitems + complicated categories and aggregations. Result of making 1 change: DB reads/writes: 70868/43297 DB queries time: 120.40607. Almost 100k queries? What's it doing?! Why 3 queries per grade? If I change a weight (say), surely I don't need to update or select all grades, I only need to touch the aggregations, right? I thought maybe something was wrong with our database (this site is upgraded continuously since M2.2), so I installed a Moodle 2.9.2, created a course with a 1000 students and 10 gradeitems *with grades* (this is essential, I used the patch from MDL-47911 ). Result of making a change: 29306/21018 DB queries time: 41.78441 secs So, again, 3 or 4 queries and updates per grade. Is there anything I can do? This really makes our instances of Moodle 2.8 very difficult to use. I wonder if nobody else is seeing this: there must be a lot of Moodle admins with 100s of students and 10s of gradeitems. Maybe I'm overlooking something obvious? I notice MDL-47911 is closed and that development of MDL-48838 and MDL-48839 seem to have stalled. There's also MDL-49324 .",

The other 40% does not allow me to enter the grade from Grades Report page, but when I click save updates and refresh, the results for the 40% of students are missing.  I have also looked at the backend sql and no results have been entered for those students. The funny thing is that I can enter grades into the blank fields using the edit button (this is very tedious as I have 160 students in the class). I have tried, rebuilding the Gradebook for the class, same problem after rebuild. I have also tried IE 9.0 and Firefox (both latest version). No success!

The other issue to this is that most of the online content to this class is SCORM files... so the small groups are all accessing the same SCORM files and then having separate discussions in forums, taking quizzes, etc. To put it another way: can I assign a TA to a group and that limits them to the gradebook for just that group? I really don't want to go down the road of separate courses for each TA small group; that's a lot of maintenance. Suggestions?",

Does anyone have any experience with this? Any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated. I should note that I have tried to unenroll / re-enroll students, but their SCORM completion data and quiz data remains. This may be a module issue or an enrollment issue, or simply a \"Moodle wasn't written like that\" issue. Please contact me if you have any ideas or suggestions.

The idea is that all students will enroll in the course using a group enrollment key. As test scores are entered, individual students will be able to check their results. Teachers, in charge of a section (group), will be able to check and download their class results from the gradebook by choosing a section. A problem that has arisen is that teachers will also be able to view results from other classes, which is against institution policy. Is there a way I can set this up so that a teacher or non-editing teacher will see ONLY grades from the section they are assigned to? I've experimented with assigning a non-editing teacher to a group, but it seems NS teachers can still view grades from all other groups as well. Any ideas? Jim",

          "Text": "I know there has been a lot of talk about this feature, but I can't find what the status is for 2.0. I have groupings in my course. Each grouping has slightly different assessments. The groupings can't see each others' tasks in the course view. They can however, see the tasks listed in their gradebook. What I really need is the grade items to be hidden if they don't belong to the grouping. Can anyone help me out with this please???? A little more information: I'm trying to do two things: 1. Create elective assignments. I'm using the group choice module so that individuals choose the assignment they want to do, which sorts them into that assignment group. Once they are in the group, the assignment becomes visible to them on the course page and they complete it. They can't see the other assignments so are prevented from doing all of them, only the one they have chosen. It falls down at the User Report level because they can then see all the possible assignments listed in their gradebook, which aggregates incorrectly. 2. Create streams We have different audiences doing our course that lead to slightly different qualifications. One group does the basic assessments, but the other group does additional, harder assessments each module. I don't want the easier group to see the harder group's assessments because it will be confusing which ones they need to complete. I also don't want to separate them out into different courses because then we don't get the cross over and collaboration between the two groups on the common assessments. If there's not a standard solution out there, is there a piece of code I could add somewhere such that whatever triggers an activity to be invisible on the course page to an individual could also trigger the corresponding grade item to be invisible in the gradebook? Now that we can aggregate only visible grades, this could potentially be a viable solution? Perhaps?",

It turns out that they added some new admin settings MDL-20250 . These settings affect the whole gradebook, even though they are hidden on Site administration > Grades > Report settings > Grader report. I have to say, the only extra complexity of having calculations enabled is that you get an extra menu item in the Edit menu on the Categories and items page. I don't think an admin setting to hide that is a good trade-off in terms of compexity. It looks like that setting is meant to default to On when you upgrade, but on two different test sites it defaulted to Off. Has anyone else seen that?

Something like this =sum( #001 *0.5+ #002 *0.5) where the #001 and #002 are graded assignments. My question, if I now hide the grade item corresponding to #001 will my course total be updated to reflect this? So if #001 was 70 and #002 was 56 making the grade total 63 and I then hid #001 then would I have 28 or still 63 as my course total in the user grade report? This user insists that the expected behaviour has been, until recently, the former, i.e. the hidden grade updates the calculation accordingly. At the moment on our performance instance and our archives, I can only see cases in which the latter happens, i.e. id displays the course total ignoring if the grade has been hidden. Can anyone from the community let me know which is the correct expected behaviour and how long has it been so? We are using 3.4 and we have recently moved up from 3.2. Many thanks, Damian",

Everything was setup correct.  They both had other classes setup similar with no problems.   One of them was using Natural and one was using Simple weighted. I recalled that one time  I had some sort of category issue and I just hid and then unhid the category and it was fine.   So on the category totals that didn't show to the students, I hid those categories and then made them visible again, and they then matched. When I told faculty they might want to check grades with one student, two replied that they did and the scores were off, but only by about .3 of one percent. When I looked at the student grades, again from the the student log in, I could see the category totals showing for all categories.   This time I just hid the main category for the class, and unhid it and the totals then match exactly. I didn't find anything about this issue when I searched the gradebook forum. Has anyone else seen this?",

The 4 modules constitute the grade for the course. The students have taken these module and the gradebook shows their grades properly. The 4 modules have been weighted 25% each. However, when the grades are exported to calc or excel, the grades are multiplied 4x. I noticed this with the certificate module where students are getting grades of 180% etc. Is this related to the way the scorm modules work, or some other setting in the gradebook? Paul",

It would help if you could do a course backup (obviously changing the student names or simply create a demo course and make up data) such that it will demonstrate the problem you are having. There are several options in setting up a SCORM so I in order to track down what is happening in your case having a common data set or sample would be very helpful. From what you are describing it sounds like it might be a bug but we can confirm that with a backup. Let me know if you have any questions. Peace - Anthony",

Is this at all doable? I am a bit lost reading documentation on restricted activities and hidden activities. Thanks!",

I have a course with 5 quizzes in it.  I am trying to create a custom column in the gradebook which I want to show *how many* of the quizzes the users have attempted, regardless of the score they have achieved in those quizzes, so if they've tried 3 quizzes the colum will show '3'. In order to do this, I need any column which has a grade in to be treated as a score of '1', and any grade which doesn't have a score to be treated as '0', and these to be added together for all 10 quizzes. Since a number divided by itself = 1, except for 0 which (hopefully) = 0, I thought I would be able to do this with the formula: =sum( quiz1 / quiz1 , quiz2 / quiz2 , quiz3 / quiz3 , quiz4 / quiz4 , quiz5 / quiz5 ) However, although this formula is accepted, in the gradebook I just see 'error' in that column.  (Using Moodle 2.09).  Some exploration suggests it doesn't like the same grade item being used twice in one formula... Does anyone have any suggestions for how I might achieve this, either with the gradebook or with another method?  Using a checklist doesn't work because our logs are only stored for 30 days and completion tracking isn't enabled, and I need to aggregate grades from quiz attempts over the pass year. Any advice most gratefully received!",

For example: O = 2 K = F = The result is: 3/2 = 1.5 multiplied by 100 = 150 Does anyone know what the syntax for not allowing that to happen?

The problem only seems to be for courses that have existing grade items in the gradebook when students are enrolled in the course. For existing courses where the teachers have not previously used the gradebook the quick grading works for all students in a column when new grade items are added. Next experiment in to back-up a course with an existing gradebook - remove all gradeitems from the gradebook for that course and see if the problem is solved - not the solution we want but the info should help us with our troubleshooting.

I traced through the code, and I see it inserts records into the grade_import_newitem table, and I guess at some point that gets put into grade_items table, but with the reverse sortorder that I want.

Also, if a student is excluded from all assignments in a particular category with a weight of 25% then the student will effectively be graded as though the other 75% is 100% of their grade. This means that the other categories will effectively have a heavier weighting. Consider the following scenario: Three categories with the listed weights: exams: 50% homework: 25% labs: 25% If a user is excluded from all lab assignments then the \"75%\" from the exams and homework will now be 100% of what that particular user is graded against. That is, the exams for this particular student will be weighted 66% (50/75) and the homework at 33% (25/75). Another idea is if you are using \"drop the X lowest\" with grade items of varying point totals. If this particular user scored really low on a high point value item then that one will be dropped. This will result in the lower total point values for the category meaning that the remaining assignments will have a much greater weight for this user.",

You could do it manually with Moodle 1.9.x through the use of idnumbers, and either manually exporting from Moodle and importing the data into your database ( XML , CSV, etc.), or you could write an update query of some sort that would move the data between the two, but without a good reliable method of aligning anything that exists in both, it woud be difficult (we've got about 700 active courses, and I don't know how many 'Chapter n Quiz' instances!). I don't know a whole lot about FilemakerPro, but I do see that it is able to import Excel spreadsheets. It's possible that you could extract grades from Moodle by course and then import them into your database. Thanks, Matt",

Can I now go back to the 10 or so quizzes - turn the adaptive mode off and then regrade the quizzes. They just want an all or nothing scenario on the questions as to if they got them right or wrong.

Although we have been given directions for linking, I think I am the only faculty doing so. These outcomes have not been 'rolled out' for general, nor mandatory, use. Fortunately. I had interesting Outcomes reports for Fall 2013 courses. But then, there was a major issue, with some outcomes still linked, but not operational. Tech support had to call whatever their acronym is for an outside Moodle support system. After about two weeks, I asked for news related to the outcomes issue, and within a day or so, the outcomes appeared to be working again. Fortunately, I was reviewing the Moodle transcribed grading to gradebooks in the current Spring 2014 courses. Disaster! Havoc! Tech support eventually told me there was a bug. Tech support deleted one of the problem outcomes while in Gradebook, then added that outcome back to that assignment. I had to then, go back into the activity, and reenter data for the outcome (options: No outcome, DId not meet, Partially met, Met). In one course I had two assignments already graded, 20 students. So I had to delete the carefully placed outcomes from each activity, add the outcome back in, the re-enter data for all of those outcomes. I am wondering, among others who are linking sitewide outcomes, if this bug was widespread, or just a local site misfortune.",

I think I got it!  I had the previous assignments hidden (and had said to included hidden items in the Gradebook Preferences.  But, it only worked for me and not them.  I assume this is a glitch????  When I unhid the items then you could see them as a student.  I pseudo-hid them by moving them down the list, and then selected to only have the first ten items shown.  They show up in the Gradebook now! As a side, is there a plan to add grades for non-moodle activities to the Gradebook?  If teachers could do that then we could fully migrate to moodle as our gradebook software as well.  The only other item would be to add quarters onto the Gradebook.  That way a teacher could have separate grades and entries for separate quarters. My school is looking (at my resistance) at eventually going with ProgressBook.  It allows parents to view student grades and assignments online so they can check on their progress.  Moodle is very close to becoming a free alternative that I think my leadership could live with.  ProgressBook cost local schools  $4 per student per year.  It is an ongoing cost I would like to avoid!

It appears the course has been set up as a category with 5 \"courses\" under that - but they are all part of the same course, just separated into weeks (probably the best explanation). Students complete one course/module and automatically move to the next. I can see individual gradebooks appearing under each course but I was wondering how I can get one gradebook with all the grades listed together. Also the \"lessons\" have been set up but when looking at the students it is listing as \"no attempts\" when I know they have reviewed the info. See my example.  I gather the person who set this course up may have chosen the wrong activity or hasn't included something. Can anyone help me?  Thanks heaps.  (I've attached some screenshots) Kindest regards Jacqui",

          "Text": "Hello, In our current version of Moodle (2.4 I think) when different professors import their partial list of grades to the qualifier the empty grades on their CSV file override and delete the grades previously imported by different professors (with a different subset of students). So an actual grade gets replaced by a blank grade ! The \"subsets\" of students (or partial list) change from activity to activity so erasing the empty files is not a viable option (not all grades may be empty for a given student). It forces us to import the grade for each activity one at at time. Creating an activity just to be able to import grades without the overriding problem is also a pain in the ... and does not allow multiple grade imports either. I would like to know: (a) if there is a work-around to my problem (b) if future versions of Moodle allow to import without over-rides. Thanks! Ileana",

They're using different methods of calculating grades (some assignments graded on a 4.0 scale, some on points, some satisfactory, etc.). Extra Credit has been extremely problematic as well. So suppose you were going to teach somebody how to use the gradebook from scratch. What aggregation method would you suggest? Extra Credit does not seem to calculate correctly if you use anything but \"Sum of Grades\" in your overall aggregation method. The whole situation is very frustrating, and everything I'm seeing is that from 1.8 to 1.9 the Moodle Gradebook took a HUGE step backwards.",

Currently I have the quiz with a result of 50%, 1 SCORM activity with a result of 74.67% and no results for the rest. It is reporting a Course total of 19.92 %. I am using the formula =average( Quiz , SCORM1 , SCORM2 , Ass1 ). Is this correct? Or how would I be able to get it to take the average of the 4 activities to use for the course total?",

I used to keep another online gradebook, but never did enable the parent access. Since every assignment goes into the gradebook, I only record it once, and my life is a lot easier. In my experience, an online gradebook is way too much info for most parents. I give lots of grades, and students today had a Moodle quiz, a HW grade, and a CW grade. Parents tend to micromanage and really if they have gotten a 2 out 3 correct on the CW, it is not the end of the world. I keep guest access enabled on my courses, so that parents can see what is due and when I have tests and projects scheduled. This is very good information, and works well. When it is time for grades, I record grades then in an online form for another utility, and report cards are printed from that. If I have to mentally \"recalculate\" a C as a C+ due to trend or something, it happens at this point, and no one has to know since they have not been looking over my shoulder at the gradebook numbers.

So to further explain what may happen with the new code. All new installations should work cleanly without problem. Upgrading installations in the absolute worst case will lose the following information; grade item category settings ie. what category a particular moodle item belongs to grade scaling extra credit settings grade exceptions If you do notice that this information is lost, you can manually reset this to avoid problems/inconsistencies by deleting all records in {$CFG->prefix}course_grade_item and {$CFG->prefix}course_grade_exceptions doing so will ensure that there are no inconsistencies. I believe that there is enough error checking code in the gradebook that there should not be any inconsistencies and over time the extraneous entries should be cleared, but to be on the safe side if the upgrade fails I would suggest manually clearing the afforementioned tables. Just to reiterate in the worst case no student data regarding graded items will be lost, only some gradebook settings could be potentially lost.",

Yes, there is a way for your administrator to change the link for the gradebook when a student is looking at it; however, it would effect every course on your Moodle site and it would be a custom change.

But the weird thing is that some students ( 4 or 5) have the mar as not visible and they cant see they mark. Ive revised the exam and the exam was ok and they have their mark. So these students are in the same group which students cant read the marks without any problem. If i had enable some option nobody could be able to read their marks and review the questionaire.

          "Text": "Season’s greetings Tom. This is such an excellent post – and it is a topic that faculty members ask about frequently during the semester.  So, even though you already have your answer, I hope you won’t mind if I add a line or two here. I have found the Offline Activity Assignment a great tool for assignments that are submitted by students – but that for various reasons – are not submitted online.  Some examples - for others who might be wondering - are:  assignments involving architectural drawings that are “pinned up” and discussed during class, in-class discussions, quizzes in paper form that were administered and graded offline – and the list goes on. For those who may be new to the Activity and Resources area, here are the steps for creating the necessary “container” for the offline activity and the steps for grading the activity in Moodle. (These instructions are for version 2.3 – but should work just as well for older versions.) Steps for Creating the “Non-Moodle” Assignment While logged into the appropriate Moodle course, click on the Turn Editing On button. This will display the Add an activity or resource link. Select the Assignment radio button, and then click on Add .  (For those who see two sets of Assignments or who wish to see detailed instructions on how to fill out the Assignments screen, please review this link for details: http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/mod/assignment/view Fill in the name of the activity, e.g. Museum Visit, Sketches, etc.  – and add a description that will serve to let the students know what the assignment involves. Pay careful attention to the Submission Settings area since it is here that you will indicate no file uploads, no text submissions, and no comments.  Be sure to assign this offline activity to a category.  (This option is in the Grade area of the Assignments screen.  The link included above also explains how to create and use categories.) Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select Save and Return to Course . Steps for Grading the “Non-Moodle” Assignment Back on the Moodle course page, click on the link for the assignment - once you have manually marked the quizzes and/or graded the assignment. Then, click on View Assignment Grades and Feedback .  Turn on Quick Grading , (this option is located in the Optional Settings area that is below the list of students.)  Assign a grade to each student for the offline activity and remember to click on Save All My Feedback .  And there you have it.  These grades will now be included in the Moodle Gradebook. Best regards, Michele Edwards",

You could then either code it to prevent teachers from editing grades but allow them to view grades (which could then be overridden when necessary) or have a setting within the module or at site level that specifies if teachers can edit grades or only view them.

If I do a dummy run as a student I see the grading as follows: If I answer say 2 out of 3 questions correctly the grade shown is 66%, but I need the grade to be calculated out of 24 ( i.e. 8.33%). It also means that (presumably) if a student only answers 1 question and that is correct then he/she gets a grade of 100%!

          "Text": "Greetings - we're running Moodle v3.0.2; For one course, the grade book was not calculating correctly. A category was not totaling, so a colleague created a new category and moved the items that were within the erroneous one. This seemed to resolved the issue. we deleted the old category, however, as soon as we did so the grade book became inaccessible. I ran debugging, here are the main results: Attempt to obtain a grade_category's associated grade_item without the category's ID being set. Can not regrade non existing category Can not update grade object, no id! Is this normal behavior for a gradebook to break after deleting some empty categories? siteurl/grade/edit/tree/index.php?id=123 gives \"isn't working message\" Attempted to get to edit category pages by adjusting the courseid/categoryid in another course's page, but this brings up a page showing the course title and the breadcrumb, with everything else blank. I'll have to move forward with a restore, but either my colleague didn't actually move all the items out of the categories before deleting them, or there is a major flaw with deleting categories.",

When out tutors mark an assignment and give a 'refer' grade, they also 'allow another attempt', which in turn allows the student to see their grade for attempt 1, even when grades for that assignment are hidden still. Is the only answer to prevent tutors from selecting 'allow another attempt' and do it manually on the day when grades are actually released? Seems strange to me that previous attempts' grades would should when grades are hidden for the assignment. thanks",

I know set up will take a while. Adding the Outomes for each class and program might be the easy part. Then, we will need faculty to map all assignments/ quizzes etc. to the outcomes. Or maybe only map to quizzes and larger assessments. My questions-- Are there any schools currently using outcomes like this? If so, are you satisfied with the results and reporting the results.? How are you using it? Set up seems pretty simple, but do you have any advice on making this work efficiently? Are there best practices in set up? In creating reports? Does Moodle have a comprehensive reporting structure to give me what I need? Or do I have to write my own report? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.",

It's really too bad. I used the journal activity for a weekly learning log and liked to be able to print the whole thing off (or PDF it) so that I could analyze it as part of the course learning assessment. That's a real pain (read waste of paper and time) to do with \"online text.\" I also found scoring the journal assignment much more convenient than the online text assignment. DW",

Two categories: \"assessed\" and \"not assessed\"; set weight assessed to 100 and not assessed to 0. Then use set categories on each item.

          "Text": "A colleague created an assignment using Completed/not completed as the grading scheme.\nShe graded the items, but when she viewed the gradebook, these had been assigned a percentage value.\nStrangely the percentage value was 100% if \"not completed\" and 0% if \"completed\"!\n\nI couldn't explain to her why this behaviour occurs in Moodle, nor I could I find out how to fix it.\nShe went back to the assignment and changed the grade criteria to a mark out of 10. She decided to enter these grades directly into the gradebook instead of updating the assignment, and allocated 10 if completed and 0 if \"not completed\".\n\nBizarrely, back in the submission list, that changed the grade shown to \"1\" for completed and \"2\" for \"not completed\"! But the \"final grade\" showed the grade she entered in the gradebook (i.e. 0 or 10).\n\nSo I have these questions:\nWhy does Moodle try to allocate a % score to an assignment if you choose \"completed/not completed\" as the grading criteria?\nWhy does it give 100% if \"not completed\" and 0% if \"completed\"? (is this a bug?)\nWhy if you then change the grading criteria (e.g. to mark out of 10) does it change the percentage to 1 or 2 (or something else)?\nWhat is the difference between the \"grade\" and \"final grade\" in an assignment submission list?\n\nI have so far been unable to find answers to this, so if anyone can shed some light on this I'd be hugely grateful.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nJames Bisset",

That may explain most of your problems. In the grade book I think all assignment are given a numerical value to give each pupil an average over all assignments, e.g. 5/10 and 20/40 would average 50%.\n\nSo if your scale is providing 2 possible results, the first becomes worth 1 and the second becomes worth 2, hence Not Complete becomes worth 100%.\n\nI use Outcomes to record my BTEC grades as Not Met or Met. You will need to read up if you want to set them up, but basically I assign a grade scale of: Needs Improvement, Complete, Good, Excellent but also allocate outcomes for P1, P2, M1 etc. This means I can tell the student which aspects of the work are complete but also give an indication of the quality. Technically I am awarding them a grade from 1-4 but in the gradebook I always show raw values so they will only see Needs Improvement, Complete, Good or Excellent.\n\nHope that makes sense/is helpful.\n\nGraham",

At this stage it seems as if Moodle calculates the final weight for each assignment as a percentage of this assignment's contribution towards the final mark. ex: If I have 2 Tests counting out of 50 and 100 respectively, Moodle will calculate the final mark as follows: Test 1 wil attribute 33.3% to the final mark and Test2 66.6%. I want to know whether it is possible to change this weight value to an equal amount for both without changing the total marks for each Test. I have tried the 'Curve To', but it seems as if this only changes the maximum mark of the assignment and does not reale 'curve' the mark to the maximum. Thanks",

How does Moodle treat notifications when an assignment is graded? Sometimes I see an option to send notifications.  When I do see it, and click it off, as sometimes I am want to do, does this remain off for all notifications on other assignments until it is switched back on? This option does not seem to exist on all graded assignments, has it been removed on some? If I make an adjustment to a grade or comment after it has been saved, does the student receive a note announcing the change? Aside from remembering an assignment that has the switchable option, is there a location I can switch them on or off globally? These things keep me awake at night.....",

(and workflow, I believe) I have a situation where advanced grading comments (from a marking guide) were lost after the grade was manually overridden (by accident). I have \"released\" the override, but the marking guide comments and grades did not re-appear. Does anyone know if there's anyway to retrieve the marking guide comments? Is this just the understood consequences of overriding an assignment grade? I've been searching Moodle.org and other institution's websites but detailed information around the assignment override function is a bit vague. I have found a few references that suggest that unlocking the override should revert back to any assignment level grading...so I would have assumed that the marking guide comments and grades would re-appear but they did not. I did try to retrieve the lost marking from an automatic course back-up, but unfortunately the marking all took place after the most recent backup. Can anyone provide any clarity on this for me?

For each lab, the members alternate being the group leader with the leader being responsible for the lab report. A student’s lab grade is compromised mostly of the lab that they have written and, in a smaller part, the two other labs that they participated in. For instance, if the first lab report received a grade of 12, the leader would receive 12 points towards their total lab grade while the other two members would receive 2. Is there anyway of simply writing 12 in the leader position and have 2 appear for the other two members? ű Thank you.",

I increased the PHP timeout to 4 minutes (up from 2 minutes).  That gives me more time before I get the timeout error!  After maybe 10 minutes if I re-try in the same session (after MySQL processes have completed) I get in.  Taking 10 minutes per gradebook update/save is too long. I can see in the My SQL process list that it's going through and doing various processes like UPDATE mdl_grade_grades SET aggregationstatus = 'used', aggregationweight = 0.021276595744681 WHERE itemid = '122' AND userid = '385' and others after the UI times out.  Once these all complete I can get in in the same session. We're running Moodle 2.9.2+ (Build: 20151016). This only became a problem recently as I've added more students to course. Is there anything I should turn off or can turn off to prevent this recalc from happening all the time?  Are there tricks for large courses? thanks, -- Scott",

For example, if a student has taken three assignments (10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, and 25 out of 30)....how can I display the course total for that student as 88%, instead of 44? I can get percentages as the average of each individual assignment column, but I've lost the ability to get the course total to reflect the current percentage. Thanks for your help!",

I have a lot of moodle courses with a high amount of questions asked to the learner. The courses are theme-based and learners decide for themselves what and when to answer. If they choose to answer, they should get some feedback from me. That's why I need to know who answered exactly which question so I can provide that feedback. Currently I check the user's logfiles and via that way see who waits for a grading/feedback. This is quite cumbersome, but I don't know how to do this most efficiently. What I would like is something like \"All submissions for all tasks on one page\" or even better \"All submissions for all tasks in all courses on one (very long) page\" Any tipps how to do this? I use Moodle 3.4. Thanks in advance, Maud",

This client uses groups/groupings for visibility so there are just under 100 groups enrolled to most courses. One student will typically belong to many groups and there are multiple non-editing teachers in each course. Groups are set to separate in all courses. In this case my task is to control visibility (in Grader Report) between non-editing teachers. I do this by adding/removing users from groups in \"Enrolled Users\". I assumed adding two users to the same group would facilitate them being able to see each other in Grader Report. This is not always true. There seems to be a limit on how many groups one user can be added to as it pertains to what's seen in Grader Report. There also seems to be a hierarchy .... some groups taking presidence over other groups in Grader Report. Can someone please explain? Thanks, Mike",

I have created a category called \"Homework Totals\" that is intended to show the addition of all grades coming from 6 different categories of Chapter homework assignments (about 5 quizzes per each Chapter homework). Then I move all my Homework chapter categories (which move will all 5 quizzes contained) to the category \"Homework Totals\". For some reason I do not follow (since I was never asked what the maximum grade for the \"Homework Totals\" category is) when I see the grader report page, this new category shows as \"Range\" the values 0-100. When The grades are populated by the students' submissions of homework, the values shown in the \"Homework Totals\" category stop adding when they reach 100. I have tried to edit the maximum for this \"Range\" by editing the category, but the editing window shows as a fixed number that I cannot change. The info associated with that value (question mark link) tells me that to change it I have to do it via the actual activity... Since this is a category created to organize the gradebook and not an activity, I don't see how I can change this value and have the gradebook show total sum of submitted homework. Any help/guidance will be enormously appreciated! Thank you for your time Cristina",

But occasionally a student will do something that is novel, or will leave out a minor thing that I didn't anticipate in advance when I made my rubric. So I may want to add a point or two, or even subtract a point or two, but not necessarily go into a higher or lower category. So, what can I do? I know I can manually override a grade, but it would be MUCH more convenient if I could do it as I am grading, using the rubric.

          "Title": "SOLVED BTEC Criteria Grade Calculations",
          "Text": "Our gradebook has different units with differing numbers of Pass, Merit, and Distinction criteria. Each criteria is given a grade item and assigned a scale with 3 achieved codes and 5 non-achieved codes. I have been looking for a way of getting Moodle to calculate the end grade for each unit. The problem was that BTEC requires every pass criteria to be achieved for a pass to be awarded, no matter if all the merit and distinction criteria were met. To get around this, Distinction criteria were given a weighting of 1. Merit and Pass criteria were then given suitable weightings so that achieving all Distinction criteria were not worth a Merit, and achieving all Distinction and Merit criteria was not worth a Pass criteria. i.e. Unit has 8 Pass, 3 Merit, and 2 Distinction criteria. The distinction criteria are given a weighting of 1. (You do not need to use the weighting options in the gradebook. They do not work with Grade Items anyway. We will give weightings in a customised grade calculation) Since there are 2 Distinction criteria, each Merit needs to be worth 3. 3 Merits, each worth 3 gives 9 in total. Add the 2 Distinctions and a Pass should be worth at least 12. The next problem was not having a Boolean scale (achieved/fail). To get around this I took the log of the grade (by assigning a IDnumber and multiplied by a suitable number (for 8 grades by 0.26). i.e. 0.26*log( P1 +1) The +1 in the calculation is needed to avoid an error with log(0). All the achieved grades come out above 0.5, and non-achieved below. I then used the round function to transform them into Boolean 1s or 0s. i.e. round(0.26*log( P1 +1) All the achieved grades are now worth 1, and non-achieved worth 0. They each get multiplied by the weighting of each level of criteria: =(16*(round((0.26*log( 1P1 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P2 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P3 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P4 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P5 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P6 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P7 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1P8 +1)))))+(3*(round((0.26*log( 1M1 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1M2 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1M3 +1)))))+round((0.26*log( 1D1 +1)))+round((0.26*log( 1D2 +1))) Since I have six units, I needed to adjust the weightings to make sure to achieve a PASS overall I could utilise the letter scales with fixed percentages. Since I have 8 Pass criteria, each worth 12, that is 96 total. 3 Merit at 3 each is worth 9. 2 Distinctions worth 2. 107 in total. To get a pass in total you have to score 96/107 = 89.7%. Since most of my other units returned a percentage of 92%, I increased the weighting to 16 (as you can see above in the formula) so that every unit returned PASS at 92%, MERIT at 98%, and DISTINCTION at 100%. I probably haven't explained everything in full detail, but I know there are people out there who would like to solve this issue. If you would like to know how to get it to work for you, drop me a message.",

          "Title": "Achievement Based Grades- Weighted Sums?",
          "Text": "Hello all! I'm a relatively new user- have been using for a year and generally happy. I'm part of a worldwide \"beta\" on how to incorporate gaming concepts and attitudes into the classroom, but I think that what I need can easily be used by others- and I'm not sure how to do it. Basically, I want to grade by sum- so that the \"final grade\" they have (like XP in a videogame) rises as they complete assignments- So instead of an average... a rising point total like in a videogame.  Similar to that fundraising thermometer... I want kids to get excited about rising to the goal of \"leveling up\" I'd like to use the same simple rubric (i built a 5 point scale in moodle) for every project. But depending on the complexity of the project- I'd like to multiply the final score. so a simple project is on the 5 point rubric, but a more complex assignment is 15 (5x3). I'd be just as happy weighting sum categories OR each individual project... I see advantages to both ways.  But ultimately I want to have a gradebook that has every project graded on a 5 point scale, but can have some projects worth 15 points (x3), 20 points (x4), etc... Easy solution would be to just have a \"weight\" in the assignment or category when using sum... Multiplicator seemed to be the answer, but it only multiplies up to the total possible- which is the 5 point scale. I want to multiply AFTER they use the 5 point scale to assign a grade for a 15 point project. There a way to do this? Seems like lots of people in Career and Tech Ed or Business courses might be interested in using this to have kids see \"proficiency\" in areas by striving toward a point total for \"leveling up\" Ultimately, I'd love to see something where the kids can enter a forum post with their artwork, have the other students grade on the rubric, and it drops in the gradebook automatically with the weighted value. I'd only have to mediate \"discrepencies\" between student's self assessment in the post and the overall class review of the work by ratings.

          "Text": "So in troubleshooting another problem (and trying to be quick in order to allow the user to accomplish what they needed) and without fully considering the ramifications, I deleted all attempts for two quizzes.  Being somewhat familiar with MySQL , I dove into the database to find the old attempts after reading this post . With a little bit of orientation, I found the mdl_grade_grades and mdl_grade_grades_history tables, as well as the id from mdl_grade_items that corresponded to the quizzes that contained the attempts I had deleted.  Using these and my userid I was able to run the following query to find the old quiz results: select * from mdl_grade_grades_history ggh where ggh.itemid='2849' and ggh.loggeduser='1833' ; From there I ran an UPDATE query to restore the results in the mdl_grade_grades_history table to the mdl_grade_grades table: UPDATE mdl_grade_grades gg, mdl_grade_grades_history ggh SET gg.rawgrade=ggh.rawgrade, gg.finalgrade=ggh.finalgrade, gg.timecreated=ggh.timemodified, gg.timemodified=ggh.timemodified WHERE gg.id=ggh.oldid AND ggh.itemid='2849' AND ggh.action='1'; I added the ggh.action='1' as that was the only entry in the history table that contained actual grade results.  This was successful and I got all of the entries back into the mdl_grade_grades table, but the restored entries don't appear on the website when I go to the quiz results page and get a report. Is there a step I'm missing here? Running Moodle 2.3.3 on CentOS 5.7 with Apache 2.0, My SQL 5.1.63, and PHP 5.3.15. Thanks!",

For example, say we have a category \"Quizzes\" to which we assign a value of 10%. We put 13 quizzes in the category. Is each of these quizzes worth A) 1/13 of 10% such that in the end the weighted grades of all the items in the category add up to 10% of the final grade? or B) is each quiz in itself worth 10% of the final grade? I presume it's the former, but I'd like to know for sure before he plans his grading system around it... If someone could offer me a coherent, not-too-technical (Math-y is welcome; he's an accounting professor.) explanation of precisely how the category weights work, I'd appreciate it very much.

I.e., I upload the grades by .CSV to the gradebook, then look at an individual assignment.  I can see that Student X has a numeric grade, but the 'Status' is still marked as \"Grade\". I'm new to Moodle, and was wondering if this will cause problems elsewhere (i.e., some other component won't do something because the assignment is not \"graded\", even though it has a grade).

          "Text": "Anyone have a better mousetrap idea? As a background, we are a homeschool with 7th through 12 can take some online courses provided through moodle. Students are assigned to homeroom teachers but they don't teach them - only record student progress each month for each subject. HR teachers sign their students up in moodle to take courses from various moodle teachers who do MOST of the grading EXCEPT for the monthly progress report. Our superintendent wants to have all the homeroom teachers give student progress reports for every course to each moodle teacher. They have up to 30 students all in different moodle classes. Right now, some HR teachers are having to email 60-90 reports monthly to various Moodle teacher who then add it to their grade either inside or outside moodle. solutions I thought of but please give me ideas if you see a faster way. Keep in mind the limiting factors can add up fast like uploading pages on internet or sending emails: just imagine having to do this for 100 grades and your solution will be more realistic: currently : each teacher emails every moodle teacher a separate file for every student they have. Each moodle teacher inputs every file into every student’s grade either inside or outside moodle. 1. HR teachers type reports for every student inside moodle by giving HR teachers editing teacher status Pros: it's right in moodle already saving moodle teacher time Cons: page loading time going into 60-90 different grades would take way too long We don’t really want them seeing grades of all other students too 2. Excel solution : teachers email one person (me likely) one page in excel where they list each student, grade, comment for that month’s effort. When all excel sheets for all teachers are collected, I run a program to extract each page information to one excel sheet page and then sort it by moodle class. Then send to each moodle teacher by coping their class students with all the comments/grades. I could either email whole excel file to the moodle teachers who paste into moodle each student. I could export it as csv file from excel and have each teacher import it to moodle (better if I train) Is there a way I could import them to Different moodle classes from one csv file? (saving time by not sending it out to each teacher and waiting for them to upload it themselves) 3. some better way in moodle to create grades in ONE place but have those grades show up in DIFFERENT moodle classes??? Thanks in advance for your ideas James",

The curving strategy, however, works as follows: A quiz with 30 questions (1 point each) has a passing percentage of 75% which translates into a 5.5/10 grade. Lowest possible grade is a 1/10. Between 10 and 5,5 0,6 points are deducted from the maximum grade for every incorrect answer, between 5,5 and 1 0,2 points are deducted for every incorrect answer. These values will vary if the quiz has more questions, or the passing percentage is higher/lower than the example 75%. My question: can it be done? And if so, how?",

The weight will be automatically adjusted to \"0\". The problem: why is extra credits automatically checked? Is this a bug? I'm trying to get everyone on board with the Natural grading.
