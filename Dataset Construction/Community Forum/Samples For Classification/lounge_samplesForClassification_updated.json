If I can describe what it is I exactly want to do and if someone could explain if it is possible and if so maybe where I can get information on setting it up.. I have spent an hour or so looking for info on this. OK:  I want to do the following.  Setup different types of course, based upon the different subject areas:  EG:  We have Islamic Studies and ICT piloting the software.  Underneath each subject there is different courses:  EG:  GNVQ, Applied ICT, ECDL.  Then underneath each course there is a sub category, which is basically the different Units for each course.  This is the part that actually has the topic information that we are currently seeing each time. Is this possible?  I thing it is so important to get this right.",

The project is funded by the European Union within the Lifelong Learning programme. The ARGuing project created 'The Tower of Babel' Alternate Reality Game, using Moodle as the platform, to motivate secondary school students across Europe to learn languages with great success. Project website at http://www.arg-education.eu You can see a presentation on YouTube at (I have taken out the direct link as it caused problems in my previous post): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd4rKnRSZY8 that includes some statistics and comments from teachers. The link to the Moodle platform is: http://ictthatworks.net:8080/moodle/ We will be presenting academic papers on the project at the forthcoming European Association for Games in Education conference in October, Graz, Austria and will be placing documentation on the project website as well later.

Another reques that will use that feature, is that they want to get information from teachers about conferences, so other teachers later can browse for an specific conference and turn in their feedback ; both actions via the form and the display feature. Such a thing is possible under moodle? I suggest them to use the forum, but the information will be all over the forum. Thanks.",

The folks that I've spoken with at the hotels near the conference center have said that they have space now, but that they expect it to fill up soon. I recommend that if you are planning to join us, you get registered soon and secure a hotel room. We are quite familiar with the restrictions that purchasing departments put on registering and attending conferences.

In other words, this posting is automatically copyrighted to me.  And the moodle code is copyright to Martin and colleagues.  Even if you do not write, \"Copyright to author\", it is still your copyright.  You can sell your copyright to a publisher if you wish (the Beatles sold their songs) or you can keep it.  Now besides copyright, licensing is another issue.  You can choose to release a writing, a lesson plan, or programming code into the public domain or to commercialize it. Assuming that you want to commercialize a lesson plan, I would do the following:  look at a textbook and copy the phrase they use to discourage photocopying.  For example,  \" All rights reserved.  Please do not copy.  Support the author by purchasing this book/lesson plan.\"    How does that sound? Absolutely, this is an important discussion and one that Moodle is urgently dealing with as a new \"Exchange\" system is being created.  There will be room for both Moodle GPL content and Moodle commercial content to be exchanged.  Personally, I hope most content will be released as GPL, but I realize some teachers are not on a salary as I am, and need paid publications to support themselves.",

There are some cases (stock photographers come in mind) in which you can register your work at the copyright office, at least in the U.S., as far as I recall. Registration allows you to seek punitive damaged in a civil suit. This will, using the example of photography, allow the creator to claim from the infringer more than just the time and materials for creating the content. If you have a novel way of presenting material or \"method\", you can trademark it. One example that comes to mind is a decision making process called \"PrOACT\" (TM) by Dr. Howard Raiffa. Nothing new in the actual content or process, it is just a package with a name.

You can create nice lists To articulate instructions To remind important points To list resources To define priorities Narrower lists are possible To show the plan To tell where we are Show what's coming next and the end point Adding buttons Use buttons instead of simple links. Especially to reuse older resources or activities .\nAnd students love them. Read Review Test Show plan and icons Show the plan and give student rhythm for the activities . Student are much more aware of their progression. And it is even responsive on mobile! What's the problem Identify the points where you could improve the course design. File Now you try it yourself Go and get a few code snippets from bootstrap and try them on your Moodle. Submit Go a step beyond Watch how you can also add \"calls to actions\" and play with colors and icons.

The other thing that helps is if you start the threads with instructions for example- Please post questions about week 1 assignments in this thread. All students are encouraged to respond to these questions with whatever solution to a problem they used. It is also useful to have a class policy that encourages or enforces use of forums as opposed to email.

The concept behind this is that users will devise a three-year learning plan comprising dozens of activities , amend it as they progress, but see only the handbook content that is relevant to their plan. Unfortunately, the learners are mobile and often rural with poor or non-existent connections, so they need to be able to compile and download or print their learning materials. The closest I have been able to get to this is to create each activity as a separate course in which the participants may choose to enrol. This seems very fragmented and I'm not sure how well the learners can be tracked by their mentors.",

But in the grade view (Grades -> View -> Single View) adjacent to every student grade the override checkbox is ticked on. If I untick it then the marks uploaded to that particular student disappears. If I keep it ticked on, then students are able to see the grade but it would be still showing that assignment is not graded, in spite of uploading the grades. Some of the TA's at my University have used a bad approach to this problem by manually assigning marks to each and every student which I think is not good.

Note there are many languages available, especially on the European site, so there is something for everyone to do. Here's the original message I found: Some of you may know the wonders of Project Gutenberg\n( http://www.gutenberg.org ), which has thousands and thousands of public domain texts digitized in several languages, primarily english, french,\nand german, with a fair number of spanish as well. However, these\nprojects don't just appear - they have to be proofread, since software\nand whatnot simply can't match the power of a human. Please volunteer\nyour time - completely at your leisure, from your desk, how much you\nwant when you want - in proofreading these projects. Countless\nhistorically important (and admittedly not so important) works are\nwaiting to be shared with the world that the internet truly makes\npossible. Please register at Distributed Proofreaders\n( http://www.pgdp.net ) and proof a couple of pages. If you have a real\nskill in other languages such as Russian or other slavic languages,\nGreek, and languages with alternative alphabets, please also take a\nlook at Distributed Proofreaders Europe at ( http://dp.rastko.net ). One\nof the incredibly fascinating and groundbreaking projects is an\nEnglish/Spanish/Tagalog dictionary, which will serve for at least 6\nother dictionaries when finished. Encyclopedia Brittanica is underway\nas well - truly massive (it's in the early C's right now). Please\nplease help in any way you can. Very much appreciated!",

For example: 123@hotmail.com – will be assigned as students (anyone with  hotmail.com extension will be set as student) 123@gmail.com – will be assigned as teacher (anyone with  gmail.com extension will be set as teacher) This automatic system will save me a lot of time doing it manually.

          "Text": "Hi im having a problem with getting Single Sign Logon to work in 1.9 in the Ldap Settings. Ldap Is working fine and we have about 4000 staff and students who all use ldap and i have no problems with how that is set up. The only manual accounts i have a 4 external staff that dont have accounts in house and a backup manual admin account. Now we used to use the onld NTLM folder on our old version 1.8 but i deleted this before we upgraded to 1.9 as it was not working. Now we are on 1.9.2 i though it would work stright away but if i enable the sso option and leave the subnet blank, or enter the subnet details it does nothing. Nothing happend at logon and i dont get any info like attempting to auto logon. Now if i browse to the /moodle/auth/ldap/ntlmsso_magic.php i get the following error \"A required parameter (sesskey) was missing\" and thats it. Also i have done all the iis setting on the server and it is running on server 2003 with mysql 5.0.27 and php version 5.2 build 3790. Using ie 6 and 7 for testing. I can provide a copy of my Ldap settings but they must be correct as they have always been tha same and are working 100% If anyone can advise anything i can try would be very helpful. as im a bit stuck now as it would be nice to have single log on. Many thanks David Hallam",

Second, if your system has IPv6 enabled, it might happen that the web server is returning the client's IP address as an IPv6 address, which the current code can't handle, so the check will fail. To make sure this isn't happening, could you please add a line like this to auth/ldap/auth.php, at the begining of the loginpage_hook() function, just right after the 'global $CFG;' line: `error_log('[AUTH_LDAP] Client address: '.$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);` and see see what you get?

The following questions are for those who have a better understanding of the architectures underlying such standards and systems? Will it be possible to use these OpenSocial standards to link Moodle with all social software networks that subscribe to these standards? Would it be a good solution to build similar social networking functionality into Moodle using these standards?

This stunning animation (created by Eloy Lafuente using the open source software Gource ) represents Moodle development as tree, with the root directory at the very centre and other directories as branches. You can clearly see how, in the early days Martin is developing almost entirely alone and gradually more contributors get involved. In addition to developers, in the early years, translators are also shown (up until the language packs were moved to a separate repository).

First off, Chardelle, as one of the people who sent you info about your site being hacked, I suppose I should say \"your welcome.....\" As to my post here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=103424&parent=456943 which you suggest indicates that I am intent on \"belaboring...\", I was actually responding to points Howard made and I included URLs for the material I referenced as I always try to do, because that way everyone understands what everyone else is talking about...... I think on review you will note that I agreed with a number of the points Howard made, but was concerned when talk moved to further exchanges of aspersions. If you want to attack me for what I think was a reasoned review of the details and my expression of my dismay that the source of the discussion was no longer within moodle.org, please me a bit more specific and I will be more than happy to address any of your concerns. I am not sure who is \"getting off on attacking Moodle\". Nor am I sure who \"people\" or \"someone\" are as usede in your post. I tend to agree with Mauno's perspective that ad hominem (invective directed at a person for the purpose of obscuring the underlying argument) is not an appropriate tool for rational discourse, but that does not equate with confusing or refusing to use proper nouns. \"An eye for an eye\" was abandoned by its authors two millennia ago. Sometimes the willingness to see another's actions as incendiary keeps fires burning for as many years. Sometimes its just because humans are venal. There are way too many examples available to prove either theory. I think Mauno argues that without fuel a fire will die, and I second that notion. So I try to focus on facts, and I try to inject a bit of humor where I can......",

It seems to be centred around around asynchronous forum activities and doesn't take into account other modes of computer mediated communication such as conferencing and VoIP. I think it also dismisses power relationships between participants unreasonably. The social dynamics online are different but that doesn't mean that we all suddenly become egalitarian and democratic. That's quite an assumption to make. It also fails to address issues with learners' identities and feelings of commitment to online groups. As we've seen from studies more recently, there are significant issues with cultivating personal investment and productive relationships between participants.",

          "Text": "This might sound a bit silly but I'm looking for a name for a classroom activity that I would like to do with some of my students. Once in a while, I'd like to send some of them (those who want to do the exercise) on a miniature quest for information that I know is readily available online. I'd drop in a few clues in class and interested students would have to do their own queries. For instance, to get some students (in an introductory class in cultural anthropology) to look at Tuckman's model of team development, I could give the terms \"storming\" and \"performing\" as clues for their searches. It may sound a bit silly but I think the strategy could work out. I wouldn't be grading these \"mini-quests\" or giving extra credit to those who go on them. The content of these \"queries\" wouldn't be on quizzes or exams. But I'm guessing that it could be fun to do and it might have some positive effects on student engagement and participation. One thing I like about this simple strategy is that it's not too directive (no hand-holding) but it still gives some signposts so people don't get lost... Now, what could I call these activities ? \"Wild goose chase\" has negative connotations but the concept that they're a bit erratic does capture something of what I want to do. \"Scavenger hunt\" isn't appropriate because the structure of the task isn't as complex or team-oriented as a scavenger hunt. I quite like the concept of an \"Easter egg,\" but that might be an imprecise analogy for what I want to do (the information wasn't deliberately hidden). I don't necessarily need a name to try this strategy out with students, but it could be easier to explain the process if I did have a cool name for it. As English isn't my native language, this is the kind of thing about which I'm not really sure. Of course, some of you might tell me that what I'm trying to do is pedagogically unsound or that my methodology is faulty. If so, I will fully respect your opinion but I'll try it out for myself, at least on a couple of occasions. If you have tried a similar strategy, I'd be happy to learn about it. And if you think of ways to integrate these queries with Moodle (I have my own ideas), it could be very helpful. Thanks a lot for any help you can give me.",

          "Text": "Glad you like it. Seriously. \"Off the beaten path\" sounds good. \"WILD Goose Chase\" could sound a bit too wacky for an undergraduate class. My wife was thinking of something to do with \"fetch,\" \"fish,\" \"boomerang,\" or \"recover.\" And I was thinking of something a bit more descriptive, like a \"GoogleQuest\" but without trademark... My intentions was to let students do what they want with the results. It's always a challenge, for me, as I really want to let students be as autonomous as possible, right away. It can well work. But still, you have an important point about collecting answers. I guess I should provide some structure. My initial idea was simply a free-form forum or blog. I don't want it to be an assignment (even ungraded) and I'm not sure glossary, database, or wiki structures would really fit, at least at early stages of the semester. I also plan to give clues during one lecture and go back to answers (asking class members if they found it) the following lecture (a week later). My not-so-secret hope is that some of these hunts would take a life of their own online and make students more likely to experiment with Moodle. So, eventually, I would very much like not to have to talk about these in class. Actually (thinking out loud, here), it's been my experience that free-form online discussions work really well when a subset of students may create a dynamic of their own. Out of 170 students in this one class, I'm thinking that I just need a few people to get started on those \"fool's errands\" for Moodle to become a fun place to visit, for many students. Maybe I should make it into an actual easter egg hunt. Put some \"goodies\" in different parts of the course's Moodle site. CMS geocaching. No idea what the goodies would be but I don't want them to relate to grades very directly. As for whether or not the answers should be available to others. I actually don't mind if they're not. Some people like to jealously keep secrets, and it's probably their right to do so. But I'm a bit wary of the clique mentality. My first lecture is this Tuesday, so I should think fast. This type of activity isn't meant to be a very integral part of the course. But it can be fun. So, maybe, I'll just open a forum with a catchy name and post clues there, mentioning in class that this forum exist and mentioning the first set of clues in class. If students start participating in the forum, we might take it from there. Path, wilderness, searching, hunting, fetching, retrieving... We're getting somewhere.",

(Maybe logs, test scores, courses taken, etc.) I know some schools are transmitting limited information from Moodle to their SIS, but is there a way (future possibility) to zip up all the information inside Moodle about a particular student? Will this be more possible/plausible with the new grade-book in 1.9? It just seems a lot of people that use Moodle don't necessarily have a full blown SIS, but could benefit if there was a way to store most information about a student gathered within Moodle without having to look it up piece meal.

This strikes me as rather ironic in that one of its key points is about the separation of form and content but it doesn't separate form and content - they are welded together. Flash videos of text HTML pages are not text. I blogged about it here . I sat with a blind colleague this morning while he used a screen reader to read my email containing a link, then went to the Youtube site and 'played' the video. Well we heard the music but that was all. He also pointed out that had there been describing text, the music would have interfered with it. There are some very brief text transcripts on the Kansas site but I am not sure how that will help users of text screen readers. I'll be blogging some more about this - it's a very interesting issue, I think.",

Since the video has already been translated in different languages, there could \"easily\" be a version oriented toward visually impaired people. It would, in fact, strengthen the point Wesch was making in that video (for Visual Anthropology Review). In other words, while art isn't directly translatable, this video's main points can and should be made through different channels. The draft was posted so people could add subtitles.",

Apply gamification to learning. Use social media to centralize knowledge and create valuable communities of practice. Reach game-savvy, socially-networked workers and create a learning model that truly delivers just-in-time learning and performance support. How about for Moodle?  What is Moodle 3.0 going to be?  Presumably a qualitative leap like Moodle 1.x changing to Moodle 2.x. At the iMoot conference, I attended Lasic's presentation on the Moodle Hub. I said teachers doing mass collaboration globally to create great courses in specific fields is the next quantum leap. Even bigger than Moodle itself. Some people agreed. That may be different from what the Training Magazine people think. What do you think is 'Learning 3.0'?",

I hired college faculty and public school teachers to develop a series of self-study online modules based on a format that I developed. In order to make it easy for the developers, I had them create all their content in MS Word for me to reformat to the web once complete. I've just finished getting one of the modules on the web. It covers Technology for Special Populations (Assistive Technology). It is open to the public on my site and will remain that way. It is created so that everything can be seen/done with guest access with the exception of the quizzes...anyone can create an account, and enroll to do the quizzes if they like. The course is located here: http://www.kentuckyclassroom.com/teacher/course/view.php?id=145 I have eight other modules on various educational technology topics I will be making available to the public as I get them formatted and posted to on my Moodle site. On a side note, I'm no expert in assistive technology, so if anyone is really interested in this area and would like to help improve and keep this module updated, please reply here or PM me and we can discuss making you a teacher in the course to help maintain and keep it updated.

I know the list of courses in which a student is enrolled (and much more) is available via the myMoodle page, but anyway here is a solution for those who cannot or do not want/need the myMoodle page enabled. To enable a student to have the list of the courses they are enrolled in displayed on the front page of a Moodle site: as Admin, on the front page, enable the Courses block.

On the other side, in the long run, if you go with them, you will pay and suffer big time. They can set you up within minutes as they have automated script that install Moodle efficiently. On the other side the servers we have used with them go down about every day, and this is a real pain. They have people getting back to you quickly, but many of the people we have dealt with have insufficient and ineffective knowledge. At some points we had so many problems with servers down and things not working that we had to place several tickets a day. This is very time consuming. We had 2 sites with them, and on one of them, they changed their policy about allowed bandwith and they CUT our service... 2 months after we had renewed for the year. They refused to reimburse saying we had violated the policy... which policy was different when we had signed up the year before. They did not send notification to tell us that the policy had changed. We had also signed up for a windows hosting server , and they stopped hosting on windows servers. They would offer us \"free\" downgrade to Linux, but we had all the programing of our active pages in ASP and they did not support ASP on the Linux server. So we would have had to pay thousands to reprogram all our active pages in PHP. In short, we found Siteground business practises deceitful, misleading, plain dishonest. Technical support appears impressive at first, but really, this is varnish that did not (at least for us) have any depth. They lure people with their low cost hosting, but then charge you for everything (even backups). We lost valuable info when they lost one of our databases. A nightmare. I could go on and on! They will try to get people onto expensive dedicated servers. On top of that, there servers are located in Houston, Texas, in an area very close to where Katrina hit and very likely to be hit by major violent hurricanes. There are some very good people in Texas, but this type of company has the culture of Enron and Exxon. They are driven by pure greed and will do anything to get your business and your money. Do a google search on Siteground and you'll get many other horror stories. Conclusion: I suggest you deal with anybody BUT siteground.",

          "Text": "Hello fellow moodle users, For the last five months or so I have been learning how to use moodle. (thanks for all the support at this site!) I am an English Teacher at a technical high school in Japan. Currently, I now am serving my moodle on my Mac Desktop Pro, as a production server . Unfortunately, I cannot register or access my moodle from home because it is stuck inside our school network. This week I have a meeting with the Computer Dept. to explain to them why I need to have the moodle outside the school network. The Computer Dept., traditionally doesn`t allow anything outside their network for security reasons. Let me list a few items of information that are important. 1. My server is my own personal computer, not the schools. 2. I did a step by step install of Moodle 1.7.2 so as to secure the site better. 3. I changed the default passwords, as said in the moodle installation info. 4. I want to use my moodle as a platform for other students studying English to communicate in English with my students, via, posted discussion, chat, blogging, and posted video and audio. I would know the total number of students and set all passwords and user names. My understanding is that Moodle is pretty secure as long at you take necessary precautions. (backup, hard passwords, update). BUT, I am not sure what the computer people think over at the computer dept. I suppose they view by moodle as another potential access point for crackers. My big question is, can anyone point me to a discussion or thread that outlines moodle security in a detailed manner? I would like to be prepared for what ever questions the Computer Dept. puts to me. Ps. My understanding is that if a cracker uses packet snifers to intercept the encrypted data between my server and the users computer that they eventually could *crack* my moodle after they beat the encryption. Is this correct? One, I dont think that any cracker would be that interested in my Moodle. There is no sensitive data (pictures of students, full names, addresses) Two, a cracker would have to intercept a lot of packets before that could get enough info for a password and user name and that is after they cracked the encryption. What is the moodle encryption rate? And is this premise correct or incorrect?",

We would now also like to add a dozen or more more generic courses for a wide range of our employees on general topics like communication, writing reports, supervision, conflict management and other general business topics. We can develop these courses ourselves, but since many organizations must have these same courses already, we are thinking, \"why re-invent the wheel?\"  Thus, we are looking for these kinds of generic courses that we could simply purchase and save time/money.  Does anyone have any ideas about where we could purchase some of these \"generic\" course for use in a corporate learning environment?",

We use a variety of tools for a variety of purposes, but here is what I am narrowing down my focus to: Learning -> Moodle Reflection, Social, & Publishing/Views -> Mahara Communication & Video Tutorials -> DimDim Moodle is the core of it all and everything is based on your login to moodle. From moodle ( LDAP LOGIN) every staff and student can gain access to these three add-on resources. Teachers already have instant access via ldap permissions to publish a course at anytime in Moodle. I have the first 2 done, I am waiting for Version 4 of DimDim which will allow a teacher to upload a PPT and record the webcam and presentation for viewing later. DimDim can also be utilized for collaboration and communication on class/group projects or study sessions. These three systems work well and integrate nicely to provide everything from social bookmarking & Blogs to web conferencing and whiteboards. I like that students can now be publishers of content via Mahara as well. What are your thoughts?",

Moodle 2+ has a lack of some plugins available for 1.9.  But not so big a problem with a starting off in 2+.  You don't know what you haven't got.  The book (a non core modue) is working for 2+. The basics seem to be sorted, especially with the video work currently headed for the weekly release soon. Gradebook: no experience in this.

However, we consider Moodle 2 to be a beautiful, modern system; and as such is the future LMS for our Polytechnic (32,000 students). We started designing in 1.9 without incident; but soon realised that conversion to Moodle 2 can be messy. We now prefer to start with Moodle 2 and design directly in the production environment. Furthermore, we need to develop add ons for the LMS to monitor and flag participation (or rather, non-participation). This will be much easier to achieve in Moodle 2 with its built-in conditional logic. Moodle 1.9 is inadequate in this respect. Students also enjoy Moodle 2 for its file management. It is highly significant that a student can maintain a Flickr, Picasa, DropBox account as a file repository that can be easily referenced in Moodle 2 across all their Courses. We are optimistic that the release of Moodle 2.1 will demonstrate maturity and stability at the enterprise level.",

If the Book module and Feedback module are already in Moodle 2.0, you should have little problem. Our Sharing Cart and Project Course Format plugins are due for updates in May. We are also waiting to hear about some drag-and-drop Question type plugins that should be coming soon. Martin reported at the MoodleMoot Japan that HQ is now using a \"swarm\" style of programming management. This means they work on major issues as a whole team until completed, then move on to another major feature. This way they can fix a release date more reliably than if they worked in parallel with each person doing separate jobs that may not get completed in time. So I feel confident you will see a 2.1 release in June/July.",

          "Text": "Well, it is not clear how religiously Moodle HQ are following the Scrum gospel. Anyway, I would say that Martin is product owner. It is his role to represent the voice of a million Moodle users in the planning process. I believe they are recruiting, or have recruited, someone to fill the role of scrum mater, but it has not been announced yet. The team is indeed the HQ developers. There are two added complications to the classic Scrum picture. First, not all the Moodle developers in the world work for Moodle HQ. There is lots of other development going on. Second, as well as the fortnightly spring cycle, there is also the weekly cycle of integrating and testing contributions and HQ patches to make the weekly builds. The key organising point is the Tracker . Each item in the project and sprint backlog is recorded as a tracker issue. It is also how non-HQ developers feed their changes into the system. Votes on tracker issues are one of the ways Martin listens to the millions of Moodle users. To reply to Derek, I would say that the big picture emerges over time. Particularly, I would guess, via Moodle Moots. I would guess that every time Martin has to prepare a keynote explaining what has been done recently, and what is coming soon; then present it; and then listen to the feedback; that provides a good opportunity for reflection on the big picture. The other point to make is that Moodle has been set up in such a way to de-emphasise the need for a big picture. We intentionally have modules and plugins so that lots of innovation like certificate and questionnaire and forumng can take place separately. If something gets done that is very good, the decision to then include it in Moodle core is something that can be decided later.",

          "Text": "I've just wasted about an hour trying to find something online that gives some clear examples of what a derivative work is in terms of the creative commons license. I'm wondering particularly about images. There are some definitions of a derivative work that are quite clear-like a painting or collage based on an image. The creative commons license variations cannot include a \"no derivatives\" and a \"share alike\" clause in the same license, which makes it more confusing. But what is a use of an image that is not a derivative other than just posting the image by itself? The share alike clause seems to apply only to \"derivative\" works. But if one uses an unmodified creative commons licensed image as an illustration of a newly composed text on a Web page, is that Web page considered a derivative work? If it is not considered a derivative work in that case, then is there any different functionally in the terms of the license if it is either a no derivatives or share alike license? If a share alike image is used in a non-derivative way, then is the user obligated to publish the entire work in which it is included as share alike, since share alike only seems to apply to derivative works? I hope this makes sense. I really wish someone would take someone to court over these creative commons licenses as they seem to me to be full of ambiguities. At least that way there would be some clarity to the matter.",

I'm not so sure I would agree with the courts myself but it is to my own benefit to accept their judgment so that's what I will do. The creative commons license is just too ambiguous and untested-unless it is a strict \"by\" license-and even then it is kind of silly because most people on Flickr use nicknames so you have to credit the photo to some stupid nickname rather than its real photographer-and that makes little sense either because in a way, does that really fulfill the license requirements?

But I have some concerns. 1) I am iffy about being able to monatize a Moodle site. I know there is a paypal plugin for Moodle. But what about subscriptions? What about credit cards? 2) Is this site made with Moodle? If not, why not? 3) I am reading some harsh stuff about Moodle. Is it any cause for concern? 80% of people on this site hate Moodle: http://amplicate.com/hate/moodle I am also reading a lot about performance issues, especially with recent releases of Moodle. 4) A lot of people post that: \"anything you can do with Moodle can be done with WordPress, or Drupal.\" I think that is probably true. But, from my experience so far, getting WP to act like an LMS is huge PITA. WP seems to be very centered around blogging. Using WP for an LMS feels like trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Maybe I'm too impatient with WP? Also, worthwhile plugins in WP cost money, and sometimes even those are not worthwhile. 5) Mobile is important to me. WP does have decent some decent mobile themes. How would you rate Moodle for mobiles? 6) Does the Moodle flashcard plugin work with newer versions of Moodle? 7) One of my great frustrations with Drupal was: this module does not work with that version of Drupal and that module does not work with this version of Drupal. Sadly, Moodle seems to have the same problem. Or maybe I have misunderstood? That's all I can think of for now. Thanks for reading. 3)",

          "Text": "http://amplicate.com/ looks like an amusing site to pass the time, but I am not sure I would trust it for reliable information. You also need to calibrate against the competitors: http://amplicate.com/software/12376-top-e-learning-platforms/ On to the more serious questions: 2) This site is a mixture of Moodle (e.g. these forums) and other more specialised tools, like tracker.moodle.org and git .moodle.org. The intersting one is docs.moodle.org, which uses Mediawiki, not the Moodle wiki. The Moodle wiki is designed for a small wiki activity within a course. The Moodle docs wiki is a huge site, which needs the extra organisation tools that mediawiki provides. 3) The perforamance issues are fixable. Indeed, how we have started working on it, a lot of them have been, or are being, fixed MDL-39443 . Many sites run Moodle with good performance. 4) Anything you can do in Moodle can be done in Drupal or Wordpress. Similarly, you could do it all by starting from scratch and building your own custom system in PHP (or any other language) but that is going to be a lot of work. If you want to teach online, then using a tool that was built to support teaching online is probably going to turn out easiest in the long run. (And I don't believe there is anythign for Drupal that can do everything that Moodle's quiz module can do.) 7) The Moodle plugins directory clearly documents which add-ons work with with versions of Moodle. Of course, it takes time after a release like Moodle 2.5 for all add-on maintainers to test their plugins and update the database entry. Normally, plugins that works in Moodle 2.x just work in Moodle 2.x+1 without changes, but this needs to be tested. Sorry, I can't really help you with the other ones. I will just comment that one approach people sometimes take is to put another system in front of Moodle. For example, if you have complex payment requriements that you know how to implement in some other system, then you could use that other system as a front-end to your site. Users enrol and pay there, and then you use a single-sign-on system, and an enrolment plugin, so that when they click the link to their course, they end up in Moodle for the actual teaching and learning. Look up authentication and enrolment plugins in the docs.",

It's true you can mimic most of Moodle with Drupal, but at cost of using ton of modules (the first in my mind Organic groups, webform, some content access module, views, rules..) and personalisation.. let's say it's a ~2-3 years/man job of a proficient drupal developer. On the other hand, Moodle is a ready-to use solution BUT it doesn't have almost anything of user management other than the courses.. most (all?) large organisations that use Moodle they use it to deliver the courses but, for example, the enrolling of users to courses or the assignment of credits is done toward external back-office tools and then integrated in Moodle e.g. using LDAP . In your case, you can set paypal to pay for courses but you can't set it to pay for individual activities . So the best solution is to just use both: use the flexibility of Drupal to manage the users, if you need add a e-commerce store to deliver access to the courses rights, etc and then use Moodle to deliver the individual courses.",

          "Text": "Hi Antonello, Good points; a generic CMS like Wordpress, Joomla, or Drupal is going to take a tonne of work to make it anywhere near as useful as an LMS. Also think about much re-inventing the wheel you'd have to do. With a mature LMS, you've already thousands of users trying to do all kinds of different things with it and, with a good developer team and contributors, there's more likely to be some really coherent, practical, and useful features that you're unlikely to think of if you starting from a CMS and adapting it. That said, I've been playing around with a collaborative platform built on Drupal (cue jokes about Drupal's core code), called OpenAtrium: http://openatrium.com/#!/ Once you get used to the pretentious naming (e.g. pages are called \"spaces\") it has some interesting and potentially useful features for collaborative learning. I like the amount of autonomy and control you can hand over to participants to form groups, start their own projects, control access, keep track of what others are doing, etc. in particular.  Of course, it's not an LMS and not what most people have in mind when they think of online courses. However, if you want to do some strongly social constructivist oriented learning and teaching, I think it's certainly worth considering.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone... I am looking to hire a Moodle/Content Developer to assist us in a Moodle transition. Due to the fact that we currently have a LMS contract that I inherited from my predecessor that carries us through to end of 2010, this position will have the time necessary to create a one-of-a-kind and exciting Moodle offering that will support our company eLearning efforts. Truly carte blanche, but with plenty of internal resources to use to get the job done. When we have it set, we will end our relationship with our current LMS provider and move forward. In addition, this position will add creativity and excitement to existing eLearning content and manage it on our existing LMS and then on to Moodle. We use a combination of Articulate, Captivate, and PPT for these courses. Knowledge of these tools is less important than Moodle experience as they are pretty easy to learn. Ultimately, we are looking for a creative, unique, and enthusiastic individual who will do some 'fun' and cutting-edge work. Flash/HTML and/or any multimedia experience a plus. The company is a $100mil. corporation based out of Philadelphia, PA. We are open to making this a remote position for the right person. Person has to be US-based though. If anyone is interested or if anyone of you know a good place for me to turn to find this unique skillset, please let me know. If interested, reply to this message and I will send you the official job description. Tom",

The possibility of a marketable credential  -  A study group does not meet the requirements of accreditation boards as equally as a qualified instructor. Cost factors in remote learning -  with moodle/blackboard there is the possiblity of lowering already outrageous educational fees (i.e. gas, food, rent, books, etc) not sure if that helps to answer your question, peace and merry christmas",

I also stressed that the most important thing was that the technology was simply a means to the more important end-giving the students personalized instruction by a teacher. No self-teaching program can compete with that. As for teaching oneself German, I actually did pick up a German book and taught myself a little a year or so before I really started studying German with a teacher. I became very good at German because I had great teachers (it was at UC Berkeley, which has the best German program of any US univeristy). Unfortunately, I have had little use for it besides reading it and have lost most of my ability to speak. But I can definitely say that without a teacher I wouldn't have gotten as good as I did.",

If they prefer to teach themselves, to learn another language, not to learn any language at all... Well, we are okay with that, too.

If you live in the Seattle, WA area and can work with me in person from time to time, that would be a major plus. Please email me at foundationsproject@comcast.net Thanks Drue Larson",

If you are referring to the former I would think that using a discussion thread and attaching the aforementioned data set would do the trick. This would work as long as the discussion forum was set up so that everyone was subscribed by default. The course news forum may serve this purpose for you in this instance. If you are referring to the latter there are many ways to automate this task using macros built into email apps like Outlook, but in order to make any of this work you would have to first create a separate entry for each student in your contacts list in that email application.

A draft email saved without a recipient. With this you can then automate the process of sending the email with the use of VBA (for Outlook) or another scripting language for different email apps that allow command line calls and you should be all set. My VBA is extremely rusty but I know I've done things similar to this in other Microsoft apps and the code can be created by recording the initial macro and then modifying the code to increment attachment number and go to the next contact, etc. If this exists in Moodle somewhere I really hope somone else chimes in to give us a clue because I don't know of any feature in Moodle or any email application that will do this without significant setup on the end users part.",

I recommend starting slowly and being very practical. You may want to start by asking questions in the general forum about how to accomplish a particular task you want to do. Feel free to describe the task in the way that makes most sense to you and I am sure someone will have some ideas about how Moodle might be used to help. Keep in mind, Moodle is more than just software. It is a whole community of educators like yourself. The Lounge is usually a place for more social interactions and thus you may get a quicker response to particular questions in the Using Moodle forums.

If it's still misbehaving have a word with your IT department and ask them if there is a cache on the system and how often it should be checking for new versions of files. HTH Chris",

But I can get you started, then if you have further questions, go to \"Installation Problems\" forum to post them: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=28 Yes, you need to put Moodle on a server--your own server or a district server. Then you publicize the URL of that server so students anywhere can access the moodle site. If you just want to try out Moodle and learn how it works, go to \"Downloads\" in the top menu, and download the one-click version for your personal computer (No one can access it, but you can try it out). The 1.9.9+ version is the best for now. In a few months, you might try the 2.0 version of Moodle. For example, here is one-click version for a Mac computer . To add student names and emails, you will have to put them into an Excel spreadsheet and upload them into the enrollment section of Moodle. This starts getting technical so be sure to give yourself several hours the first time. Moodle Docs has full explanations of how to do this and how to install Moodle anywhere. Hope this helps,",

I was just curious about this cms because it was built on ruby and I had heard that because of this customizing of the code was very straightforward. I don't really know enough about this sort of thing to make a judgement myself, so I was just wondering if anybody had used this sort of thing. I am struggling to get my head around ruby on rails etc. and am basically trying to find out what it is all about. I like moodle a lot but I would also like a lead-in page that could be very easily edited, change, and customized, using graphics hot-spots etc. to lead to whichever point in the site the user is interested in. A sort of minimalist page that is very accessible, if you see what I mean. Sort of like the moodlerooms site (very nice design!) but with even less on it, and very little writing. And possibly with an api that interacts with another site on it. This may all sound a little confusing. Cheers, Jamie",

Would also be a great chance to see how an \"unconference\" works and to network with others. Please share with any others who may benefit .... the more the merrier. If someone can get this added to the conferences area of the moodle.org website that would be great (I couldn't post in that particular forum for some reason).

          "Text": "I would really appreciate any info people could give me on cheap/reliable web hosting. I've checked prices at Godaddy.com and they are too expensive for my needs. I just came back from Africa. During my stay there I met a number of people that I would like to help and having access to cheap and reliable web hosting would be essential. These are people who have just started with little businesses such as hostels or craft shops in areas that are not far from areas that foreign travelers visit but because they have not made it into travel guides and do not have web presence, they don't receive as many visitors as they might receive otherwise. I volunteered to create simple web pages for them and I'm even willing pay for the hosting for a while in some cases. I checked web hosting services such as Godaddy.com but I find them too expensive for what I need. In some cases these are people who are barely surviving with their businesses and $4 a month is quite a lot in a place where $120 a month is considered a pretty decent salary and very few can actually get jobs that would earn it. The web sites I want to put together with the pictures and info I collected are very simple and hence require very little space. Does anybody know of cheap (or free if possible) web hosting services that could help me with this initiative? Any advice, tips I should consider besides info on the hosting itself? Thanks a lot in advance. Josep M.",

Each business can indeed get Gmail accounts which is useful and negates any limitations on the number of e-mails offered by some hosting packages. Taking the idea a step further- is there an opportunity here for a type of co-op to develop? Customers of one client may be interested in the wares of others also? i.e. hostels and crafts- if a craft biz sells something thru the web.. could they recommend the hostel? Could the hostel recommend the local goods as souvenirs or to send home to friends/relatives? Could they get involved with the Fair Trade Movement? Having a Googlepages site (as Brian suggested) is an excellent idea- there are in fact NO adverising banners, the interface is quite simple so the clients may take over maintenance themselves... lastly even having a second site (i.e. googlepages) with the same businesses listed and links to the main site (if seperate) will help with getting listed in Google. Good luck. Seán.",

On this chapter, I run the Certified Integrations program, where we vet potential Moodle partners on the usability of their integration with us, on their business consistency and, if there is code, on the code quality. The result is a small set of tools that we have reviewed and labelled Certified Integrations: https://moodle.com/certified-integrations Obviously, Moodle is used together with both open source and commercial programs, so the program is happy to promote other open source tools, like BigBlueButton and Myddleware, but accepts commercial partners as well. My question would be the following: Which should be in your opinion the criteria of acceptance of products to the program? Should we limit tools, for example, produced by competitors? Should we ban the big names that tend to use their market position and have very aggressive user terms? Or should we stick to the code quality and leave other matters to you, users? In general, as this post bears as title, which should be the criteria of acceptability for Certified Intergrations? Thanks for your interest and insights, I'll love to read any comments on this. 🤓 Best, Carles",

At the moment I have 3 moodle sites on seperate sub domains for different clients, although they all look different - branded for the customer, the course content is the same in all three. Essentially I have a core set of courses that I sell to clients as an online learning portal branded with their corporate identity. I am wondering if it is possible to somehow get multiple moodles that use their own user tables and config details but all share the the same course data. I hope that is clear, I'm sure it is possible so the real question is how hard would it be to do. I'm thinking that if the database table names are stored in one place for moodle to read in to variables then I could change the appropriate names with no great trouble, but if the names are hard coded into the SQL statements then it would be a nightmare not worth pursueing. Any advice would be appreciated. Regards Brendan",

          "Text": "Hello Philip, Moodle is among the most popular of many learning management system (LMS) software. LMS doesn't necessarily mean distance learning, but it can lend itself very well to that. Anyone can use Moodle, but initially it's just an empty platform. In general, the school chooses a particular LMS and the teachers develop their course on this platform. Note that this involves a lot of work on the part of the school to manage the platform and a lot of work on the part of the teachers to develop their courses or even just a few activities on an LMS. This is a significant change for a school and its teachers. All students must have access to a computer and course activities must be redesigned to be done on the computer. That said, computer-based education and, to some extent, distance education seem to be the way of the future.",

When you want to play devil's advocate, logout and log back in as them.

With this in mind along with managin an online learning environment, at the same time, I also want to be able to manage offline resources, booking classrooms, allocating students and teachers to it, and so on. Also, is there an accountancy package that would allow me to track school running costs, student payments and payment of staff salaries? Any help greatly appreciated. Best regards Marco",

So it seems....it did make sense-the formula sounds like it will be (my interpretation): edx accomodates x & c MOOCs-(cMOOCs-developed by grads) so both will run under the one roof-interesting times. Sanders et al., (2014) 'A new approach to developing interactive software modules through graduate education' Journal of Science Education & Technology 23, 3, pp431-440. Abstract Educational technology has attained significant importance as a\nmechanism for supporting experiential learning of science concepts.\nHowever, the growth of this mechanism is limited by the significant time\nand technical expertise needed to develop such products, particularly\nin specialized fields of science. We sought to test whether interactive,\neducational, online software modules can be developed effectively by\nstudents as a curriculum component of an advanced science course. We\ndiscuss a set of 15 such modules developed by Harvard University\ngraduate students to demonstrate various concepts related to astronomy\nand physics. Their successful development of these modules demonstrates\nthat online software tools for education and outreach on specialized\ntopics can be produced while simultaneously fulfilling project-based\nlearning objectives. We describe a set of technologies suitable for\nmodule development and present in detail four examples of modules\ndeveloped by the students. We offer recommendations for incorporating\neducational software development within a graduate curriculum and\nconclude by discussing the relevance of this novel approach to new\nonline learning environments like edX.

I could not find this functionality till now. I think Moodle controls access based on users, not on courses. Which means that either a user can access all enrolled courses, or none of them.

It's very transparent-it gives you a lot of information about the people you can hire beforehand and it allows you to monitor their work through randomly taken screenshots of their computer to make sure that they are doing what they are supposed to be doing. For the people doing the work, it provides payment guarantee for hourly work, which is nice, because I have read on other sites often the users are often just looking to get someone from overseas to do work and then not pay them. There's no upfront registration fees-they just take 10% from the users on top of the rate set by the suppliers, which is quite reasonable considering the services and features they provide.

Some courses show they are done upto months later in this year but it still shows a red light. Some courses say valid to a few YEARS ahead but it still shows a red light  !!! Also some courses go from green to red but didn't go to Amber first. Some courses showed green light last week and now many have gone red. How can I get this rectified? Worst thing is that the moodle has a phone number but when you call it says it doesn't accept calls. There is an email but no-one replies. What is the point of even putting a telephone number or email there?",

First of all, just to point out that the Moodle site you are posting on here is the general site where people discuss and download Moodle , not the help desk specific to your own NHS Moodle site. Presumably the site is hosted by a company and you should have contact details for them? However, people are happy to offer free voluntary support in the Help forums.  Secondly,I am not aware of a green/amber/red light in standard Moodle, so you might have some customisation there - but let's see what light others can shed.",

Students can review a quiz immediately after taking it and are able to see scores, feedback, general feedback, etc; however, after that initial review, they can no longer access it. The \"Attempt #1\" text becomes black instead of blue, and does not allow access to the review page This is the case no matter what is checked in the \"Students May Review\" area in quiz settings. My thought is that there is something overriding these setting, making them null. This is true for quizzes made in the 1.6 version that were migrated and it is true for every new quiz that we create using our upgraded system.",

The second way to send email is to set up something like the quickmail block.  If you install it as is, I believe teachers can use it to send email to students.  If you add the recommended changes (search for quickmail and you will find the instructions in the discussions), you can make the block available for students as well.  Only students can't send attachments even though an instructor may do so. I am  not sure about your messaging problem.  If you log in as admin, there is a setting in the configuration files under \"permissions\" where you set messaging to yes or no.  Perhaps you have yours set to \"no\"? We chose to use messaging and the quickmail block.  Some instructors also use the forced subscribe forum for course announcements.  So you may wish to use a combination of tools. Remember, users who set their email to digest will not receive the messages immediately.  They will receive once each day, and as admin, you can set the time.",

They seem to have about 25 to 30 patents all in the online education field. The fact that two patent attorneys are allowed to start up this kind of company that seems to invite litigation, knowing that they have an advantage where fees are concerned as they are themselves patent attorneys, strikes me as a staggering conflict of interest. It is tantamount to extortion. However, in the US, the patent system is \"first to invent\", which means that the patent goes to the person who came up with the idea first, so if enough prior art can be turned up then it should be possible (troublesome, and expensive) to invalidate the patents. Personally speaking though, I do not think that patents that so obviously refer to software, no matter how heavily disguised, should ever be allowed.",

          "Text": "A very good afternoon to you all and thank you for all your interesting posts to date and the work you do to make Moodle the wonderful tool it is. I posted about this to the \"Forum\" forum but received only one reply. I apologize in advance for cross posting, but I wonder if anyone here might have ideas / comments on what I believe is a very important aspect of Moodle. I've had a look but couldn't seem to find anything. My question is: Is there a way to have the forum display changed? My students inevitably click the person's name who started the forum post - it's in the middle of the screen, and it kind of makes sense to click that. No matter how often I tell students, it is the one thing that continually sends students on the wrong path. They click the person's name, then try and send messages rather than post replies. This, to me, is a major design fault and I wonder is there any way I can change it. I know forum has been around for a long time. I've only had smaller classes in the past (have used Moodle since 1.2) but have always had troubles. I now have a course with over a thousand students from 6 different countries and we are having the same problem in all 6 countries so it doesn't seem to be limited to one culture (as I initially thought it might be.) I'd be very interested in others thoughts on this and if there is a way to change the layout. I wonder if others think the same way as I do regarding the design of the forum? Should I start a tracker item? Do others think it is a fundamental design flaw? My ideal forum interface would look something like this Your post (or something else, but not \"Discussion\") Follow button Group Replies Last post made by An example title (click anywhere in this section and it will take you to that forum discussion) started by Joe Bloggs on (date) (institution name here?) (NO link to student profile) Click here to follow this topic only 3 6 Marla Doe – see it here (clickable) Another cool title Started by Minnie Do on (date) (institution name here?) (no link to student profile) Following (eg only) 2 2 Joe Bloggs– see it here (clickable) Forum has been in Moodle from the beginning and it is a crucial part thereof but I really feel it, of all things, is in a dire need of a facelift. Would be interested in others' ideas. I have some money that I could put toward making this happen if a programmer is out there. I'd also love to have a report along the lines of a page that shows the following and can be separated into groups and be both course wide and per forum: Student name Country Number of posts (if possible, set dates here – between ~ & ~) Number of replies Total forum views Total number of words First post Last post Send reminder Link to complete report Joe Bloggs Japan 1 7 18 542 Oct 1 Nov 12 (click to send) link Marla Doe Colombia 2 8 21 625 Oct 1 Nov 14 (click to send) link Minnie Do Japan 1 1 8 35 Oct 10 Oct 27 Sent (date here) (click to resend) link Many thanks again to everyone that puts so much time into Moodle - wish I had the tools to do this myself!

Writing code to put IDs directly into the database is meddling with the difficult stuff, and will sentence you to continually retesting and maintaining security. Using one of the existing authentication options (see MoodleDocs ) is much less work and lower risk. It's much easier to reshape the Login page and to place it on a different website. There has been some discussion of this in this forum . Cheers Russell",

          "Text": "How much storage is enough... perhaps 10GB more than you are using at the time, and therein lies the problem. Before you can give an estimate you need to know what those 500 students are going to be doing. For example we recently had an assignment run with 500 students. It was a video assignment, they recorded a presentation and uploaded it to Moodle. That one assignment gobbled up 20Gb in a couple of days. The answer is not to try and guess a hard number but set up something which is flexible that allows you to expand over time in line with demand, but there is a cost associated with that too. As for \"the cloud\", there are plenty of people (Moodle Partners included) who will provide that for you, but keep in mind you can move to that kind of setup whenever you want, by that I mean you could migrate an internal Moodle site to external hosting if you needed to. I think a lot of Moodle hosts use services like Digitial Ocean or Rackspace. Rackspace are very good but also expensive. Digital Ocean seem pretty good but you have to do more yourself. Also consider how you are going to recover that space later on, i.e. auto clear down / delete courses. To get an idea of prices just ask a few Moodle Partners for quotes. When you do that it would be worth asking: What their policy is on adding plugins, some providers charge silly money to add new plugins. Whether your install is on its own code base or multi tenancy (multiple customers on one code base) The latter can be cheaper but may constrain you around plugins / themes, upgrades will be automatic but you may not always want to upgrade.... To give you an idea of prices there is a non Moodle Partner who provide 50Gb for 500 students for $125 per month fully managed using Multi Tenancy (less control over themes and plugins).",

WGET is a unix console command so it takes a little to understand\nall the options.\n\nI've entered the following commands in a notepad document: \n```text\n \nwget -o log.txt -np -m ftp://username:password@\nwww.olvrode.be/private/moodledata\n```\n and saved it with extension .cmd\n\nNow whenever I click on this file\nall the recently changed files are downloaded to my pc\nI believe it could work for you to if you just replace the location, username and password stuff.\n\nAnother thought: if you have shell access you could zip directories before downloading them.",

In order to understand the needs and desires of users as we make these improvements, we would like to invite you to a virtual chat about the plugin directory in the form of a workshop. The workshop will be held on 9 January 2023 at 19:00 UTC . Other workshops are being held in other time zones and languages as well to try to capture as much information as possible. We imagine that most of the attendees will be Moodle administrators or course creators, but everyone is welcome. The aim is to understand what you would like us to improve in the directory from the point of view of the user looking for and installing plugins. There will be other sessions dedicated to the plugin creators/ developers experience, at a later date.

While at school, I was moodle admin and webmaster and therefore did content as well as techie side, in a bigger institution such as the university I am now working at, those roles are split. There is a marketing/communications department who approve the look of the site in the first place and also approve that significant messages going out on the external website are all 'on message', and a slightly lesser degree of active interest in the intranet (more of an overview to ensure everything is ok, but they don't necessarily approve every single posting that goes up through the web-team) but they take very little notice of most of what goes on our moodle as that is entirely inward facing and the content is teaching and learning focussed. As the moodle developer, I am setting up the moodle 2 system that we are moving to and I anticipate having very little responsibility for the actual content on the front page once it goes live - beyond having constructed the theme and the look and feel of the page.

          "Text": "Kelsey, There is so much to Moodle that it can be ovewhelming. A simple process we learned to follow with our Moodle training is to teach teachers to first do only the basics with Moodle, such as upload course essentials, like syllabus, work, resources, etc. and try Moodle with traditional teaching in a \"blended\" model.  Some time later ( maybe weeks, or more) we introduce more interactive parts of Moodle such a discussions, glossary, quizzes, etc.  and let staff / students gradually utilize this functionality and make moodle more/more interactive.   This avoids overwhelming staff and students with too much functionality and avoids un-realisitc expectations and even burnout from trying to do too much too soon.   \"less\" is often \"more\" valuable when exploring a tool as rich as Moodle.  Hope I didn't mis-interpret your question.

Instead use your browser to visit directly http://(domainname or localhost)/(moodle root)/admin/ck-admin/index.php - Complete the Test Environment installation as described in Step 10 to step 16 The added steps are to make use of the newly added 'role' feature to ensure only administrative staff (ie excluding teachers and students) is able to access the embedded CK-ERP application.

This feature could be linked to the Moodle help pop-up boxes that produce boxes with the current theme.  It would be interesting to know if someone has already done this, or feels the need for such a feature. brgds Paul",

They use Blackboard, but I am using Moodle for special needs students for my capstone project. So . . . I'm turning to my fellow K-12 Moodlers for help! So is anybody out there, with all the free time they have as educators, willing to answer some questions for me? I have been using Moodle for almost eight years. Let me know by reply, as I need to have this done in the next week and a half. Here are some of the questions I would ask: 1. How long has your online program used Moodle, did you switch from another CMS? If so, why did you switch to Moodle? 2. Is your program a major transfer of classes from facd-to-face to online? If so, how did you train traditional classroom teachers to transfer their classes to online. 3. Do you have official professional development courses to train teachers on how to use Moodle, transfer courses, give tech support? If so, do you hold face-to-face workshops or do you use Moodle? 4. What kind of tech support is available at your institution? In your opinion, is it effective for the teachers? For the students? 5. How involved are your parents involved in your online learning program? Do you have parent accounts? 6. How do you ensure that your courses are as accessible as possible for disabled students? Do you follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)? 7. How do you host your online program? If hosted locally, do you have proper server space, memory, and broadband access for your online program? Who is in charge of the server? 8. How do you assess the effectiveness of a particular course? The entire program? 9. What is the workload of an online instructor vs. a traditional face-to-face instructor? Do they receive more or less compensation? Is tenure affected by whether an instructor teaches online or not? 10. Do you have a blended or online only program? 11. Are your courses using media-rich content? If not, why? If so, do you have problems with compatibility? 12. Do you integrate third party Web 2.0 tools in your program? If not, why? 13. Who owns the course content in your program, the institution or the instructor? 14. How does your institution monitor fair-use, plagiarism and copyright infringement. 15. What provisions/accommodations do you make for LD students? Sincerely, Jamey Barber jbarbercsueb@gmail.com",

So I recommend rephrasing it to: 13. Who owns the course content in your program, the institution, the instructor, a publisher, or the public as open content? Incidentally, I recommend that all institutions build policies and contracts that state all content created by staff is created for the general public and is owned by the public. As more people share Moodle courses via many Moodle Hubs (ver 2.0), this will be an important policy.",

I'm hoping to do a few days Skiing at Glencoe the preceding weekend, so will have my car with me. Who else is going? Really pleased to see that the change in location to Glasgow has also resulted in a drop in the ticket price and my hotel is cheaper. I'm also happy to see that we're university based this year. I much prefer that to the soulless conference centre/hotel used for the London events. I'm hoping this means a return to lecture hall tiered seating for the conference sessions, which is so much better than the \"dining room\" arrangement. Note to the organisers (Gavin etc), the huge (2.7MB) image of Strathclyde Uni on the booking page means that (a) When you PDF the booking page the PDF is very large and (b) when you click through each page of the booking process you get landed on the image with nothing else visible, so you have to scroll right down a lot to get to the actual form you need to deal with. One request for 2019! Can you please try and get the dates confirmed much earlier, March/April is a really busy period for me and while MoodleMoot is normally the week before Easter, that hasn't always been the case and there are other things going on around then which I would like to do, but can't commit to until the MoodleMoot dates are out. Unfortunately, the announcement usually comes too late, so I miss out on other activities . I appreciate that there is a lot to organise, but as a committee member for another large software conference, we usually managed to confirm a lot further in advance, one year we managed 12 months notice!",

I run a Moodle with 4-5000 FE & HE students across a wide curriculum of subjects. I have quite modest support requests from staff but then our Moodle has been allowed to languish for several years and expectations here could be higher. If you already feel comfortable with running a course, pure front end admin is actually quite easy and should feel familiar after you've oriented yourself but you will still need back end technical support and at least someone who can lead you if you feel out of your depth - these forums are very useful for those times. Unless you already have the skill set, you will need someone to handle the backend stuff for you. After 2 years of doing this I still need that technical back up myself. Most of the problems we have as an institution are not with Moodle but with the supporting infrastructure. I'd recommend starting by asking for an admin account from your host and familiarise yourself with the new menus and options it gives you. Hope that helps, Sam.",

If you are not familiar with Linux, I would not go this route.   i cannot say anything about the Windows version, since I am not familiar with it. If you are, setup a test server while you still have the hosted version, so you can see the \"inner workings\" To this day I have our working Moodle server, a test server with the same version I run on the working, and another test server with the latest version of Moodle.  I do not upgrade until I am comfortable with the latest version, and I know it is functioning.

If so, admin is not too bad as long as you stay away from some of the server settings, and in later versions of Moodle dont go installing / upgrading random plugins you have not tested before hand. The best approach is probably to take it a step at a time, ask for access if you dont have it and try to deal with some of the issues that arise. Another option would be to get some cheap hosting with a \"one click install\" of Moodle where you can experiment without making a mess of your production system!",

          "Text": "Maybe not jobs per se, but definitely tasks like writing essays. Now that ETS, Pearson Education, and McGraw Hill (as well as others) are using computer essay grading, students can now get robots to write their essays for them because the graders can't tell the difference. Here's an example: \"Machine rifle on lassitude has not, and in all likelihood never will be rivetingly vying. Human life will always lament automatic; many of the insinuation but a few on admonishments. a pugnaciously but perilously banal scaling lies in the search for semiotics and the realm of theory of knowledge. Consequently, scaling should engender none of the agriculturalists. As I have learned in my reality class, grading is the most fundamental speculation of humanity. Though a pendulum produces neurons by scrutinizations, the same brain may counteract two different plasmas. The plasma emits gamma rays with hagiolatry to spin. Simulation at a administration is not the only thing interference for augmentation spins; it also reacts of automatic. The less those in question belie the allegation but disrupt interlopers, the sooner a countless respondum voyages. Essay which mesmerizes cornucopia and is petite, furtive, and laudatory changes a lack of automatic. According to professor of philosophy Eli Whitney, mankind will always disseminate machine rifle. Despite the fact that the same orbital may process two different neurons, the same plasma may catalyze two different neutrinoes. The pendulum counteracts gravity to receive brains to provision. Simulation for speculations is not the only thing a neuron inverts; it also transmits plasmas on automatic. The sooner conveyances accede, the more the dictate by the inquisition should excessively be incarceration that can elatedly be a account. By enlightening a sanction that belittles propagandists, the enormously convulsive grading can be more inflexibly incensed. As I have learned in my semiotics class, human society will always rationalize grading. Although a pendulum oscillates, the same gamma ray may catalyze two different neutrinoes. Information at virtuous analyses process orbitals of diagnoses with patter to counteract brains. The neuron is not the only thing radiation to an authorization implodes; it also produces the pendulum on automatic rifle. From infusing, many of the accessions bluster as well by essay. Substantiation for grading changes the enormous grading. Automatic will always be a component of mankind. Nonetheless, armed with the knowledge that the certainly reproving mendicant might timidly be expressiveness, none of the convulsions by my atelier solicit concurrences. If aggregations which regret congregations preach performances for a query, a plethora of machine rifle can be more pusillanimously civilized. Grading of injunctions will always be a component of human life. Essay is substantiated because of its prototypical confluences.\" You can generate your own from 3 keywords here: http://babel-generator.herokuapp.com/ courtesy of the fine work of Les Perelman et al.

The whole idea is to find bands/artists that are willing to do famous song covers but also to perform original songs that they've written. There will be at least 6 bands/artists involved who will be performing a mix of these songs. The genre of the music isn't essential but should be already playing in gigs and pubs already. New talent can be involved but would prefer someone who has a following already. There will be a mashup of 2 bands who will perform the cover song together so a constant rehearse and meet up of all the bands is necessary. There will be a battle of the bands competitions consisting of 3 rounds (6 bands to start – all pair in 3 in the first round) , 2nd round(4  bands go through out of the 3 pairs) 3rd round (2 bands) then last round is the winner where they get to play original music. I am specifically looking for artists who able to do cover songs but have the opportunity to sing their own music. If interested please email me on yohanns3456@hotmail.co.uk thank you",

With Moodle 2.0, we got activity and course completion.  And they rock.  My (work) life is so much simpler now (and by simpler, I mean my external reports no longer take hours to run and my core-hack student transcript that took 15 minutes per student is no longer necessary). But here's my question...why don't we have a forum to specifically post questions about course completion and activity completion?  Okay, so activity completion could be covered by the specific activity...but course completion questions don't really fit anywhere.  Courses and course formats doesn't seem to be right place.  Maybe I'm the only one with questions/concerns?",

          "Text": "Matthew, We've had a Moodle install at Rackspacecloud.com for a while and I tried Turnkeylinux.org.  Rackspace is flexible and not that expensive (I believe a virtual server with 256 ram starts at around 10 dollars a month); the benefit is that it's very scalable (resizing servers takes just a few minutes).  A downside is you'll need significantly more server side expertise (which my partner handled). For Turnkey (which uses Amazon's web services and storage) it was about 30 dollars a month minimum for service (but it's also scalable; setup was very easy with the Turnkeylinux tutorials provided). Personally I'm using Bluehost.com which is around 80 dollars a year (but you can have unlimited domains and it's all cPanel setup).  I'm pretty satisfied with my service for a Wordpress blog , I also have a Moodle setup, but it's not receiving any traffic (it's demo purposes only).  But the blog receives about 1000 visits a day and load times seem to be good. Best of luck...let us know which way you go with the hosting.",

          "Text": "Hi Moodle gurus, We at Kenfuse.com are looking to set up compelling courseware for tech students following MIT's opencourseware guidelines. PHP application development of course is one of the key topics. You can find some details at http://www.kenfuse.com/course/php-programming-101 Our focus is to organize a good set of courseware that can be used across universities and hence this note to this forum of Moodle stars. The idea is to first introduce PHP programming and then run students through some popular PHP based applications such that students get a first hand feel of real apps besides picking up skills on design, coding style, organization and eventually pick projects to develop some handson skills. To kick start the process, we are planning to have a session material on moodle as well. Looking for advice on content and resources particularly on the session moodle development and more than welcome thoughts / suggestions on others. Here is a quick link to the first session on the topic \"Essential PHP\" http://www.kenfuse.com/content/essential-php . This is just a reference . Also would be interested in if the moodle community has project ideas that can be offered to students the coming session. These are going to be administered by faculty and therefore would have serious participants only Thanks in advance - Sandy",

They've been trying to make a decision about an LMS for some time... any how, things like BigBlueButton and Openmeeting are standard plugins with Moodle 2.1.2 (many more plugins std). The catch is, you must point to the server where BBB and/or OM are installed or located. Recap, plugins already installed to enable Moodle functionality-- vendor opensource software (both BBB and OM opensource) installed and pointed to (on plugin settings in Moodle). I'm in Malaysia on +8 timezone but could arrange a demo; I believe you can go to bigbluebutton.org and see/use the demo from there. BBB is awesome with it's presentation view, whiteboard, chat (all & private), video sharing and conference/listen (VOIP); the VOIP I believe is a Freeswitch technology and requires some thinking/server to dial in and have a ID, etc. There appears to be little \"overhead\"; I did a demo using a Celcom Broadband and the other guy Streamyx and it worked fine! Openmeeting is BBB on steroids (16, 50, 150 people modes) for conferences, meetings and webinars... Hope this helps?",

I currently attend a Meetup organized webmaster group and always learn something new. I could never find a Moodle meetup group on Meetup.com; therefore, I was considering sponsoring a meetup. While looking over the new group setup form I noticed that Moodle is not an available topic. I find this odd due to the huge Moodle user base. Do you guys think that Meetup.com organized local Moodle meetings would be something worth pursuing. I don't see why it wouldn't work, as long as there is a significant local user base. I think we need to start by getting Meetup.com to add Moodle as an available topic. I could pursue this but Moodle Headquarters may yield more clout than I do. Once they are aware of the popularity of Moodle I suspect this would be a \"no-brainer\". What do you guys think?",

Over the last several years, when I checked the event calendar I have never seen any Moodle event of any kind within 3,000 miles of me. I have found Meetup.com to be very effective at organizing small local meetings. While using the Moodle site to promote small local Moodle meetings is \"singing to the choir\" promoting a meeting with Meetup.com would expose Moodle to many others that never heard of it. You do have a point about using existing Moodle resources. The more I think about it, maybe the best solution would be to use and possibly integrate both. Maybe Meetup.com could set up an RSS feed so that every Moodle meetup organized with Meetup.com could be displayed in the events area automatically. I think leveraging the strengths of both resources might be a powerful combination.",

I’ve just finished creating www.JogLab.com , a completely free web-based teaching and learning tool that makes remembering stuff quick, simple and fun ( quick video tutorial on main page ). I’d LOVE any advice/ volunteers to help spread the word about this tool; JogLab needs thousands of daily ‘hits’ to cover running costs but I believe many learners/ teachers will find it useful once they know of its existence. I don’t have a great deal of time so I’d be really grateful for any advice or help you might give on any aspect of JogLab/ promotion suggestions etc. These are my ideas so far: · Emailing teachers and asking them to forward a poster (this one: http://www.joglab.com/resources/JogYourMemory.RememberEverything.JogLab.doc ) to their learning/ teaching contacts. Are there any email lists that are appropriate? · Asking teachers who like JogLab to post a link to JogLab on newsgroups they use ( on site functionality exists to do this on Facebook etc.) · Asking all educators/ learners to give feedback, propose areas of collaboration, contacts or ideas for promotion ( danTHECAT@joglab.com (put THECAT out)). · Asking (and please consider this an ask!) for volunteers (special skill or time) to help spread the word or help out (please email volunteersTHECAT@joglab.com (put THECAT out)) Hopefully JogLab.com will have a lasting impact for many types of learner and make teaching even more fun. Please email me if you can be of any help or would like a colour printed poster sent to you or are interested in a JogLab t-shirt. Any constructive comments/ support/ help very gratefully received.

I am wondering which forum is best to discuss this as I think it is probably something needed by many higher education institutes and it might be that a tool could be developed to assist with the proccess of moderation of exams. If we can get a discussion going, then we might be able to scope what is required. The request seems to be that for pre-exam moderation you need to export a view of the quiz that shows all the questions with the right and wrong answers, as well as all the feedback and score related to each question. For post-exam moderation there needs to be a way to pick out three participants results (top, middle, bottom) and export them to give to the moderator. It might be that the best export method is to .pdf into pre-exam moderation file and a post-exam moderation file. Is anyone else interested in a tool like this? What would be important to your learning institute? I have discussed with someone from another institute, they call the \"moderator\" the \"examiner\" so the terms might need some further thought. Also she suggests it would be good for the person receiving the file to be able to pretend to take the exam so they see it as the student would (particularly if questions and/or answers are randomised). Looking forward to hearing from others.",

At least Apple no longer requires third-party browsers to use a slower engine than the one used by its own Safari, something it did until iOS 8.

I have tried a few questions in the regular Moodle quiz bank, but it's not quite enough, I'm not sure the best way to set it up.  Plus I'm not sure I am even clear what I want. Maybe this:  38 themes.  Serve up 15 questions each evening on the themes, on 15 themes, not random, but in a specified order.  When they student gets a question in each theme right 3X, that theme is checked off for (say) 5 days before being reintroduced. -Derek",

The way I envisioned implementing this in Moodle is to put my questions into cateogries \" Lesson 1\", \"Lesson 2\", etc.  Then use the review quiz plugin (don't remember the exact name) to create all encompassing quizzes for review. I was also going to have 20 question quizzes.  10 would be new material.  5 from the last 5 lessons, and the last 5 from any lesson before that.  I have not tried to setup a quiz yet, but from what I have read, the add random functionality that is build into the Moodle core can handle it. I also think that as a person works with Moodle their question bank will be better at handling incorporating previous material into new questions.  Although, I am thinking in terms of reading lessons, listening skills, and foreign language. Also, from what I read about the Pimsleur method, spaced repetition is not based on if the student gets a certain answer correct or incorrect.  It is based on introducing a topic, reviewing it 5 minutes later.  Reviewing it an hour later, review it the next day, reviewing it in 3 days, reviewing it the next week, reviewing it in 2 weeks, reviewing it the next month, randomly throwing the material in. The whole point is to increase the number of times  that a student is exposed to a certain word.  At first it will be \"that sounds familiar\", then it is more recognition, until finally it is truly knowing the word that it is a part of the student.  For some student that can happen in 5 exposures to the word, while for other students they may need 40 exposures to the word.

If you have any idea about 'new' (post 2004) E-Learning technologies that could be implemented in these three existing areas, could you let us know?

I am also collecting the remainder of the slides and URLs used in the presentations. I will edit the audio (not for content...but to cut out the part where the speaker is giving their presentation, and to mix together the audio that featured more than one speaker) and convert them MP3 over the next week. During that time I will convert the slides to PDF. The finished files will be compiled and hosted on our site when they are ready. I will send out an email message to all of the attendees with a link, as well as post a message to the Moodle Moot Albuquerque forum , the general forum and anywhere else someone requests that I post the link. I recently posted a very similar message to the Moodle Moot Albuquerque Discussion forum, and thought that this would be useful to be posted here. I apologize to those who are enrol(l)ed to both forums. Thanks again to everyone, I will post the finished files as soon as they are ready. jon",

          "Text": "Hi Andrea, Greetings from Spain! Short answer: Yes. Moodle has online payment integration built in & there are also additional 3rd party payment integration plugins: https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=payment For self-study language learning activities , I recommend exploring the Quiz module: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_activity & H5P module: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/H5P_activity I use both because each has its advantages & disadvantages according to what I want to achieve. For additional, asynchronous communicative activities between students &/or teacher & students, the forum module is very useful & flexible: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Forum_activity It works particularly well for anytime, anywhere, spontaneous communicative activities when students use the free Moodle mobile app: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Moodle_app It's a bit like having Facebook discussions on your phone but without all that bad stuff that using Facebook entails. In my opinion, 6 is a reasonable size for online synchronous video conferencing (Moodle has a wide range of integrations for video conferencing services: https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=conferencing & now has the BigBlueButton plugin included as standard) but for asynchronous communicative activities, I recommend larger cohorts within each course, e.g. ~30, so that there are more potential respondents to discussions at any one time & so discussions feel more responsive & therefore motivating to the students (forum discussions are a good strategy for increasing student engagement & reducing drop-out rates). It's also often the case that it's difficult to schedule lesson times to suit everyone all the time in small groups & so having larger cohorts gives greater flexibility for accommodating everyone's schedules, i.e. there's always a choice of times.",

I suppose the real question is - is there a purest camp that sticks with moodle and nothing else, and a camp that use anything (and everything) ? Personally I like using hotpots as their construction can be very fast (compared to creating a quiz in moodle) The downside being that they do look like they have been \"bolted on\" to the course and are not fully integrated (still working on merging all of my style sheets etc to minimize this) The reason I ask is that some of the teachers I converse with prefer not to use hotpots (purely for the aesthetic reasons), and others do jump on board and ask me to show them how to use them.",

I use Moodle for grading, email-communication with students, discussion forums and for posting assignments. But I do pop out to more powerful Content Management System for page editing and publishing when ever possible. Moodle's page editing features aren't so bad per se. But Moodle's page-to-page navigation is a bit too spartan for me. I like what I get with various other content management systems a lot better. The trick is to hack the CMS so it saves the return address of the Moodle page you jumped away from, so the CMS reader can click back to the right spot in Moodle at any time. Most open source CMS systems can be hacked to work that way, one way or another. It's too bad it takes developer's skills to make that work, because CMS integration is a useful thing. I thought I saw a Drupal plugin for Moodle once. Might have to give that a try at some point.",

          "Text": "Hi Ossie, I have what I call MoodleChris at home and MoodleWork at work which are sandbox or standalone moodles  on  desktop machines.   Sandboxes are absolutely the way to learn in my opinion.   The initially installs I did back in Jan 06 were pretty simple on my Window XP professional OS. My first suggestion is to start really digging to the various forums and documations available here.   After 4 months, I am still rediscovering what is going on in each of the forums as my personal experience with Moodle grows.  Some of our volunteer experts don't look at this social forum, but stick to their speciality. Here is some more about me and my sandboxes.  The only way I can use the production Moodle is via the web.  I think that is running on Red Hat.  I have figured out how to download backup course files from there to my desktop, go into moodle and \" upload \" them into MoodleChris, then restore.   I played around with back and restore options on MoodleChris before attempting this.   Now I build courses on MoodleChris, do a backup, \"download\" that backup to my desktop, then get on the internet and upload the file to the production moodle and restore.  Piece of cake. Even figured out what kind of backup I need to do, to minimize the file size, yet achieve the results I want when I do a restore.   Remember that I am building course lessons  and doing quality control on existing course lessons.  I play with other activities in my sandboxes.   However, I can download an entire course with all the files and check it out on my MoodleChris or MoodleWork. Enjoy. Chris",

          "Text": "We would like to take this opportunity to inform our fellow Moodlers about our new public online course in Emotional Intelligence training. This course (of course) runs on Moodle. This course has now been under development since July 2004. Our selection of Moodle as the LMS for all our courses has turned out to be a huge bonus to the project. While this is a commercial project we are doing it more from our hearts than from any financial incentive. We hope however that the project will at least pay its own way. We have managed to integrate Moodle as our e-campus into a conventional HTML web site, near seamlessly and with very few problems. At this stage we are using 100% standard Moodle but the plan is to customise certain parts of the program to better suit our needs. We are therefore hoping to be able to offer some code snippets and maybe even some complete modules back to the Moodle community . Since Dan Golemans best selling book on Emotional Intelligence appeared about 10 years ago, the subject has intrigued and frustrated people. Most of the frustration results from the lack of any reliable method for developing Emotional Intelligence. We believe our training courses will address this issue. Also, as far as we are aware, we are the first to ever attempt this type of practical training on line. Our first course will be available from Wed 16 th March and other more advanced courses will be available latter in 2005. We are probably biased but we happen to think that our Introduction To Emotional Intelligence training course at $69.00 USD is very good value for money. The site address is www.fifthstate.com",

You probably want more than that, so you may be interested that we addressed this issue at the Australia Moodle Gathering.  Martin presented modules coming up for 1.5 and later that would show progress towards goals by student.  We also pondered individualized goals, negotiated goals, and learner contracts.  In a demonstration on open source tools, I saw CMAP, concept mapping software, which works like Inspiration, making conceptual drawings.  I want to use that to draw visual maps of the lesson process I use in Moodle--combining classroom and online activities .  This might be the kind of metadata that we attach to courses to help allow transfer and exchange with other teachers.",

You could upload into site files (it would have to be site files so everyone could see them) your course policy document and at the end of this document you could include the enrolment key for that particular course. Then in the description of the course in course administration>settings you can upload and display the course policy as a link using the hyperlink icon. People would have to open and read it in order to get the enrolment key to enter the course and in so doing would be agreeing to the policy. Well it is just an idea.",

          "Title": "Unique way to help Hurricane Katrina victims",
          "Text": "I wanted to come up with a way to personally reach out and touch the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  My solution:  get as many people as possible to write personal but anonymous letters of encouragement and support to give to those in shelters.  Many tens of thousands are housed within 200 miles of my home. The result: www.letterofhope.com .  The site has a pdf file containing everything you need to write a letter, send it to \"Letter of Hope,\" and, hopefully get a personal reply from the storm victim who receives it.  I can produce a group package with an organization's name and city on the letterhead. Within 3 days of operation, I have received commitments for over 2,000 letters from individuals, companies, churches, and schools.  I have also received commitments from social and religious organizations to deliver letters that will cover over 38,000 evacuees. I need the MOODLE community's help.  Please consider writing a \"Letter of Hope.\"  If you represent a business, school, church, social club or other organization, go to \"How Can I Help!\" on the main menu to see how to request a customized group package.  Also, please email everyone you know and tell them about this project.  \"Word of email\" is the best and most effective way for me to get the word out. MOODLErs in outside the US can participate!  I have a physician in London who is organizing a letter writing campaign! Thank you for anything that you can do to assist these people who have lost so much. Please feel free to contact me either by replying to this post, or by email:  help@letterofhope.com.",

The save button would bring me to a page where I could create a new category or save it in an old category. Let's say I'm mainly interested in two forums or just a couple of threads, I could re-create those and save it in the appropriate one. The Forums are awfully big and having some way to \"edit\" them individually seems like a good idea. Having the messages come to you as e-mails (in order to save them) is possible but a little overwhelming -- I've tried it. Also, we can make these personal forums public, so that if I know someone is interested in flash, for example, and I haven't been following the forums for awhile, I might check to see what he has collected. Perhaps we could also great smaller, more intimate groups. Got the idea from photo sites that let you create your own album. You spend a lot of time looking for the right picture but you are not ready to buy, so you save the picture (just the link obviously) in your own album for future reference. An idea?",

          "Text": "The pragmatist in me suggests that your browser bookmarks/favourites are probably the best way to achieve this for your own use. Simply bookmark the forum, discussion or post with a brief note about why you think it's important and you should be able to retrieve it later with no trouble at all (the better your browser the easier this will be). The techn-utopian in me thinks that some folksonomic categorisation / shared bookmarks tagging system built into the Moodle forums would be ideal for this kind of task. However most Moodle sites are not as public or as well trafficed as Moodle.org so the benefit of adding this functionality would probably be limited for most Moodle users. However, combining these thoughts, and remembering that Moodle.org is available on the open web, I'm wondering how succesful it would be to link to various specific posts via del.icio.us, furl or some other social bookmarking tool that allows tagging of URLs (which is what basically everything in Moodle.org is when you get right down to it). The new Technorati redisign lists lots of stuff for the tag:moodle including moodle photos from Flickr and moodle links from furl , and from delicous So hooking up with some external service and allowing people to use that system to categorise, rate and link the contents of Moodle.org would seem to be a way forward.",

I was thinking of the benefits of having a large group of people organizing the information on the forums in different or individual ways. On this photo site I really like seeing how others have thought of using the same photos, or when you find someone that likes the same things you do, you check in to see what they have added recently. Wouldn't it be fairly easy to add a \"save\" button and then a choice as to where to save? What might be difficult is what to do next. These \"groupings\" shouldn't be administered and they would have to kept separate from the established groups. How would they be organized, listed, and made available to everyone?

I changed institution about 18 months ago from one where we were using Moodle widely. I now have a situation where our learning architect and I think Moodle would have really great application, working as an LXP in a wider learning infrastructure, but are facing resistance from a higher level (possibly due to a negative past experience with a badly-built Moodle instance). Can anyone recommend any really great public-facing Moodle sites? Ideally ones that don't actually look like out-of-the-box Moodle, but it doesn't really matter. I just want to be able to pass some best-practice examples to the relevant people, to show what it's capable of. Thanks! Fran",

It is still far too early in the learning analytics technology (hype?) cycle for there to be any published standards for how LMSs should expose data. In about 5 years time (if learning analytics takes off) then there will be such a thing and the question will be easy to answer. Until then, we are stuck with ad-hoc solutions. At the lowest level, Moodle tracks excellent, high-quality data about what users are doing in the database . That is mainly in the mdl_log table, but the gradebook and activity and course completion tables are also excellent sources of data. The Moodle database is not very complex, and if you are a developer, it is really quite easy to pull the required data out. And Moodle now has many hooks (web-services, course and admin reports) where you can expose that data in whatever form you want. You can also just let your learning analytics program pull data directly from (a mirror of) the Moodle DB. At this early stage in the learning anlytics came, that is probably as good as you are going to get.",

These 2GB email accounts are powered by Google. I had signed up with Google for their offering of hosted email for domains and now am able to offer a limited number of accounts to any moodler that may be interested. The email interface is very similar to Google's regular GMail web pages and has GMAIL features like Chat and searching. You can also access your moodler.com email through email clients like Outlook. Your email address would be chosen_name@moodler.com . There is no commercial intent, by me, with this offering. Like GMail, Google does place some text ads on the web interface of your email web pages. I do not receive any revenue whatsoever even if you happen to click any of the Google text ads. This is how Google is able to offer this free service to domains. I hope that this can be a fun tool for those that sign up. I currently have a limited amount of available slots, as determined by Google, so please limit your requests to one account. To sign up, please go to: http://moodler.com . Thanks. Rich",

These tend to use a program called \"knowledge forum\" rather than moodle, but their conclusions about collaborative learning, student to student (vs. student to teacher) communication, and treating knowledge as something that can be stored outside ourselves and collectively advanced is compelling.",

There's also the issue of creating courses on the fly so that the courses are created and can then be associated with users after logging in. I know from reading the documentation that the file is a comma separated file with four fields per line: * operation, role, idnumber(user), idnumber(course) where: * operation = add or del * role = student, teacher, or teacheredit * idnumber(user) = idnumber in the user table",

          "Text": "I've been working at introducing e-portfolio to our Key Stage 3\nstudents, and am now taking in only work handed in through our Moodle\nfrom these pupils. The rationale for not doing this with KS4 is that they are taking the\nApplied GCSE course, so their evidence still needs to printed, fairly\nobvious... Anyway, e-portfolio through Moodle or other online CMS or V/MLE for me has several advantages: 1.  Reduction in printing costs 2.  A reduction in working time for teacher when marking.  I'm much more efficient working onscreen than with bundles of paper. 3.  Integration with other methods of communication.  Our kids now\ncommunicate via text, chat room and message board as much as they do in\nany other fashion.  It makes sense for work (not just ICT work) to be\nsubmitted and edited in the same fashion. 4.  Ease of storage and retrieval for the student.  Granted there are\nlimitations in terms of learning where file and folder structure is\nconcerned to a degree if the students work mainly through the Journal\n(now assignment in 1.5) system as my pupils do, but it saves valuable\ntime for less able students when the teacher knows exactly where to find the previous lesson 's work for continuation. 5.  As above, ease of access to work in progress for the teacher. 6.  Access to work and lesson content from home. 7.  Easy moderation for the department, without the need for face-to-face meeting time.",

          "Text": "Last year I set up a moodle course for OCR ICT GCSE that led pupils through their coursework by setting assignments, with deadlines.  OK, it wasn't perfect and was still a \"work in progress\" when I moved on from the school (who promptly closed down the web presence anyway when I left - duh) but the intention was to be able to produce a progression through the coursework, with evidence, that could then be used for moderation.  There was still work to do on aligning the mark scheme fully, and on the pupils producing their final reports but the facility to provide feedback via the markbook and through other means was invaluable in getting pupils to revisit work and amend it.  The pupils appreciated it too - as with everything we did with moodle, I was always pleasantly surprised to see how positively learners responded if they were given the chance to do so, and it appeared that a few words in their markbook had more impact than actually speaking to them in class (and it's so much more efficient to look at their work the night before and comment on it so that they can start work next lesson straight away - think of the example of a waste of productive time in class where they sit with their hand up for 10 mins while I work my way around solving individual problems). As David states, the advantages of Moodle are obvious and my favourites are: files are backed up off-site as well as on-site; files are available anywhere, anytime (to coin a phrase); progression through the work is obvious and is backed up by entries in the journal and in other places such as dialogue, chat, forum discussions; a Dialogue module allows pupils to ask for specific help; moderators can be given a teacher password to access the course thus saving time, postage etc. OCR seemed quite interested in moderating in this way and I gave them access to the site, even though it was still only a \"work in progress\" (I'd resurrected it from a backup - the school had killed the site, remember?).  One moderator absolutely loved the principle and could see how its value if it had been completed, while another liked it but failed to grasp the potential of what was essentially an incomplete offering. Used in the right way, and bearing in mind that the moderator is unlikely to be familiar with the system and has associated needs that should be accommodated through a set of instructions or an appropriately-constructed course, my experience is that it is entirely possible to use Moodle to complete and submit coursework. <musing>Surely  it is only a small step to create  e-portfolios after this?  Could it be made possible for the pupil to search the database for all the work they've ever done on the site and back it up to a zipfile or whatever?",

          "Title": "Response to \"Research on Ecstasy Clouded by Errors\" by Belladonna Dioszegi",
          "Text": "Response by Belladonna Dioszegi on \"Research on Ecstasy is Clouded by Errors\" by Donald G. McNeil Jr. New York Times writer Donald G. McNeil responds to Dr. Ricaurte 's scientific studies on Ecstasy. According to Mr. McNeil's sources, these studies were highly inadequate and inaccurate, where a particular study was even retracted due to a mix up in labels. Many of Dr Ricaurte's mentors, fellow scientists, and examinees are quoted throughout the article, all admitting Dr. Ricaurte's methods and results to be not quite up to par. From postcards showing holes in brains of excessive users to claiming Ecstasy causes the tremors of Parkinsonism, Dr. Ricaurte is proven wrong on every front. The very first paragraph draws the readers in by identifying a well known, costly study preformed on primates to be completely invalid, stating the labels on methamphetamines and Ecstasy were mixed up. “What a comical mistake”, I thought, and continued reading. Mr. McNeil backs up his first statement by proceeding to give examples of other work the Dr. has published and the comments of other professionals and scientists familiar with Ricaurte. All of which either make claims against the Dr.'s results or his sloppy methods. It would seem that everything Dr. Ricaurte has done or said is in some way comical and hard to take seriously. The article concludes with a study on two male patients who took a large amount of Ecstasy, among other drugs. The patients stated they were jet lagged and sedated as the tests were preformed, and that it was a biased exam that seemed bent on proving they had some sort of brain damage. Despite the 4 years of heavy drug use, one man is a graduate in Chemistry at “a leading university”, and the other works at a law firm and “is in line for a federal job”. With not a single sense of praise or credibility included, I am left to wonder how a man supposedly so incompetent could be taken seriously; or is this portrayal of Dr. Ricaurte unfair and more belittling than he deserves? Based on my own lack of knowledge on Dr. Ricaurte, and Mr. McNeil's known credibility, I am immediately enticed to take McNeil's word for it, at first. Then the five pages of Dr. Ricaurte's petty claims and quotes of others down talking him, it starts to feel like just a negative buildup against Dr. Ricaurte, and becomes hard to take seriously. For the man to be a ranking scientist, how can all of his methods be less than desirable? Mr. McNeil makes no effort to a counterargument, giving Dr. Ricaurte no saving grace. The information provided seems accurate, but I would have preferred it to include some positive aspects in the Dr.'s research, so I could better form my own opinion on him. Despite the one-sided opinions portrayed, the article is well written and an intriguing read. I particularly found the short paragraph explaining the medical use of Ecstasy to be interesting. It was often used to help patients with trauma or anxiety talk about the event or their upsetting experience with ease, without the sleep inducing effects a sedative would create. In 1985, when Ecstasy was outlawed, this productive use for the drug ceased to be practiced for fear of prosecution.",

One, a vet, out of desperation, started to restudy his profession, from scratch, in Canada or order to restart his career there. Higher education in Canada is expensive but that was the only way he could find to do it and that'll leave him saddled with a huge debt by the time he graduates. So many of the immigrants I met couldn't afford to re-study what they already knew. I met an engineer who was driving for Uber. I met a dental hygienist who was unemployed. I met a lighting engineer/designer who couldn't find work.My aunt emigrated to Canada many years ago too. She was a highly qualified and experienced paediatric theatre nurse with the UK's NHS (think near surgeon-level training). She had to re-study too. Additionally, in the 2010s,\nCanada had a 7-year backlog of applications for work visas, i.e.\nemigrating to Canada for a guaranteed professional job. They decided\nthat after 7 years, most applicants' circumstances had probably changed\nso much that the applications we no longer valid... so they cancelled\nthem and made everyone re-apply. There's a joke in Toronto that your taxi driver is probably more highly qualified than you. What a waste of talent and maybe that's why so many countries have skilled labour shortages despite having high levels of immigration? Finally, when the COVID-19 confinement hit in 2020 and students had to stay at home, you'd think educational institutions would need more elearning and Online & Distance Education (ODE) specialists, right? No. They started firing those people instead so that inexperienced tutors and lecturers had to perform the rapid \"pivot\" to online. We now have hundreds of \"experts\" in ODE who think it's simply uploading reading materials and giving video tutorials on Zoom. I no longer live in Canada. /end of rant",

          "Text": "Claim: You can Google \"the most useless degrees\", and you'll find that the list is long. If you search for \"the most useful degrees\", engineering will likely be at the top, followed by medicine and business administration. Our technological world needs people who can calculate the length of a hypotenuse. However, young people don’t want to do math—most of them don’t even know what a hypotenuse is. If you show an integral sign to a student, they might faint. Business administration students don’t know the slope of a line on a graph, let alone students in other fields. Sorry, but the world needs more engineers—not so many art historians and language experts. Counterclaim: While it is true that STEM degrees, particularly engineering and medicine, are often ranked among the most \"useful\" in terms of job prospects, dismissing other fields as \"worthless\" is an oversimplification. The economy is not solely driven by engineers and doctors—society also needs educators, communicators, analysts, and creative professionals. Moreover, the issue of youth unemployment is more complex than simply blaming degree choices. Factors such as labor market conditions, automation, economic downturns, and even the rising costs of education contribute significantly. Many STEM graduates also struggle to find jobs if they lack experience or if demand fluctuates in their field. Rather than discouraging students from pursuing their interests, a better approach would be to reform education systems to better align with job market needs. This includes improving career guidance, integrating practical skills into all degree programs, and promoting interdisciplinary knowledge—because even engineers benefit from good communication skills, and businesses need people who understand human culture, language, and behavior. I understand where you're coming from—there is certainly a strong demand for engineers, doctors, and other STEM professionals, and many students struggle with math, which can limit their career options. However, I think the issue is more nuanced. The job market does favor certain degrees over others, but rather than saying some fields are \"worthless,\" it might be more accurate to say that universities need to do a better job of preparing students for the realities of employment. For example, even in the humanities, students could benefit from more practical skills like data analysis, project management, or digital tools to increase their employability. That being said, I do agree that too many students avoid math-heavy fields, and that’s a problem. But perhaps the solution isn’t just to push everyone into STEM but to make math and logical thinking more approachable from an early age.",

Educated in rural New Zealand, half my classmates would have left before 3 years of secondary education. Only half those that sat the external exam at the end of the third year passed and that was considered enough to get a job in an office, bank or insurance. Undoubtedly they were immature and lacking skills at 16 but many have been very successful in their careers. Those jobs now require a degree and tens of thousands in student debt. Less than 10% of those entering the school with me went on to University. The problem isn't just a Western one. I spend several years teaching in a Chinese polytech where I was told to pass every single student - even those who never turned up. The students were at the lower end academically in a system that ranks both students and educational establishments and the 3 year diploma they received had little value. Some were shoved into an English class, and there seemed to be no way students with little ability or interest in learning a foreign language could change to a course that better suited them.",

If not, search in the Moodle bug tracker ( http://tracker.moodle.org/ ) to see if anyone has already reported the problem. If so, then stop.

This work has been funded through a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant and is about two years in the making. The tools will support several functions: * Design of curriculums maps relating Competencies (a.k.a. educational goals), Professional Abilities (a.k.a. learning objectives), Learning Activities , and Assessments. * Submission of learning activities (a.k.a. lesson plans) by educators with associated searchable metadata . * Review of submitted materials by an editorial team, with support for revision cycles. * Searching and browsing of curriculum maps and their related learning object repositories. * Rating of learning objects by editorial staff and/or public browsers via a star rating system. * Checking out materials from the learning object repositories via a shopping cart model. * Packaging of selected curricula items, with a dynamically created curriculum description including links to learning activities and assessments. * Tracking of downloads and follow up surveying of users.",

That is good for my institution needs, but individuals with spontaneous, flexible learning styles may not be as excited. At Sapporo Gakuin University we released the Sharing Cart last week and soon the internal Repository (in April). In addition, six months ago, the Project Course Format was released for teachers developed project-based content (sharing packages of mixed types of resources/activities). All of these may be of interest to you and your project. They are intended to meet the need for sharing Moodle-based activities and resources. The Moodle 2.0 Repository API however seems to be aimed at connecting external banks of activities, not necessarily Moodle based. The beauty of the Sharing Cart is its ability to act as a window to transfer Moodle items between sites. What we miss is the connection to competancies, so I am eager to study your plans. Do you have some links to proposals, requirements papers, screenshots? Will you be offering this Curriculum Mapping Block as GPL? Since others may be interested, you might post some of these links onto the Moodle Docs , too. Thanks, Don",

When designing a curriculum map, you can upload any type of document as a learning object, or point to the URL of a learning resource that resides anywhere. So while there will be some advantages if an institution already uses Moodle, the tool will provide the bulk of its functionality with any other LMS in place as well. John Jackson",

As I'm preparing the slides and the structure of my presentation I thought I would ask for the help of other members of the community with more experience than me. I know many of you have participated in events to promote Moodle or to talk about specific aspects of Moodle. Are there any helpful tips that you can offer? I would be very grateful for any materials that you could share with me. I know there are some official Moodle slides that I can use (and I will probably make use of them), but if you have created additional slides that can be useful to make certain points about Moodle or that provide other important information, I would really appreciate it if you could share them with me. Of course, I'm going to use my own Moodle courses to illustrate the specific uses I make of the different modules, but if you have any other materials besides slides that can show original and creative uses of Moodle (some interesting use of a module or activity such as a glossary, for instance), I would also welcome them in my presentation. Thanks in advance. Josep M.",

Be wary of any analysis of this or any other\npatent which does not involve an element-by-element discussion of the claims as\neach element is a limitation on the scope of a patent. \" So, in order for someone to infringe on this patent, they have to meet the 34 elements (if I read correctly) that are dependent on claim 1 to be in violation?  So, Blackboard wrote a patent that someone amazingly fits their top competitors?  Seems a little scarey to me. Or how about this: \"The inherent complexity of patent law is no doubt a leading cause of confusion\nabout the Blackboard patent. \"",

As you may have seen, I'm leading a project for Moodle called MoodleNet , the aim of which is to achieve the following: MoodleNet sustainably empowers communities of educators to share and learn from each other to improve the quality of education. It is a new open social media platform for educators, focussed on professional development and open content. It will be an integral part of the Moodle ecosystem. Thanks to those of you who have joined in the discussion on the separate sub-forum ! Now that we're within six months of launching the MVP , I thought it was a good time to extend an invitation to you all. Please do introduce yourself to the MoodleNet project! We're running the first ' office hours ' next Thursday, if you're available/interested. I hope you are, as we need your expertise and insight to make this a success. ?",

There are many options. You would be best advised to contact a Moodle Partner in your region and get some local advice from them. See https://moodle.com/partners/",

For this reason I use my Yahoo email when subscribing to foirums and discussion groups - it lets me deal with direct work issues that require immediate attention on my company email, and look at discussions that are interesting but not urgent using the Yahoo email. Unfortunately the decision in this forum to not allow Yahoo addresses means I am stuck with a flooded email inbox or have to unsubscrbe (which I don't really want to do, but will have to). Wouldn't it be reasonable to allow Yahoo email addresses? I subscribe to a lot of specialised discussion groups and none disallow Yahoo addresses. Chris",

Here's the blurb: Alton Convent\nSchool is seeking to appoint a network manager,\nto take responsibility for the day to day management and maintenance of the\nschool’s computer networks, to provide technical support to staff and pupils,\nassist with hands-on training, and contribute to decisions on the development\nof ICT within the school. Applicants must be committed to prioritizing the\nneeds of learning, teaching, administration and management over technological\naspects, and seeking the best possible return on investment. Some experience\nwith SIMS and/or Open Source applications and approaches would be additional\nrecommendations, as would recent experience of the education sector. For\ncandidates with vision and creativity this post offers considerable scope to\nexplore innovative ways of delivering cutting-edge provision for ICT. Now, this isn't a Moodle job per se , but when we start looking at setting up a VLE, I think I know which one we'll pick... That said, I'm sure there are folks around here who could do this, or might know someone who could. Anyhow, I've uploaded the details and would be happy to chat with anyone interested in applying. Salary is 'dependant on qualifications and experience' but we're thinking about £20K+. The school has c460 on roll, and around 70-80 computers at the moment. Alton is a (rather nice) market town in Hampshire, SE England.",

I use a mix of Edmodo and Moodle in my classroom. Edmodo for the social aspect and Moodle for all my class content and progression. I am currently able to award badges in Edmodo manually, however, I think it would great if I could affix a badge to any Moodle assessment that receives a grade and it would automatically reward the badge onto their Moodle profile. For instance, I would set a Moodle Quiz to award BADGE A to the student if he/she received a 95% on the test. The badge would just be a 50x50 pixel image which would bounce over to the student's profile upon meeting that requirement. Thanks!",

It's designed to give a quick and easy way for learners to check how they've been doing on SWF activities , see where they're doing well and where they should spend more time. Setting up some kind of side block that generates reports on learners' quiz attempts and awards badges should be fairly simple and easy to do. Probably, the most time consuming part of it would be deciding on how you'd like it to look and behave.",

For example, we have a moodle instance that we use for a moodle portfolio. Certainly, in a portfolio situation, you don't need many of the instructional features that are built into moodle--no quizzes, assignments, etc. So we just went into the admin settings and turned off what we didn't need. The capabilities are still there, so you can always go back in and turn them on again should you so desire. So don't let \"complexity\" weigh too heavily on your choice.

I think that it uses XML to send the data out to other systems; but without a subscription to the API I cannot even look at the documentation to see if Moodle Web Services would be compatible! I will speak with iSAMS to see if I can access the documentation without paying up; as using the official APIs would seem a more robust long term route to take. The only downside in doing so for iSAMS schools is that they would have to license this access to be able to integrate with Moodle. My current solution allows basic integration at no additional cost.

New features include, Support for My sql i, Support for Sqlite3 Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Russian translation Updated Chinese, Spanish, French, German translation Relaxation of restriction on display language must be the same as installation language As far as I can determine, a Moodle+CK-ERP environment is most useful to teachers, school administrators and other educational professionals. While Moodle supports the front-end elearning process, CK-ERP provides facilities to manage backoffice routines of a school, eg, procurement of supplies and ledger bookkeeping. All these happen within the familiar Moodle environment. CK-ERP is an open source educational / accounting / MRP / ERP / CRM system that runs on top of multiple middlewares. It comprises 32 modules - Contact Management, Customer Relationship Management, Customer Self Service, Vendor Relationship Management, Material Requirement Planning, Warehouse, Inventory, Service, Accounting Ledger, Bank Reconciliation, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Purchase Order, Sales Order, Quotation, POS for Cashier, POS for Manager, Human Resources, Staff Self Service, Payroll, Administration, Internationalization, Access Control, Data Import, Teacher, Counsellor, Student, Applicant, Family, Registrar, Edu Administration and Volunteer Management. Please report error and suggestion to the discussion group / mailing list, CK-ERP-en(at)googlegroups.com or CK-ERP-zh_CN(at)googlegroups.com . General history and expected development is available at the discussion group's Archive.

Because--for the most part--there are no local high schools. That headmaster wants to expand his constituency to adult education. Few Belizeians finish high school. And many now wish they had. But they want an accredited diploma of some sort. They aren't interested in education for its own sake. They want better jobs. Employers want certified credentials of some sort. And that's a problem. Because well-regarded programs with good curricula and teachers who interact with the students can cost as much as $2000 per student per year.

          "Text": "Hi Angel Morris, I've developed some amazing tools myself to enhance the Moodle experience, and I'm happy to share my two cents! To increase teacher engagement, I created the local_geniai , a plugin that brings an intelligent chatbot , capable of acting as a virtual assistant, answering platform-related questions, helping with course setup, and even providing personalized pedagogical suggestions. It also has a virtual tutor . In partnership with Sil, GeniAI also includes a content generator for H5P, making it easier to create interactive activities . When it comes to student behavioral engagement, the video platform OttFlix is an excellent solution! With it, you can create immersive and engaging experiences by combining interactive videos with AI-generated automatic subtitles. After generating the subtitles, OttFlix goes further and transforms the video into an Interactive Video , allowing the creation of Mind Maps , personalized quizzes , Interactive Books , and many other H5P solutions that encourage active student participation. It’s a great way to keep students engaged by offering different ways to interact with content, while the teacher can track student performance in real time. In terms of emotional engagement, AI can assist through sentiment analysis and personalized feedback . Some tools can be used to monitor student participation and even identify when a student may be facing emotional difficulties, suggesting interventions and appropriate support. However, I don’t know of anything specifically available for this yet. Social engagement can be enhanced with the use of AI to foster collaboration . Chatbots and virtual tutors can encourage forum discussions, promote group activities, and even help form study groups based on complementary interests and skills, just like the GeniAI already does. And regarding gamification , there are many ways to implement it in Moodle, such as using H5P activities generated by GeniAI to bring a playful touch to learning. The future of Moodle with AI is all about increasing personalization and interactivity! Eduardo Kraus Innovation and new products",

          "Text": "I know advertising isn't allowed but I'm sure you won't mind if I mention this Moodle promotion. It's an email to the Aussie PM's office (and a few others), after reading the interim report for the Australia 2020 Summit . I'd be interested in whether anyone thinks it's worth giving it a big(ger) push. (and if I've got my facts right). Well the Summit is over and we have ideas about WHAT needs to be done. Now the challenge is HOW to go about it. Most of the pieces are in place, but scattered all around. So let me point at the two of the most obvious pieces. The first is the initiative by edna - education network Australia. It’s called me.edu.au. http://me.edu.au/ This IS the basis of a citizen’s learning account. It’s still in beta and edna will probably not have considered its wider application. But with a little encouragement it could provide a way for every citizen to have a log in to many interactive .edu.au and gov.au services. It just starts as a log in to edna's network. The second is a piece of software that could, with a little work, act as a good learning environment- i.e. the online forums. This Aussie invention is used as a courseware host in many .edu institutions around the world. With a little tweaking it could provide a good introduction to a citizen’s online learning. More importantly it will encourage teachers and students to get involved and learn it while communicating. It’s called a Moodle. http://moodle.org/sites/ Most of the things we would all like to see For Australia in 2020, and the infrastructure that it will demand, are now down to how fast people government departments might pick up the interactive and open culture. Wikipedia is the best example. 15 people are responsible for a network of information, which is contributed to, and demanded by, around 40 million people per month (take all numbers with a pound of salt). Progress needn’t be as daunting as you might think. Australia has a lot of very bright people here who would like to contribute, if we could just get conversations like this onto a well organised group of forums and help them find one another. This can be done very quickly, as many of them would like to get involved but have never been given the means or opportunity. Thank you for the Summit ; you’ve set the old media stage. Now the new interactive one must be set. So could I ask you to respond to this little message as though I, like many others, have been working for years on understanding how lots of the pieces and people could come together ? (once we had a government with the right attitudes). Thankfully, now we have a government with the right attitudes.",

          "Text": "When I was first given the task of researching Moodle I did so from a Learning Centre (Library) point of view because that was my function in college and I found the language of Moodle confusing, Learning Centres at least in our college do not have 'courses' we run sessions, we provide information, we do books but, we don't teach - not in a traditional sense. So I was determined not to refer to 'courses' but I'd call them something else. It was only later that I realised 'course' is just a word. The content of a 'course' can be anything you want it to be. When a course is set up in Moodle there are two basic options Add resources Add activities Adding resources creates a filing cabinet, adding activities creates a learning environment. In your situation I would use the 'add resource' option, allow guest access or set up a new role to allow a degree of inter-action. The topic based format would seem to be best - although the adaptations to Moodle that can be made using the 'flexible-page' format should be considered. To take your points in turn (although each point could be considered as a separate 'course' there will be some cross-over) 1- Numerous pages with articles about learning models etc. Topics set up using labels to break up the content to give an appearance of structure, links off-site 2- About us pages Links to your establishment, documents prepared by you or your students 3- Privacy policy and mission statement pages More topics, another course, a directory of files 4- A full fledged FAQ section with categories A glossary - yes I know that's a Moodle activity but it's purpose built for the job 5- Contact page for personalized inquiries This could be just a listing in a topic, or it could be a forum, or a glossary, or a chat room and yes forums, gloassaries and chat rooms are activities but with Moodle it is so difficult (and really not to be recommended) to separate the resources from the activities.

Is that really necessary? If you have your own server , hard disks are cheap. One question is whether your experience with Moodle is short or long? There are some things I could recommend to make the job easier, but we have been doing this for six years now. Some things you may consider: Import will move ALL course files (it is an all-or-nothing option to set) Import can selectively remove activities and resources, but the course files Using site files instead of course files might be a better strategy for saving disk space However using site files to hold your common files would require some advanced setup (make and apply new roles for example) The Sharing Cart (a contributed block) may be useful for duplicating and moving single activities and resources Hope this helps.

I have chosen to do my final year dissertation on VLE's (Virtual Learning Environments). To begin my project I want to critically analyse what is already out there (moodle being one of the main VLE's), so what I ask for is general feedback from Moodle users. This can be disadvantages you have stumbled across, advantages and even your views on how 'you' would make the system better as a whole. I would normally have done this as a questionnaire, however I do not know of any institutions round my area dealing with moodle. It is important I can gather this information from users who have currently used this system day out and in and have had many experience with it. As it is also important to gather it from first time users, as they may have more critique to add. So please add any feedback and views on moodle, I have already got a few views however lacking the real community voice. Remember this is just general feedback so just bullet point whatever you think is good, bad or what you think you could do to make it better. From this information I can further assess Moodle with reliable and honest information and not just my opinion. Many thanks, Mark",

          "Text": "Mark I applaud your very valiant effort to take a bite out of this very important topic, VLE. One feedback has already pointed out that this subject is big (huge in fact)-- how so? My own experience is as a client, creator, facilitator and server side developer (amateur with intermediate skills). I have no computer science degree but a MBA, 23 years plus in the US Navy before retiring, 4 years as a lecturer after retirement at a Maritime Institution and various skills sets in computers, programming and such--most recently Adobe elearning and WAMP . My main reason for mentioning the above is to help bring a \"two sided\" coin type look at his issue. For me, VLE, LMS, CMS or what have you-- in order to have the desired affect (attainment of competencies, real learning/synthesis (Bloom stuff), development of life learning skills, betterment of society, etc.) VLE must have a guiding hand that understands the requirements of both facilitators and ICT! THIS I FIND SORELY MISSING! What do I mean by that?; If the \"correct\" track/ ICT infrastructure is not in place for the facilitators/ course creators-- we get garbage in, garbage out! Problem is, many facilitators (generalizing) have little clue about ICT requirements with reference to (WRT), i.e., LMS, CMS, e-Learning Course building software, security, access, course creator skill sets and even proper learning, teaching style, course structure and development (competency and outcome development, etc.) My experience here is that for more than two years, administrators can't decide weather to adopt a VLE or not; Issues put forth include; privacy of data, concerns about allowing material on the net for others to see and copy, not understanding total cost/benefits, and stake holder req, etc. Facilitators will even expect you do their work for you-- load materials, convert files, etc. Protocols and standards for ICT often times are at odds with \"educator progress\". SMART classrooms, use of INTRANET, Exam clickers, interactive quizzes, live Internet access and camera feeds present real security issues for ICT but are a must collaborative learning to take place. We're also assuming everyone is enthusiastic about doing VLE. The \"old guard\" suggesting what's wrong with the way we're doing now syndrome? Even though there may be clear direction from a businesses Strategic Planning for these types of initiatives, the paralysis of analysis often prevails. They cannot implement or follow through. My recommendation here is the Six Sigma type approach; Assemble a \"Black belt team of ICT, SME and Execs to quickly and decisively carve out the way; next a Green belt team to flush out and implement, and White belt for daily routines. One more note on the server side-- once the facilitators and course creators start creating-- watch out for file sizes and haphazard file storage directories with little organization-- policies, structure, training and coordination. Again, the facilitators will think you are supposed to guide them, but ICT themselves may be looking for guidance. In one organization I worked at, every day people from ICT came thru the spaces looking at what we were doing, asking about problems/ staying connected and going to some department meetings to get the jump on \"unplanned initiatives\" that would involve/impact ICT. So, getting back to too big a topic-- something like VLE best practices and somehow theorizing it having positive(significant) effect on the bottom line, human capital development, etc., might be good? How this helps-- look forward to more dialog! Iman",

To add to the multi-stamp feature for Moodle 2.2 , I've managed to add a \"Pseudo-block\" that allows the current user to see the number of stamps that he or she has earned. So as soon as the user logs onto Moodle and enters his/her coursepage, he will immediately see the number of stamps and the stamp icons he has earned. A mouseover of each stamp will elicit a text description of the reason for the award. Those currently using David Mudrak's Stamp Collection module for Moodle 2.2 (and their students!) will benefit from this. A picture is worth a thousand words. More info and screenshot here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=199982#p872196 . Wait for the code, it's coming soon.",

          "Text": "Hi, iam interesting in integrating social network features into moodle in nowadays college. just want to ask for some advice for this one, since the several benefits from such integration based my personal perspective are: 1. The authentication of files can be verified since is posted by the students within the college, as a result, each student from different courses or from different classes of the same course may share the knowledge with each other based on a mutual academic acknowledged condition, which means those files gain a more academic value than those who just randomly post in one's blog on internet. therefore, students may add their friends based on one's future development plan and establish his own college networks.(it doesnt only help with the solving the academic problems but also enhance the study motivation through a virtual learning environment) 2. Presuming that a server may established between 2 cities,e.g.cork and dublin, such networking is enble students from 2 different univisities to connect through the server which connect through each moodle of those two universities. therefore, a more wider academic communication may establish and those moodle in those two universities can be well socialized. finally moodle can both socialized within and out of a university. I am trying to borrow the facebook theory and its \"hot\" popularity to add into moodle then transform moodle into a academic governed and giuided (since this is the reason for the development of LMS ) - but managed by students (a students-centered tool) - through a social networking method to support students' learning stratefy (therefore once student may well find their sources , which narrow down the question easily that save the most of time wasting on the useless finding in the wide internet. once such network eastablished, with the convinent course delivery and the well connected network, students may gain more valuable time and more motivation spending on their subject) This is only a theory based way to help college students to manage their own study assets, anyone who like to advice me on that one, i will be grateful..

Privacy Badger is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.  If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission , Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.  To the advertiser, it's like you suddenly disappeared. Install it now at: https://www.eff.org/privacybadger Why should you care? Here's an excerpt from a news story in the UK publication Private-Eye: Besides safekeeping, such an intrusive industry raises another question: is sensitive personal information now mere merchandise? Most UK data brokers have sense enough to hide their creepier practices, but there are exceptions. Clear Data Ltd, based in Herefordshire, advertises lists of old people (\"over 65 and mostly female\") waiting to be targeted by quack doctors, boiler room conmen, telephone raffle operators, and pyramid schemers in need of credulous targets. Data Broker Limited, from Cheshire, caters to predatory lenders — \"[if you're] offering new loans to people With poor credit history and [county court Judgements against them], Databroker have the largest list related to loans for postal, telephone, mobile, SMS, email and social media campaigns\".

I have been looking at Moodle for some months, and have used in a very primitive manner in one short courses and like it very much.  Now, I am planning to use Moodle in a series of courses on statistics, data analysis, and methodology at the faculty of psychology at my university.  Therefore, I am trying to locate useful material on the net, especially in respect to sets of questions or item banks that might be useful.  Google is not very useful, at least not in respect to the search terms I have used so far. The textbook I am using at the moment is Howitt & Cramer, \"An Introduction to Statistics in Psychology\", and it seems that the publisher does not have anything useful to contribute in this respect.

Presently, the best way to directly edit documents is to make a forum--and paste the document text into the forum text area. If you make the document itself directly editable, you would of course have to make settings to say who can update it and whether it should be updated at all. Some resources posted are reference materials, not for editing. Do you know how to post a feature request? Here is an guide. I suggest you go to the Issue Tracker, log in there, and \"create a new issue\". An issue can be either a \"bug\" or a \"feature request\". Explain what you want and why you want it. Explain the problems that this new feature would deal with. Then come back to this forum and post the Issue Number. Then the rest of us can vote on it and optionally choose to watch the comments on the Issue Tracker. It may take months or years to get something going, but if enough people like the idea, it will eventually get put into Moodle. How does that sound? Cheers, Don",

This is where specific content tools like (for example) the Articulate suite can be used to create the content and then upload that content into Moodle. In summary - Moodle can create content, but this will really depend on what the expectations of your management group are in terms of what 'content' means to them - get that picture clear and then you can assess whether Moodle's inbuilt tools are good enough for what you need.

The planned system will be to freeze enrolments, clone the site to an archive server , run an upgrade to Moodle and plugins on the LIVE server and do any planned maintenance, link the course enrolments back up so that the new cohorts get automatically enrolled from our student record system (external database plugin). We'll keep those archives for x years, then back them up and remove them from the archive server in line with a data retention policy that is currently being discussed.",

The earlier versions required the user to download an application and install it locally before accessing the server which kind of ruled it out for what I wanted to use it for. The web app. approach makes much more sense and the moodle integration is excellent news. Will take another much closer look. Just a few notes about this (I should really forward this to the guys in Hong Kong first but here goes anyway): The distinction between the various forms of gong is massively confusing (at least it was to me). This really needs to be simplified/clarified. The people writing the page obviously know exactly what they are talking about but there is way too much knowledge that is assumed of the visitor to the page. An approach where everything is explained in the simplest terms and then expanded would be much more helpful (the moodlerooms site does a very good job of this sort of thing). The descriptions are also very generic and when you try to delve in at some sort of depth you don't really find any. I am guessing they are in need of some feedback so I will give some once I have looked into the newer versions. Cheers, James Phillips",

I'm a Spanish Computers student.  As you can see my english isn't that bad, but it's not very good at all :'( I'm making a course based on moodle with the purpose to learn about Open Source and Moodle. And with a final project which would consist on adding a feature to the moodle. The course is this one: Taller de Software II And for my first participation on this forums I want to ask you please some things about my project. - Are there any similar features already implemented ? - Where, on the forums, should I ask for this kind of developments. - Do you think there would be another different feature connected to this one that would be interesting ? The description of the feature is : \" Title : Load Diagram of a student. Description : Given a student who is registered on one or more courses, or defining a set of subjects, obtain the load of works he is doing. For doing it for each subject there would be defined certain number of \"load hours\" to do from a given init time and untill a given finishing time.\" I still don't understand at all the meaning of doing this as we're just begginning the course, but I'll soon talk with the teacher to understand it better. Anyway please help about this : Well thank you very much! PS : I hope at least someone to help me, I'm a little bit lost on this, as I'm a noob also on Open Source, but I'm interested on learning!",

However, exact dates aside, could the MoodleMoot UK organisers *please* get the dates announced sooner? People keep trying to fill up my diary, I've got other possible commitments \"on hold\" waiting for the MoodeMoot dates. Easter is a holiday period and like many people I would like to be able to plan my holidays before everything gets booked up, but it is impossible to do so until MoodleMoot dates are out. For 2019 I already have a one-off invitation only event in N. Wales that's on the 15th April. As a volunteer contributor to the project, I'm loath to miss it. Right now my plan is to skip the first day of MoodleMoot and travel in the evening. I'm hoping MoodleMoot isn't too far from N. Wales this time, since I have to be back there by the evening of the 18th for further confirmed commitments. On side note, I'm a director of PyCon UK 2019 (5 days, 700+ attendees and 100% volunteer run) we already have the 2019 dates published on our website (13th to 17th September if anybody is interested). I'm firmly of the opinion that getting the dates and location for MoodleMoot UK out much earlier would have a positive impact on attendance numbers, it works for us at PyCon UK. There are many other smaller events I'm involved with or attend that already have 2019 dates out that are well past April.",

They are realising nowadays that this is the best way to manage a company and the best marketing strategy, also. The best pedagogical theories in education , such as constructivism , just say that we have to listen to what the student knows, and then help him to improve his knowledge. The less bad political organization today, called democracy, is based on listening to the people and leting them choose who is going to rule the government . The most important method for acting , proposed by Stanislavsky, is a whole process that starts just by listening to everything. It is used by all the actors from the Actor's Studio, many of them being Hollywood stars. Psychology is the art of solving problems by listening to the people and understanding them.

          "Text": "Open Source software is catching fancy of millions of technocrats around the world. A lot of emphasis is being laid on developing applications based on Open Source, which are either free or are available at nominal costs. This is coming out as a big opportunity to developers and users alike. It is estimated that by 2015, Open Source Market will assume 37% market share of overall development scenario. This needs for deep introspe ction both at micro and macro level so that the true potential of Open Source can be explored and entrepreneurs are prepared with right mindsets. INMANTEC had successfully organized first seminar on “Open Source: Opportunities in Entrepreneurship” on March 13, 2010. This seminar was a huge attraction among open source professionals and budding entrepreneurs. The glimpse of the same can be accessed from here. Keeping the same fervor, INMANTEC is organizing second seminar in this series entitled “Open Source: Opportunities in Entrepreneurship Ver 2.0” on February 15, 2012 at INMANTEC, Ghaziabad. Through this seminar, we wish to address following issues impeding growth of entrepreneurs in Open Source: Entrepreneurship through open source Capital for entrepreneurship venture on open source Marketing of open source products & services Customization of open source software To provide hands on experience in different technologies, we will be conducting workshops on different open source technologies:- Spoken Tutorial [ Free Workshop ]. Open Source OS: Ubuntu ( A Separate session on Ubuntu for Schools. ) Game development using Open Source. Content management using Wordpress Open Source ERP. Moodle 2.0: A Course Management System Android Apps Development. Open Java [ Free Workshop ] Library Automation using NewGenLib For more information please connect to http://inmantec.edu/os2012",

The concept of open source is basically a legal framework of copyright (or copyleft) definitions that enables anyone to use, adapt and redistribute freely and without any restrictions: http://www.opensource.org/osd.html I think it's imperative that anyone embarking on an open source project or uses code from open source projects understands the legal responsibilities and implications before they invest time and effort in them. It's a fundamentally different model. I think a lot of people from more traditional business backgrounds would have difficulties understanding how all this works, I've certainly had some quizzical looks and incredulous responses when I've tried to describe the open source concept.",

I develop a stand alone recommender system for teachers which can be applied to any learning management system like Moodle or L2P (L2P is a LMS based on MS Sharepoint and is used at the RWTH Aachen). The recommender system shall use different data mining techniques on LMS usage data like regression to give teachers some information how their own LMS usage impacts the usage behaviour of the students. Clustering algorithms shall give teachers an overview about different student groups based on their LMS usage. The recommender system uses tools like WEKA and KEEL. Unfortunately my university can only give me usage data of the courses but no marks - without this very important attribute I cannot use (for example subgroup discovery) algorithms to give teachers feedback about their students LMS usage and the students learning success. Therfore I am asking for students' Moodle usage datasets I can analyze in my thesis. The data may not be randomized because I need plausible data. Does anyone know where I can get such data?",

It should be easier to output AVETMISS data from the SMS than from Moodle. The SMS is usually part of a complex qualification process for getting demographic-linked subsidies. It needs minimal information about the content of courses because funding does not (yet) depend on qualitative aspects of learner performance. The VLE is part of a mass of teacher/learner interactions, and not oriented around demographics because it is possible to teach well without background information about students. The essential documentary output of an SMS is authorisation for a student ID for specific courses. The essential documentary output of a VLE is a statement of achievement (grades). AVETMISS specs require a lot of fields that are not in Moodle: http://www.ncver.edu.au/statistics/avetmiss60/vetprovider/vetprov_collection_specs60.pdf Data might be stored in existing spare fields and repurposing a few, but only if: 1. All of your Course Creators strictly follow a protocol regarding all of the Course and Assignment identifiers and names, etc. 2. Validation rules are applied to user profile data and course data after it has been created. I had assumed that all RTOs had a Student Administration System with much more (relevant) detail than Moodle (at least for billing purposes!). Are there any RTOs that don't?",

I've made the whole course as a backup zip file that you can download and then restore as a new Moodle course. Some of the games listed are classics in the genre of puzzles and problem solving. Since I love chess, my all time favourite Java/flash puzzle game on the course is Lunar Lockout , a ThinkFun game that is no longer on the market (shelves). There's also a Javascript ( DHTML ) version of the Lemmings game - that game was the Angry Birds game of the 1990s! Also, as for an excellent game to teach introductory modular and procedural programming to kids, you can't go wrong with lightbot (I've got the swf on my Moodle site). Lastly, if you happen to like innovation and Moodle hacks (almost all for Moodle 1.9, one or two for Moodle 2.2), do drop by my blog at: http://moodurian.blogspot.com . Be warned, many of the 'improvements' and 'innovations' on my blog will render your out-of-the-box Moodle site, virtually impossible to automatically upgrade to the next version. Meaning that core Moodle code is being changed in many of my posts. All the best, have fun with the games section, and please let me know how it works out for you.

We are looking for folks to give us feedback and then potentially be beta users of a new platform we are launching shortly called LMSCheckout. It is a shopping cart solution that will include full integration for Moodle that has a workflow similar to using Shopify, only we automate the enrollment process between the systems. It has features like coupons, tax management, course reviews and ratings and a self-service theming tool. We are doing a couple sneak peak events next week so we can start gathering feedback and attempt to line up beta users. We are even doing a drawing for a couple of attendees to win a free subscription to the service once it launches. If you have any interest, we'd love to invite you out to take a look. You can register here: https://cysalesteam.com/envisiontel/category/connect-your-salesteam-live-webinars We would appreciate any feedback that anyone cares to share. Hope to see you there. Thanks",

It's more than likely a stop-gap measure until an open source solution comes along. However, MPEG LA, the H.264 licence holders, are likely to fight tooth and nail to preserve their market share. I'd expect a lot of litigation along the way and attempts to bankrupt open source CODEC projects that might compete with them.

And as mentioned in the announcements - \"Moodle developers receive Global Learning Impact Awards\". Are there some reports about the results of these activities (workshop, discussions, dissertations/speeches)? Does anyone know if there are some CC Players available for the purpose of demonstration or are there livestreams that can be downloaded or watched? And I would also like to know what are the activities of the CC Alliance at the moment? What will be the upcoming activities for the next months? Maybe somebody can report some news from this event... greets, claudia",

Does anyone know of a survey module that will pop-up randomly for Moodle on the front page ? Thanks...",

          "Title": "Random Wishlist: Grade Sliders and Word Viewer",
          "Text": "Well, my \"crazy end of semester\" (and upcoming move to a strange land, 2,000 miles away from my current location) are preventing me from engaging more fully into Moodle's greatness. But, as I'm grading assignments, I've been taking headnotes about Moodle features. It might be useful for me to just throw them out of my head, even though they're not fully fleshed out (or intelligible). Some things I'd like to have in Moodle, which would make my life much easier. A viewer for Word files. And/or other file types used in assignments. This way, there wouldn't be much of a difference between \"online text\" and file- upload assignments. (Maybe students could elect to submit either an online text or a file upload!) It'd make things easier for students while allowing teachers to grade assignments in one simple interface. Sounds relatively easy to implement, and there might already be an add-on for this. A system to assign grades using sliders. Think rubrics, but less compartmentalised. My categories are put in decreasing order of importance (from insight to concision). And I do grade by giving relative weight to many of these (not all of them are relevant for every student's assignment). At this point, I basically \"see\" a series of sliders in my head as I grade. Assignments which are very insightful can easily get a full grade if everything else is at least decent. Assignments which have few other redeeming qualities may still be evaluated for concision. Altogether, my grading scheme is rather algorithmic, but the algorithm is quite difficult for me to explain (and I do realise I'm doing a rather bad job of explaining it now). So, having sliders would be very useful. I know some of the same effects could be achieved with drop-down menus for numeric values but the slider interface would, in itself, make things easier (direct feedback while grading). While I'm at it... A way for graders to separate grading and \"releasing\" (publishing) grades. You mark and grade an assignment but you only make the grades and feedback available at the end of the grading session. That way, you can \"play around\" with grading scenarios or simply compare assignments with one another. These are all very clear in my head but I'm having a hard time verbalising them. They would all make my life much easier and I'm sure some colleagues would find value in them. So, I'll surely revisit these issues later on but instead of writing them down as notes and procrastinating about fleshing them out, I decided to RERO . Cheers!",
