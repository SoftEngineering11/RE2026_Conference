          "Text": "Sometimes I allow a quiz to be submitted after the deadline has passed using the User Exceptions tool. Or I allow other students to try to improve their grades on a quiz by giving them extra attempts. At the same time, all students have another new quiz to answer because classes are moving forward and time does not stand still. All teachers have many students. This usually means that after a while I've forgotten which students have ungraded tests or which ones I haven't reviewed yet. Then, to fix this I have to go through each quiz, one by one, to check that all my students have all their attempts graded. This involves a lot of time. I think it will be useful to have a tool that shows us a list of all the students who have an ungraded attempt without having to buy each quiz one by one. Does anyone know if moodle has a tool or tip that allows you to do this? Thank you so much",

I would first look at the grade book to see which quizzes have students with no grade for a quiz. It might be that for some quizzes every student has a grade. Then using the Gradebook, I would go to those quizzes with ungraded quizzes. From the Grades view, I can see which students require grading. As a suggestion, consider not allowing students to submit late. Make do dates be solid! I know, I know, I know. But train students to do work on time, then you will minimize the number of exceptions. Also, there might be ways to convert essay questions into other automatically graded types, such as T/F, Multiple Choice, etc. Then you would not need to grade these. This is especially important for multiple attempts. Multiple attempts with quizzes containing essay questions can develop into a grading nightmare.",

I thus have to duplicate an existing (commercial) course to avoid mixing up paying customers with students accessing the (free) course where they will interact with their teachers. What is the best way of copying the course? I tested it out, and by copying the html code of each topic into the new course, everything seems to be fine (except some links, that will have to be modified) - but what about the quizzes? What is the best way to copy quizzes from one course to a second course? Thank you, Stephan",

          "Text": "I had read in a very old thread that a quiz could have sections . For me this is good since I want a quiz with the first set of 5 questions relating to one chapter of my content, and the next set of 11 questions relating to a different chapter, and a section with 7 questions, and so on. I'm currently using description question types, but it doesn't look great and it means I have questions in my banks that aren't questions. I went ahead and built the quiz with all the questions. I then clicked on the 'Add' button at the bottom and it gives me these options: a new question from question bank a random question There's no option to add a section. I have discovered what I need to to to put section headings in arbitrary locations within the quiz, which is this: Click the repaginate quiz button Repaginate with 1 question per page. in the 'add' menu for the question BEFORE i want a section heading, click add. This now has the following drop-down a new question from a question bank a random question a new section heading I enter the section heading as I want it, and do this for all locations throughout the quizI click the repaginate quiz button againI then select 'unlimited' questions and update. this collapses down the pages and leaves the sections I've defined.voilà I have sections in the right spots But here's the rub . I wanted to show those 5 questions on the first section all together, since the questions all interrelate and I want the learners to see that. I wanted to show the 11 questions on the section section together. I have the quiz layout set to 'never, all questions on one page' but one there are sections it flat out ignores what you set here. Is there a quiz plugin or behaviour or setting I can fiddle that will allow multiple questions on a section?",

Each of the students attempts will be listed below their names and there will be other information, like when they started the test, how long they took, and the final grade (or there might not be a grade because the test is still open). If you put checkmarks in the checkboxes in the leftmost column on the rows where you want to delete attempts, you can set the \"with selected\" dropdown box to delete.  This will delete the attempts that you have marked.  My recollection is that incomplete attempts can be deleted just the same as completed attempts.

I then log on as a teacher / admin, open the test back up & click onto the item analysis 4. I can then download the test to text & then copy to excel.

          "Text": "Hello, When a quiz with has an open date in the future, the grade may be hidden in the gradebook, even if the quiz itself is visible to the students on the course page.  This is a problem, because the default gradebook setting at our school is to hide the course total if it contains hidden items.  Even though the future quiz is available on the course page, the quiz is hidden in the gradebook and so the course total is hidden.  We'd like to keep that default setting, so simply changing the course total settings to \"Show total excluding hidden items\" isn't an option. After much experimentation, I discovered that the quiz's visibility in the gradebook was determined by the \"Points\" checkbox in the \"Later while the quiz is still open\" column of the quiz's Review Options setting:  if the box is checked, the quiz appears in the gradebook.  If that box is not checked, the quiz is hidden in the gradebook.  So one solution to the problem would be to check that box, and allow students who have completed the quiz to view their scores before everyone has completed the quiz.  Unfortunately, one of our instructors doesn't want grades to be visible until after the quiz closes, so checking that box isn't an option for her. Is there some way for the future quiz scores to count as empty, rather than hidden?",

I don't know if that discussion parallels your post. I am puzzled by your statement that \"the grade may be hidden in the gradebook, even if the quiz itself is visible to the students on the course page.\"  I seem to recall that when an item is made visible to students in the course, such as a quiz, it becomes visible in the grade book.  Yet, an instructor can purposely hide this grade, if desired.  And there might be some settings that might hide the activity.  I don't know.  I am just trying to add a few thoughts to this conversation.",

At first it was intermittent but then it became constant. It kept wanting to open the php file with notepad. Now, I went to check in Windows what program the php file exetension was associated with. It for some reason had reset to Notepad, perhaps this was my own doing because I had opened a php file recently with Notepad. However, wierd things happened when I tried to associate the php file type with Firefox . When I clicked on that extension in the list, it told me it was another type, whatever the last other type I had accessed was. Furthermore, I looked at our other computer here, and php wasn't associated with any program. Anyway, I rebooted and it seemed to resolve itself, but the problem remains a mystery to me, so I can at least say you are not alone, but I suspect it may not be entirely a Moodle problem.",

As a result we have about 8000 question categories (and growing) in the System context . We are running into issues with how Moodle displays the question categories. It creates a drop down of all categories. This ends up create a dropdown with 8000 items contained in it. Some pages have this dropdown in two places. This is causing both performance issues as well as usability issues. We are working on a way to improve the display of these dropdowns for our site (ideally making it searchable via ajax ), but are unsure what the best way is to tackle the issue. In some places, the dropdown is being displayed with \"html_writer\" and in others is in a \"moodle_form\". Many of the locations aren't using renderers. Is there an approach anyone can think of to modify (outside of core) how these dropdowns are being displayed or does it make sense to make a new card in the tracker to add renderers for the question category pages?",

This could be an attempt made in a version of Moodle older than 2.1, and something went wrong during the upgrade. The other possible explanation is similar: it could have come from restoring an old quiz attempt. I can see a few options for dealing with this - most of which assume that you don't need this quiz attempt any more: You could try deleting it using the option in the  Quiz results report. (This will either work or give the same error.) You could try editing directly in the database . Remove '450821,' from '5,1,6,450821,8,2,7,4,3,9,0'. ... etc.",

I am setting up a series of short quizzes that students complete after each section of work in learning HTML. The course that we have set up gets them to work their way through several exercises and then complete a short review quiz before moving on to the next set of exercises. I am presently setting up my first quiz with a bank of questions. I have set up a number of categories. Unfortunately, the short sections of exercises cover material from several different categories. So I would really like to categorise questions as section1, 2 ... questions in order to quickly generate a random set of questions for each section. At the end of the course, though, I would also like to be able to use the same question base to generate a set of questions covering all the different HTML categories such as text tags, image tags etc. Is there a way to allocate questions to two different sets of categories? If not, would others also find this helpful? Thanks Len PS if anyone has a bank of questions on HTML that they would be willing to share I'd be grateful.",

Also as a suggestion perhaps the ability to have mutiple category structures and to allocate a question to a category in each structure would be beneficial. As an example in NSW, Australia there is a science syllabus for year 7 - 10. I'd really like to be able to store the Science Syllabus structure in a category hierarchy and store another category with generic topics. ie cells to allow increase the ability to search for questions.",

A single-answer Multiple Choice question can result in a negative mark if its behaviour is set to Deferred feedback, but not other modes (Adaptive mode, Interactive with multiple tries, etc.)...\" If you have more than one question in a quiz, the total mark is the algebraic sum of the marks for each question. So if you have a negative mark for a \"single-answer Multiple Choice question in a quiz with Deferrred Fedback behaviour\", this negative mark will be subtracted from the marks for the other questions. However, if the total mark for the quiz is negative, the grade in the gradebook will be zero. There might be other question types that accept negative marks, but I don't know about them.

We need to ensure the tests are as secure as they can be.  I've noticed three things I couldn't work around in setting these up.  I was unable to find mention of these on the forums, if these have been posted feel free to let me know. 1) When a student enters the PW and navigates away from the quiz, they can continue their attempt without a password. (we're going to leverage the timer to mitigate, but this isn't ideal) 2) If a student enters a PW for the quiz then enters the quiz, then they use the browser's back button to navigate back to the launch page, the PW modal is still there, with the PW filled in and unmaskable. Also the \"Start Attempt\" and \"Cancel\" buttons no longer work. Student needs to navigate away from the launch page and return to get rid of the modal. 3) When using the extra pop-up quiz screen for security... if the student uses PW to get into the test, the student is prompted twice for the PW. If the student uses the browser close window button, the quiz window closes and the modal with the quiz PW form is still there. The PW can be unmasked and viewed. We use online proctors that orally convey the PW and we'd like the student to not be able to freely see it written down. There is a potential that the online proctor is disconnected and the student could unmask and share that PW with students who could open the test prematurely and without proctor. We considered it, but we are unable to use the secure browser for test security.",

Background In a quiz where some time gets wasted due to issues like network failures or hardware crash, the user needs to be given additional time to compensate fairly for this loss. Problem There is no way to automatically quantify the lost time. The compensation of the lost time has to be done manually with the help of user overrides. Proposed solution Monitor the health of the connection using heartbeats provided by websockets Record the connections and disconnections of  a user attempting a quiz Calculate the time lost between connections. Automatically set user-overrides to extend the quiz time limit by the amount of time lost. Implementation details NodeJS, ExpressJS, Socket.IO for heartbeat tracking. Trigger moodle to set user-overrides P.S :  Comments, advice and suggestions are gratefully appreciated.",

I am thinking of this structure, please feel free to comment on it... Question categories for 'Quiz: Book 1 Chapter 1 Quiz ' Question categories for 'Course: My Course' Book 1() Chapter 1-MC() Chapter 1-FIB() Chapter 1-Match() Chapter 2-MC() Chapter 2-FIB() Chapter 2-Match() ... so on Book 2() Chapter 1-MC() Chapter 1-FIB() Chapter 1-Match() Question categories for 'Category: My School' Question categories for 'System' Currently, the question banks are listed under the quiz category Question categories for 'Quiz: Book 1 Chapter 1 Quiz ' Chapter 1-MC() Chapter 1-FIB() Chapter 1-Match() And there is a quiz for each chapter so ditto for each chapter in each book. My understanding is that if I put the banks under 'System' then I would be using the same banks for every course I create with these quizzes for every semester.  If I put the banks under 'Course: My Course' then when I copy the course for multiple sections OR for next semester, it will create new versions of the banks?  Not really sure if there is any difference (except organizationally) between course and quiz levels? (maybe being able to create a final exam?)  If I put them under the quiz, then I won't be able to use them to create a final exam? Sorry for all of the questions, but I read the docs and am still not certain? Now that I write it out, I think it would be better to create the banks at the course level so I could pull from them for a final test? MK",

          "Text": "Some of this organization depends upon what you are planning to use in a quiz within a course. First, I like to create categories for my courses, such as Business, Engineering, etc.  My thoughts are that Business courses might share questions from Business textbooks, so question banks created under the Business category can be shared by other Business courses. Then, for a course, such as Statistics, I make another question bank category for \"statistics.\"  Then, under this category, I create separate categories for different chapters, such as \"Ch01-Introduction,\" \"Ch02-Descriptive Statistics,\" etc.  Finally, I put the textbooks question banks under these.  Yes, I might have more than one textbook's question banks under one chapter. When I create a quiz for Ch01-Introduction, I tell the quiz to pull questions from the \"Ch01-introduction\" group and \"subcategories.\"  Using this approach, if I decide to add more questions, such as textbook #3 questions, I can keep these in their own group, under Ch01-Introduction, and the Moodle quiz can pull from all three resources.  You can even add another category under Ch01-Introduction titled something like \"My own created questions.\" But a lot of this, once again, depends on how you plan to use your questions.  I run my own small Moodle, and don't have to worry about other teachers, so I can do whatever I think is best for ME. So, just as a suggestion, an alternative solution for you would be something like: System | Course_Category | Category_Topic1 Chapter 1 Book1 -MC() Chapter 1 Book1 -FIB() Chapter 1 Book1 -Match() Chapter 1 Book2 -MC() Chapter 1 Book2 -FIB() Chapter 1 Book2 -Match() Category_Topic2 Chapter 2 Book1 -MC() Chapter 2 Book1 -FIB() Chapter 2 Book1 -Match() Chapter 2 Book2 -MC() Chapter 2 Book2 -FIB() Chapter 2 Book2 -Match() This assumes that you might want to create a quiz for Chapter 1 that might include randomly selected questions from all groups under the Category_Topic. I also don't know if the two textbooks, in your example, parallel each other, but I think that you get the idea. Another advantage of this approach is that it gives you the easy ability to remove old textbook question banks and add new, without the need to do anything at the \"edit quiz\" level.  Pretty powerful stuff.  Moodle is the only major LMS with this much power in its quiz engine.",

Currently, there's the question type of Drag and Drop onto images, but in many cases, we'd want to encourage students to actively think and recall the knowledge rather than to passively choose from a list. I think it'd be great if there's a question type that requires students to type to label parts of an image. My current workaround is to label the parts in the image with questions, which they can't type directly in, and use SHORT ANSWER below the image. It works, but doesn't look good, and can be confusing for primary school pupils. Thank you for reading. Doan",

No, unfortunately they don't have sound yet. If you check this example ↗ , you will see that positioning the answer boxes onto the background image is indeed quite simple to obtain. In the example with the animals, I added formatting for the faded, rounded, red-bordered answer boxes. Again, this is not very difficult to do. It would normally be done with three lines of CSS , but since the Atto editor removes the style tag, I prefer to do it with Javascript , which can make formatting look a bit complicated, but in reality it isn't. In the HTML code of the question, for example 'opacity:0.7' means somewhat faded (on a scale of 0 to 1), 'border-radius:20px' means rounded corners, 'border:2px solid #f00' means 2 pixel thick, solid (not dotted), red border where #f00 is the red color in hexadecimal. I've also included a small script to make the answer box expand as you type long answers. This bit is more complex, again not really, but anyway you can just use it without having to know the details of how it works.",

If they then do the activity again and self-assess a score of 86 that becomes the score for their second attempt etc. I would like a way for them to see how they did on the various attempts. I thought of doing this in a quiz using the numerical question type where a student would be asked to input a number and the score would match their input. My problem is, Moodle does not seem to accept scores that are not \"standard\" from the drop down menu..e.g. 86 (even when I import the question). Any suggestions? Is quiz the best way to do this? Any way around the grading limitation mentioned? Thank you. TD",

Our question database contains around 2-3000 unique questions and most are at system level as they are shared. All this works fine. We use backup and restore to create a duplicate course for different schools for example. However, when we run a backup (and select the option to backup questions) things recently started to run very slowly and finally we realized the questions table in the database was enormous. What seems to happen is that all backups contain the entire database of questions and when restored these are duplicated so the number of questions effectively increases exponentially! We have a massive AWS server so have managed so far!!! However, we have recently had to use SQL to delete unused questions but this soon doubles up again. Has anybody any ideas or come across this or anything similar before? We are on the fully patched 3.5 version. Thanks Tom",

Secondly, When you answer a question with keyboard input only, you can't tab out into the next question.

Are you someone who regularly uses Jaws to access the web, or are you a non-expert user of Jaws, for example a software developer or tester, who is trying to understand how well Moodle works? If that latter, you need to realise that Jaws is a powerful bit of software that you probably don't know how to use well, and so it is easy to have it in the wrong mode for effectively accessing a particular page, or something like that. Unfortunately, the other thing to realise is that, things change with time, so even if things worked nicely a few years ago (which they did, we got some expert testing done) the web browser, and Jaws, change and there is no guarantee that things still work well, so more testing is welcome. Anyway, your first issue probably comes from having Jaws in the wrong mode. A page of a quiz is not really a form. It is more like a page of content. The second issue: well it certainly used to work properly in the past. If you answered one question, then when the page re-loaded, focus would be on the question you just changed.",

My issue was with the expectation of tabbing through the quiz and hazing the question to the quiz be in focus first, but instead the answers are in focus first. Granted, I can use the up arrow keys to get the question after tabbing to the answer, but is that confusing for a blind person? Do they tab through or arrow through a page more frequently? There must be some place I can learn more about how a user uses JAWs. I would think there would be a tab index attribute set to zero on the labels (quiz questions) so you could tab to the question, tab to the answer, arrow key up and down the radio/checkboxes then tab out to the second question. If this isn't how it's supposed to function then I guess I need to learn more about JAWS.",

We've had this problem on our site, too - several of our teachers inadvertently published their categories which resulted in some confusion (just in your case). If you are an admin of your site, you can easily track down those \"public\" categories in the database - search the mdl_quiz_categories table for any records with publish set to 1 . You will then see which courses they come from and you will be able to contact the teachers of those courses and ask if they really wanted to share their questions with all the other teachers on the site.

This makes sense a) when you teach a number of related courses where you would like to avoid replication of questions and b) when you work in a large institution where \"publishing\" categories for the whole institution site might mean hundreds of items among which it woud be hard to find your own categories, especially if each teacher uses their own naming system for categories.

You may have to create a new account.) Click on Query Issues from the link on the left. Click advanced query page at the top. Type an appropriate keyword into the Title of bug box. Click Submit query, then scan down the list of bugs. Repeat 4-5 for some other plausible keywords. If you can't find the issue already reported, then you need to file the new bug. You do that by starting with the Add a new Issue link from the menu on the left. The bug is much more likely to get fixed in you write a good bug report. The mozilla project has some excellent guidelines for writing good bug reports: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html Obviously a few bits of this are not relevant, but most of it is. The key points are: Make it very clear to me what I need to do to reproduce the bug on my server . If I can't reproduce it, I can't fix it. The kind of detailed steps I gave at the start of this message for searching is the level of detail I would expect. Say exactly what you saw that is wrong. Copy and paste any error message. Screenshots are also good. Say what you think should have happened instead. That is, explain why you think what you saw is wrong. Write a summary which is short, but which says exactly what the problem is. (This is hard, do your best.) File this sort of bug under either Questions or Quiz component. Try to guess which of the two is more appropriate, but it is not that important. They all come to me. I think this is a good example of a bug report: http://moodle.org/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=5688",

          "Text": "Hi all! I am wondering if there is a way/or has been a way for students to 'save answer' as they go in a Moodle Quiz. Having a feature that would allow the students to 'save answer' next to each question was something I noticed Brightspace having that eased a lot of anxiety. I understand that the autosave default is 2 minutes (which we have it set to) or that by students clicking over to a new question page (when Layout is set to \"new page: every question\") this saves their work on the previous page, but if some faculty opt to have more than 1 question on a page or use Long essay style questions - these are both scenarios where students will be on one quiz page for a longer period time. Even having a 'save as you go' button option on the page (and not necessarily next to each question) would be a nice add. We certainly provide 'best practices' to safeguard against this but from a usability standpoint if Moodle Quiz has options for long essay questions or more than one question on a page, I am wondering why not have a 'save question' option' next to each question or on the page to mitigate potential disaster in the event of a connection issue. Would love some additional suggestions or if there is some other settings or features that might address this. Thanks! Marybeth",

I'm finding it hard to imagine exactly why you would want that \"not applicable\" option anyway. Could you provide a real-world example, please? Joseph",

          "Text": "Hi, can anyone please help me. I have moodle 1.6.1+ installed. I develop the courses and the quizzes in my computer (local host ) and take a back up when done. then I restore the same on the server . everything works and appears fine, but the quizzes behave so strangely. first of all, the quiz does not recognize any correct answers. But very strangely, once in a while it does recognize the correct answers, but again, this does not happen for all the questions within a quiz. I think the problem is not with the back-up and restore method I use to transwer work. I say this because I have tried writing a quiz, by directly working on the server and BAM it still has the problem. The stupid module wont recognize the right answers. I should tell you that I have got 'Adaptive mode' turned ON and all the settings relevant to it. The settings of individual quizzes mathces the site wide settings. This arrangement works perfectly fine with my locakhost, but then when its on the server, it simply wont work. I have the same version of moodle installed both on the server and my localhost, namely 1.6.1+. Any suggestions would be much appreciated",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, I’m trying to create an exercise about submerged plane surfaces, where students need to calculate the resultant force and the center of pressure . I would like to use wildcards to assign a range of values to the variables so that each student gets a unique question statement. I have tried creating it with the calculated question type, but it only allows me to enter a single formulated answer. I also attempted using Cloze questions , but I can’t get the variables (wildcards) to take the values defined in my dataset. Could you please guide me on the best way to implement this question so that I can show two answers within the same statement and have the variables take random values for each attempt? The exercise is: A semicircular gate is submerged in turpentine (sg = {SG}), as shown in the figure. The diameter of the gate is {D} m. The vertical distance (HV) from a reference point in the fluid is {HV} m, and the inclined distance (yi) from the same reference point to the top of the gate is {HI} m. The gate is inclined at an angle  𝜃 of {B} degrees to the horizontal. Calculate the Resultant Force and the Center of Pressure. Any suggestions or examples would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!",

I've been part of a group of teachers that has been piloting Moodle over the last half of this year for a district wide launch in the fall. I teach six sections of math, so as you can imagine, I have lot's of reusable questions. As I imported and exported questions to move them from one classfile to another, my questions kept doubling themselves, so that a question category that had 20 questions in it, soon had over 100. The system admins had done all their previous development in 1.8, so when I went looking for a solution to my question duplicating problem, I found the question context feature that John describes, that they hadn't known was added. This is a brilliant feature!! Now, all six of my courses are in a course category called \"Mr. Lavery,\" and I use that category for all my questions now. This allows me to create quizzes in any class using those questions. As an added bonus, I can modify the questions in one centralized location and see those changes reflected throughout all my courses. The one wrinkle we ran into, though, is that of roles. You must have the role of \"teacher\" in whatever context you are trying to use to be able to create question categories . This took us a couple of tries to find. Hope that helps,",

Matt, You don't need the Teacher role in a category context to be able to create questions there. You only need a few question-related permissions. For example, you need moodle/question:add (\"Add questions\") = Allow in that context to allow you to add questions. By assigning the Teacher role in the Lavery context, you get these permissions, but you get over a hundred other permissions that you don't want or need. Also, you become a Teacher in every course in the category. It's a moot point with a category like Lavery, since all the courses in the category are Matt's anyway. But if the category was say Math Dept, then assigning Matt the Teacher role there would have all sorts of unwanted side-effects (like making Matt a Teacher in all math department courses). So you want to create a new simple role with only the question-related permissions allowed and all others Not set, and assign this role to Matt in the Lavery context. Better still, design a collection of simple roles containing different sets of permissions. Role for question creators, a role for question Quality assurance, a role for question users, etc. Now suppose Matt has been assigned the Question creator role in the Lavery context. If Matt is inside one of his six math courses, where he has been assigned the role of Teacher, the category dropdown menu in the Question bank will have a Category: Lavery heading (the context), and under that all of question categories (algebra, geometry, etc.). Matt will be able to add questions to the category. This ability comes from Question creator role assigned above, not from Teacher.",

Why I think there is a problem It all started because I wanted to fix MDL-6368 and MDL-6369 (let question types easily include some CSS and JavaScript ). This caused me to take a long hard look at mod/quiz/attempt.php, and I realised it was a big complicated mess. This makes it difficult to maintain, which leads to bugs. Probably the underlying cause of this mess is that the one file does at least four different things: It checks all the conditions about whether the student can do the quiz (quiz open and close times, delays between attempts, number of attempts allowed, password, IP address, ...) It starts a new attempt, if necessary. It process any data that came from the previous page (if moving between pages of a multi-page quiz, or clicking one of the save/submit buttons). It displays (a page of) the quiz, for the student to enter their answers into. Also, because of 2. and 3. a lot of the time, when you are looking at the quiz attempt page, you are looking at the results of a HTTP POST request, which means that clicking the reload or back button in your browser does weird things. What I am going to do I'm going to split attempt.php into three bits: attempt.php?attemptid=X&page=Y This will just to part 4 above. It will display a single page of the quiz ready for the student to enter their answers. In can only be used to display an attempt, once that attempt has been started. The only checking it will do is to ensure that this attempt belongs to the current user, is still open, that we have not passed the close date, and the time limit has not expired. Instead of checking all the other conditions, we will store in the user's $SESSION a list of attempt ids that have been fully checked. It the student tries to go directly to attempt.php for an attempt that they started in a previous session, it will redirect them to startattempt.php. processattempt.php When you submit the form on attempt.php, it will POST the data to this page. This page just does step 3. above, that is process the responses. Once it has done the processing, it redirects the student pack to attempt.php (or review.php if they did submit all and finish).",

In my Word course, we have two tests (set up as \"quizzes\" in Moodle). They are completely different and both are set up from scratch.  Normally they run fine but occasionally when the course is rebooted for new students those two quizzes become \"linked\". So if I edit one, it makes all of the same changes in the other quiz. So both tests wind up being the mid-term exam (if that was the last edited) or the final exam (if that's the last one I changed). I wind up setting up the mid-term from scratch before they write that, then doing the same thing with the final exam sometime after the mid-term is completed! I have not had this issue with ANY other course. I have also completely deleted them and the issue is still there. Any ideas???  I'm desperate!!! (Oh, and I think we use Moodle 3.1.1)",

Quizzes are shells in which questions are placed. Here is how a problem can occur: You make Quizz01 that includes question A. Then you make a copy, Quizz02, and edit it. Heck! Everything is mixed up! Here is what happens: Quizz01 contains question A. When you copy Quizz01, you get: Quizz02 which also contains question A. When you edit Quizz02, you are actually editing question A and simultaneously Quizz01 because both Quizz01 and Quizz02 contain the same question A! Remember that when copying a quiz, questions are not copied. Only the references to the 'same' questions are copied. What you should do: Label your questions clearly, e.g. 'Question 1 of Mid-term', 'Question 1 of Final', etc. Check that your quizzes contain the right questions. Be careful when copying quizzes, because you also need to make new questions either from scratch or by copying existing questions.",

I have always used the \"Regrade\" feature when I have determined that I had a wrong answer in one of my questions, and students have already taken this quiz with the wrong answer.  My method is to fix the question's answer, then do a \"Dry run a full regrade\".  What moodle shows is those quiz attempts that will be changed when I do a \"Regrade all.\"  These changes are shown with crossed out numbers for the \"Grade.\"  At this point, I can pick those quiz attempts that I want change grades.  Usually, if the student's grade will improve, I check these.  If the student's grade will go down, I leave these along because I don't want to penalize those students who had my wrong, correct answer (this is my method, but others might not want to do this.)  Then I \"Regrade All\". However, if I manually go into a quiz attempt, and for whatever reason manually adjust the points for any one question, this does not show up (in my moodle) with a cross-out.  Nor does regrading over-ride what I had just manually changed. So this leaves me wondering exactly what you are doing, Sarra?  I encourage that you experiment a little to make sure that you know exactly what your moodle is doing.  (I think this is why Tim asked for clarification.)",

Therefore, the actual question is: Is it possible to define a specific question type so that when I upload moodle xml with the questions, it would work? How exactly would the xml look like? The idea can be seen down below <question type=\"essay_attachment\"> <name> <text>Name of question</text> </name> <questiontext format=\"html\"> <text>What is the answer to this question?</text> </questiontext>\n.\n.\n. </question> Thank you!",

Would I simply reupload an unziped quiz module from the 1.3 tgz I have, or should I upgrade the quiz module to a new version of moodle (1.3.1, 1.3.3 etc), and if I should do that, would I simply download the 1.3.3 version and use that quiz module as the quiz module on the download page is only good for 1.4 dev.

Also you should see if there POSTs to /mod/quiz/autosave.ajax.php, Of course if it was enabled.

          "Text": "Hi there, I've been using the zoomify tools to display high resolution images online in some online tests I manage. I've hacked this into the quiz module and thought I would throw it out there in case others could make use of it. Zoomify ( http://zoomify.com ) takes a large, high resolution image and creates a bunch of smaller, lower resolution tiles which are then loaded by the Flash movie as the user zooms in. This means that the individual files loaded are small but the resolution of what can be seen is high. This is great for detailed images that you want a student to be able to view but which would be way too large if you loaded up the full size jpg as one file. I've added some code to the /mod/quiz/locallib.php quiz_print_possible_question_image() function that looks to see if a zoomify file is available and if so, it loads the flash code into the page, if not, it displays the image as normal. I have not extensively tested it and have only tried it using the multiple choice question type so I have no idea what it might look like in other question types but it should be fine. I've attached the source code to this post. Simply replace the existing quiz_print_possible_question_image() function in /mod/quiz/locallib.php to give it a try. You will need to download zoomify, convert an image (works well converting .tif, not sure about other file types), zip up the directory that zoomify creates, upload this to your course, unzip it, create a low resolution .jpg to go along with it, upload that file to the same parent directory as the zip archive (and the new unzipped folder) and add the low resolution jpg to the question as a figure. The zoomify.swf needs to be uploaded to /mod/quiz also. In theory, now when the quiz module looks to display the figure for the question it will find the filename of the low res figure in the database , then check to see if a high res zoomify version is available and if so, it should display it.",

          "Text": "Hi Miguel, Zoomify has a free version (Zoomify EZ) which works very well if you want to take images and individually put them online on a webpage using zoomify as a stand alone flash component. If you want to integrate zoomify with your own flash movies or do more complex server-side integration or have a lot of images to convert then that is when their commercial products come into play. I have only used the EZ version. The moock.org scripts are needed to implement flash plugin detection so that your page can cope if the user doesnt have a flash plug in or has an early version that doesnt handle the zoomify viewer. With plugin detection it will display a message and the lower resolution jpg image rather than having an blank spot on the page with a broken plug-in icon, or similar. This isnt necessary but it is a good way to gracefully cope with the different browser capabilities of your users. Simon.",

Whats really frightening is that it doenst seem that anyone else is having this problem. Any suggestions are appreciated. More information - It seems to have happened because I changed the time after creating the quiz.  I created the quiz and then came back later, before the students started and changed the limit from 'unlimited' to 45 minutes. I wound up having to change the time limit back to unlimited and allow the students a second attempt.",

Can this be done within the Quiz Activity itself (in 3.9)? For example, if each question is worth 10 marks, then the max grade for the quiz is 30. If a student scores 10, 5, 3, 7, 10 then their total grade for the quiz should be 27/30. It would be preferable if there was a solution within core moodle, but I am interested in plugins, if anyone knows any? Many thanks, Michael",

Then create an Assignment activity with no file upload requirement as a place to return the computed 'best of' grades to students, Download a grading worksheet from this assignment, and use the Excel function VLOOKUP (or better yet XLOOKUP) to map the computed grades from the from the Quiz results into the assignment grading worksheet, and import them back into Moodle.",

The custom question type you are targeting will also probably need two small methods to be added to support import and export to Word format, see the All-or-Nothing Multiple Choice Question code for an example. However, the main effort in supporting a new question type is mapping the HTML table elements generated from Word into the corresponding Moodle Question XML elements used in the custom question type in the plugin Microsoft Word File Import/Export (Question Format) . This requires XSLT (rather than PHP) programming knowledge. You can easily see the required XML by exporting a question from Moodle into XML , but then you have to define a Word table structure that incorporates all of the components. If the custom question type is similar to an existing supported type, it is quite easy. But if it isn't then there is much more work involved.",

However, just because they are on the same computer, does not mean that there was any cheating.  One student would have to log out for the other one to log in. When you are setting up the quiz, you can randomize question and answer order which would stop students sitting next to each other to be able to copy.  However, students are pretty ingenious and could easily be taking screenshots and texting each other pictures of the questions or they could just have taken the quiz together at the same time with no supervision.",

My example was if both used the same computer say in the lab or if one borrowed the others to take the quiz or if they shared and apartment or dorm room, etc.  The individuals insist that they were in two different towns, and that each page of the quiz submitted within two minutes of each other was - A submits page 1, within two minutes B submits page 1, etc., was coincidental.  The only way I can think of that occurring with the same computer is using two browsers. I reminded the faculty that if shuffle had been in place it could be a deterrent but that nothing is fool proof and perhaps 'virtual' proctoring should be considered in the future. Again, thanks for the quick response.",

Each question contains a text with gaps (6-10 items) for students to fill in . 2) After the students submit the quiz, they are returned feedback which present the items they got correct or incorrect for each item. 3)  When the students retry the quiz, the students must re-enter all of their answers, even for the items they got correct. My specific question is: how can I change the Moodle settings so that when a student retries a quiz, they only have to correct their mistakes within each question, instead of having them redo the entire question?

          "Title": "Roadmap for future question type INDIVIDUAL",
          "Text": "Today we have the question type RANDOM, with which we can accomplish individual quizes. Especially for numerical questions it could be neat to have another framework for attaching individual parameters of files to questions that use the same question text. This is a feature that my collegue statistics teachers have asked for and together we have come up with a possible model for the solution. As we are dealing with statistics, it comes natural to have individual stuff as individual measurement data on file. Each student gets its own file and then analyzes it according to the question text. For educational reasons it could be a good idea to have the student use the very same data file for a number of questions and quizes. In statistics this gives us the possibility to show the students how the use of different statistical tools end up with different results. We have come up with a specification that contains these key points: As data is to be reused between questions, it should be stored at category level (or simular). When an individual question is created, the individual items are chosen from the individual items that the category offers. The first time a student takes an individual question from the category, he/she will be assigned an individual dataset from that category. Whenever the student later takes another individual question from that category, he/she will reuse the same dataset that was used the first time. An individual dataset will contain a limited number of named items. The names and types of the items are defined by the teacher at category level. Example: The category \"Some Category\" can have four item definitions for its datasets: \"number\" as parameter; \"bloodpressures\" as file; \"time for recovery\" as file; \"age group\" as parameter. I intend to have the parameter number as an automatic default, having number=1 for the first dataset, 2 for the second etc. For each dataset the teacher then needs to upload a file 'bloodpressures' and a file 'time for recovery' and set the parameter 'age group'. If the student later gets the dataset item 'age group' for a question, the student will also be bound to always get the items 'bloodpressures', 'time for recovery' and 'number' from this dataset if he/she later have an individual question that uses any of these. My plan is to start by constructing a page for editing datasets (datasets.php). It will be reached from the \"Editing quiz\" page as shown in the attached example. It will store dataset definitions and datasets in these tables: CREATE TABLE `prefix_quiz_dataset_definitions` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, `category` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0', `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '', `type` smallint(6) NOT NULL default '0', PRIMARY KEY  (`id`), KEY `category` (`category`) ) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Options for multianswer questions' CREATE TABLE `prefix_quiz_dataset_items` ( `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, I continue by creating the quesiton type INDIVIDUAL. When editing the question the teacher provide a question text and also pick the relevant dataset items by names. It is thereafter necessary to define the actual question type and the answers for each one of the datasets in the category. It would be useful to use some kind of file import to define these answers. I cannot offer any format for this but I hope others can come with ideas here. When the questions have got their answers they will be ready to use in quizes. I will go ahead with this now. If you wish I can have things checked in as I proceed or have a huge bunch of code submitted when all is done.",

Using Moodle 3.3, I get access to user and group overrides, but not the settings. I guess I need some other permission outside of the quiz module, but I have absolutely no idea which one. What I need to achieve is to create a role that can change the time limits and other settings of a quiz, but without access to the question database . Yours: Laszlo",

          "Text": "Dear Bill If the poems themselves do not need to be shuffled (same as your \"sorting\"?) then this is achievable. But there is no tiered, shuffling of shuffled sets of questions (containing immovable descriptors). So assuming it is okay that all the students get the same poems in the same order, then.... In between the poems you can then add \"random questions\" which are placemarkers for questions drawn at random from a specified category. Hence after poem one you would add four random questions from the category of questions \"questions about poem one.\" And after poem two you would add four random questions from the category \"questions about poem two\". The categories would have to contain four or more questions. If you want the students to be given questions about diffferent poems either drawn at random from a set of poems, or at least in a radom order then (since there is no facility for binding questions together and shuffling them) you would have to put the poem and the question(s) in the same moodle question. This would mean that you would have only one multiple choice question about each poem. But you could also 1) Have a poem followed by four questions as part an essay question. I don't know about these but I guess it provides the students with a box to submit an answer, a bit like an assignment. The students might then write four answers inside that one box. 2) A poem followed by four questions each with A,B,C,D responses followed by a short answer question to which the correct answer would be \"BCDA,\" or whatever meaning that the answer to the first question is B, the second C etc. You could also set answer variants so that the question also accepts \"bcda\" and \"B C D A\" and \"B,C,D,A\" as correct answers too.

I think that Joseph has written a question type that uses regular expressions. Perhaps that could be used. 3) You could also have a poem followed by 4 questions each with four answers followed by a multiple choice questions with 16 responses four of which would be correct. This in GIFT format (for only two questions) is Jenny kissed me when we met<br /> jumping from the chair she sat in<br /> Time you thief who likes to get <br /> Sweets into your list put that in<br /> Say I'm weary, say I am sad, <br /> Say that health and wealth have missed me,<br /> Say I'm growing old but add, <br /> Jenny kissed me<br /><br /><br /> 1) This poem is about<br /> A.

But there is no way of achieving two tiered shuffling, or shuffling sets, where one part of the set (the poem) stays at the top. Tim",

I do not see this behavior either in 1.6 or 1.7. What are your quiz settings ? adaptative mode on/off? 1 question per page? Students may review: etc. What I see is that when a student enters his answer and hits RETURN the focus remains in the answer input text field. Are you quite sure that pressing Enter makes the quiz proceed to the next question page? Joseph",

Attached, the MS doc with coded exercise (in Italian), screenshots and other data. This is the case (just one example, but it's a recurring problem for all other Embedded Answers exercises): A text with blanks to be filled (20 items). The score is 6 points for the \"perfect\" execution (i.e. 0.3 for each correct answer - but you know Embedded Answers lets you enter the total score (6), but not the partial (0.3) for the single item). I created it, I tried it out several times and also disabled the penalty for wrong answers. Now, if I do everything right, that is 20/20 correct answers, I get 6/6. However, if I perform only 10 right answers I always get a very strange 1.57 out of 6, whether the 10 items left are wrong or blank (i.e. I omit to fill them). I can't explain. Of course it should come 3 out of 6. Any help? Thank you for your kind attention",

Editing the inter-course question bank is limited to a few specialists. We tried to solve this by putting question categories in the course category context for department, but regular teachers who have roles only in their courses can't access it to add questions to their quizzes. Assigning every teacher a role in the department course category is a nightmare. Is it possible to allow users to use questions stored in higher-level contexts without being assigned a role in that higher-level context? Or how this is supposed to be working?",

I note in your article that the template is not complete and that you will continue to update the notes as you go along. A few questions on this: What still needs to be done before this will be ready to use? Do you have a rough estimate of when it may be completed (we all understand \"rough estimate\" doesn't always happen as planned)? I have not done any of this type of development before, is there some reading that I should do or things I should be looking up in preparation apart from the obvious things in Developer Docs? This one is an open question to everyone on the forum - Does anyone else have a need for a question type where the student marks themself against a model answer so that no tutor intervention is required?  This is very useful for allowing a student to see how they are doing in preparation for Exams etc where the answer is not just a single word.

So I started from the shortanswer question type and did the necessary modifications in its various files. This is of course only possible when a new question type is fairly close to an existing one, at least to start with. 2- I am very interested in you new plugin, although I do not quite see what it might look like from the short description you give: \"... a question type where the student marks themself against a model answer so that no tutor intervention is required? \" Would it look more like a shortanswer type or a Multiple Choice type? I'm puzzled and would like to see some real-world examples. Joseph PS.- I agree with Howard that an important consideration is whether to start developing such new question type plugins for 1.8 or straight away for 1.9, considering the differences.",

          "Text": "Hi Joseph Thanks for your post. The question type which I am looking towards would be more like a short answer than a multiple choice question. I have a course which has been paper-based for 30 or so years and we simply want to make an online version of it. It is available in over 50 languages, so having a standard format which would work with Importing questions and answers in a standard format where I am not familiar with the language is key for us. A question would look somthing like this: 1. What name did Jesus give to the Scripture? (John 10:35) Type your answer below: Submit button Student then sees: 1. What name did Jesus give to the Scripture? (John 10:35) The student's answer The model answer Please score your answer: __/1 The complexities that I see which may cause a problem, but are undoubtably solveable, are that: I would like the student to be able to see a form with the Question, Their Answer, the Model Answer and their score at any stage after the quiz for the purpose of printing it or review; There are also notes to the correct answers, but I presume this is where feedback comes in (I haven't used it up till now); Some questions have more than one part eg: 20. List four things from the following verses that God’s Word does for His people. (1) (John 15:3) (Eph. 5:26) (2) (John 17:17) (3) (Acts 20:32) (4) (Acts 20:32) The concept seems so simple to me, but I think that making it a reality may take quite a lot of work.  As you point out, it would be worth keeping the 1.9 developments in mind and I think that while we wouldn't need the funcitionality that the new version brings, it may prevent later upgrade issues? I have seen Ray's post and have tried to contact him.  While I think that his workaround may help in the short term, having to set up groups and monitor new enrolments etc. is one of the reasons that I would like a new question type which stands on its own without any further intervention required.

It appears to me that when I go back into the quiz after completion (as student) and select the Results tab, the Overview is affected by the Separate Groups and I only see the logged in student's quiz, but Manual Grading doesn't appear to be picking up the Separate Groups functionality.

I want to create a quiz which will randomly select 5 questions from each of the topics. How do I do that? So far, I know I can randomise but only from one category and if I have all the questions in one category, there is no guarantee that the student will be equally questioned on each of the topics.

OR Is there a way for the student to edit the answers they have\nalready submitted in attempt #1 after feedback from the trainer? Without making\nan attempt #2 and the trainer having to mark entire thing all over again?

Imagine a tax return with a lot of fields to be calculated and filled in the respective fields. Imagine an accounting student learning how to fill in such a return. We need to put a description with the case, then the student to calculate the respective figures and to fill in the form. And I imagine a quiz of at least 15-20 questions of this type. Of course we need Moodle to check whether all the calculations in the forms are correct or not. Drop and drag on image is not enough - we need Cloze's shortansers on an image or on a PDF, but I am not sure Cloze has such an ability. Assignment is not OK - we need a quiz in order to get evaluation immediately and not manually. Can you recommend me a way to do this? Thanks a lot.",

With this question type, you can set things up so that there are multiple places where the student will have to input an answer. Further, with careful planning, you can set up your question so that it randomly gives different versions of the question to each student to help cut down on cheating.

It's not difficult but you have to get a bit familiar with the coding langages. For text images, PNG format is more efficient than not JPEG. PDF's are special. You need a reader to display them. You may be able to superimpose answer boxes over a single page PDF, much more difficult, if at all possible, if the PDF has more than one page. Anyway, it would be much easier with a PNG image You raise an interesting question. Can PDF \"forms\" be displayed and filled in in Moodle? Probably not, but that remains to be checked. And let's suppose they can, could the data entered in the form be retrieved by Moodle? Anyway, if I were you, I would consider AL's suggestions which will give you a sound solution.",

I have the same problem: I change the parameter values for my wild cards, delete many already generated data points. Then I try to regenerate with the new set of parameters, but in fact my new data points are exactly those previously generated and deleted. I have checked, for example, generating 20 points, deleting 10, changing parameters, then generating another 20. Of the new 20, the first 10 are exactly those I had previously deleted. I tried doing this with all three possible options for how to add a new item (keep previous, regenerate only non-shared, or regenerate all wild cards). My wild card data set is set to shared and synchronized. My moodle version seems to be 3.8 (must verify). Thank you!",

If you visit the feature request linked at the top of the docs page previously mentioned, you will find a patch for version 1.9 which will almost run on 1.8 of moodle too. I have not tested as I developed this feature on 1.8 and we created it for 1.9 as the \"official\" version. So it might be better if you request the patch for version 1.8 that I have here and I can post it in this thread if you like. My 1.8 patch does not take note of groupings. So to notify anyone, you would need to have them as a registered user in Moodle and all in a common role. It is designed to notify supervisors and teachers of all quiz submissions. It does take note of the groupings, but it would be a pain to group by every parent or student so that you can have an email notification to a separate parent for each student.... is possible I guess, but I would not want to administer it. This feature (as is) is more than likely not what the OP wanted if I read it right. Unless he is talking about a small group of parents for a larger group of students and all parents receiving all student notifications (or a different sub-group of students each). Another way of wagging the dog would be if you can control the mailboxes of each student and perhaps duplicate emails with certain subjects. This would also be a bit of a pain in the ..... but could use the \"confirmation\" feature to the student him/her self and copy to someone in the mailbox processing. This is also messy. Personally I would not do that as it is a maintenance nightmare. Hope this helps Graham",

          "Text": "Hi All, I am planning on utilizing the Respondus Lockdown Browser for the quizzes/exams I give in my class this fall, and I've had no plans setting this up. However, I have not been able to find a way to restrict students to using the Lockdown Browser when they review their quiz/exam results. My plan was that I would allow students to review their results only for a short time while we discuss commonly missed questions in class, and then turn this review option off as soon as we were done. This way, the students would only be able to review their results in a Lockdown environment for a short period of time while I am present. I would then be able to protect the integrity of my exam questions. However, based on my experience messing around with Moodle, it appears that as long as the settings are configured so that students can review their results, they can access their results in any browser regardless of whether the original quiz was taken in a Lockdown environment. Another faculty member indicated that restricting review to the Lockdown Browser used to be an option in Moodle, but I can't seem to find it, nor can our IT department. We are currently using Moodle 3.2. Any help or workaround solutions are greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

However, it is marked with a green tick if it falls within the tolerance band of the rounded answer (i.e. the answer rounded to the required number of, for example, significant figures). On occasion, this leads to an answer marked as \"Correct\" but given a red cross and, at other times, to an answer marked as \"Incorrect\" but given a green tick. The frequency of occurrence can be minimised by increasing the number of sig figs but I wonder why this is how things are set up. What advantage does this offer that outweighs the confusion engendered when it's first encountered? I'm new to this, by the way, and find Moodle impressive but I couldn't find the answer to my query after digging round for a bit. Graham",

However, it is a bit of flexibility that not many people take advantage of, so it is not as well tested as using the using the version of the quiz module that shipped with the release. So be even more paranoid than usual about backing up before the upgrade, so you can undo it if anything goes wrong, and testing that everything is working after the upgrade.

I need this to help monitor if students take quiz outside of the assigned location. We sometimes allow the students to do quiz within a confined location. I know we could use the \"Require network address\" under the \"Extra restrictions on attempts\" settings but the challenge with that once it is in use, it doesn't allow the use of password under the group overrides. The lecturers use the password group overrides to ensure that only students who attended the lectures appropriately are allowed to take the quiz but once the \"Require network address\" is in use any one in that location is permitted to take the quiz which defeats the aim.

The various MS-Word quiz solutions that have been developed over the years are fragile. This is because a lot changes inside of Office/Word at each release, e.g., new security policies, changes to the document models on which the macros are based, etc. These macro-based solutions are developed by the open-source/Moodle community, and there are inadequate human resources to update them to follow the changes of Office. One possible solution is to install inside a virtual machine (you'll need IT support help to do this) an old version of Word (e.g., Word 2007, Word 2013, etc.) for which the macro-based solution was developed.",

Inside the VM with Office 2013 (or if you already have Office 2013 installed in Windows 10 you don't need to use a VM) can you try to install the VSTO version of Word-Moodle-Quiz as a setup.exe using the following instructions at: https://github.com/fuhrmanator/word-moodle-quiz#installation--updates - here's a copy of those instructions: Installation / Updates The solution now is a VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) Document-level customization (in Word). It requires .NET 4.0 as well as some VSTO 2010 files to run. To successfully install this on your Windows machine, follow these steps: In Windows, add `http://profs.etsmtl.ca/` to the \"Trusted Sites\" zone (do not require https: ). For more information, see how to add sites to zones . In Internet Explorer (I'm not sure it works with other browsers), download and run setup.exe . You should see a warning that the Publisher cannot be verified . This is normal because currently there is no certificate for this tool. However, you can verify that it's indeed From: `http://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/MoodleQuestions/MoodleQuestions.vsto` If you don't trust this tool, then do not install it. * Download the customized Word document to start creating your quiz questions. If you have trouble installing with the SETUP.EXE file, you can alternately 1) Uninstall the installation if you installed an older version, and/or 2) try installing the MoodleQuestions.vsto . Note this version comes with no guarantees of its stability. Use at your own risk. Documentation The Document-level Customized version of the tool is not yet documented, but it supports most of the functionality documented by Frankie Kam . With a lot of help from my students, I developed this VSTO version (but haven't touched it much for a few years). I tested it again on my Surface Pro 4 just now with Office 2013 (didn't try in Laptop mode though!) and it's working for me (but I'm not using a VM!). Hope this helps!",

The labels in the Word templates are derived directly from the Moodle language packs (as far as possible), so should be familiar to users. The templates are separate from the plugin, so are kept on a different website www.moodle2word.net . At present, they are a bit fiddly to install on a PC, because the automatic installer VBA code recently started being treated as malware, so you have to do it manually. I haven't got around to re-creating all the templates for different languages, but English, French and Spanish versions are currently available.",

Since the quizzes are anyways for test preparation, the feedback or the answer explanation in the DOM would not be a problem. There is no urgency. Whenever you find time, a JS snippet would be great. Currently, I have used an inefficient work-around for the feedback. I have just used the same feedback lines across all the answer options - so it effectively works as a question level feedback. However, since the explanation can be a little lengthy at times, it increases the upload file size and the database size... Thanks!",

The exact number of users depends on your hardware/software/network combination. Usually the amount of memory installed (RAM) is the deciding factor but a faster overall processor speed will also help in reducing waiting times for pages to load. The general rule of thumb for a single server is that the approx max concurrent users = RAM (GB) * 50 and the approx max browsing users = Approx max concurrent users * 5. As an example, a university with 500 total computers on campus and 100 concurrent users at any time will need approx 2GB of RAM on the one server to support the number of concurrent users... Our government has state wide exams. According to the above rule of thumb and with a 100 000 / 50 = 2 000 GB = 2 TB web server or bigger, could 100 000 users take exactly the same quiz simultaneously? Also, would the waiting time for feedback during the quiz be reasonable? Best regards to all.",

However, I’ve noticed that some teachers are regrading attempts that were already assigned 0 points - either automatically (when students leave the answer blank) or manually in a prior grading round. This creates inaccuracies in both records and payment. Is there a way to automatically restrict teachers from grading the same quiz attempt more than once in Moodle - either by locking the grade after the first grading or by disabling access to already-graded attempts?

I agree it doesn't happen with numerical or text Qs. With my CBM mods I distinguish clearly between 'No Response' and an incorrect response, which required some careful programming, and I don't have the problem there. The fact that I was using a clean new 1.9 (without CBM) on this occasion simply reassured me that this bug without CBM wasn't something I had introduced! I think in general it is important not to treat blank responses like incorrect responses, with or without CBM. And obviously it's bad in adaptive mode that an unanswered Q comes to look like a considered answer of zero!  Tony",

The old simple multiple choice quiz questions all show 'missing type' and for the life of me, I can't find an option to select a new multiple choice type for the old questions (100s!).  The edit icon does not show any type menu. Any suggestions? Thanks very much, Linda",

          "Text": "The reason is that question types used to be stored (in the database and in backup files) as numbers. Now they are stored as names. So all you need to do is to open the backup file in a text editor, and look for where it says something vaguely like <QTYPE>2</QTYPE>, and change that to <QTYPE>multichoice</QTYPE>. Sorry, can't remember exactly what the format is, and I can't be bothered to check. The tag something like <QTYPE>, I can't remember what the old number is, but 'multichoice' is definitely the right name to change it to. Some people were talking to me about restoring 1.4.x backups to 1.6 at the UK MoodleMoot, and I think they said that there were a couple of other bits of the file format that had to be tweaked, but it is all easy to do with a text-editor and search-and-replace, if I remember right.",

When people implement new features they are supposed to ensure that the old backup format is still supported, but if they forget, then it ca be almost impossible for someone else to recover the situation, because that other person can't be sure exactly what changed. Even if you want to start with a clean 1.6.1, you could still use backup and restore to copy your old messed around with 1.4.x version into a clean install of 1.4.x. Then upgrade that clean install to 1.6.1. Then, if you like, use backup and restore to copy that upgraded site into a completely fresh install of 1.6.1. Or, as someone else suggested, go via a 1.5.x version. There were lots of changes to the quiz between 1.5 and 1.6, so it is pretty miraculous that restoring 1.5 backups into 1.6 works. Expecting 1.4 backups straight into 1.6 is clearly too much to expect. Obvously it would be nice if it worked, but if it doesn't and if there are workarounds, then making it work is not the best use of the limited developer time.",

When setting up the lesson, Handling of retakes would need to be set to 'Use maximum' so they could eventually wind up with 100%.

But the situation is still inconvenient. I have to create the 4 Datasets for each category, e.g. linearfunctions, rationalcalculation, linearequations, ... It would be nicer to have the datasets independent of the categories or even better have a second type of category for datasets. I had the following in mind: 1. create a question. 2. choose an old dataset by name (with the right dimension) or create a new one with a new name. A workaround would be to create a category for each dataset, create the question in the new category (e.g. ag) an move it (once the bug is fixed) to the category it belongs (e.g. linearequations). I could live with that, but it seems not straightforward to me ;) Thanks again, i'd have never discovered this possibility on my own :) Georg",

The only response I got  was that people have backed up and restored many times - in effect saying the issue does not exist.

We wanted to allow users a more memorable URL so we had set up virtual hosts on apache pointing to the same insatallation which works. However in our zeal I edited the config.php as follows $CFG->dbtype = 'xxxxxx'; $CFG->dbhost = 'xxxxxxx'; $CFG->dbname = 'xxxxx'; $CFG->dbuser = 'xxxxx'; $CFG->dbpass = 'xxxxxx'; $CFG->dbpersist = false; $CFG->prefix = 'mdl_'; $CFG-> wwwroot = '/kmoodle'; # this MUST be something like http://hostmame/... $CFG-> dirroot = '/var/www/html/kmoodle'; $CFG-> dataroot = '/var/www/kmoodledata'; $CFG->admin = 'admin'; ... It was the change to $CFG->wwwroot which broke it - it seems that you MUST have a proper, full, http:// URL here for the quiz to work. It appears that other parts of the site worked but I may be wrong as it was not extensively tested. Does anyone know whether this is the case and whether there is a solution? So now, although users can access the site with a friendly name (one different one for each school taking part), once in the URL changes to the generic one - it would be nice to be able to retain the school specific one. If you want to take a look try any of the below - the Guest course allows Guest access. http://web1t.e2bn.net/kmoodle http://thurleston.moodle.e2bn.org/kmoodle/ http://claydon.moodle.e2bn.org/kmoodle/ Thanks.",

Reformat the \"printed\" exam to match the \"Aiken Format\" (See the Moodle Help for details on the format). For other question types,  follow the first five steps to saving the quiz to a file.  Then open the files in a word processor and use \"Find and Replace\" to reformat the quiz into one of the other available (already developed) file formats.  I use Microsoft Word extensively as I can search and replace formatting charactes such as paragraph marks, line breaks, tabs and spaces. I assume similar operations are available in other word processors. Hope this helps... Cheers,",

In the future I would suggest that if you want students to answer multiple essay questions, then I would using the Diary plugin. It can be set to help you out by doing some automatic grading, but the teacher can easily override it, and any comments are always visible to the student. You can also set up a Glossary of common errors that gets included as part of the automatic grading. Currently a Diary activity can also be set to give automatic time based writing prompts, which I see as being an enhancement when students work on essays. I have future plans to not only have time released prompts, but to also have performance and teacher released prompts, to allow an individual to go on the the next writing prompt.",

Similar to matching but more flexible allowing multiple answers to be matched to a single \"question\". Eg. Standard matching: 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc... Classification Matching: 1= A,D and E. 2= B,C, F. 3= H,I,J etc.. 2) Is it possible to set up hierachical decision trees as questions? Furthermore, in addition to being able to display the usual test results, I need to display results/statistics in the following fashion: How many students took the test. How many passed. How many failed.",

What kind of animal is a cat? a. reptile   b. amphibian     c. mammal - THEN - 2a. What color are its scales? a. green     b. brown     c. yellow - OR - 2b.

Results processing: I don't know about the gradebook. Within a single quiz, there are the various reports under the 'Results' tab. None of them do what you want, but each result is a plugin, so in theory you could write some new ones to do what you want. You could probably cope with the PHP by copying other reports.

As for the USER ID, I am not sure.

You can have as many parts as you want. Parts can use the global variables and local variables (displayed with 'Show more'). Parts have their own text and feedback, and can\nhave multiple answers. They can be thought of as different questions sharing the same random variables. Note that parts can only be displayed on the same page and that they share the same [Check] button. If required, the quiz can be attempted during different sessions, with the same set of random variables, by setting the quiz's 'Attempts allowed' to 3 for example, 'Grading method' to Highest grade, 'Each attempt builds on the last' to Yes and the 'How\nquestions behave' to Adaptive mode which allows students to check one or more answers at a time.",

But as Dominique pointed out you can have as many parts as you want in one unique formulas question. And I must add that a part is not just an input, a part can have several inputs for instance student can enter all the numbers of a matrix as just the answer to one part of a formulas question. Another advice when the question has several parts is to use the adaptive behaviour because even if the question has one unique \"Check\" button students can just enter an answer for the first part and use the Check button to test this answer. There will be no penalty for the not yet answered other parts. Also if a student has the same wrong answer to one part for several \"Checks\" there will not be multiple penalty. You are the first one to ask the ability to access system variables like user ID. Of course it could be done but to be honest I don't think I will be able to find the time to do it. In fact for several months I have not been able to find the time to work on the formulas question type code. My problem is that you can't just say \"This afternoon I will work on Formulas\", to be productive I need to find some hours during several days to first remind me of the current state of the code, read my notes and my todo list and begin to work, and when something is finished I need to do some tests to verify I have not broken something. This explain why for instance I have not yet been able to work on the feedback problems submitted by Dominique Bauer (Sorry Dominique !). On the contrary I am still working on some Moodle coding smaller tasks that only require a few hours of work, for instance this week I submitted a new feature: export of multichoice questions with Aiken format ( MDL-21904 ) but this is all I can currently do.",

If the question is \"Can a set of variables, such as x, y, z, be used across a group of questions?\" the answer might be yes.  I say this because this is what I am doing with the Calculated Multichoice question type. For example, if one wants to use two randomly, let's say x and y, which might take on the values 4 and 5, and then ask: For a rectangle with sides of 4 and 5, 1) What is it's area?, 2) What is it's perimeter, and 3) What is it's maximum distance between corners?, this can be done.  All questions would use the values 4 and 5. There are a few qualifiers for what I say. 1) Calculated Multichoice doesn't create the random variables on the fly, you create this \"set\" of randomly generated variables when you create the question. 2) The questions that are going to use the same set must be in the same question category . Also, the Calculated Multichoice question type takes some study, like 8 hours of experimenting, to start appreciating what it can do. (So Jean-Michel, I can appreciate what you are saying about needing a block of time to get back into an issue.) Having said this, I do want to add that I find this Calculated Multichoice question type to be one of the most powerful \"Moodle built-in, supported\" question type, meaning that it is not an add-in. Well, hope some of this is helpful. (Actually, I am thinking about giving a presentation at one of this year's MoodleMoots on this topic. Might anyone find this useful?)",

          "Text": "I am being sort of lazy but I could not find the answer in MoodleDocs . We are using 1.5 something on one of our production Moodles we use for testing. In one course (Moodle101), we have 30 quizzes on different subjects (say SubjectA, SubjectB and so on). We have stored our questions under one main category called Moodle101, in 30 sub categories labeled SubjectA and so on. It is time to create a final exam. We are going to pull a specific number of random questions from each of our subjects for a 150 question quiz. In doing an item analysis, we have discovered that we have some \"bad\" questions. We don't want to use them in the final. In a couple of other courses I am not involved in, the random questions pull some bad questions. I do not like that. Can I move the bad questions to either a new subcategory without effecting the past quiz? I thought I might create under Moodle101 a sub category called Bad and move those questions there. Or create 30 sub-subcategories under each of our existing subject called \"bad\". Then tell Quiz we only want questions pulled from SubjectA and not it's subcategory called Bad. Is this a good plan? Thanks in advance. Chris",

We have a lot of quiz submissions and it would be helpful to immediately tell in the notification whether it is a first attempt or a second attempt. I have spent some time looking at the language customisation for that string but unfortunately the number of the attempt isn't available as one of the options to customise it - is there a way that I can add more fields to that placeholder object? Also, how can you tell what fields are available in that placeholder object? Is it just the ones listed on the docs page? We're currently using 3.6.4 (Build 20190519), but will likely update once 3.9 is out. Thanks for any help. Andrew",

          "Text": "I am so sure this question has been raised, but I have not seen it yet when I search for it. The adaptive mode is not working in the way I assumed it would. It appears to calculate the penalties based on the question's total marks. So a 3 mark question (with 33% penalties) has -1, -2 applied at try 2 and 3 respectively. The problem is when you have partial marks coded. So I have one example where a student, on her 3rd try, got an answer that would have scored 2/3 if she gave it on her 1st try. The penalty though meant she scored 0, even though she actually worked out a 'valid' answer. My original thought was that the adaptive mode would give 2/3 - 66%, which is 0.68/3. This was important for her, as it was the difference between a pass and fail on her paper. I've had this on other questions. I had a whopper 13 mark 'Moodle formulas' question in adaptive mode that did not work as I thought at all. If the student got, say 5/13 on the first try, then fixed questions so that they would get 10/13, the score became 5.71/13 and not what I would expect 6.7/13. So this is clearly something that is coded into the core and can't just change, so I wonder what my options are moving forward? Is there some other plugin that does what I am thinking? Maybe my thinking is wrong? Maybe students should be penalised in the way it is happening? What I wonder is whether the adaptive mode was considered initially for simple pass/fail answers, and not partial grading which the calculation questions and pattern-match question types afford students. kind regards Gareth",

Still, a reasonable and self-consistent scoring scheme was devised and implemented. If need an option to change this, then you can use the fact that question behaviours are plugins. You could make your won behaviour plugin, which implements a different scoring algorithm.

I think maybe it depends on how the parameters are set. Tim Hunt is responsible for the \"Adaptive mode (multi-part questions)\" plugin. This plugin is required for the Formulas question to work. If I understood correctly, it is quite complex. Everyone who uses the Formulas question is indebted to Tim Hunt for his outstanding work on his \"Adaptive mode (multi-part questions)\" plugin. I'm just guessing his suggestion to write your own plugin stems from the fact that he seems to view any question about his plugin as a criticism rather than a naïve question. Of course, you can always write a new plugin, but I guess that's not exactly the answer you were expecting. If you'd like, I could help you try to clarify how the Formulas question scoring works in adaptive mode. But I'll have to get back to you a little later, because if I don't take care today of the things my wife asked me to do, I might... oops I have to go!",

          "Text": "Hello Gareth, I'm sorry for the late reply, I've been busy a bit longer than expected. Adaptive mode itself works well, at least it follows simple logic. Suppose the students have three tries. They get 100% on the first try, 66% on the second, 33% on the third and 0% on all subsequent tries, or 1, 0.66, 0.33 and 0 point for a question worth 1 point. The scoring of the Formulas question depends on how you organize sub-questions. If several sub-questions are in the same part, a zero mark is attributed as soon as one answer is incorrect. It's an all-or-nothing kind of behaviour. If the sub-questions are in different parts, the score awarded is the sum of the scores for each part, which are awarded according to the adaptive mode rule. It is important to tell students to modify their answers only if they intend to immediately check them. For example, if students clear an incorrect answer and click the Check button, they lose a try (say 33%) on that sub-question because an empty answer box is interpreted as an incorrect answer. If the student got, say 5/13 on the first try, then fixed questions so that they would get 10/13, the score became 5.71/13 and not what I would expect 6.7/13. Suppose the penalty is 33% per try, and students have answered all questions and clicked the Check button. If they got 5 correct answers, they will have accumulated 5 points. Note in passing that the accumulated points can never decrease. If they change their answers, click the Check button and have 5 more correct answers, their score will be 5x1 (first try) + 5*0.66 (second try) = 8.33, not 5.71 or 6 ,7. Overall, it works pretty well. Feel free to ask further questions if my answer is not clear.",

          "Text": "Hi. I'm administrating a moodle platform that was poorly designed. The way it worked before showed repeated questions to students, and now at least I was able to low the chances of a question to be shown twice to the same student. I'll explain the problem briefly: I have a bank of 20 questions, the system is supposed to show 5 random questions to students (there should be 25 questions to be able to use 5 random questions that have 0 chances of being repeated, but I don't have that amount). The old administrator just did 5 questions from the same 20, which is the worse that what I thought (once it was explained to me by my boss how it works now and has worked for years now, I said \"we might have a problem here\"): I divided the 20 questions in 5 groups of 4 (where the intersection between each bank is empty) and was expecting it to work great, but it didn't, since each random question requires at least a bank of 5 questions. so 4 banks of 5 questions where the intersection of those is empty and one bank of the 20 questions seems a little better since the probability of getting the same question twice is now lower, I still don't like it one bit. Can I lower the minimum of questions to 4 in the configuration? I wasn't able to find it yet. Another option would be to use the same bank but to remove the question that was asked every time a question is made, but of course this seems unnecessary since the problem would be solved being able to tweek that.

So when I read in another thread that a bank of 1 or 2 questions could be legible for a random question I realized I was doing something wrong with my random questions and then it hit me... I was using like 5 random questions with a bank of 4 questions and then they would definitely be repeated... dividing the 20 questions in 5 banks of 4 questions wasn't a bad idea after all, since I couldn't find information of people saying that the questions wouldn't be repeated, but the fact that I had this problem tells me that probably moodle is smart enough to demand for more questions in a question bank than random questions, hence, checking before actually attempting and knowing that they would definitely repeat themselves if having less questions in the question bank than random questions feeding from it.",

The new gradebook in Moodle 1.9 lets an activity in Moodle report several scores against several different learning outcomes. So the required change is to extend the quiz to let it do that. The steps involved would be: 1. Work out a new quiz editing interface, so when a quiz is created, you can say this question counts towards this score axis - and do this in a way that does not make the interface impossibly complicated. 2. Change the database structure, so that the new information about the structure of the quiz and the students scores can be stored. 3. Change every place where scores are displayed to display the extra information in an appropriate way. The hard thing here is working out a user interface that is usable.",

The reason I choose to use full pdf of Quiz rather than mere grades is that questions in the question bank are occasionaly changing, and this affect quizes. Also, expired quizes are deleted after semester ends. PDF printouts, IMHO ,  are the best way to archive Quiz answers from the time of completing the Quiz by student.",

The idea is that a calculated question can be dependant of previously answered question (also a calculated one). For example: This question is answered with: a = b + c This question is answered with: d = a + c As you can see, the second question result is dependant of the \"a\" value that the student got at question 1. So this value must be stored and carried among the entrie quiz. I would like to ask dev people for some basic guidelines of the best way of implement this mod on the quiz module (files to mod, data structures to use, database usage, etc...). Every suggestion would be welcome. Greets!",

I cannot check, as after the first attempt all editing or viewing of settings is disabled – very counter-intuitive and plain wrong. My problem is that I think results keep disappearing from this quiz. Today, I had four users who started the quiz and one – myself – who have completed it. In the Edit section I now deleted information from Grade entry windows for all questions as grades are not relevant for me. Now, I have only one user with one uncompleted attempt listed. Why? Can you give me a general advice on how to setup a survey-like quiz with no marking (and, preferably, with mentions of it hidden)? Are quizzes generally reliable? I would hate loosing data that people spent time entering. Thanks for the advice, S.",

There was a list of all requests, with a link that would take me to that particular question and from there, there was the possibility to edit the original question. That request had its own opening and closing dates, but it was somehow connected to the quiz. Right now, all I can do is to create another activity where the students can indeed post their requests, but there will be no link to the particular question for that particular student -- which is a big deal, since the question might be faulty for the particular values of the joker that student had. I have to open another browser tab with the results from the quiz and look for each student. Thanks in advance!",

If I change the structure of variable in the database to a varchar(2000), will it break anything else?  (Which includes the weekly builds we implement from Moodle 3.3 STABLE branch) 2. Does the form in the quiz where we set the subnet from have an input limitation which is coded other than from the definition of the field size set in the database. Any answers from the development side would be greatly appreciated, as I am currently at 247 characters, and still need to add additional campuses, so have had to begin reducing security to entirely too many IP addresses.  ie. instead of 1.2.3.4, I have had to implement 1.2.3. just to cover what we have, and additional IP addresses are coming online as our needs grow.",

As an aside, would I be safer to request an improvement in tracker to be certain it would not cause issues, or is it a try and hope for the best by making the change and seeing if anything goes wrong?",

The general way Moodle works is that it hides its internal IDs from users. So I was surprised when Martin started printing the ID number on the quiz preview. What do you use that information for? You can already get at the id number by hovering over the edit icon and looking at the URL that is then displayed in the status bar (all the way at the bottom of the browser). A compromise might be to put the id number into the lable for the edit icon so that when you hover over it the little tooltip says \"Edit #11\" rather than just \"Edit\".",

          "Text": "Hi Gustav, Its an organization issue I suppose.  The item ID is the \"true identity\" of the question.  The number in the quiz is a temporary alias.  The title (usually the content) of the question works as an identifier if the questions have titles or are dissimilar in wording and you wrote them.  In my case I am tasked with creating item banks and quizzes for anyone who needs help (which right now is everyone).  My first item bank (2 weeks ago) had four subcategories in CNS anatomy (not my area).  Many of the questions were slight variations on one another and used the same response set.  I had begun with 1.4.4, and previewing and testing two random quizzes and a final was very confusing.  When I changed to 1.5 one of the (very many) improvements was that in the preview I could finally see the item ID and know at a glance which item was which.  I couldn't help wishing I could see the ID's with the item bank list on the edit page as well, especially since the list of items is ordered differently depending on the itembank selection: Anatomy Ch 15 displays all 82 items a different order than selecting Ch 15.1, then Ch 15.2, etc. So for me at least, the numerical ID is very helpful when dealing with large numbers of items (we plan to use very large numbers of questions), especially in an unfamiliar content area. I just tried watching the URL while hovering over the edit icon -- I think your compromise might be a good way to go, but a switch at the quiz, course, or admin level might also work: if you don't want the clutter, you don't have to have it, but if the ID is useful to you it can be switched on. Oops! Watching the URL brought up another issue: I had mentioned item ID for both sides of the edit page, but it applies to the quiz side for non-random questions only.  One shouldn't be able to edit a question or get an ID from the quiz listing for a random question -- no need to change anything from what you get now, it wouldn't make sense (item ID might display #? or some such thing).  It makes sense when previewing to have an item id that refers you back to the item bank for editing, because that is an actual instance of a selected item.  But outside the preview, the random question in the quiz is only a placeholder for an item to be selected at run-time.  I realize at present there are ghost placeholder items created in the item bank, but this will likely be replaced in some future version with a cleaner structure.  1.5 already gives the visual impression of having got rid of the the ghost items -- are they added to the item bank from which the random items are to be selected, or are they kept in a separate \"random placeholder\" item bank (which avoids altering the user-created item bank)? Thanks, Jim.",

Checked the following after reading on forum. Cron is running correctly Students affected quiz permission is set correctly and not at preview and identical to students not experiencing the problem. Student does not have multiple roles. Any suggestions welcome. Jonathan",

The easiest way to do this would be for you to export the category in one of the allowable formats (e.g., GIFT), and give the file to your colleague. Your colleague can then import the file into her category. If she truly cannot see the answers to the questions in your published category, that's a bug. What version of Moodle are you using?",

I do remember it drove me crazy when they changed question behavior, years ago, and I had to change all my questions. If I'm not mistaken, in current versions of Moodle, by setting wrong answers to -100% and actually giving a wrong answer, it will cost the student double points for not getting the question right. In other words, if I give a ten question quiz and they get half right and half wrong, their final score will be ZERO, instead of the expected 50%. Let us say I give a ten question quiz. Typically, our grade starts at zero, and as we answer questions correctly, we gain and add points to our score. So, if I answer correctly for the first five questions, with each correct answer my expected total goes up 10%, so that after five questions I am sitting at 50%. Now on question 6, I give a wrong answer and my total goes down to 40% because the penalty for a wrong answer is to REMOVE whatever value that question had towards the total. With each succeeding wrong answer, the total goes down another 10% until after 5 right and 5 wrong, we wind up at zero. Note that doubting my poor memory, I did make two questions and created a quiz. As I tried the the results were: For two correct answers, I got a two point total grade. For one right one wrong, I got a zero total grade. For two wrong, I got -2 total grade.",

          "Text": "Greetings, Here is a request from one of the faculty I support: This is a quiz feature request to let an instructor let a student continue a quiz that has timed out before completion. Several of my students reported losing their quiz data. I'm not certain, but I think my students' problems occur because they are failing to perform a \"submit and finish\" for a variety of reasons. (Some students mistakenly believe that the countdown timer stops after submitting and exiting before doing a \"submit and finish\" and they time out. Other students just lose track of time. My apologies if these scenarios cannot occur.) When I investigate, I see that their exam is still open, but that time has expired, and their score is zero. I am unable to recover the quiz but I am gradually discovering the degree to which I can see through WebAccess item analysis what the student had been attempting at the time of timeout. I usually have to come up with some compromise with the student. So the request is for WebAccess to let the instructor allow the student to continue and finish even after timeout. The version they are now is 1.6 but are going to 1.8 soon.  I don't see this capability in 1.8.  Thanks for any input on this request. Steve Murray",

I have the following scenario: - I have 100 courses, the courses are called say course 1, course 2, course 3... - Each course has the same 30 quizzes. The quizzes are called say Quiz A, Quiz B, Quiz C.... - Each Quiz has 10 questions. The questions in Quiz A are called Question A1, A2, A3, and in Quiz B are called Question B1, B2, B3... - All questions are on Core System context . In total app. 500 questions. - When I have a typo in say question B2, I can correct this typo in Question B2 and the correction will show up in all courses. All this is in German language. I now need to provide the quizzes in English language. What is the best way to do this? I cannot use multi-language filter because it is not working with cloze question type. My current approach would be to: 1. create a new category called Quiz A (English) 2. Export all questions from category Quiz A. 3. Translate the export file from German to English language. 4. Import the translated questions into category Quiz A (English) My concern with this approach is that importing exporting will evolve manual interaction when it comes to images and formatting. Any suggestion? Thanks a lot.",

The reason for having the Quiz's Question name to be HTML style is because the current style, which is text style does not support TeX notation. Teachers are finding difficulties to include TeX notation (those Maths formula or Maths notation) in the Question Heading (also known as Question name). They will also find it hard to extract those Maths questions from the Question Bank to the Quiz itself since the Question heading in the Question Bank is not quite meaningful to them. Do hope to hear some comments on this issue. Thanks.",

Still there's a problem: If people work in the production server the test site will be an old snapshot. You may be able to get the results of the exam and enter it to the grade book manually. Given deep insight in to the working of the Quiz it might be possible to \"inject\" only those attempts in to the running system. I can't even guess how demanding it would be. If the exam asked for file uploads the job is going to be doubly difficult. To the original problem, it is likely that the synchronous exam overloaded the server.

Making the \"Shuffle answers\" option be a category property will however also not please all people because some people might want to use one and the same question differently in different quizzes.

Answers would be shuffled only if both quiz and category chose this. From the point of implementing this an easier alternative to making it a category option would be to make it a question option. Given that it is really a property of the particular question which makes it unsuitable for shuffling, having a question option to turn shuffling off even if the quiz has it on would make a lot of sense.

May I suggest the following for the help file text... \"If you set this option to \"Yes\", then the order of the answers is randomly shuffled each time a student\nattempts a quiz containing this question - provided that \"Shuffle answers\" in the Quiz settings is also set to \"Yes\". This option is not related to the use of Random Questions.\"",

I agree with you however that it would be a good idea to also set the option on the editing screen for new questions to \"Yes\" by default and I will now do that. I will also introduce new help files for these question-level shuffle options. One problem that has always bothered me is that \"Shuffle answers\" is really a bad name for this option in the case of Matching questions. In matching questions the answers are of course always shuffled, the option controls whether the question-answer pairs are shuffled in addition to that. So a better name for the option would perhaps be \"Shuffle question parts\". Can someone come up with a better name?",

Suppose the superset consists subsets for each chapter. Suppose each subset contains 100 questions.

Regarding STACK, my Moodle provider does not provide a MAXIMA pool server which I understand is required.

The only way I can think of achieving the same result using another workflow, is the following: Instead of building one quiz with several sections containing n multiple choice questions each, you bild several quizzes containing ne multiple choice questions each. (sidemark: the number of questions may differ between quizzes). Each quiz is autograded upon submission. You may then generate a general score of the quizzes in the gradebook weighting the score of each quiz and putting the overall grade manually to 0 if one of the quizzes did not reach the pass grade. To do so you would create a category for the three quizzes which gives you a combined total score of the three quizzes. Best regards, Antonia",

It would be possible to create a new Quiz access rule plugin that gives exactly the behaviour you want. If you want a work-around, then at 13:15, you could edit the quiz settings and add a password. That would stop students starting attempts late.",

At the moment, when you submit a blank answer, if you do it the first time you see the question, the system just redisplays the question with no change, ignoring your submit.

I have tried all sorts of methods of telling them to double check their quizzes to make sure they have answered all the questions with not so great results. I've been forced to go into the database and fiddle around and manually reopen the quiz for them. The reason my students are doing this so frequently as I use the quiz for quizzes that they have an unlimited amount of time to take. I have it set to one attempt only, and \"each attempt builds on last.\" This means they can come and go to the quiz working on it a bit at a time, but since the quiz is usually spread out over a number of pages they may come back to it and forget where they were and accidentally skip something and then submit it for review without doing all the questions. Someone suggested allowing more than one attempt, but that won't work for me at all since the quizzes are mostly essay questions that require manual grading so there would be really big problems logistically if I had multiple attempts to deal with. I would like to see either a way of notifying the student they have left some questions blank before they submit and letting them complete those, and/or a way for me as a teacher to reopen a quiz with a single click so that the student can finish the questions they forgot.",

I like to make the penalty for a wrong answer on a quiz .5 points. I can set this in the on-line question editor, but I would prefer to import my questions from a text document and not have to edit each question individually. I import using the GIFT format, is there a way to specify the wrong answer penalty in this format? If not, where do I suggest that? Also, if the above is no, is there a way to set the default in Moodle to be something other than .1? Thanks, Peter Kupfer netm@n's post Hi everybody and espessially Peter! I have exactly the same problem with importing questions by using GIFT format together with setting penalty factor. Furthermore, I need to assign different penalty factor to different question. Any Ideas how to make it. Using 1.5.3+",

The problem is that default value is 0.1 so for every wrong sub-attempt student gets 10% off the total points of the particular question. I think of my own percentage of penalties. They are for multiple choice with one correct answer: 2 choices - 100% penalty 3 choices - 50% penalty I'm thinking of embedding my own code into import filter so it could calculate the number of possible choices for the question and put penalty factor automatically based of that number and rules mentioned above. As for now I've changed database so if new question added the default penalty is .333 because the most popular question of mine with 4 choices - 33% penalty And students like it much - they say \"we could practice until we get right answer and we are agree with those penalties you put\"",

Our quizzes are set in sequential mode.  Students click on the Next button and then claim that the system is skipping a question.  Now, whether this is a glitch or finger trouble is something that we can argue, but the fact is it will start an avalanch of students skipping difficult questions and putting us in a tough spot.

We're running Moodle version 1.9 (soon to be 1.9.1) and I have a question about setting up a quiz to work as a post-course evaluation. I haven't worked with the quiz module much...but looking at our copy of the Moodle: E-Learning book it says you can rig up a quiz to act like a course survey. So I've got three simple short answer questions, and I want the professors to be able to review what the students said...but I'm not sure how to get the student responses to display for an instructor...and the easier it is to do this the better because my instructors aren't terribly Moodle savvy. I tried running a report for the quiz/eval but I don't think that was the thing to do. Oh and installing the third party evaluation/polling module isn't an option unfortunately because our sysadmin has some reserves about customizing Moodle.",

That makes sense with its\nintended purpose to display messages concerning the result of the\nstudent. But still it would be nice, if the feedback could be displayed without the need of an already (automatic) corrected test. A\nworkaround right now can be done, when I set 0 points for the essay\nquestion. That way I get all the results from a test and the overall\nfeedback will be displayed.

My answer was the same as Gustav's: add pagination to the tests. ;) But at the same time I think that adding support for question anchors should not pose a difficult problem (am I mistaken?), and it seems to me that it would fit fine into the adaptive mode quiz usage. Some questions (e.g. cloze or questions containing pictures) tend to be rather long and -- in an extreme case -- the \"pagination approach\" could lead to having one question per page as Gustav suggests. But in tests containing a number of questions (e.g. language drills) this could produce far too many pages to navigate through.",

They say that last time they could see all questions in a quiz and now it is not really convenient for them to navigate from one page to another just to see what the questions are. Another inconvenience is that it takes more time for them to solve the same number of questions. So I need to increase time. Third thing to note is that they do not really know what particular question in a quiz is already been answered and what is not. If it could be possible to Highlight the question/page number somehow to make them know!!! Another thing they ask was: Can we choose the way questions are displayed between one or many? Like # items to display per page? - Is it good idea? Of course it would be perfect if anchors were embedded as well. Good thing is that having one question on one page leads to reduction of traffic and database load. Your opinion on that?",

          "Title": "Excessive Growth in mdl_question Table After Upgrading to from 4.4 to 4.5",
          "Text": "Issue Summary After upgrading from Moodle 4.4.2 to 4.5 , we have encountered an extreme and unexpected increase in the `mdl_question` table size, leading to major performance concerns. Before upgrade : The table contained approximately 400,000 rows . After upgrade : The table has grown beyond 11 million rows in just a week or so . Key concern : The issue seems to occur when creating and duplicating quizzes , even before students attempt them. Observations & Testing We ran controlled tests in both Moodle 4.4 and 4.5 with identical quiz creation steps: Added a quiz with two questions from the question bank (no randomization). Moodle 4.4 : Number of rows does not change. Moodle 4.5 : 60 rows were added to `mdl_question` and related tables. Duplicated the quiz within the same course : Moodle 4.4 : Normal behavior. Moodle 4.5 : The duplication process added 120 more rows . Duplicated the quiz again : This time, the table grew by 240 more rows . It appears that each duplication exponentially increases the number of rows in `mdl_question` . Key Considerations Answering the quiz does not seem to be the trigger— the growth happens upon creation and duplication . The exponential increase in records suggests redundant or unnecessary question entries may be created in the database . We previously had hundreds of thousands of redundant rows before the upgrade, indicating that this issue may have been affecting us even earlier, but it has become much more severe in Moodle 4.5 . `mdl_question_bank_entries` has also grown significantly, mirroring the pattern in `mdl_question` . Questions for the Community Has anyone else observed excessive row creation in `mdl_question` after upgrading to Moodle 4.5? Is this a known bug or a schema change in Moodle 4.5 that affects quiz duplication? Does Moodle 4.5 handle question versioning differently, possibly duplicating questions unnecessarily? Are there safe ways to clean up `mdl_question` without breaking existing quizzes? Have there been changes made to how Moodle duplicates Quiz's? Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

          "Text": "Newbie here. Trying to set up Moodle to deliver private tuition. Hoping to offer bespoke formative quizzes based on bespoke combinations of questions based on learners individual needs. To charge a fee for these quizzes I think each student probably needs their own 'course' creating? Main Q is, how best to compile/categorize large Q banks that these individual courses will draw from to create bespoke quizzes for individual students within their courses. Assuming that individual student-specific courses is the way to go for this project, does Moodle's allow Q banks that can easily be drawn on across multiple courses? E.g., perhaps via 'Core System context '? Possible alternative approach? Use access rules within a course to deliver chargeable items to individual students? For example, students A and B both registered on the same course but student A needs to purchase quizz X whereas student B needs to purchase quizz Y. Does Moodle allows that functionality via payment gateway etc or can students only buy whole courses? Likely that I'll be the only person constructing courses, Q banks etc so permissions probably not an issue here. Thanks!",

If your setting is like that, you can enable notifications when a quiz is submitted . You can enable this as an admin for everyone or only for those who want it and for specific quizzes, which is my preferred option. I don't get a \"bell\" notification because I have disabled internal notifications in Moodle, I get an email - I guess this can be configured as well. From my experience, the best way to check if a user has this feature enabled is to check his/her preferences and see if the permission is \"on\".",

However if you insist on using category export/import, you could do it in four steps: (1) export/import the questions (2) zip and download the images from the old site (3) upload and unzip the images on the new site. All image links will be broken on the new site after step (3), so you'll have a fourth step: (4) manually repair all broken image links. Backup/restore SHOULD handle image relinking, but I have needed to repair certain links following backup/restore (and I'm not sure why).",

          "Text": "Hi all, I help support a Moodle site and my client called in a panic yesterday because he deleted a question that was part of a quiz users had already taken. Here is the background, he had a quiz of 35 questions that was randomly choosing the questions from a question pool.  After users had already started taking the quiz, he realized one of the questions did not have the correct answer.  He was not sure what to do so he deleted that question.  Then he hit ReGrade. Now he is wondering if the grades are accurate or if he needs to make adjustments for the question he deleted. My questions are this: 1) why was restore not available for the question he deleted?  I see other questions greyed out with the restore icon but not for this question. 2) If a user got that question on their quiz (because he used random question, not everyone would have gotten the deleted one), what happened to their grade when he deleted the question and Regraded? 3) What does it mean on a user's quiz results when it says \"This question has been deleted...\" but there are no marks for that question? (not correct nor incorrect) We seem to have a few questions that were deleted (even though he says he only deleted one) and I have no way to tell which question it was. Thanks for any thoughts.  Sorry for so many questions. Terry",

          "Text": "1) If Moodle can detect that a question is in use, then when you ask to delete it, it just marks it hidden instead of really deleting it. If a question is marked as hidden, then it can be undeleted. Unfortunately, the way things are stored in the database , it is almost impossible to tell when a question has been used by a random question. This is MDL-5780 . 2) I didn't actually know what happens in this situation. Looking at the code, it seems that it regrades any questions that still exist. Any questions that have been deleted are not regraded, so the score for them is not changed. 3) What happens here is that, on the review screen, it displays this message in place of any question that was deleted. However, the score that the student got when they attempted that question is still stored in the database. If you want to poke around in the database, then student responses and scores are stored in the mdl_question_states table, and for random questions, the answer column starts random123-, where 123 is the id of the question that the student actually saw. That is, the 123 bit refers to the id column of the mdl_question table.",

          "Text": "This post is probably only of interest to quiz module developers, not to most users. The quiz module often has a need for knowing whether a particular question is in use. For example when you want to delete a question the code first checks whether that question is already being used. If it is it will allow you to hide the question but not to delete it completely because otherwise all the data about student attempts at the question would become inconsistent. Now there is a problem with random questions which in an actual student attempt are replaced randomly by some question from the chosen category. The quiz module code currently has no efficient way of finding out whether a particular question has been chosen randomly in a given quiz. There is a table quiz_question_instances which one might think would do the job but it does only record the random question id, not the id of the questions that was actually used in the various student attempts. So I propose to introduce a new table quiz_question_attempts (later to be recalled just question_attempts once I get the go-ahead for separating questions from quizzes) with fields 'question' and 'attempt' which gets an entry whenever a question is used in a student attempt at a quiz. This table would then make it easy with one database query to discover whether a question is in use.",

          "Text": "Yes, I have this issue as well. We would like to be able to create a category called clubs. In version 1.6 it looks like this will be addressed as you can make certain modules inactive for a course. I cannot think of why a club would need to write a quiz. Melissa's option of setting up a category is also promising. It would be difficult to make this a course setting (for example a variable of AllowPublishedQuestionUse) as usually the teacher controls all of the variables for a course. This also ties in to some of the work being done with the quiz module to pull questions out of the quiz module so that they could be used by other modules as well. It would be nice to say that a certain bank of questions are shared with a specific list of teachers. There are many possiblities and I am grateful that this issue is being discussed/pursued. Peace.",

          "Text": "Hi Guys, We've got a large question bank with nearly 3000 questions and growing, organized into a tree of categories at the system context level, and administrating it is now putting quite a strain on our server . I'm looking for advice on if there's a better way to structure our question bank to work more efficiently with Moodle. We provide personalized courses to language students, so rather than one large standardised course that all students follow, each student has their own course to which activities are duplicated. To facilitate this, we're heavy users of the Sharing Cart block. To avoid duplicating the data of every quiz at the course level, our questions are stored under the system context for universal access. However we've now come to a bit of a hurdle, as it seems when you backup a quiz in Moodle, it also backups up every single object in the included questions' context. That means for every quiz we copy into a student's course, Moodle goes through the process of backing up our entire database , bringing the site to its knees. Currently, our question bank is structured a bit like this... Beginners Vocabulary Adults Animals Numbered subcategories containing 6-8 questions each Drinks Numbered subcategories Fruit Numbered subcategories Vegetables etc, etc. ...and so on and so forth. Prepared activities are stored in a similarly structured category of hidden courses, which our teachers then use to copy the desired activities into their students' classrooms. The only \"solution\" I can think of is to store the questions of our quizzes at the course level context. We'll end with lots of duplicate data & a rapidly growing database, however at least Moodle won't be brought to its knees every time we try to copy a single quiz of just a couple of questions. Can anyone think of a better way to do this? (Related links: How to minimize the question bank when doing backup/restore , [MDL-41924] , [MDL-12403] )",

Do not routinely include questions banks in course backups. As an admin, go to, Site administration > Courses > Backups > General backup defaults, and remove the check mark for, Include question bank.

When a student logs in, they select an answer and click the \"Check\" button. Based on my understanding of the settings ( https://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Quiz_settings ), the general feedback back text should appear to the student upon clicking the \"Check button. Currently the general feedback only appears once the \"Submit All and Finish\" button has been selected. My questions are: 1. Should the general feedback be appearing when the check button is clicked? If so, how do I correct this to make it happen? 2. If that is not the intended behavior, how do I correct the quiz so that the student can receive non-answer based feedback (general feedback) for each question prior to submitting the quiz Thanks!",

In Moodle, click on the \"Edit\" button next to the quiz and select \"Edit quiz\". Click on the \"Edit\" button next to the question you want to display as an image. In the \"Question text\" field, click on the image icon (a picture of a tree) to open the file picker. Upload the image of the question from your computer to the file picker. In the \"Question text\" field, add any additional instructions or text for the question. Click \"Save changes\" to save the question. Repeat these steps for each question you want to display as an image. When students take the quiz, they will see the image of the question along with any accompanying text or instructions.",

          "Text": "Please don't be offended as it is also very interesting to see what AI responds. If you ask ChapGPT: Q. Is displaying the quiz questions as images available in MOODLE? A. Yes, it is possible to display quiz questions as images in Moodle. You can insert images into quiz questions using the \"Image\" option in the Atto text editor, or by uploading the image to the \"Files\" area in Moodle and then inserting it into the question using the \"Insert image\" button. To insert an image into a quiz question using the Atto text editor, follow these steps: Click on the \"Edit\" button next to the quiz you want to modify. Click on the \"Edit\" icon next to the question you want to modify. In the Atto text editor, click on the \"Image\" icon. Select the image you want to insert from your computer or from the Moodle files area. Enter a description of the image in the \"Image description\" field (this is important for accessibility purposes). Click on the \"Insert\" button to add the image to your question. Once you have added the image to your question, you can format it as needed using the Atto text editor. Note that it's important to keep the file size of your images small, as larger images can slow down the loading of your quiz. You may also want to consider using alternative text for your images to ensure that they are accessible to all learners, including those who use screen readers. Q. Thanks, but I already know of this. A. I apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Moodle does not have a built-in option or function to display multiple-choice questions as images instead of text. However, there are third-party plugins available for Moodle that can allow you to create image-based multiple-choice questions. One such plugin is the \"Image Map\" question type, which allows you to create multiple-choice questions where learners click on different areas of an image to select their answer. To use the Image Map plugin, you will need to install it on your Moodle site and then create a new quiz question using the \"Image Map\" question type. You can then upload your image and create clickable areas for each answer option. Please note that third-party plugins may not be supported by Moodle and may have limited functionality. It's important to thoroughly test any plugins before using them in a live course.",

Now, in ver. 1.4.1, I see that javascript is eliminated from the body of the question. Of course, I could replace the button with a link (like <A HREF... TARGET=\"_blank\"> ) but I cannot control the size, the menubar and the toolbar of the popup window. Is there any way to use javascript in questions? Is there other solution for my problem? Thanks!",

To improve the usability of the question editing forms, we probably need to make this general mechanism more flexible (basically allow more than two categories) without making it too complicated for users, then harness that in the question types.

          "Text": "Sharing is defined as the joint use of a resource . If I share my lunch with you, we both eat from the same plate.  If I make you a sandwich just like mine, it is another form of charity, but it's no not sharing. In the same way, \"sharing questions\" means using the same questions, not copies. On our moodle site, we share questions.  Course #1 has a large question database .  Categories are published so they are visible to all teachers.    Only the editing teachers of course #1 (so far, only the site admin) can add, delete, modify, or re-categorize questions.  Teachers in other courses use these questions to create quizzes for their students.   The teachers see read-only questions in read-only categories.  If a teacher finds a mistake in a question, they report it to the site admin, who fixes it.   The mistake only needs to be fixed once, and the question magically is fixed in every quiz in which it appears. So far, everything works beautifully.  However there are some special quizzes (example: the Final exam), which must be identical in every course.   How can this be guaranteed? I experimented with two possibilities: Create the Final in course #1 and allow teachers to Import it. I can't imagine a worse solution.  First, we would have to make the teachers editing teachers of course #1, which would compromise the security of the question database.  Second, Import copies the questions, not just the quiz.  Furthermore, it copies all the other questions from the same categories, and it creates local categories for these questions. Create the Final in course #1, Backup course #1 with just this quiz, put the backup in a public place, and allow teachers to Restore (adding content to their courses) from the backup. Except that teachers don't need to be made editors in course #1, this solution has all the disadvantages of Import . I fully expected Import and Backup/Restore to copy activities , but until I experimented with them, I had no idea that they would make such deep copies.",

I'm testing it with a couple of test student logins, one of which has produced viewable results, one did not. I completed each one and clicked 'submit all and finish', both looked like they were submitted correctly. When I click on the Quiz then select 'Results/Responses' from the cog dropdown menu I only see one row of responses in the table. I can't work what the difference between these two submissions were, or, where else the issue might lie. Can anyone offer some clues? Many thanks",

          "Text": "If the wildcard comes up as 27, it presents as 27, not 27.0. This means the significant figures in the answer are incorrect. Sue's comment made me take a closer look at the significant figures workaround for the Formulas question. I worked in javascript . First, Javascript has the toPrecision() method. It adds trailing zeros, for example: \n```text\nvar Number=123.45;\nNumber.toPrecision(6)   // returns 123.450\n```\n Unfortunately, \n```text\nvar Number=123.45;\nNumber.toPrecision(2)   // returns 1.2e+2 instead of 120\n```\n 1.2e+2 is not wrong. It simply is in exponential format, which often would not be as convenient as the decimal format. I worked out the following javascript for significant figures with trailing zeros and the decimal format maintained: \n```text\n< script >\nvar x={z};                                               // x : number to round\nvar s = {nsf};                                           // s : number of significant figures\nif (x == 0) {\n  xr = 0;                                                // xr : number to round (= 0) \n} else {\n  var a = s-1-Math.floor(Math.log10(Math.abs(x)));       // Inflate/deflate exponent\n  var b = Math.pow(10,a);                                // Inflate factor\n  var c = Math.pow(10,-a);                               // Deflate factor\n  var d = Math.abs(x)*b;                                 // Inflate\n  var e = Math.round(d);                                 // Keep significant digits\n  var f = e*c;                                           // Deflate\n// Trailing zeros\n  var g = e.toString();\n  var h = g.length;\n  var z = \"0\";\n  if (a==0) {xr=g+\".\";}                                  // Add \".\" Ex.: 200 w/ 3 sig fig = 200.\n  if (a<0) {xr=g+z.repeat(-a);}                          // Trailing zeros\n  if (a>0) {\n    if (a<h) {xr=g.substr(0,h-a)+\".\"+g.substr(h-a,a);}   // No trailing zeros required (x > 0)\n    if (a>=h) {xr=\"0.\"+z.repeat(a-s)+g;}                 // No trailing zeros required (x < 0)\n  }\n  if (x<0) {si=\"-\";} else {si=\"\"}\n  xr=si+xr;                                              // Add minus sign\n}\n< /script >\n```\n This script seems to work like a charm.",

Whereas with 120, the number of significant figures is not clear since it could be 2 or 3. My apologies, toPrecision() is fine. Yet, in many cases we would like to keep the decimal format, and 120 would be preferred over 1.2e+2.",

Of course that function would return a string not a number to be able to display the right number of trailing zeros. This would not require a lot of work. In fact just to translate your code to php. My idea in adding the poly function was that if formulas already has a lot of math functions it somewhat miss some functions to ease the display of questions. The toprecision function seems to be a nice addition in the same area.",

If the rule is applied, the precision of any number is between 0.05% (for example 199.9 ± 0.1 = 199.9 ± 0.05%) and 0.5% (for example 200 ± 1 = 200 ± 0.5%).

We could draw inspiration from the calculators' display, such as HP and other calculators, in scientific notation and engineering notation. The javascript function toPrecision(), or a similar function, can only be a one-size-fits-all solution which has some gaps.

The author inserts an audio file into the question's description area as usual, and surrounds it with Poodll filter tags.

It is keyboard navigable and should work with screen readers (I will check) but there are no further accessibility features.",

Another way you coudl have tracked the plays, is to use a Moodle user_preference. There is a core_user_update_user_preferences web service which can be used from JavaScript . (E.g. for example https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/contentbank/amd/src/sort.js#L167 ). That would protect against people switching browser.

Its suite of plugins includes tools for audio and video recording, vocabulary learning, and assessment of speaking and reading. It is a Moodle Certified Integration ↗ . I also designed a client-side workaround which is to only show the play and pause buttons and let Moodle count in a quiz how many times the audio is played. It would be desirable to have the solution on the server side. However, one thing to consider is that students can easily record an audio with their phone and then play it back as many times as they want. See Limited number of audio plays ↗ .",

Since each of our courses has a \"final\" quiz I think this would be the logical module to add the code to. I have a few ideas on how to implement this but need some help on the details. Here's what I'm thinking: 1. Add two fields to the quiz table: \"Final_quiz\", \"Send_email\" 2. Add the same two fields to the quiz mod.html and edit.php script so that the teacher can designate if this is the final quiz and they want email to be sent. Here's where I get lost. Where is the sql function that stores the quiz grade? I'm thinking that here is where I can add a call to a function to send an email of course completion.

A module where the editor can add several tests (quiz module) which would be selected according to the month of the year. This would allow for a test rotation during the year. When the student displays the module, he would see the quiz according to the month, the others would be hidden. Example: The module contains 3 tests, the first of which would be used for the months January, February, March and April. And the other 2 would be respectively used for the months May, June, July, August and September, October, November, December. Depending on when the student takes the test, the module chooses the right test to use. Can anyone tell me that the \"Content bank content types\" plugin type can do the trick by specifying that the content type is of the \"Quiz module\" type? If not, can you tell me what would be the best way to achieve my goals? Thank you",

The page will load for a very long time, and eventually time out with an error box that almost immediately disappears. Sometimes this box is empty, sometimes it says \"unknown error\". We've tried enabling errors as described in Debugging - MoodleDocs and repeating the above steps, but that still does not display any errors at all. Not in on the web page, nor an error_log file. I'm not even sure where to begin troubleshooting this if I can't get it to throw any errors. I'm running Moodle 3.1.3+ (Build: 20161202).",

It gets weird, though, in terms of the Moodle in which it appears. The Production Moodle (Windows Server 2012R2 running IIS , MySQL 5.6.29, PHP 5.4.33 and Moodle 3.1.2+) has no problems. Dev Moodle 1, which was a clone of the production Moodle, first saw the error. The clone was created by copying the moodledata directory to the Dev server (Windows Server 2012R2, IIS, My SQL 5.6.21, PHP 5.4.33, Moodle 3.1.5+) and using a MySQL Dump from the Production server with the Dev server's URL inserted by text substitution before import into the database . This migration was done twice, with the error occurring every time we tried to delete a Quiz in the Dev version. Dev Moodle 2 was then tried, where instead of a clone with URL substitution we created a new Moodle 3.1.5+ (CentOS 6.4 Linux, Apache 2, MySQL 5.6.34, PHP 5.4.45) and restored the courses 1 by 1 from backups from Production. During the Restore process we excluded Student data. In this Dev Moodle, the error still occurs every time we try to delete a Quiz. Additional detail: when the error triggers on the Linux server, the mysqld process starts consuming 99% of the processor resources. Nothing happens int he browser except the \"loading\" circle going around and around. If I give up and use the Linux command line to restart mysqld, the server becomes responsive again, but the Quiz reappears on the Course page. Suggestions? Questions?",

          "Text": "Hi there! On Moodle 4.4.1+ quiz settings pages are not scrollable on iPad Pro 12.9\", iOS 17.5, iPad 10.5\", iOS 15.0 using either Safari or Chrome . This occurs in both Boost and Classic themes. The only scrollable area is inside the Atto editor; the rest of the form remains locked, even when tapping outside or trying to swipe. Tested on: Moodle 4.4.1+ (clean install, no custom theme) iPad Pro 12.9\", iOS 17.5, iPad 10.5\", iOS 15.0 Safari and Chrome Boost theme (default) Classic theme Attempts to fix (none successful): Custom CSS to force `overflow-y: auto` and `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` JavaScript to manually enable scroll on `.mform` , `.card-body` , `#region-main` Switching to Classic theme per user Creating new admin user This appears to be an iOS-specific bug caused by the way Moodle's form layout and containers are structured. It prevents any meaningful quiz editing on iPad, requiring desktop access to perform basic admin tasks. Steps to reproduce: Log into Moodle as an admin on iPad Pro 12.9\" Open a quiz and click on \"Edit settings\" Attempt to scroll the settings form Only the Atto editor scrolls; all other parts of the page remain unresponsive. Is this a known issue?? Thank you so much in advance, Tiziana",

I was trawling through all the configuration pages trying to get a feel for all the options available (I had too much time on my hands that day!) and I came across the answer.  Try going to Configuration/Variables and then scroll down till you come to a setting called \"slasharguments\" which is to do with the way Moodle searches for any uploaded files.  Our default setting was the second one in the pop-down list [file.php/pic.jpg] and we couldn't get pictures to display.  The guidance to the right of the pop-down list solved the problem - I switched the setting to the first option [file.php?file=/pic.jpg] and the problem was solved.] Note: according to the FAQ on \"slasharguments\" this can lead to problems using relative links within HTML documents. You can link to the FAQ directly from this poting as the word \"slasharguments\"on this page should be a hyperlink.  This gives details of how to fix the problem at the server side.  We haven't done this yet (as we don't host our Moodle site) but I'll try and remember to let you know if we sort it.  I have to say it was great to see the images appear.  They add hugely to the Moodle experience and the glossary I was working on has been transformed! Hope this helps.  Let me know if it solves the problem. Chris",

Somehow the autoincrement value has\ngone down by many numbers. I’m not a database specialist at all. Just trying to\nunderstand some basics. My first approach was to delete the entries in the\ndatabase with the ID-number given in the debug-info. But then always the next\nnumber would be the problem.  And there\nwere much higher ID-numbers in the table. That’s why I decided to truncate the\nwhole table. The question is why the autoincrement value went down\nso far. And one explanation would maybe be, that when importing the quizzes to\nanother course the question_attempt_steps were somehow also copied, so when\ntrying to start the test again in the new course that would lead to those duplicate\nentries. And that would probably be a bug. I have no idea how to reproduce the error on\nqa.moodle.net.  What I have done, was\nuploading  the course into a fresh Moodle\ninstallation. And there everything works fine of course. So a.t.m. for me the only solution for my production\nMoodle would be to also truncate the tables · mdl_question_attempts · mdl_question_attempt_steps · mdl_question_attempt_step_data · mdl_quiz_attempts to get the quizzes working again. The question is how that could affect this Moodle installation\nin other places. It’s working well in my copied Moodle, but things may be different\nwhen hundreds of participants are working in the system. So what do I really risk?",

But my original import was not from a backup but an import\nof activities directly from a running course to a freshly created course in the\nsame Moodle.

It looks more complicated to use and setup than Respondus, for everyone involved. I really haven't found an easy to read \"this is how you set it up and use it\" as the teacher or student. 4.

I have dealt with commercial companies, and I heave dealt with Open Source projects, and I know which generally gives better support. Commercial support sucks. Getting online exams to work with students own computers, and wifi, is definitely still hard, not routine. But, it can be done with either Respondus or SEB. Getting and configuring a particular secure browser is the easy part. The real problems are the same in both cases: How do you make your wifi reliable?

I want to find out if there is any plugin available which can be used to compare student responses and tell the instructor about the likelihood that part or all of the answer was copied from another student, or has common features that warrant further investigation. It is impossible to specify this completely as I am looking for any helpful tool that could help. Needless to add, the essay type question will be manually graded, so something that generates a summary map pointing to attempts of concern would be most helpful. The instructor has to obviously exert the final judgment, but a supportive tool is helpful when you have a very large number of students, and by the time you are grading the 133rd attempt, you have mostly forgotten about the 15th. I have looked at the auto-graded essay type question and that is not what I want. The bigger concern here is students copying from each other, rather than from some known source(s).",

There\nis no resource issue with servers and there was plenty of CPU headroom\nthroughout this time. We have checked the environment and nothing was amiss.

I am an IT student at Borrego Springs High school, & w e are beginning to use moodle as an online tool to administrate a school wide quiz to regulate computer control. You see, we are restricting certain individuals that think that they will not get Caught by our blocks, so they do get caught & we suspend their Computer privileges. So far it has been working, but to make this easier we are going to issue cards to have on their [the students] persons at all times at school. I have been issued as the person that will put the quiz into moodle.learningtech.net & then tell the students where to go, etc.The quiz we are using we got from a seperate school & is a HTML format document on a CD. So far I have run into several problems. Mainly because I'm about as deft at HTML editing as a potato, so I have run into some snags while inputting the quiz text into moodle. For one thing, I do not know how to make the submit button send the results to our server , or any server for that matter. Also, when I save the changes, all the buttons disappear! Can someone please assist me in my query?",

When a student wants to start a new quiz attempt and clicks the button Start attempt, he is redirected to ../moodle/mod/quiz/startattempt.php (from mod/quiz/view.php?id=x). On this page the white screen awaits him with only an instruction to click the Continue button to be redirected on actual quiz page. When he clicks Continue link button he gets to his quiz link with questions (mod/quiz/view.php?id=x), if not he stays on the white page (moodle/mod/quiz/startattempt.php) infinitely. It occurred after my update to actual 3.3.2 version, before there was no such redirection issue. Did anyone has the same issue and how to solve it?
