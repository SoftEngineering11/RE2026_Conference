          "Text": "G'day all, I'm attempting to move a large SQL report-generating query from Ad-Hoc Reports into a cron job, but am butting my head trying to get even the simplest query to work properly. For some reason, any queries I add, as per following, return a \"1\", aka var_dump of \"bool(true)\", despite the queries working fine in phpmyadmin? A few things to note; this is added to the end of an existing lib.php triggered by cron, which contains another sql query which works fine - is this an issue?  Other sql uses $DB->get_recordset_select. Here's a simple example; am I doing something stupidly wrong? \n```text\n$sqlreport = \"SELECT\n c.shortname AS 'Course ID' FROM {course} c\";\n\n\n$reportresults = $DB->execute($sqlreport);\n\n\nmtrace($reportresults);\n\n\nvar_dump($reportresults);\n\n\nfile_put_contents($reportfile, $reportresults, FILE_APPEND); //create report file\n```\n It seems that \"execute()\" is the correct method to use for arbitrary queries? The above returns the following in phpmyadmin (with the prefix in place) \n```text\nCourse ID\n\n\nE247\n\n\nE248\n\n\ntestSite\n\n\nSW01\n\n\nSW02\n```",

Tim, the query actually currently resides in report_customsql and works as intended, what I'm trying to do is get it to execute on a regular basis and automatically create the csv file on the server ; it's part of an automation process for feeding back into our HR system, which is extremely unwieldly and inflexible.  It can't talk to Moodle, and Moodle can't talk to it (security, etc), so these csv's will be generated in a set location with a set naming convention, an FTP job will pick them up and dump them across to the HR system, which will pick them up and process the results.  Inversely, the HR system creates new account/enrolement csv's, this is FTP'd over to moodledata, and a cron'd process picks them up and processes them into moodle; I have this part working.",

Yes I spotted that API and from my understanding that is used to create the top level course definition which is a great start however what I require is also the ability to define the underlying content that goes into the course programmatically. As there doesn't appear to be any API's around content creation (as you have pointed out above) I assume I would have top potentially provide this in some way, I wonder whether the best approach would be to write a plugin that exposes a set of my own API's that allows content to be built directly against the Database ?

Basically, I am using an old-style assignment (Moodle 2.2) with a custom type. I'll be upgrading soon and have re-implemented this as a standalone module, but I fear I'll have the same or a similar problem, which is... The assignment mod sends an email to report submission of the assignment to people with the 'grade assignment' permission . In some cases these should go to people assigned at the course level, but in others they should go to mentors, which are assign on a per-user basis. To assign a mentor in this way, I create a 'mentor' role with the 'grade assignment' permission, and then use the 'assign roles relative to this user' link on a student's profile page to grant the mentor role to their mentor's account. Unfortunately, when the user submits an assignment, the course-level graders get an email, but the user-level ones don't. Hopefully context_module::instance() will help me troubleshoot, but perhaps I have a more fundamental misunderstanding here?",

I thought about disabling the delete button that shows up when you right click on a file/folder. The approach I am considering is to use the $('.fp-file-delete').hide() on the delete button. The problem here is the file manager takes more time to load and my hide() function gets called before the element exists on the page and thus the button is still visible for all users. This is the url Moodle/lib/ ajax /service.php after which the file manager actually loads. 1-Is there a different way of preventing users from using/pressing the delete button from the filemanager ? 2-If my only option is to hide the delete button, is there a way to know when the filemanager actually loads (Not the document/page, just the filemanager) ? Like a trigger of some sort ? (No events available, I checked.) Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks !",

          "Text": "Last week, I received a somewhat puzzling report from a user who claimed that he couldn't open files from Moodle in Microsoft Edge.  Upon further investigation, I was able to determine that the trouble was with PDF files displaying embedded in the page: when you open one, Edge stops responding to user input.  You can scroll the page (but not the PDF) - but nothing else; no UI element within Edge will work, and clicking on links does nothing (except occasionally highlight the link).  If you have multiple tabs open and still have it set to warn when closing multiple tabs, attempting to close it via right-click on the taskbar button will pop up that confirmation box - but you can't interact with that, either!  The quickest way to kill Edge when it's in this state seems to be to drag the titlebar down to the bottom of the screen, though you can also use other methods such as ending the task in Task Manager. I was eventually able to track it down to Moodle's embed maximiser script (which resizes the embed to take up as much space as possible on the page).  That script sets the height and width of the embed to 0px briefly, so it can check the size of the page without it present; for some reason, this specific act puts Edge into the strange state where it refuses all input.  I've submitted a patch which instead uses display:none to make the embed take up no space while it calculates - MDL-51190 - which is currently awaiting peer review, but thought I'd post here in case anyone else has been scratching their heads over this issue.",

Improvements and new features can still be submitted for integration, however they will be held until the end of synchronisation period, which is 3 weeks after release, 1st of June 2015. After this date we will be integrating new features and improvements in 3.0. During this week integration team will go through all the issues that are waiting for integration. However Monday being a public holiday does not help with the queue that is already bigger than usual, so we anticipate that some issues will be carried over the next week. Hopefully we can still start the QA cycle next week as planned. If you are a plugin author, it is probably best to wait until at least\nnext week before starting to check your plugin for 2.9 compatibility as\nthis will be a busy week of changes in the codebase. Just a reminder that integration of improvements during the code freeze is still possible but only when approved by the product owner.

I am trying to follow the restore process described here https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Restore_2.0_for_developers#Automatically_triggering_restore_in_code but I am getting errors. I have my backup file in $CFG-> dataroot . '/temp/backup/test/' named backup123.mbz, and I want to restore it into course id 456, so I am doing: \n```text\n$folder             = '/test/'; // as found in: $CFG->dataroot . '/temp/backup/'\n\n\n$courseid         = '456'; // \n\n\n$user_doing_the_backup   = 2; // e.g. 2 == admin\n\n\n// Restore backup into course.\n\n\n$controller = new restore_controller($folder, $courseid,\n\n\n        backup::INTERACTIVE_NO, backup::MODE_SAMESITE, $user_doing_the_backup,\n\n\n        backup::TARGET_EXISTING_ADDING);\n\n\n$controller->execute_precheck();\n\n\n$controller->execute_plan();\n```\n I am not sure what to use if I am trying to restore into an existing course, so I go with TARGET_EXISTING_ADDING, I have tried all other options as well (TARGET_CURRENT_DELETING, TARGET_CURRENT_ADDING, TARGET_EXISTING_DELETING, TARGET_EXISTING_ADDING) but all produce the same error. For the folder i tried 'test' and 'test/' and '/test/' and tried adding the exact backup file name as well, all produce the same error. In fact, even if I use the code as it is straight out of the link above and try to restore my activity into a new course (as is the case in the link) I still get the exact same error which is: \n```text\nDefault exception handler: error/cannot_precheck_wrong_status Debug: \n\n\nError code: cannot_precheck_wrong_status\n\n\n$a contents: 200\n```\n Someone here https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=347629 had the same error however I cannot message them or comment on that post to find out the exact solution. Someone here https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=350138 seems to be doing it successfully, I have tried using literally their code, still getting the error above.

The problem is, that the active radio button will always be the OAuth one with value 0. Neither does the default value work nor when I explicitly set the checked attribute within the createElement method. As I said, the db field gets updated correctly no matter which value I'm acitvating, but after saving and reopening the form the second element will be active. Could it be, that the default value is somehow cached? Greetings and thanks for any help!",

The global object $USER, which contains the numeric $USER->id among other things. How do I find out the current course? The global object $COURSE, which contains the numeric $COURSE->id if anyone knows a easier way to get the users' peers please let me know. my ideia is: - get the userids from core_group_get_group_members() - get the user role from core_user_get_course_user_profiles() to split teacher/students using the role it returns.",

          "Text": "Ok, I think those examples you refer to are missing some context. Broadly speaking, there are 2 different types of PHP file in Moodle - libraries, which are not called directly but contain classes and functions, and pages which are called directly.  Libraries will start by declaring the \"MOODLE_INTERNAL\" constant, while pages will start by including config.php, as in your original example. When you include config.php, you load Moodle's configuration and core libraries, initialise the page's global object in $PAGE, as well as the user's profile and session data via $USER and $SESSION.  However, until you set the page's course by calling $PAGE->set_course() or require_login() and passing in a course id, $COURSE will not be set - there's no way of knowing what it should be. You need to pass to the page either the id of the course, of the id of the course module, or something else within the courses's context that allows you to determine which course you are within. If you are writing a function in a library, you can get current course by doing global $COURSE; at the top of the function - as long as the function will be called within a page that has already done $PAGE->set_course().",

          "Title": "Error code: storedfilecannotread",
          "Text": "I did something silly and wanted to share the fix in case someone else did the same thing. When you upload a file (e.g a scorm package) in Moodle through the UI it uses the Moodle file api to store it in moodledata/filedir and point to it in the moodle database table mdl_files. What I did was accidentally delete half of the filedir directory. The person who is responsible for backups realized after I did this that they had no backups. So when you clicked on a scorm activity link, for example, in the course you would see the following error: More information about this error Debug info: [ dataroot ]/filedir/ff/d9/ffd980468bb9a9d42e24991891182efb973eba94 Error code: storedfilecannotread Stack trace: line 454 of /lib/filestorage/stored_file.php: file_exception thrown line 2127 of /lib/filelib.php: call to stored_file->readfile() line 2491 of /lib/filelib.php: call to readfile_accel() line 1005 of /mod/scorm/lib.php: call to send_stored_file() line 4601 of /lib/filelib.php: call to scorm_pluginfile() line 37 of /pluginfile.php: call to file_pluginfile() We had the scorm files though. And so to fix this problem you should access the Moodle database and issue the following command (this sql is just for the scorm file fix): delete from mdl_files where contextid=(SELECT id FROM `mdl_context` WHERE instanceid=(SELECT id FROM `mdl_course_modules` where course=20 and module=18 and instance = (select id from mdl_scorm where name='[name of scorm activity]'))) just subsitute \"name of scorm activity\" with whatever that activity is named in teh course or database . . . \"Module 1\" for example. This deletes all the previously associated files in the file system associated with that scorm activity/contextid. Then you just turn on editing in the Moodle UI and re-upload the scorm package for the given activity. Then the link will work again. So this is how i rebuilt the filedir. Of course as I said above this is just for the scorms we had. If you uploaded anything else throught he Moodle UI it would be in the filedir too and therefore be broken.",

I am anticipating code to come from 4 main sources: Moodle codebase, maintained by Moodle HQ on GitHub My own plugins (blocks, modules, themes, etc.) Third-party plugins, used as is (same as above) Third-party plugins, modified to fit my school's needs I will be working with a very small team of developers, none of whom will have access to the server Moodle sits on (including myself), other than running git commands. Should I fork the Moodle codebase (and the third-party plugins that need modifying) and use sub-modules, or go a different route? If I understand it correctly, this would allow me to have a 'moodle' folder with all of the necessary modifications I'd need, in this folder (or at least it would 'look' like it's in the one place). Am I correct in my assumption? Cheers, Fred",

This is what I do now: I copied the moodle code base, the contributed plugins and my own plugins to a single repo and I deploy from it from the git repo with Capistrano . The disadvantages of this are: My own custom plugins are developed in their own repos, and then I have to go through the extra step of copying them to my \"deployable\" code base for deployment. I have accidentally made changes to the deployment code on multiple occasions, which gets confusing. I don't like the idea of having a repo with a bunch of code in it that does not really belong. My dissatisfaction caused me to open this topic , which contains some good information. You might also want to check out this topic on adding composer support . Long story short, I am still working on a better solution. To that end, I created an Ansible role which assembles moodle from zip files hosted on moodle.org and github repos. It applies patches too for my code modifications. At the heart of the ansible role is a simple PHP program I wrote called \" Tasc \" which stands for Tool for Assembling Source Code. It's what does the source code fetching and patching. What all this allows me to do is keep a GitHub repo that contains ONLY a YAML file which describes my Moodle installation and patch files. Here's an example I made: https://github.com/hcpss-banderson/moodle-manifest",

Personally, I use essentially the approach you've suggested: I have a fork of the main Moodle repo, which contains branches based on the MOODLE_XX_STABLE branches which I'm working with.  My branches contain customisations to core, along with plugins included as submodules.  In order to upgrade to a new version of Moodle, I rebase my branch onto the appropriate upstream MOODLE_XX_STABLE branch. The main thing with using submodules is that you need to remember that a `git pull` on the main repo won't update the submodules themselves - something along the lines of `git submodule update --init` covers most bases (new and/or updated submodules), though if submodule repo URLs change, you may also need to run a `git submodule sync` before the submodule update.",

It gets tricky when maintaining a fork of a third-party module, though I have done it in a couple cases. The trickiness comes when you have submodules pointing to multiple repos on dev but not in production. I also typically have a couple things in dev that are not part of production at all and I use the file at .git/info/exclude to avoid tracking them. I am a fan of submodules, despite the complications, because I like tracking all the modules in my main Moodle fork history. Using submodules does not necessarily prevent you from also using some additional deployment tool which could then run the submodule update command for you. I have not so far used any, however.",

          "Text": "Our preferred method for managing client codebases uses submodules, Gerrit, and client specific branches. The steps we go through: Checkout MOODLE_29_STABLE Fork a client branch, eg. git checkout -b clientname-version-sitetype. Push to Gerrit. Add plugins using submodules. Submodules repos are also on Gerrit. If a plugin requires customisation, fork a new branch from the submodule, and push it to the Gerrit repo. To manage code changes, we use Gerrit for code reviews, and controlling what patches are merged. Gerrit also handles submodules nicely - if a patch is merged in a submodule branch, and a project tracks that submodule branch, the parent project will automatically be updated. This removes the overhead of managing submodule changes in the parent project. It probably wouldn't be too hard to script this if you weren't using Gerrit. Merging upstream releases of core or plugins is pretty simple. Just merge the latest parent branch, push, and test. The biggest advantage of using submodules like this is keeping all the plugin code separate. Tracking upstream plugin changes if plugins are part of the main repo can be a serious pain. Deployments are a separate issue, and there are many ways to do it. I've used capistrano, debian packages, git checkouts, CI tools... Currently one project I manage uses GoCD and Jenkins. This can be overkill for some projects though. Another uses custom bash scripts with git-archive-all to create a tarball of the full codebase, which is then extracted on the servers.

          "Text": "I've found this thread very interesting and am grateful for all of the suggestions shared. I will be looking into Capistrano , Ansible , Chef , Composer , Docker , Gerrit, GoCD , Puppet and Tasc . It's been a few years since I last looked into these types of tools so there may now be something to suit my needs. My situation is a little more complicated than yours because I need to support multiple version of Moodle and multiple versions of plugins in several cases. One of the things you keep in mind is that the GitHub repositories for 3rd party plugins rarely contain the same code as the released code on moodle.org/plugins. In some cases the code is behind while in other cases it is ahead (i.e. new version in development/testing). Be aware and be careful of this as you can end up breaking plugins and your Moodle site. With very few exceptions, the only git repo that I typically clone is Moodle itself. What I've done is to setup a directory tree structure and have a bash script that assembles/updates a Moodle site with plugins, as needed. Here is an example of my directory structure which matches where plugins would be placed if in the Moodle directory tree (minus the plugins directory). Moodle moodle/ Unlike the rest of the directories below, this is a clone of my Moodle fork repository on GitHub which includes all versions of Moodle so it can easily be switched from one version to another when creating a new site. I can also simply merge recent updates into the code. If I need to create a pull request, I will create separate branche (with tracking enabled!) and push it to my GitHub fork. If the core code gets updated before my modifications are merged into the core code, I can rebase my patch branches to merge changes. If you never plan on submitting fixes for Moodle core code, you can skip having a fork on GitHub to make things a little simpler. When I create a new Moodle site, I simply copy the files to a new location on my webserver and git checkout the desired MOODLE_XX_STABLE branch. If you do a lot of core patches, you may also want to have your own branch which integrates all of your fixes so that you don't have to wait for fixes to be integrated into the core code. Plugins I put all of my 3rd party plugins under a folder called plugins. They are organized in the same structure as if they were in the directory tree of Moodle making it easy to keep track of the types and locations of plugins. For example: plugins/auth/ plugins/availability/conditions plugins/blocks/ plugins/course/format plugins/enrol/ plugins/filter/ plugins/lib/editor/atto/plugins/ plugins/lib/editor/tinymce/plugins/ plugins/local/ plugins/mod/ plugins/report/ plugins/theme/ Inside each of the above directories, I have a directory for each plugin of each version of Moodle. Unlike with Moodle, this is necessary because there is no standard organization of branches in plugins. The main branch in some plugins might be \"master\" while others, like Configurable Reports, might be CR_23_STABLE. For example: plugins/mod/attendance24 plugins/mod/attendance25 plugins/mod/attendance26 plugins/mod/attendance27 plugins/mod/attendance28 plugins/mod/attendance29 In this case, there is a release for each version of Moodle the Attendance activity module. However, in cases where a version of the plugin is the same across several versions of Moodle, subsequent directories would actually be symlinks so that I only need to make changes in one place when making modifications: plugins/mod/groupchoice22 plugins/mod/groupchoice23 (symlink to groupchoice22) plugins/mod/groupchoice24 (symlink to groupchoice22) plugins/mod/groupchoice25 (symlink to groupchoice22) plugins/mod/groupchoice26 (symlink to groupchoice22) plugins/mod/groupchoice27 plugins/mod/groupchoice27 (symlink to groupchoice27) plugins/mod/groupchoice28 (symlink to groupchoice27) plugins/mod/groupchoice29 (symlink to groupchoice27) My script removes the version number at the end of the plugin's directory name. Custom/Customized Plugins (optional) Although not required, I also maintain a separate \"cplugins\" directory tree at the same level as \"plugins\" where I put plugins that I've ether developed myself or 3rd party plugins that I've customized. It makes my build script a little more complicated but makes it easier for me to easily see what I need to maintain. Managing plugin source code As I previously mentioned, git repos are not consistently reflective of the current stable release on Moodle.org/plugins. What you can do is to setup each of these plugin directories as it's own local repo. Then, each time you download a new version of the plugin, replace the existing code (but not the .git directory) with the new version you downloaded and create a new commit for it. This will enable you to move forward and backwards in versions of the code as needed. I've tried using git subtrees (not submodules) and run into directory structure issues that I was unable to resolve in an automated way. The advantage of having your plugins separate from your Moodle code is that you can then have a system whereby you can pick and choose which plugins to include into the instance of a particular Moodle site. If designed right, this same system can double as a way to add new plugins into existing instances of Moodle and update existing plugins in a given site. Even if you maintain only one Moodle site, the ability to create multiple sites can be a real benefit. For example you might want to test a new plugin, a new version of a plugin or a new version of Moodle without impacting your production site. Save even more time/effort/money the Open Source way Whenever you customize a 3rd party plugin, depending on the nature of the customization, I encourage you to contribute your modifications back to the original author through a pull request. Some managers will see this as giving away the results of your time and effort but, since you feel are doing the work anyway, little additional effort is required to share the changes back to the author. Explain to him/her the true long term benefit of participating in Open Source. Think about it. Each time you download a plugin, you are receiving hundreds or even thousands of hours of time and effort that one or more people put into this for free. Why return the favour by sharing your customizations with the author? If the author also thinks this would be a great addition, he/she will integrate the changes into the core plugins code. The best part is that, once integrated into the plugin, your modifications will be perpetually maintained and supported by the author of the plugin and possibly even enhanced over time. The same can be said for Moodle core. This means that, when comes the time for you to upgrade to a newer release of Moodle, the modifications will already be upgraded for you and you won't have to spend any time, money or effort re-applying your changes. It's a win-win situation. You get free maintenance enhancements for the life of the plugin and the Moodle world benefits from your genius and may even raise your awareness of issues you didn't think of before it impacts your users. In general, I've found many Moodle plugin developers to be very responsive and appreciative and open to most contributions. I've submitted issues, fixes and enhancements to 3rd party plugin developers and seen them integrate the changes into their core code not within years, months or weeks, but often literally days or even hours and occasionally even within minutes of sharing changes with them depending on the complexity of the change. You will only see this in the open source community. Microsoft, Apple and other large companies? They might require you to pay for a subscription or at the very least charge your credit card just so that you can report an issue to them. In my experience, unless you are a MAJOR client, the response in the end is often something like \"This issue may be addressed in a future release\". Will it? Think of it from a business perspective. Why fix an issue if you are making money from it being broken? They have shareholders to keep happy. Imagine if that was the way things went in the Open Source community. Progress would be slowed down to a snails pace. Even if the author of a Moodle plugin has abandoned their project or is too busy to respond, you've got the support of the whole Moodle community to help you out. If you don't like the direction in which a plugin is going, you can fork it yourself and customize it to your hearts content however you loose the benefits and handing off future maintenance and upgrades of your plugin. I've digressed a little here but the point is that sharing back to the community should also be part of your git workflow. Additional development tools On a side note, you might also find the Moodle MDK command line tool to be useful in addition to Moosh previously mentioned in this thread. As part of your QA testing, the Moodle Code Checker plugin can help you get 98% of the way to meeting Moodle coding style guidelines . Hope you find something useful in all of this.

I wholeheartedly agree with the pull requests to developers and Moodle HQ. This is not something I was at liberty to do in the past, and I have already started selling the idea to my new management (I have moved schools). Hopefully I will get my point across. I will have a lot of thinking to do over the next few working days, and the information in this thread has been invaluable. One decision has already been made, which is to use the Community Edition of GitLab to manage the code (for a myriad of reasons a cloud solution was not suitable) and I must admit I am very impressed with the product so far. It won't prevent us from pushing some repos to the cloud, should that be allowed by management. Cheers, Fred",

So currently there is no way to force plugin developers to do these things. There is a way though. We all in the Moodle users community can encourage the plugins maintainer to provide useful release notes (among other meta-data). So let me suggest - if you realize some plugin is updated without meaningful and useful release notes, go ahead and report it as a bug in their issues tracker.",

          "Text": "Hi Sriharsha, erm.... actually, you have asked this question in the wrong forum, it would be better placed in the General Forum. Having said that, let's see of we can work it  out anyway - it would have been easier if you had given your Moodle version number, but this is for v2.7. The essentials are the same, but some things will be different. You do not need anything fancy, for the Role is already in your Moodle, all you have to do is to coax it out. Go to Site Admin > Users > Permissions > Define Roles and that will get you started. If you look at the list of Roles you will see one called \"Non-Editing Teacher\". This Role has access to a course, can do things in it like view grades and so on, but cannot edit course materials, so that is a long way towards what you are looking for. Click on the Add a New Role button at the bottom of the Roles list and select in the \"Use role or archetype\" drop down list, non-editing teacher then click on Continue button. Give the new Role a name, then a formal name. You need to be able to assign this Role either at a site wide level or a Category level, so click on the checkbox everywhere you want it to be assigned, but be careful, make sure the Role works before assigning it. You want the Role to enrol students, so in \"Allow Role Assignments\" select \"Student\" and deselect Student and Guest from the \"Allow Role Switches\" list. This should already be turned off, but in your find dialogue, enter Switch and search for the Capability. It is about the third entry located starting from the top of the page. If the \"Allow\" checkbox is ticked, then turn it off. What I am suggesting here is to change these if they have ticks in the Allow box, and I suggest NO then turn it off, if no tick, then don't worry about it. The reverse is true, if the recommend is YES then turn it on. Where there is a ??? then suit yourself. I have taken a lot of permissions out, so leave them at the default setting unless otherwise indicated. You can always change them to suit your need or if it is not working then add or subtract capabilities to suit. Create a test user and assign the Role AFTER you have hit the \"Create this Role\" button. Test it thoroughly before using it. Good luck....

I have an existing plugin which through an overnight cron job, takes all the data in mdl_user_info_data and normalises it into a new table, where every additional profile field is a column in the table (called userdata) I'm now looking to improve this plugin to make the updates to my plugin table instant, rather than wait for the overnight cron job. From my understanding of the Events this should be possible by: adding a file db/events.php to my plugin listen for core/event/user_updated within the $observers array and call my custom function (defined within the callback param). My custom function would update my userdata table when a user profile is updated. I could also 'observe' other events such as user_created and user_deleted to do other things on my custom table. Is my understanding correct and do other authentication methods trigger the same events, for example if a user is created via LDAP authentication would it trigger the same user_created event?

          "Text": "Yes, that sounds about right. I've generally found that core Moodle plugins \"do the right thing\" with events (e.g. auth plugins will call user_create_user() when creating a user, triggering an event), but if you need 100% accuracy the only way to be sure is to check the code! If you're using Moodle 2.7 or higher, it might also be worth considering creating ad-hoc tasks rather than updating your database directly in the event handler. It's pretty easy to introduce performance problems with event handlers that are doing anything but the simplest things, so it's often preferable just to create an ad-hoc task that will be run next time the cron job runs. It's not instant, but it sounds like that might not matter for your use case.",

I need to delete all users who are currently NOT enrolled in any courses and who haven't logged in for more than 30 days. That's are my only parameters. I'm assuming this can be done via a simple SQL query? I know I need to pull from the mdl_user, mdl_role_assignments and maybe the mdl_role tables, but I'm not sure how to construct this command. I have created a clone install/DB so I can safely test. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I have made some good progress so far, but I have hit a road block with checking activity completion. Essentially my plugin opens a third-party page in an iframe on the activity page and the user then complete some tasks within the website on the iframe. Once these tasks are complete the third-party website returns that the tasks were completed to a URL that I can specify. I was planning on implementing the Custom Completion Rules within the URL that I provide. My question is if this is the best way to proceed. Also I am wondering if once the third-party website sends the completion information to the URL and the activity is considered complete will the current activity page that the user is in be reloaded and show that they have completed the activity?",

          "Title": "Unit testing Messaging, database environment not resetting between tests.",
          "Text": "I'm working on writing a bunch of unit tests for an existing custom body of work (which I've talked extensively about distributing before, to a fairly cold response). So far, the tests have been going OK - but I've written some tests to make sure event observers were being called correctly, and this is where things are falling over. When this specific action I'm testing occurs, it generates a notification to the staff and student using the messaging system to state that the action occurred. Two scenarios can occur; One for an instance of an Assign module and one for an instance of a Quiz module. My tests are structured that they extend a base test class which contains setup/teardown code. In setUp() the course used for the test is setup, staff and students are added correctly (they have their own assertions which are all passing as expected), Groups and Groupings are added (again, checked with assertions). In tearDown() the variables are unset to hopefully prevent these staying around. In the test themselves, they are essentially duplicated. Test 1 creates an Assignment module instance, assigns the grouping to the module instance and sets other basic information such as the due date etc (all checked with assertions). We then apply the extension (this is our custom code, not the core extensions which are not very advanced) to a group inside the grouping, this all works OK (all assertions pass), the event is called (assertions for this pass too) and the observer picks up and calls the required code to generate the message. In this test, this passes all assertions correctly. Test 2 does the same process as Test 1, with the required changes to create a Quiz module instance rather than an Assignment module. Everything passes all assertions until the Message is generated - for, get this, the Assignment module instance created in the previous test! The module instance created in Test 1 and Test 2 both end up with the same Course Module ID! It's like the whole environment isn't being reset between tests. In each test that is testing the observer and messaging, I've tried calling $this->preventResetByRollback(); as I've seen in other tests - but no change. I've tried with and without $this->preventResetByRollback() with no change. I can switch the order of these tests and whichever is run last fails as it's using the module created by the previous test. I can comment out either of the tests and on their own they both run successfully. I can comment out all other tests (three others, no messaging stuff), same result. I am rebuilding the course cache at the top of each test, again after the module instance is created, and then again at the end of the test itself. I have confirmed Setup/Teardown are being executed before and after each test: \n```text\nMoodle 2.9.2+ (Build: 20150924), pg\nsql\n\n\nPHPUnit 3.7.38 by Sebastian Bergmann.\n\n\n\nConfiguration read from C:\\moodle\\my_phpunit.\nxml\n\n\n.Setup called Setup complete.

Not sure where to go to resolve this, any help appreciated.",

Does anybody know if there is a more generic class to select items from a pool of items with the same user interface like the cohort assignment page?

          "Text": "Hi All, In the slow march towards weaning ourselves off YUI, i've just removed the mcore YUI rollup from being included on every single Moodle page ( MDL-57690 ). This was including a few Moodle YUI modules unconditionally all the time (dock loader, popup help, and widget/dialogue modules) and so if you are using of any of these modules without explicitly declaring the dependency it may not have been detected before. Now that those modules are not being included unconditionally your code may break. It would be a good time to test your plugins early against master this week using boost. Or grep your code for instances of `M.core.dialogue` (which was the main thing we detected undeclared dependencies in core code).",

          "Text": "Greetings-- I am a software developer who is brand new to Moodle, and fairly new to PHP (though I've done extensive server -side scripting with other technologies, mostly ASP/VBscript/ SQL Server).  As such, I'm still wading through the Moodle docs , so please excuse me (and correct me) if I misuse the terminology; and please advise me if posts like this belong in a different forum. We have been charged with finding, or building, a plugin that provides functionality like this: Content creator generates an activity that looks mostly like an HTML page, except it includes specially coded spaces (text inputs) in which student can enter data, which is saved.  (At this point, it's reminiscent of an \"Embedded Answer (Cloze)\" quiz question; but it's not quite the same thing.) Content creator may create several such activities .  The \"identifier\" for a text item in one activity may match an identifier for a text item in a different activity.  In such a case, any text the user may have previously entered, matching that \"identifier\", in this or ANY OTHER similar activity, will populate the field. Content creator may specify an instance of a field to be \"read-only\", in which case student's previously-entered value will just show up (in that activity) as inline text, not as a text entry box. Student may edit the values in the text fields at any time (except in activities where they're marked as read-only). Content creator will define the unique names for the field identifiers (subject to some syntax restrictions TBD). If possible, we would like the student's entered values to be preserved across courses, so that an activity of this type in course \"B\" may be populated with the values that the student entered while in course \"A\".  In this sense, the entered values are somewhat like pieces of the student's \"profile\". Does anyone know of an existing plugin that works this way? Thanks! - Rick",

          "Text": "I don't know of any activity like this. However, you may want to consider creating a Moodle filter instead of an activity. A filter is basically a way to do search/replace on any input before it is output, for example in the contents of a page resource, but it will work anywhere. For example there are several filters running here. If I type [ [Debugging] ] without the spaces, that will get replaced with a link \n```text\n<a href=\"https:// docs.moodle.org/en/Debugging\">Debugging</a>\n```\n (but without the extra spaces, which I have added to stop another filter, one which looks for anything like a URL and turns it into a clickable link. If I just type https://docs.moodle.org/en/Debugging then that will become a link without me doing anything. So, if you want, you could make a filter that looks something like {{name=inputid|width=30}} or {{name=inputid|width=20|readonly}} in the text, and replaces it with a text box. You would probably then also need some JavaScript / Ajax code to handle putting in the value, and saving it when it changes. See https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Filters for docs. This approach is probably simpler than building an activity, but is not without its issues. E.g. How do you stop students typing that sort of thing into a forum? (The answer might be https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Managing_filters - only enable the filter in the places you need it.)",

When I ran 'php purge_caches.php' in the terminal, this is the message I got: !!! <p>Error: Database connection failed</p> <p>It is possible that the database is overloaded or otherwise not running properly.</p> <p>The site administrator should also check that the database details have been correctly specified in config.php</p> !!! I'm confused as to how in the world that could be when the database just upgraded to Totara. I do have a custom theme from Moodle 2.2.2+ still enabled. Could that be the problem, and if so how would I fix that before doing the upgrade from Moodle 2.2.11 to Totara 2.9? Can anyone help me with figuring all of this out. Thank you in advance!",

We offer our courses at a very low cost so they are affordable for urban communities and per seat is critical in our business model.   In all of the example Moodle sites I have looked at to this point it seems that individual students enroll and pay via PayPal.  How is that different from per seat? We wrote our own PHP-based CyberSchool and implemented code that associated a key with the PHP session to not allow more than one computer to use the same userid at a given time.  Is this something that could be easily implemented in Moodle?",

          "Text": "Good afternoon all, A quick bit of background, I've been a PHP developer for a few years, this is the first time I've worked on a Moodle site, everything seems to be going well but I have an issue with one of my database fields. I have a database table with a number of columns, most of which are populated upon creation, a few of which are populated when the item has been looked at by the appropriate person. To clarify in the test process of this I've examined the stdClass immediately before it is parsed to the update_record and insert_record methods and all of the fields are set to the values I would expect. I've set the db to debug in the standard way. This is outputting me the UPDATE query, which has completely dropped a couple of the fields, most importantly a datetime field. I have tried renaming this field, I've tried adding a new column (INT) and storing the Unix timestamp to see if it was a DateTime related bug etc. and nothing seems to be working at all. To clarify my code isn't changing anything prior to the data entering the Moodle DB method I have done a print_r immediately before the line which calls update_record and can confirm that it shows all of the data. I have also then manually taken that print_r of the stdClass and copied and pasted the columns and values into a query which executes fine. Any advice or guidance on this would be great - I'm really stuck now and just can't understand why it isn't working Many thanks in advance! Matt",

The way that Moodle knows which fields should be in each table is (as far as I am aware) by looking in the db/install. xml files for each plugin (with this data being cached, to reduce time spent checking). As long as you define all your DB tables using the install.xml files + upgrade.php statements (and you bump your version number when these change), everything should work as expected. Problems usually start occurring when the fields have been manually added to the database, without using the Moodle upgrade API.",

Having a look at some of the mods, the \"assign\" mod has a method called count_participants (and list_participants ), which does take that into account and only gets the participants who should actually be on the activity, but that is just a method on that assign class so could only be used for that 1 mod. Whereas then looking at something like turnitintooltwo, that doesn't seem to really take the restrict access into account, as the student list in the submission inbox still shows all the students, regardless of group. And whilst other mods might have something similar, they are all their own separate methods in their own classes, which would make the supporting of any module/activity quite difficult. So... is there any kind of built in method or function in Moodle which I can use to find only the students who should actually be on a given activity/module? Or will I need to write one for that?

However, I don't want to turn off these globally in case people actually want to use these, just for one or two calls to the format_....() functions.

          "Text": "Hi Marius, Thanks for sharing your plans - to be honest I think you are going about this the wrong way. I would recommend putting a local mta (exim/postfix) on your EC2 instance and configure that to send mail to SES. There seem to be a few gudies out there about configuring postfix/exim to do this if you google around. Then configure Moodle to talk plain old smtp to your local mailserver. This has the advantage of your local server doing the right thing if it can't contact the amazon service. I recommend this sort of setup for any resonable sized moodle site in any case because it just allows moodle to fire off the emails and forget whilst the mta does its job of managing the email delivery. I don't think there would be much interest in seeing this core for that reason (moodle just sends emails with plain old SMTP)",

Finally hit upon using emailrelay which is a simple SMTP relay.  Very simple to set up and works perfectly. yum -y install openssl-devel Download source for emailrelay ,  and compile with openssl so the encrypted connection to SES will work. ./configure --with-openssl make & make install I put my SES SMTP credentials (not amazon aws keys) into a file: eg /etc/amazon-ses as a single line thus: login client <username> <password> Then run email relay as service using the following... /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay --as-server --port 10025 --spool-dir /tmp/spool --poll 30 --forward-to email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:587 --client-tls --client-auth /etc/amazon-ses --spool-dir /tmp/spool This will listen on port 10025 for incoming SMTP reqests, spool them to /tmp/spool and every 30 seconds attempt to send them through to amazon SES for delivery. Of course changing these settings is trivial. In centos I put this in /etc/rc.d/rc.local so it runs at startup. Check your machine is firewalled so external connections to port 10025 are not permitted. Then, within Moodle, I set up the email plugin to use SMTP address 127.0.0.1:10025 and no authentication details. One gotcha is that Moodle uses the 'support contact' email address as the sender (not the no-reply address), so this MUST be an address verified through your SES account with amazon. One of this benefits of this approach is that your Moodle PHP can 'send' email almost instantly - there is no pause waiting for SSL handshaking with a distant machine - and the emails are then spooled to be sent in an orderly way using a different process. This approach will also work with Gmail and avoids any core hacks. It only takes ten minutes to set up and seems rock solid (so far). My machine is on Amazon EC2 and Apache is Chrooted which created challenges for communicating with local MTA (no localhost). Hope it helps...",

I used Jango SMTP for a while, they had a nice mail relay service, and very little effort was envolved. But being hosted on the Amazon, I wanted to change over to the SES. And after a little head banging, I managed to get it working! Here is what I've done: 1. Signed up for the SES and created the auth key pair needed. 2. I decided to go with one email address that will be used for email, so I verified the email address I wanted to use with the SES. 3. Just for kicks I verified the domain also, which wasn't needed. Just by chance I may need it later. 4. Add the details to the Plugins -> Message Outputs -> Email. The address I used was email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:587 This has the port number for TLS. 5. I enabled TLS and added the username and password auth details. 6. I updated the reply to address, to the one I verified. 7. Then I went to the support email address and updated it (admin/settings.php?section=supportcontact) to the verified email also. This is very important because this is the address things are often sent from!) And then It was ready to roll! Another little pointer was, ensure you have your cron set up, because things like the forum post emails rely on this! - Kyle.",

So far, no deadlocks detected on system.\" If anyone else has gone ahead with this, it would be great to know: 1. How large are the batches in which transactions are committed (how many users should be processed per commit). 2. Which stage of the sync job is causing the issue. I haven't looked into this yet -  I will need to find out which of the two transactions needs to be managed in batches in this way. Thanks!",

          "Text": "I am using Moodle 2.5.7 with MySql database . I am developing a custom Flash question type. I have developed a web service to pass data from Flash to Moodle. When user responds to the question in Flash, I want to mark whether the response was correct or not. The flash file knows whether response was right or not. I am just wondering where do I mark this in Moodle database. To get to the bottom, I tried the following: - Created a new quiz with one numerical question. - The numerical question has 3 possible answers (10,20,30). Grade is set to 100% for Answer \"20\" - I attempted the quiz with right response (i.e. \"20\"). So far all is good. - Now while reviewing the quiz, I tried to change some values in the database directly, to make answer \"30\" the correct answer. - I changed \"rightanswer\" column in \"question_attempts\" table, changed \"fraction\" column value in \"question_answers\" table to make answer \"30\" correct answer. But still when I review the question in my quiz attempt, at the bottom it still says: \"The correct answer is: 20\". I don't know where it gets this \"20\" as correct answer. I tried to run the My Sql trace while updating the question but cannot find any clue. Can somebody please point me in the right direction. Thanks.",

At the page here: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Backup_2.0_for_developers#Introduction At the section: Not needed elements I'm having a hard time understanding that part. It states that you do not need child references to the parent for example: choice table: id (attr) choice options table: id (attr) choiceid (not needed) choice answers table: id (attr) choiceid (not needed) optionid (needed) My questions are why do you not need the choiceid in the backup? Wouldn't it fail if those references were not saved? Also, why is the optionid a required field? I don't seem to see the difference? Can anyone help? Thanks, Cameron.",

When the form is saved, there will be some code (usually a call to file_postupdate_standard_editor or file_postupdate_standard_filemanager) which tells Moodle to transfer the files from the draft area into the specified real storage area (just like there will be a function call, usually file_prepare_standard_editor or file_prepare_standard_filemanager to populate the draft area before the form is displayed).

This step can be more difficult if the module name is also used in other contexts, e.g. with the ' URL ' module, you need to be careful to not rename all 'moodle_url' references. Tweak the version.php file to reference today's date (optional). Step 3 should manage to fix the names of the database tables, plus all references to them. Theoretically, you might be able to get away without renaming some of the functions. However, most functions in /mod/newname/lib.php must match the name of the module, otherwise Moodle won't be able to find the function it needs to call. Also, you should assume that (at the very least) the lib.php, version.php and settings.php files for all modules will sometimes be in memory at the same time, so any functions with the same names in those files will cause problems. In practice, this means that using your IDE's 'search and replace in multiple files' function is the best way to proceed.",

Is there an easy way that we don't know about to ensure the plugin is global on all courses and cannot be deleted? I should point out this plugin operates completely separate of all other enrollment plugins so you can still do self-enroll, manual, cohort, etc. Our plugin generates 6 digit unique codes for every course and group on a site.  When the code is entered on a form on the homepage the student is instantly enrolled into the corresponding course/group.  Our amazing developer took it a step further and has integrated a QR CODE reader into the form which will allow the student to hold up a printed qr code into the camera on a chromebook and instantly be enrolled into the course as well.  This is tremendously important for K-12 sites where you have hundreds of courses and 6 year olds trying to navigate around to find a proper course.",

          "Text": "I would like my authentication plugin to validate user profile data before it gets saved. I've found out two hooks related to updating one's profile: 1. The core\\event\\user_updated event This unfortunately happens after the data has already been saved. 2. Call to authplugin->update_user() This code in user/edit.php would allow my authentication plugin to do its stuff before user gets updated: \n```text\n    // Pass a true old $user here.\n    if (!$authplugin->user_update($user, $usernew)) {\n        // Auth update failed.\n        print_error('cannotupdateprofile');\n    }\n```\n ...the problem however is that this affects only the users created using my own plugin, and I would like the validation to be triggered for all users. Is there a way to somehow force the validation feature for all accounts? (The use case is that I want to prevent using the same phone number in more than one user account.)",

I was hoping to use a mustache template, anytime the string Dashboard is found it skips the row. Or, even better a simple list I can define. Nevertheless, I failed with both of those attempts. Hence, the hacks below. Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

I thought you needed to reference the component who wanted the message to be processed by, in my case send message to the instant message module to forward on to user. So I have to fill in my plugin details in name and component param fields, i.e the module the message is being sent from to be processed my Moodle. Would my message provider be correct, if I wanted the message to be sent via instant message to user? Just to clarify, can I put the send_message code in any php file in my plugin folder, or do I need to also require a certain library file in my php class or instantiate a certain object to call send_message. e.g require_once('../../../config.php'); require_once('../../../lib/messagelib.php'); Do I need the above files referenced?

This question stems from two situations  : 1) Moodle administrators do not have access to the web server 2) <moodle>/admin/cron.php web page timing out ! When a site is particularly busy and you need to run that ONE task and cant wait it would be really hand to think about building a plugin that would do that for you from the admin interface. The reason I pose this question here is because I am sure during  building the new Task API moodle developers must have thought about this and probably thought ' naahhh!' . just wanted to understand if there was a reason behind this ?

And I have the following problems: Course administration - Enroled users: all of them show up as enroled two days ago (right), and none of them as ever accessed the course (right) Course administration - Reports - Activity Reports: the course and users where created a week ago, but I see activity from 2 months ago (when the other course was put to use). Some activities, brand new, never used (eg. questionnaire without questions still on them) show up as completed by all of the users. I think the logs, and the re-use of ids on several tables, maybe confusing moodle. I tried editing the id on several tables - WRONG. Any way I can fix them, and have moodle truly forget my old course and let me keep on working on the new one? Regards.",

Also make sure that your site's configuration hasn't been changed to not include the \"moodle/block:view\" capability for any roles. \"Sticky\" doesn't typically mean an assocation with a target audience, sticky historically has more of a idea of the block appearing permanently on pages. If you want the block to be sticky its more down to how you add the block the site, rather than something you do in development. So go to the \"highest\" place that that the block can be added (for example the front page , some blocks restrict what pages they can be added to) Add an instance of the block open the block configuration In the \"Where this block appears\" set an option. and default region and weight. The block should now appear on each page that matches the context you selected. You can use this to make a block appear on every course page too. Set the \"Display throughout entire site\" Go into a course Configure the block Set a context, which will be limited to course pages.

We'd like to disable the left and header sections of the site so the students can not add, edit navigate around at all. Basically we give them the course and that is all they see. Is this available in Moodle as is, or can I embed just the course content inside a frame in my website. All of the help searches focus on embedding stuff in Moodle, I want to embed Moodle in my site.

          "Text": "Hi Marina, Thanks for your answer. I'll try to explain: In our Moodle, which is run on version 3.1, we have courses in which there are many sections, but only a few of them are displayed. The rest of the sections have activities in them, and they are linked to from the visible sections (there were pedagogical reasons for building the sections  that way). The hiding of the rest of the sections is done by using the numsections attribute in the course. For example, one of our courses has 6 sections, but numsections is set to 0 since all the activities in those sections are reached via links from the first section. Now, we want to upgrade our Moodle to 3.3, and in that version, the numsections attribute is obsolete, which means that all those \"orpahned\" sections are now visible. If we want to keep them hidden, we have to go section by section and hide the sections, and then, for each activity, we have to make it available via the edit menu. That's a lot of manual work, and I was wondering whether either of the following options is possible: Is there a script, or DB query, that can help us do this in bulk? I see that the `get_last_section_number` function in course/format/lib.php still has a check for $course->numsections, but it returns false (I quoted the code in my original question). Is there any way to override some function and make the check return TRUE? Thank you",

However you say: \n```text\nNow, we want to upgrade our Moodle to 3.3, and in that version, the \nnumsections attribute is obsolete, which means that all those \"orpahned\"\n sections are now visible.\n```\n I do not see it. These sections are hidden and they should be hidden. Activities inside them are \"stealth\" which means that students can access them by following the URL - exactly the way orphaned activities used to behave. At the same time the course settings the setting \"Hidden sections\" by default is \"Hidden sections are shown in collapsed form\". So the names of the hidden sections are shown to the students - they see something like \"Topic 3 is not available\". Can you please confirm that you see the same? If so, try going to the course settings and, under \"Course format\" section, change \"Hidden sections\" to \"Hidden sections are completely invisible\". Will this solve the issue for you?",

Then I logged into the Moodle, and the system upgraded the DB. Do you think that could that explain the different behavior in the hidden sections? Thank you",

The first test: Installed a fresh copy of Moodle 3.1 Imported from our site 3 courses which have orphaned sections. The import was successful, the sections stayed orphaned. Switched branch ( git ) and got latest version of 3.3 from Moodle on Github Installed (via FTP or CLI) a couple of course formats and themes that the courses needed. Went to the site and did the upgrade process successfully The sections became hidden and their activities are available to students. Success! The second test: On our current site (3.1) I switched branch (git) and got latest version of 3.3 from Moodle on Github Installed (via FTP or CLI) all formats, themes, question types, etc. and assorted plugins that the courses needed. Went to the site and did the upgrade process successfully The sections stayed visible. Failure . Since the process of getting the 3.3 version was the same in both tests, and the change was in the plugins installed (in the first test only about 5 plugins were installed, but in the second test we installed dozens of plugins), I'm thinking that some plugin was at fault. I don't know which plugin, and the process of elimination would be too tedious, but just updating this info here, in case someone has an insight on the issue.",

          "Text": "Hi, I have implemented local plugin that initialize an instance of RabbitMQ consumer for Moodle 2.6. There should always be only one instance of consumer for the whole application running in the background. After 300 seconds or 100 consumed messages, consumer terminates and new consumer is created. Since I don't want administrator to run cron job to trigger consumer , and Task API is not available for Moodle 2.6, my approach to trigger consumer for the first time is to check in my event observer if consumer is running and start it if not. I used Moodle application cache store to store the value \"consumer_enabled\" to true or false, to prevent trigger to create new consumer if there is already one running in the background. It works fine, except when Apache is restarted. In that case, consumer terminates, but value in store remains true, so after Apache starts, my trigger will not initialize consumer again. Hope somebody have idea how to solve this problem, or suggest some other approach that would work better in my scenario. Thanks Zoran",

This is the first time I create code in Moodle, so I'm new to everything, I have basic PHP knowlegde.

Now I'm trying the following: In the module I have a button, and when a student clicks that button, I would like to set the course as completed for that student. I followed the documentation on the Moodle website but I'm stuck at this part. In the file mod_form.php I've added the following code, copied from mod_form.php in the feedback folder because it adds the field that I need when adding this activity: \n```text\npublic function add_completion_rules() {\n     $mform =& $this->_form;\n\n     $mform->addElement('checkbox',\n                        'completionsubmit',\n                        '',\n                        get_string('completionsubmit', 'feedback'));\n     // Enable this completion rule by default.\n     $mform->setDefault('completionsubmit', 1);\n     return array('completionsubmit');\n }\n\n public function completion_rule_enabled($data) {\n     return !empty($data['completionsubmit']);\n }\n```\n This adds the option \"View as completed if the feedback is submitted\", that's exactly what I need. But now I'm kind of stuck, I don't know what code to execute when I \"submit the feedback\" to set the course as completed. It's just a click on a button, but I don't know what part of code sets a course as completed. I tried searching it up everywhere, but I can't seem to find it. I even tried to look up the function in the whole existing feedback folder but it goes so deep, that I don't know where to look.. Keep in mind that I'm just getting started with this, so any help/tips are appreciated! Thanks in advance, Mark",

(o) Option one two. (o) Option one three [text input]. (o) Option two: [text input] [select input]. Thus only have 'Option one ...' active when 'Option one' is clicked on.  And have radio elements with appended select / text inputs? I'm an experienced Moodler but stumped on this one!

There is a great feature that will be available in 3.3 that will allow resources and activities to be available to students but not immediately visible to them ( MDL-4782 in the Tracker ) I think this would be something that would be useful at course level aswell. Say for example I have a course page that has resources/activities that I want students in several other courses to be able to access. I only want one instance each of the resources because, of course, I only want to have to edit them once. If I enrol the users to give them access to the resources, they will see this course in their list of courses on their dashboard . I don't want them to see it though in 'my courses', as I only want them to see their 'official' list of courses. If I could keep the course  'hidden' but available I could achieve this. Unless there's an existing way of doing this? Should I raise a tracker? I'm not a developer so would not be able to contribute practically myself (except for testing). Thanks Catherine",

Our problem: We modified the weeks format plugin to something similar in appearance of the grid format plugin. Now like every other plugin when you click on a section it opens its content with a list of added ressources and activities . Now this needs to be changed that there is onclick the section that there is again a section list (sub section of that section) where you could choose a chapter and after choosing the chapter/subsection you get again to the ressources and activities page. We created a new table in db with the same structure as the course_sections (just changed the \"course\" row to \"section\" and the \"section\" to \"sub_section\"). Aswell we tried to create the essential functions to interact with that table (namely: getSubSection($section_id), setSubSection($sub_id), createSubSection($section_id, $course), deleteSubSection($sub_id)). Now is the question how can we achieve to create a sub section? Which files would have to be edited, or what would be the approach? Oh further there is to say we have no permission to modify core files of moodle directly. Greetings some students ;)",

I'd try playing w/ https://daniel.hepper.net/blog/2012/04/restricting-ip-addresses-for-solr-with-jetty/ too ( http://deeb.me/20160223/bind-solr-5-5-to-localhost ). The Moodle docs covers the installation of the software not the security policies to be applied since they are specific to your environment and usually any OS starts with a basic but nice firewall configuration, enabled by default: do you have the chance to enable a local software firewall opening just HTTP/S and SSH and nothing else?

Unfortunately these logs can not be purged due to the nature of our installation so that's not an option. Migration of logs is a possibility, however I'm not sure where we'd need to start in order to do so as there are lots of extra fields in the new logstore_standard_log table that don't exist in the legacy log table.

However, to keep the plugin installation simple, I'm considering bundling the web service with the plugin code. In effect, the plugin's external file chooser will be available at http://moodle_url/repository/myplugin/service. (It can still be deployed externally, if desired, though.) Does this have any licensing or code checking implications? The web service code, while distributed with the plugin, is effectively a third party library when used this way. Do the usual Moodle code review processes apply to that code? Does it need to by GPL v3 licensed, or is that only required for the piece of code which calls the web service to load the external file chooser? Do I need to worry about whether the web service code uses libraries which replicate code in Moodle core (I'd prefer the web service to be independent of Moodle, so I don't really want to use Moodle's libraries, and would prefer to use those of my own choosing which I control)?

The answers to your questions depend on the ownership of the web service code, and what you intend to do with it. Do you own the copyright on the third party code (in which case you can license it however you wish)? Are you planning to distribute the resulting plugin, or just use it internally? (if you're not distributing it, and your usage is within the terms of the license, it doesn't matter.) If the third party code is owned by someone else, and you want to distribute the resulting plugin, then you need to look at how the third party code is licensed.  If it uses the GPL or a permissive open source license (such as BSD, MIT or Apache ), then that license allows you to distribute it however you wish, including as part of a GPL codebase (as long as you provide the necessary attribution etc). The only real issues would be if it's released under a proprietary license, or a license that's open source but not GPL-compatible .",

Ideally, I'd like to add the plugin to the Moodle plugins registry. In that situation, I would bundle the plugin code (GPL v3) along with all its dependencies (including my web service) in the plugin download . (This seems to be the way Moodle plugins work - there's no way to install dependencies other than packaging them into the plugin zip file, unless I've missed something.) To clarify, providing I treat my own web service code as third party code (as it can run standalone as a PHP app), do I have to apply the Moodle coding guidelines to that code? Or can I write it how I like and pull it into my plugin as a dependency (as long as the licensing is OK)? Thanks.",

          "Text": "May you all live in peace! I am a Moodle developer. I have developed a local plugin. The plugin allows managing webinars related information. It works fine. Now,I am looking for a way to create calendar events for every webinar entry so that site visitors can view Webinars information in Calendar block. Further, if the plugin modifies any webinar entry, the relevant calendar event may also modify accordingly. I have already created events in my plugin which fire when an entry is created, updated, and deleted. These events do not actually create calendar events. I know that when we create a course assignment with a due date, relevant calendar event gets created automatically. So, I was wondering how we manage calendar entries from within a plugin. I have tried to go through Events 2 API and have learned that /db/events.php file in a plugin can be used to define callback functions relevant to different events. I am wondering if I need to define these callback functions and then within observers.php, I need to write code to create calendar events? OR Is there a different way to accomplish the same. Thanks for your time to read my question. Looking to hear from Moodle gurus.",

Specifically when we programmatically un-enroll bunch of users in US, depending on the number users, it can take up to 30 minutes to unEnroll in this configuration which in turn results in the My SQL transactions having to also do the same in EU. We are calling the enrol_plugin->unenroll_user( x, y)  for every user. This API in turn calls bunch of other apis which include queries, deletes, etc. which the MySQL replication is choking on. My question is: is there a batch unEnroll api that we can pass the user id's, course id  to that would do this in bulk and be faster ? If not, is there a update SQL that we can run instead to do the same thing that we can simply call. Thanks A",

There are also some other kind of information submitted within the same form as the file. I already figured out how to store the information except the file. in the mod_form.php I already added the filepicker element, but somehow i am unable to save and store the the pdf  in my add_instance function (inside lib.php). As far as i understood, there are two ways to store a file in moodle: 1. Store it by yourself within the activity module, or 2. let the file api of moodle manage and save the submitted file. I would like to do the second thing, since I want also offer the opportunity to select an already existing file within this lecture/module and would like to keep all the pdfs reusable within other plugins. So i already read the files api documentation and checked some other activity modules, but somehow I am unable to figure out how to properly add this file. I also had a briefly look over the resource mod files, but again without success. Could someone share an concrete example of how to store a pdf with moodles file api (or anything else that would fit my requirements)? I am fairly new to moodle plugin development and might be on the wrong track here, so any help is appreciated. thanks in advance!",

Using the tools available in moodle: Using the enrolled users screen to sort by \"manual enrollment\" method and role of \"student\" then clicking \"Last Access to course\" twice will bring the users that accessed the course to the top. This is great but the bad part is that after i scroll or next to the page that starts showing the users that have \"never\" accessed the course I have to click on each one individually (the ability to select all would help here) and then I select from the drop down \"delete selected user enrollments\" and on the next page confirm I want to delete them. Then wait minutes for it to perform the task after its complete then I have to individually check each user with \"never\" and repeat the process over and over until I have removed all the users. With over 5000 users to unenroll from 100's of courses this becomes much too time consuming. And this is for only one particular course. I will have to do this on over 300 courses. Can I use a SQL query to do the following? And if so I have no experience writing such a SQL query, does anyone have or can write a query like this?

          "Text": "Hello there. I'm new to this forum. I have some questions about moodle installation. I installed Moodle on a webserver from a hosting provider . I also installed Sloodle to use it with Second Life. I 'm writing my master thesis and I 'm doing a research about collaborative learning with virtual worlds. The problem is that I have to open ports on the firewall of the domain but it is not possible so I have a few questions: 1)Should I use a proxy server for that, as it is mentioned in Sloodle Documentation? 2)Is it possible to install moodle locally on my PC (Windows) and make sloodle communicate with the rezzer? 3)Or should I install moodle on Ubuntu server and get it run online? Thanks in advance for any help!",

You need to take a look at the content of $myuser->sd and see why strtotime is generating a timestamp of 0 (easiest way is using xdebug + a suitable IDE; if that's not possible, you could try some 'echo' statements instead). You may also want to use 'userdate' instead of 'date', as that will handle timezone conversion for you.",

          "Text": "I'm developing a plugin that adds a menu icon to Moodle's navigation bar (left of the notifications & messages menus, in v3).  The best way I could find to add it was with jQuery, using myplugin_extend_navigation() as a trigger to run: \n```text\n$PAGE->requires->js_call_amd('myplugin/myjscode', 'init', array($myparam))\n```\n That seems to work fine for me, but this context seems to be restricting what I want to do next. I'd like the menu to be rendered differently for admin users, vs. student or teacher users.  Since there isn't a simple isAdmin property to check, I've used the Access API to check the permissions on an action that I assume only admins can take.  This code has been working in my dev environment: \n```text\n$isAdmin = has_capability('moodle/site:manageblocks', context_module::instance(1) );\n```\n The problem is that not every environment will have a context module with the ID 1.  So, I started looking for ways to check for valid module IDs. A module can get the $cm argument from _extend_navigation() , but a local plugin only gets $nav . $PAGE->cm is also empty. Are there other options to identify admin users in this case?  Thanks in advance.",

Within this function, you can check your capabilities and output plain HTML which will then be added to the navbar right where you described it. See https://moodle.org/plugins/local_navbarplus for a plugin of my colleague Kathrin as an example how to use this callback function. And, if you think your usecase could fit into our plugin, don't hesitate to create a ticket on Github to discuss it further. PS: If you want to check if the user is an admin, have a look at the is_siteadmin() function. Thanks, Alex",

The previous developer left nothing behind in terms of documentation or help at all, so I'm trying to get this installation running locally so I can start to work on it. I have the db and code copied to a local VM , pretty straight forward, everything should be fine, but for some reason when I try to access the site locally, it takes me to the \"configure your main administrator account\" screen, part of installation.  So for some reason, the site thinks it needs to be installed still, or finish being installed or something.  The db and code I have are from the production site, which runs fine.  So I'm wondering what I'm missing. I'm hoping some of you can point me to what checks Moodle does to decide whether or not installation is complete, or give me some idea of why it thinks it needs an admin account, when it should already exist. Hopefully that's enough to go on. Thanks! Oh, according to version.php in the code, the version is 2015051105.03",

A little more context : I've set the config according to my local environment, and for the record, I didn't even change the domain , I'm just using a local hosts file to resolve the original domain locally, so domain references in the db and the config should be ok.   The site responds locally in that I can hit the domain locally and get to the site, but I can't actually log in because for whatever reason it thinks it's not fully installed yet. DB access does not appear to be the problem.  I know the creds work and the config is set accordingly and there are no errors related to db access.  The only indication of a problem is that the site doesn't go to the main page, doesn't load the custom theme, etc. I did make the assumption that the data directory was not required to be copied from the production server.  I figured it was just dynamically created based on the configuration, so I assumed it would recreate whatever it needs, but that could very well be the problem in this case.  So I'll get a copy of that and see how it goes from there.

After that I read the documentation about enroll methods -> https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Enrolment_methods , the closest way I found for what I need is. 1- Create courses using .csv. 2- Use Cohort sync with users, and then make the teacher select the right cohort for the course. The problem with that solution is, how can I automatic join the teacher with the courses? Is there a better way to do that?",

I have a SCORM lesson in which I do some Ajax calls (via click event) to a PHP file. This PHP file is inside this same SCORM Package, and makes an execution of code (actually, it is a query to a MySQL database , but it doesn´t work with an easy code either...). This should return the execution of the PHP file, but what it does is to return the content of the PHP file in plain text. As an example, returns: <?php echo \"This is a sample.\" ?> instead of This is a sample. As can be seen, This call reaches the PHP file but somehow it doesn´t execute it, just reads and returns plain text. Must be said that this works locally if I play my course directly in a browser, before making a SCORM Package,  so Ajax function and PHP file code work correctly. I think that it could be some issue with permissions or something like that... I have made some test that works. I have located my PHP file in another server , and after adding the CORS header to this PHP file, executes it and works correctly. This is some solution to my problem, but I can´t understand why this PHP file isn´t executed normally when if it is located in the same package as the rest of the SCORM Package. If it helps, I paste here my ajax function: $.ajax({ type: 'post', url: 'file.php', data: {student_id: student_id}, success:function(response) { console.log(response); GetPlayer().SetVar(\"nombre\", datos[1]); GetPlayer().SetVar(\"sexo\", datos[2]); } }, error : function() { console.log('responseFail'); } }); I hope someone has encountered this same problem and has an answer to it.

You probably don't have much control over the situation, but Moodle 1.9 is now completely unsupported - no bug fixes, no security fixes and (in pretty much all cases) no fixes from 3rd-part plugin developers to support it. The first thing that should happen is for the site you are working with to upgrade to Moodle 2.9 (via Moodle 2.2). As for setting up Moodle 1.9, it should be more or less the same as setting up a Moodle 2.9 site. As a quick experiment, I just tried an install based on some M1.9 code I had lying around and it worked fine, apart from a few debugging warnings, on the same dev box I've got all my other Moodle sites on (in case it helps: Debian Linux + Apache webserver + PHP 5.6 + MySQL 5.5.44).",

So no, as Davo says, you cannot create a 1.9 theme on Moodle2.x You can set up 1.9 in the same way as 2.x on a local computer to develop a theme. You may then be able to find some useful themes in the OLD themes list https://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?id=6552 and old 1.9 themes documentation at https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Themes_1.9 However, please bear in mind that both Moodle1.9 and its themes are unsupported and the best solution to your issue, as Davo suggests, would be to get the site upgraded - both for the sake of the features, the support and also the security fixes that have gone on over the last few years.",

Fortunately, there's a ES6 compatible \"harmony\" branch of UglifyJS , which is compatible. Changing package.json from \n```text\n\"grunt-contrib-uglify\": \"1.0.1\",\n```\n to \n```text\n\"grunt-contrib-uglify\": \"gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify#harmony\",\n```\n ...and running `npm update` fixes the parse errors, and is presumably backwards-compatible - unfortunately I can't run Behat at the moment to run check for regressions. Would I be right in thinking that grunt-contrib-uglify will need to merge their ES6 support into their main release, before Moodle can adopt it? Cheers, Dave.",

In most cases - unless requested by someone in the thread (e.g. to provide secure information such as log in details to help with the support) - help should be requested through the forums, where more people with expertise can contribute, rather than via PM to an individual. Personally speaking, I am not able to provide support via PM, except in rare cases relating to my own themes/plugins (and even then would recommend going through the forum/plugin page).",

I see that test classes do no include /config.php file, so the execution won't pass the defined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die(); statement. Modifying these tests including the /config.php file doesn't work neither; other depedencies problems related to PHPUnit framework appear. I guess that changing the files you want to test is not the intended process. So, which is the correct process to execute the unit tests? The way I've tried to run them is from CLI, and I've tried with several versions of PHPUnit. Best regards, Julen",

Here is a crossreference site if you prefer browsing on the web instead of your own Moodle-Php-Dir: http://www.sourcexref.com/xref/moodle/nav.html?_functions/index.html (Moodle 2.4) http://xref-diff.mukudu-dev.net/moodle26 (Moodle 2.6) I still am not sure what you intend to do exactly. If you want to create a list of courses, e.g. for navigation purposes, you can use my sitenavigation block. You will find it in the modules&plugins database. It is a block to display categories and courses in nested folders. There are a lot of Admin options to set up that block. If you need navigation, you could use it as is. If you need something else, you could study the code in there and take what you need. Rosario",

Is there a way to have the pre-checker ignore that library?  I do have an thirdpartylibs. xml file identifying the location of the library files, but it seems to be ignored by the pre-checker ( https://github.com/sbourget/moodle-mod_pcast/blob/master/thirdpartylibs.xml ) Any ideas?",

          "Text": "Moodle: v3.3.1 Theme: Mytheme (cloned from Boost for template/layout, but using own styles) Hi there, I'm trying to change the way Course listing page is at the moment. It uses Topic format where all topics/modules of a course are listed first as links followed by a new page where each section's individual activities /resources appear. I'd like to - Move the \"Forums or General\" section on the right with other blocks - Add some of our own CSS classes in the markup to style the Course Listing page as per our theme The theme config has the below renderer set and I also have a core_renderer in my theme working perfectly fine \n```text\n$THEME->rendererfactory = 'theme_overridden_renderer_factory';\n```\n https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=229890 is somewhat similar to what I'm trying to do but not sure if it's the correct way & what should be the folder/naming convention? As per the above link, rather than extending `format_section_renderer_base`, it's best to extend `format_topics_renderer` as that's the format being used. So have followed that path but to no success. This is what I have so far: \n```text\ntheme\n  mytheme\n     classes\n        output\n           core\n              course_format_topics_renderer.php\n```\n \n```text\nnamespace theme_mytheme\\output\\core;\n\n\n\n\ndefined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die();\n\n\n\n\nuse moodle_url;\n```\n But this doesn't work as it has no effect whatsoever on the Course listing pages. I think if I manage to override the below functions in my theme renderer somehow, I can then manipulate the Course Listing page completely. \n```text\nformat_topics_renderer::print_single_section_page\nformat_topics_renderer::print_multiple_section_page\n```\n Any thoughts or guidance in this direction will be appreciated? Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "Hi, I'd be very grateful if any fellow members of the community could confirm whether their implementation of Moodle 3.1 and Unoconv is capable of converting documents which contain non-latin or special characters in their filenames? In our testing, it's not (this is under Moodle 3.1.1, PHP 5.6 and Unoconv 0.7). While conversion of documents containing such characters in their filenames is successful via the command line, submitting the same document to an assignment in Moodle and then attempting to view the converted version only results in a blank page (please note that otherwise our Moodle/Unoconv installation seems to be functioning fine). Just to be clear here, I'm talking about documents which contain characters such as the following in their filename: àéíôü!@#$%^&*()-_+= or other non-English character sets e.g. Chinese, Japanese, etc. Please can other users verify whether this does or doesn't work on their system and let me know. If there's a broader issue I'll then create a tracker item and hopefully it will get resolved asap. Just for reference, I did notice that another user made mention of this same issue via an existing tracker issue (butwhich relates to a separate bug): https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-54914?focusedCommentId=414723&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-414723 Many thanks.",

We are counting on 30.000 - 60.000 users, and that will of cause take its toll on the server (s). But which measurements are we talking about? Do we need a cluster of servers to run the site and another to run the database ? Do we need one big monster machine to run the site and another to run the database. Do we need one Big monster only to minimize mysql hang-load time. There are many different suggestions, but i like to hear from those who has experience in such a large scale solution. What are the requirements, for the hardware? I hope you can help. Thanks, kind regards Henrik Sune Pedersen",

          "Text": "Hej Henrik, the total number of users is not necessarily an indication of how big your setup has to be, it is mainly about concurrency. I used to run an 85k users, 500 concurrent (as in simultaneous) off one server (48Gb memory 24 CPU threads). You will need to optimize everything, database, webserver, php, memcache to achieve the best performance. One big machine makes it easy to optimize and configure, however this can only scale up to a certain amount. A cluster scales (if done right) much further, but is much more complicated to optimize, and will give worse performance for the end user due to added latencies. For database there are essentially three hardware parameters that influence performance: Memory Disk IOPS CPU Good luck! David",

Depending on the version of Moodle you're developing on you might need an empty lib.php to stop it complaining / breaking. The only string definition you strictly need in the language file is: $string['pluginname'] = 'Whatever you want to call your plugin'; The code from Rex Lorenzo's post in the discussion you link to looks like it's intended to be put into db/upgrade.php. You can't just copy the code in though - there's a bunch of boilerplate required in upgrade.php (see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Upgrade_API ), and it needs to correspond to your plugin version in version.php Hope that helps!",

The first is to allow multiple users to share an email address. The second is to require a unique code in order to register for the site and another to register for a specific course. Additionally, I need to set up a second registration form that will allow registered users to add another course using a username, password, and unique course code. I'm looking for a way to integrate the registration form into my authentication plugin or to override the registration form by some other means. Is it possible to override the registration form without editing it directly?

So here's a bit more detail as to what I've done: 1. I have a custom authorization plugin that is very heavily based on the db authorization plugin. It just has a couple of changes to methods that populate the $USER global so that I have access to it when automatically enrolling users into courses (actually goups). 2. I have a block called \"enrollment.\" Which consists of nothing more than block_enrollment.php (attached), version.php and the necessary lang files. All the block does is provide a couple of links. It is set up to hide if a user is logged in. If you want it to actually show up on the home page, you have to login as an admin (or someone with sufficient permissions), turn on editing, and place it on the page. 3. I created an enrol plugin (attached) and copied ~/login/signup.php and ~/login/signup_form.php into the new enrol plugin. I renamed this to existing_signup.php existing_signup_form.php and copied those files to create new_signup.php and new_signup_form.php. I created a lib.php file where I extended the enrol_plugin class and added a method called enrol_student which throws the student into the appropriate course. I made several edits to the signup forms in order to leverage the exact actions that I wanted. 4. There was some configuration that needed to happen on the group and course level to ensure that users were allowed to self-register. I can't remember every detail of the configuration so if you have any problems please post here and I'll try to get answers to you.",

          "Text": "Hi Chris. I've been reading through this very interesting thread as its something I too have been dabbling with for a while. We too seem to have fairly specific requirements of course access and the signup procedure, which has resulted in me needing to customise my Moodle installation quite a bit. I have been desperately trying to be doing changes as \"cleanly\" as possible, so that I have no issues when I upgrade the main Moodle core. So far I have managed two updates (2.0 -> 2.1.x -> 2.2.x) without any significant issues. Our basic requirement is that our courses have guest access to allow students to have a look around before deciding if they want to take the course. After this, if they are interested they have to go to a specific signup page just for that course which has a few custom questions or dropdown selction options which just relate to that course. On some courses, the students also have to enter a unique invitation code (not a common one). The way we manage this at the moment is that we have each course running in a dedicated theme. In these themes, I have changed the general.php file, removing links to the standard Moodle login page and instead I link users to a simple customised login page for the course that also has a link to a dedicated external signup form. This form then populates the standard Moodle signup form along with the standard moodle user fields and a few custom fields. After this a normal 'email-based self registration' takes place for that user (with a confirmation email etc.) just as if the user had filled out the original Moodle signup form himself. On most courses, when we post the form data, we also populate an external database with the username and coursename which we basically use only to invisibly matriculate that user later. So far this option has worked alright, though I don't really like it as it's a bit messy. The development was a bit \"ad-hoc\", and as usual we kept changing our minds as we were going along. I really prefer the option you have laid out here with a special enrollment block that has the links to your customised forms which are a part of your customised enrolment plugins. In my context , I could work on that, and expand the funcionality of this plugin so that I have either seperate forms in the plugin (for the different courses) or seperate enrolment plugins. However, what I can't really understand is how the enrolment plugin works, and  how it interacts with your custom authorization plugin. I have downloaded the enrolment plugin that you posted here, copied it into my enrol directory. I then manage to install it, activate it in my \"Manage enrol plugins\" page, but then I can't seem to get it working beyond that. When I navigate to the forms, I get an error saying \"Authentication plugin not found\". Any ideas what I am missing? I would be really grateful if you could give me a hand. Likewise, if anybody has any other tips or ideas based on my specific requirements as listed above, please let me know. Thanks a lot!",

Is there a way for me to find this out using a built in objects, or am I going to have to get crazy with the database myself?",

The documentation should be up to date but I keep http://moosh-online.com/commands/ up to date only for the latest version of the command - so it may happen that there is a difference between version for Moodle 2.8 and 3.1. It's very easy to edit the documentation - for example http://moosh-online.com/commands page is generated from https://github.com/tmuras/moosh/blob/master/www/commands/index.md . If you have any documentation improvements, please send them to me as pull request on github. Why would it run out of memory listing users for a course with less than 10 users? It should not. If you can provide more information and report an issue, so I can reproduce the problem - I may be able to fix it. cheers, Tomek",

IE :  is there some specific \"simplish\" code  currently in use in core that makes good sense of how to watch the event log and trigger actions automatically,   (ie:    user completes a course,  call back function on the event fires a custom method    (something like some additional logging to a custom table or a system wide action that needs to be performed for just that user based on the action watched. Use case: Say we have 3 Primary \"Courses\",   Course A, Course B, and Course C Each Courses is for a different type of training experience, but sometimes lessons can carry over into multiple roles.  We don't want users who complete Course A, then decided to take Course B having to completely redo activity(s) that are exactly the same as some activities in Course A If a student completes an activity that is an exact match in another course,  we want to give them credit for that individual activity in the new course so they aren't forced to view the material again.    Currently I have a monster of a local plugin that applies those \"page equivalencies  en mass,   but it's not super database friendly and it would be REALLY great to set it up off off a listener/watch/callback method. Absolutely any pointers, code samples, or as many links as you could find would be extremely helpful.   Even if it's just *plugin X* uses this functionality on \"file Y\" on line \"Z\".",

A decent example of writing custom event(s) can be found in blocks/comments/classes As for listeners you can find one example in blocks/recent_activity/classes. Bottom line for the listeners: Create directory classes inside your custom plugin and in it add file observer.php. In that file declare class named <my plugin component name>_observer and add listeners to whatever events you may need, List of existing events can be found here https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2#Existing_events Create file events.php in db directory of your custom plugin (in there you define bindings of your event listeners to the actual events) The case you explained would most likely involve use of core\\event\\course_completed event. Let us assume that you have plugin located in blocks/foo which means it's component name is block_foo so therefore: \n```text\n// content of file located in blocks/foo/db/events.php\n$observers = array (\n    array(\n        'eventname' => '\\core\\event\\course_completed',\n        'callback'  => 'block_foo_observer::course_completed',\n    ),\n    // Add more if needed.\n);\n\n// Content of file located in blocks/foo/classes/observer.php\nclass block_foo_observer {\n    public static function course_completed(\\core\\event\\course_completed $event) {\n        // Do something here.\n    }\n}\n```\n And that's it.",

One other thing, if you are unsure what Firefox version you have, do not visit the about page to find out or it'll upgrade; turn automatic upgrade off first, as below. --sam This is a general problem; here's the bug reference . They have fixed it in Selenium 2.0.43, which is not out yet. So I recommend developers either don't upgrade Firefox, or use Chrome, until this new Selenium version comes out. If you have already upgraded Firefox it is possible to downgrade as follows: 1. In Firefox settings, go to Options / Advanced / Update and select 'Check for updates, but let me choose'. 2. Download Firefox 31 installer from here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/31.0/win32/en-GB/ (Firefox Setup 31.exe). 3. Close Firefox and run the installer.",

          "Text": "Hello, some teachers of the institution i work for found two issues with the \"locked\" field of a grade/category item. If you try to edit a category grade item, let's say, you change the max grade and also checks the \"locked\" checkbox, your maxgrade is edited but the item is not locked. Then you change just the locked status, save and it works. If you try to change the maxgrade again and at same time unlock the item, it works. I have not found an issue on tracker related to this. This is more problematic. You have a \"locked\" category item, the locked help text says: \"If ticked, grades can no longer be automatically updated by the related activity. \"  But if you change, let's say, maxgrades again, then the item is updated but the grades are not recalculated, because of the locked option. So, it is not only by the related activity, but any changes won't take effect until you unlock the item (settings areare stored and retrieved ok, but no changes to grades). So, this help message hides part of the problem. It may be somewhat related to MDL-48634 It seems this is not the expected behaviour. If the changes really should not be applied, then the form fields for other settings should be disabled when the item is locked. But it seems to be a difficult approach: what if you lock an item, save it, get back to it, unlock, change something, lock again and save? This way, the more appropriate behaviour would be to apply the changes and recalculate grades even if the items are locked, just for the item settings, not for the activities as is said on the help text. What do you think? Kind regards,",

          "Title": "MUC identifiers, proposed change to implementation",
          "Text": "Hi, During my implementation of MDL-53213 it realised that MUC identifiers can change the cache pointer of an existing cache eg; $properties = array('dbfamily' => 'pg sql '); $cache = cache::make('core', 'databasemeta', $properties); Then; $properties = array('dbfamily' => ' mysql '); $cache2 = cache::make('core', 'databasemeta', $properties); This will result in $cache = $cache2, which is not what I would have expected as a developer.  It feels dangerous and counter intuitive. Proposal: Identifiers and Sharing options be added to the definition_hash. Identifiers would not be able to be changed once a cache::make has been called.  You will need to complete a second cache::make if you need a different cache option set. Remove multikeyprefix.  This would be handled by the store as the singlekeyprefix along with the definition hash if that was interesting to the store.  Some may need it for keys, others may not as definition hashes will have separated it. This will then uniquely identify a cache by those things and the code above would result in two separate instances.  It also has a benefit of allowing developers to purge a cache based on that new definition.  So in the databasemeta case, I would just purge the pgsql cache, and not all of them.  Developers can then use this function to make identifiers like smaller sub-caches for certain use cases.  I've had a couple where I want the identifier to be a userid or forumid and manage it as a separate cache. Generate singlekeyprefix would then not be required, the singlekeyprefix is the definition hash. Then the way definition hash and key hash are handled should be pushed downwards into the store.  A reason for this is something like; Redis can uses hashes for each of the definitions. A filestore can do the same thing. Memcached would need to use a different strategy of prefixing the definition hash before the key_hash in a single key.  But it has to do that now.  It will still have all the same purge problems.  But other caches would no longer suffer from purging all versions of identifiers and sharing options when a cache is purged. There is currently very little documentation about the usefulness of identifiers and it's original intended use.  I have spend quite some time working on the caching code and still don't understand the purpose they were made for.  My idea above is much clearer to me. Possible future direction is also to push the calculation of the key into the store rather than the loader.  The store is the one that needs to handle restriction on the keyspace.  Whether it's size or character options available.  Each store could determine the best rules for it.  This coupled with the definition hash change would let a store decide how it indexes the content we send to it.  File stores can have directories, redis can have hashes, mongodb can do the same kind of thing.  Memory caches can just use keys as-is and memcached could put the keys together as it can't ensure unique keys without that. I would like feedback on whether others think this is a move in the right direction and if there are any objections or ideas around this proposal.",

It has come to my attention through MDL-53875 that session cache is broken and a perfect case for the use of identifiers. To try to explain 2 a little more; Session cache for users is just a set of elements split by session_id().  That is the same as a set of elements split by an identifier.  With the capability of the proposal above, you get session caches to be much more like application caches in terms of code and management.  In my view it would reduce the complexity of the code and provide more consistent interface for users.  As MDL-53875 shows, there isn't any testing around session cache that ensures it cleans up correctly or can find the right sessions to destroy.  Work on MDL-55604 also showed there is no testing around identifiers at this time and the reliability of them is only tested by some use of them in the databasemeta cache.  Some small amount of testing was added in MDL-55604 , however it is a complicated area.",

On a general off topic note about MUC - since you seem to be working the most in this area, my personal feeling (without actual technical analysis) is that if we should be doing anything, we should actually be reducing the feature set of MUC and only allowing developers to do very performant operations with it. Anecdotally it seems there is so much functionality that many people don't know how to use and too often we are coming across MUC uses which are utilising its 'flexibility' at the cost of performance (e.g. serialisation impact). On reflection I think it would've been better to restrict the way which data which can be stored in MUC so it was as fast as possible rather than as flexible as possible.",

I ask this as it sounds as though you may have your sessions stored on (local) disk, with the load balancer sending the later request to a different node which doesn't have the session file available.  You may be able to identify this situation by tracking which node serves each request.  If this does turn out to be the problem, switching to either database or memcache/memcached (assuming a single memcached instance is shared by all nodes for this purpose) session handling ought to do the trick; if that's not an option for whatever reason, perhaps you can configure the load balancing to use \"sticky\" sessions (pinning the user to a single node for the duration of their session) so that all of the requests within a given user's session are served by the same node and thus have the session file available.",

Courses are continually updated by staff throughout the academic year. As you would expect someone slips up once in a while and that is a big problem if student submissions / grades are involved. What we would like to do is make a distinction between activities with no student activity so that staff retain the ability to create / delete at will when adding new resources but give more protection to resources that students have already contributed to. I know there is a confirm button to click during delete only really guards against stray clicks, it doesn't guard against human error. Clicking that becomes habitual and if you make the mistake of clicking delete in the first place and often you are not going to realise your mistake a second later second later when you are asked to confirm. I know we are not alone in having an issue with this and would like to do something about it but technically I am not sure what the best approach would be.",

I've had a brief look and Moodle seems to consistently use one function that could be extended to implement this kind of feature (allowing for it to be on or off etc). Then create a 'Reycle Bin' esque page, where people can actually delete items from their courses and that can be capability controlled. Might be worth looking at a cron function too to clear the recycle bins every x days. Obviously all of this idea would need to be configurable, as what we want, would probably be overkill for a small school or business. How far had you got on thinking a bit more into this? This is something that I would be keen to work on, because of the need mentioned by Jez in that 'whoopsie' moments can happen fairly easily.",

          "Text": "Hi Tim, I've been burrowing through the code this afternoon to figure out the simplest way of achieving a 'Recycle Bin' . One of the simplest ways that I can think of achieving this (who doesn't prefer simple solutions) is to extend the existing logic for deleting a course module (course/lib.php course_delete_module). My idea is as follows, add a 'deleted' tag to the course_modules table, that will be 0 for not deleted, and when it's set as deleted it would be a timestamp of when. When the delete function is called, it checks to see what this value is, if it's got a timestamp then actually run the delete process. If it hasn't, then set the value to the current timestamp. This then allows for the function that loads course modules for viewing in a course to be changed, to ignore anything with a value set in deleted (We don't want them to appear on a course anymore as they should now be found in the recycle bin). Then we can create a page that loads all the course modules that have a value in a new page called 'Recycle Bin', allowing users to permanently delete this or to restore it. The benefits of this flag and timestamp, is it's simple to restore content back to where it was. And with the timestamp we can empty the recycle bin every x days. There would be backups, and this isn't meant to become a permanent store of information. I'm not sure what others thoughts are on this?",

If that is done it would be better to catch everything on a course not just assignments as it would make little sense to users if some things were recoverable and not others. In terms of overhead to a given system it would just mean some files / records sticking around for x days longer than they would otherwise, assuming there was a cron process running to clear things down after say 30 days. I don't think this would interfere with course backup / restore as it would just use an additional flag (timestamp) in the mdl_course_modules table which those processes are unaware of. If you could configure retention period in admin individual sites could implement their own policies on clearing down resources after x period, or disable the feature entirely. There would be no impact on the way people use Moodle and I don't think would need any additional capabilities (given there arent any specifically for delete now). All users would see is a \"recycle bin\" / page that gave them the option to restore / completely delete items up until the time limit set by cron is reached and resources are cleared down automatically.

If we can get their stuff back it would probably be more useful and less disruptive, and it looks a lot easier to implement. With this process you dont actually delete when you click delete, it leaves the resource in place with a flag / timestamp which renders it invisible until such time as it is cleaned up (actually deleted) or restored. Users could work exactly as they do now, but if they ever make a mistake they could undo it. I just found these old links which are worth a look, all relate to some kind of recycle bin: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-37139 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=217794 http://www.moodlenews.com/2013/moodlewish-how-about-a-recycle-bin/ I think this would be a better aproach than my initial thought of capabilities which kind of grew out of an assumption they were already there! I still think there should be capabilities for delete as there are for addinstance but there seems to be a significant amount of work to do in the front end to conditionally display the delete options.

The aim of this plugin is: - provide a mechanism to override through inheritance most of Moodle core classes (Eg. moodlepage,  any renderer, etc etc) - this mechanism should be theme independent - this mechanism should not conflict with standard moodle edition - but rather co-exist so that one could quickly switch on/off according to his needs - and obviously survive a moodle version upgrade In its basic form the plugin ships with only an empty derived custom_page class [CODE] class custom_page extends moodlepage{ //you decide what to override } [/CODE] and a customloader class to use this class to initialise the $PAGE instance and a plugin setting to switch on/off the plugin itself and a couple of lines to add in config.php While I know this is a rather controversial idea (and maybe already discarded by core developers), I think it still might interest someone and has some use cases. I set up a github repository ( https://github.com/mvit777/custom_moodle ) with a complete proof-of-concept implementation of the idea and extensive documentation.

This accomplish what you were trying to do with the merge commit that CiBot is complaining about, which is to keep your branch up-to-date with the most recent changes upstream. It will also let you fix your commit message, which is the other thing CiBot was complaining about. Another way to make CiBot happy would be to create a new branch based on the most recent version of the upstream branch and cherry-pick your single commit onto it, though it would require you to update the ticket's branch fields.",

This error happens when a webpage expects a parameter to be passed from another page (by post or cookie), and it fails to do so. This happens sometimes when user session times out, due to inactivity, or when an URL that needs that mandatory parameter is instead directly typed in URL bar or invoked from browser bookmarks, like the SCORM Player page not being launched from a link in the course page.

I tried both $activity->availabilityinfo and $activity->availability, but they both don't contain this information in a usable format. I also found the printed text when an activity is not yet available here: $ci = new \\core_availability\\info_module($mod); $fullinfo = $ci->get_full_information(); However, it seems a detour to extract it from that.

Examples from core would be \"course_list\" or \"course_overview\". There is no reason that I can think of to move your block's settings into a separate file, since by definition, your block is a custom block. And \"index.php\" would be a bad choice anyway, since those usually have a specific purpose to be run as a standalone script. Hope this helps. mike",

Since it will not be used in all courses and by all users I need to support hiding/showing it dynamically. In Moodle plugin I implemented it is possible to list all Moodle Activities and blocks and to activate it in specific course. If, for example, Moodle activity is not activated for specific course, I need to disable that Moodle activity for the teacher, so he can't add it in his course. I know how to make already created activities invisible, but I don't know how to remove activity from \"Add an activity or resource\" menu in edit mode so teacher is prevented to use something that is not to be used in his course. For Moodle block, I need to hide/show it in the similar way like with activities, on the course level, without having teacher to manually add it. Teacher would just activate specific item in my custom Moodle plugin, and if there is block related to that item it should be activated without teacher having to search which block should be activated. On the other side, I also need to support same request on the user level, so if student decides to turn off/on support provided by my plugin, it should hide/show custom block(s) that are integrated with my plugin. Hope somebody have some idea how I can make this work Thanks, Zoran",

Changes are only necessary if a student gets a new grade or something in the course structure changes. Since I want to build it with best practise and good performance architecture Im thinking about the following points: - I tried to do everything with API calls, parsing the needed data out of them. I could also put everything together in one self made SQL Query with some Joins. Which option is the better one? - Should I hold all the data in arrays or create and insert a new DB table? I guess arrays would have the better performance but the database solution maybe prettier and easier to maintain? - At the moment Im executing everything in the get_content() function in the main file, so everything is loaded all the time with every site refresh, which is not optimal regarding performance and modularity I guess. How can I design that better? - With a database solution I would calculate everything and store it in a table. Then I would have to listen to events and everytime an activity gets graded or something in the course changes, like a new activity gets created, I would have to update the table in the database. Does that make sense? I hope somebody can give me some advice regarding these issues! Also a link to an example plugin covering some of this things would help a lot! Thank you!",

Which option is the better one? This is a bit of a toss-up between raw performance and maintainability.  Sticking everything into a big SQL query will probably be more performant (as long as you write the SQL well), but it will probably be less obvious what's going on when you or someone else comes back to this code at a later date. Also, API functions will take care of any underlying changes to the database structure, which you'd otherwise have to watch out for. - Should I hold all the data in arrays or create and insert a new DB table?

Does that make sense? Have you looked at caching ?  It sounds like that would be better suited to this case than storing the display data in the database.  You can just stick the display data in the cache, then check if it's there before doing new queries/API calls.  You can also define events which will automatically invalidate data in the cache.",

As long as i know, each question can only have one category, so I'd leave it for a mandatory field. I considered the possibility of using a category structure for the Subject and maybe leave the optional fields for the tags. It would be good to organize them better than just throwing every one of them into a cloud of tags. Anyways, I need to understand better what resources could Moodle offer me to use multiple categories, tags, taxonomies and other ways of organising the questions. I would also appreciate some suggestions to implement whatever is needed to support this structure and perspective of the complexity of what I'm trying to achieve. Thanks in advance",

So when a user reaches a decisionpoint, they choose a decisionitem. What is displayed next in the course depends on the decision they made.

The problem was to do with the size of the Moodledata folder.  It was far to big to FTP the content without corrupting the files for this particular server.  I tried using the hosts control panel tools to zip / tar /tar.gz the files but this failed. Finally I contacted the host and they created a tar file for me.  I them FTP'd this directly to the new server using Linux command line ftp.  This way I could also see that the filesize on the original server and the one that arrived were the same size, which is a good sign. I then unzipped the tar, moved the folder it to the correct place in the file system, renamed it (moodledata) and reset the permissions. It worked!! A lesson here is, if the Moodledata folder is very large just ask the host to zip it as a tar then transfer directly to the new host.  Don't download to a local machine then upload again.  The transfers increase the risk of corrupting the data.",

At first I used 'tar.gz' to compress the folder and used Filezilla for the transfer to the new server and none of the images would show on the site including the logo (after I did all the necessary URL changes in  the DB, as the domain name changed). I then used zip to compress and transfer and it worked! I'm not sure if 'tar' compression would have prevented this too, or if it was in the FTP transfer where the corruption happened. Bottom line is, retry the process using different compression method perhaps and then transfer (ftp) again. This could save you time instead of trying to looking in all the config settings etc.",

          "Text": "Hi Andy, When you say that you migrated the site, did you migrate the Moodle data directory as well as the directory with the Moodle code in it?  It sounds to me as though your Moodle data folder is either missing or\nincomplete - if the new server is configured to use a path that Apache can write to, it\nwill have created a new empty folder structure on the new server in the\nabsence of the original one - so it won't give you any PHP errors, but no files (resources, SCORM activities , or anything else stored in the data directory) will work. If you're not sure where the data directory is, check the value of $CFG-> dataroot in config.php - and make sure that the new server has $CFG->dataroot set to the appropriate location (containing the copy of all the files from your old server). If this is what's happened, since you've already run the upgrade to 2.6, you won't want to transfer the cache and various other temporary directories - the most important bit to transfer now is the \"filedir\" folder within the data directory, and if you have any filesystem repositories configured, the \"repository\" folder too.  If there's a \"lang\" folder, you might also want to take that - any local customisations to the language pack(s) are stored in that folder, but you should check those to make sure that they still apply, as strings do sometimes change between Moodle versions.  Everything other than those three folders (filedir, repository, lang) should have been rebuilt (where appropriate) by Moodle already - and will be appropriate for 2.6 (whereas the ones on the old server will still be Moodle 2.2 files, which could potentially cause some strange issues). Edited to add: If you did copy the data directory over and it's in the location configured in config.php, double-check the file permissions - if your webserver can't read the existing files, it can't serve them (but newly uploaded files will be created by the webserver, and thus it will have access to them). Hope that helps.",

Replaced the original URLs in the SQL dump to the one for my local machine and imported into a local database and then made the changes to the config file for my local machine. Tested the site worked and made a backup of it. I then upgraded the site to the next version of Moodle, moved any missing module back into the file system and tested it.  All seemed good. I then repeated the process of backing up the latest version including files, moodledata and database then upgrading and checking for new module updates. Once it was updated to the version I wanted and it was working locally I migrated the whole site to the live server, changing the URLs in the database to the live site URL and making the relevant changes to the config files. Once running on the live site some images are missing, docx files don't download correctly and articulate flash does not play. The file and folder permissions for moodledata appear to be fine. I'm wondering if its a wider server issue.  An apache setting or missing php module. Andy",

We are currently beginning a project to integrate Moodle with our Student Record Systems (SITS from Tribal) with a view to using various admin/management aspects of SITS (it holds details of disabilities, so automating possible extensions to assignment due dates is one example) as well as passing grades back from Moodle to SITS. I don't believe SITS currently has an LTI integration, but I am interested to hear if anyone else has already done something similar and how it was achieved. Many thanks, Richard",

However, there are several places in Moodle in which the fullname() function is passed with the $override parameter and our $CFG->fullnamedisplay setting is ignored. My question is the $override flag needed and does it still make sense with the \"Additional name fields\" feature? In the ticket I list the places in which the override flag is set and it is annoying to have a config setting not respected across the system without a good reason. Please reply if you can give some good use cases for keeping the override flag that I am not thinking of or vote for the feature if you are also annoyed by this implementation.",

It is normally marked true when the user has the capability moodle/site:viewfullnames. Sometimes it is desirable on some sites to limit what names the students can see, but still allow teachers to see the full names of everyone. Since the introduction of the additional name fields and the alteration of the fullnamedisplay setting, we are now in the strange situation that if all of the fields are configured in the fullnamedisplay setting that people with the moodle/site:viewfullnames capability are actually shown less information. I think that we could still make use of the moodle/site:viewfullnames capability and so I have been working on MDL-40356 which adds an additional setting for configuring how names are displayed with this capability. Perhaps people could comment here if they think that a new parameter is a good idea or not.",

I don't want to include the entire SDK in my plugin source. It's much bigger than my plugin and I don;t want to update my plugin each time AWS updates the SDK (which is very often). At the moment  am using the install.php to pull the SDK. For example: function xmldb_appstream_install() { file_put_contents(\"../mod/appstream/aws.phar\", fopen(\" http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar \", 'r')); } However this feels a bit brute force. Does Moodle support a package system? For example, would Moodle automatically install the packages listed in the requires section of composer.json or similar? Thanks.",

Whenever you push an update to GitHub, Travis kicks in and automatically checks both the PHP and JavaScript code. It works a treat for me - the results are shown online on the corresponding Travis website, e.g. https://travis-ci.org/ecampbell/moodle-atto_wordimport/jobs/92241555 for my particular plugin. Instructions on how to configure this are at https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=323384 The main downside is that you must first publish your changes to Github in order for the checks to run, so you then have to update the files again to fix the problems. Another issue is that the versions of the code-checking programs that run on the local Moodle CodeChecker are older than the versions on the Travis CI site, so you may get different results. For example, the directive \"@codingStandardsIgnoreLine\" generates a warning locally, but is accepted by Travis CI.",

          "Text": "Firstly, it's a bad idea to change core Moodle files, as it causes a lot of conflicts during upgrades. Far better to create a new TinyMCE plugin to handle this. The best way to achieve this is a plugin that defines a new capability that can be used to determine who can see the button (it should go in lib/editor/tinymce/plugins/MYPLUGINNAME/db/access.php - look at other examples to see the format). You should then create a lib.php file in the MYPLUGINNAME directory, with an 'update_init_params' function. The update_init_params function has a 'context' already, so you don't need to use the old get_context_instance functions (if you needed, you could call context_course::instance($courseid), but you don't need to in this case). Firstly do a 'has_capability('name of the new capability you created', $context)' to check if the user is able to add see the buttons at all. Next, as a site admin, you can override the role definitions at the level of the category, so that only 'course creators' (or is it 'editing teachers') within that specific category (and sub categories and courses) have that capability. Once you've established the capability, you can then look through the contents of the '$params' variable to remove the 'moodlemedia' button, if it is found in any of the 'theme_advanced_buttonsXX' parts (unless they do have the required capability). If you makes sure your plugin returns 9999 from 'get_sort_order', then it will run after the moodlemedia plugin, so it can remove the button from the settings, after it has been initialised. Feel free to ask for more explanation if that isn't enough help.",

In order to index the content, I run Tika in a terminal, run elasticsearch service and then run indexing either from the terminal or from scheduled tasks. either way, it seems that it is running, but the # docs will stay = 0, and if I search for a word, will get \"No results\".

I know we could do this with SAML (that is actually in the works) or Shiboleth, but I was hoping that short term 'hack' of the session data would suffice. If everyone says it can't be done, that's fine, I'm fine with the two sign-ins, but I have quite a few people finding it to be awkward. Thoughts? Thanks, Derek",

          "Text": "Background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomposed_character Preface: this is a issue in dnduploadlib.php in the course directory and unknown other places. I tried to file an issue in the moodle issue tracker, but as a not that tech savvy person, the obstacles to actually file an issue drove me nuts – so I put the issue here, maybe someone catches it up. *** When uploading a file via dnduploadlib.php, characters with diacritics like german ä, ö, ü in the filename are encoded as so called \"composed characters / combining characters\": an <ä> is composed out of an <a> combined with an <¨>. In combination with some operatimg systems, browsers and webfonts (OSX, Firefox and Open Sans, for example) these combined characters are faultly interpreted as two separate symbols: <a¨>, which leads to a problem when using things like auto-linking: When I upload a file called \"Mäuse.pdf\" for example, and autolinking for files is on, then typing the string \"Mäuse.pdf\" with the keyboard doesn't lead to an autolinked entry because the character \"ä\" in the filename is encoded as (hex)61CC88, whilst when using the keyboard the character \"ä\" is encoded as (hex)C3A4. dnduploadlib.php has to be aware of these combined diacritics ((hex)61CC88 for example) and should convert them to the proper precomposed characters ((hex)C3A4 for example). For my special needs, I hacked dnduploadlib.php and replaced the german umlauts. Since I am a frontend developer, that's all I can contribute to this issue, would be great, if a more tech savvy person could find a more radical and generic solution – I've found out, that the same problem occurs on a forum, even when dnduploadlib.php is patched; but I couldn't figure out, what code part is responsible for that.",

          "Text": "Here's a general question with a very specific context , related to a custom-developed block. First the question: Why might a correctly-installed block not appear in the Add a Block dropdown in edit mode? Now the context: I've created a block - call it Hamster Herding - for local use. I've developed and tested it on localhost using Moodle 2.6 and XAMPP, then deployed it on a live test system. It used to work fine on local and remote hosts. We then decided that it needed to be renamed. I went through all the renaming procedures (files, variables, caches, etc), then put the block in moodle/blocks/hamster_herding and installed it via Admin >> Notifications. The block appeared to install ok, and when I then went into Site Admin >> Plugins >> Blocks >> Manage Block s I could see it listed there. However, it didn't appear in the Add a Block dropdown so of course I couldn't add it to a course. Neither do any error messages appear. Amongst many other measures, I've: de- and re-installed the block flushed Moodle caches flushed browser caches from the beginning of time set developer errors to super-picky installed the block on another machine altogether changed the block version number read TFM and TFFAQ I think it's almost certainly related to the use of caches in the block, which are needed because of the institutional context in which it'll be deployed. I have just used basic cacheing code as specified in the Cache API , and when renaming the block made sure to rename the block caches. I'm sure that it'll be one tiny tweak somewhere that's needed, but I just can't find the cause of the problem as I'm getting no feedback from Moodle at all, so a pointer or two would be appreciated.

What I'm trying to do is improving the existing moodle activity module \"onlinejudge\". For those unfamiliar: Online judge is used to create a programming assignments and predefined testcases that are used to assess student's submissions. I have a shell script that creates a text file containing the assignment and another text file, which contains a number of test cases. There's a form that creates the Online Judge assignment. I need to create a listbox, from which a teacher can choose an existing assignment template(a text file on a hard drive) and a button that will call a shell script, that will process this template file. SHell script will produce two files: assignment and a number of testcases. I need to record the contents of those files to moodle DB. Is it even possible?",

They will then construct a mysql trigger that will insert a row into the mdl_context table (with values for contextlevel = 50 and the instanceid of the course just created).

Our SEO consultants have noticed an unusual amount of traffic to our public facing website, most of which seems to be originating from the internal pages of various other sites which are running Moodle installs. We ourselves run a Moodle installation on a subdomain of our main public facing site. My guess is that maybe our Moodle install is in some listing (linked to our public address) which appears across other Moodle installations for whatever reason; perhaps some plugin or cross-promotion facility... We'd really like to identify and stop this source of traffic, as its playing havoc with conversion and bounce rates. Visitors from these sources typically leave our public facing site immediately.

Please see the following points and comment whether it is possibility in next update... 1. Biometric Login for students to ensure Authentication. (in my scenario, its really making difficulty coz students share their user ids and passwords, after that they attempt each other's assignments) 2. In creating quiz from question bank, I have to select quizzes manually to manage difficulty level. Auto function adds questions randomly. There should be an attribute of difficulty level (Easy, Moderate, Difficult) while creating new question. So after that while creating quiz from question bank, I may set criteria of randomness such as 5 questions from easy, 5 questions from difficult etc. Regarsd",

It may simply be that I'm looking in the wrong place, but I could not see any table that mapped the integer to a string; that only occurs, AFAICT, in completion_criteria.php. If this is so, has the possibility of providing convenience tables been mooted?  Such tables would be auto-generated from the code, and would only be referred to in ad hoc queries, so they would have no impact on the performance of the system, but would be a great boon to those, like me, who are trying to get a handle on what's happening in the database . It occurs to me that this would be an easy and no-risk way of getting my feet wet with the codebase. Am I on the right track?",

I would be thankful for cthis I am\ncreating a website application using Moodle software, the website will\nbe teaching language, and nothing to do with information technology. I\nneed clarity on what you mean by \"*Modified Version *\" Why should my language students be\ninterested in the source code of the platform. Also\nwhat do you mean by *'program's users'* - does this refer to students? who\naccess my application to learn language, or other software programmers who\nmay want to create a similar application - am I obliged by the GPL to give\nthem my modified source code? Also\nwith respect to this GPL, what is the definition of \"modified\nprogram\"? Please\nrefer to the below FAQ from your website https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic Q: Does\nthe GPL require that source code of modified versions be posted to the public? (#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic >) Q: Does the GPL require that source code of modified versions be posted to the public if we use moodle as part of our project? (Please see para below from GPL) The\nGPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any part of\nit. You are free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever\nreleasing them. This applies to organizations (including companies), too;\nan organization can make a modified version and use it internally without\never releasing it outside the organization. But\n*if* you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL\nrequires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users,\nunder the GPL. Thus,\nthe GPL gives permission to release the modified program in certain ways,\nand not in other ways; but the decision of whether to release it is up\nto you. Q2: Does it mean that if my organization uses Moodle in the business, we can not release this project to the public rather we can only use internally ? If it is so, how can we execute our project using Moodle? We are to sell courses to the public. ------------------------------------------ Sorry for misconceptions if have, clarification will be highly appreciated: Regards Salman",

My understanding of the situation (and I am not a lawyer, but this seems to fit with most people's understanding of the GPL) is that running software on a server and using it to generate the web pages that users access is NOT counted as distributing the software. This means that you can run modified versions of the Moodle code on your server and there is no requirement for you to provide the source code to anyone. If you do provide the source code to someone, however, they are fully within their rights to modify it further and use it how they want. There is a separate licence called AGPL, which Moodle does NOT use, which does require you to provide the source code for websites running that code (which again, strengthens the case that GPL itself does not require you to share the source code for websites - as, if it did, there would be no reason for AGPL to exist).",

There are a couple of things I am not clear with this approach: i) A block will have a very limited amount of space presence and usually announcements would be a few sentences long; and ii) A user should be able to create announcements for different modules so would something at a course level not be required? (I am aware that the News Forum can solve some of the issues, but I would like to still investigate the possibility of going for the announcements functionality). How would you comment on my other approach - have a form at the course level so that announcements can be created and add some code in the theme when the page loads up along the lines of: check if $USER is set and if yes fetch all announcements for them and pop up a window populated with these announcements?

Personally though i'm not sure about the form+theme approach - I would say it either has to be entirely separate from the theme, or it has to be entirely within the theme. If you get to the situation of block+theme then you are making it much harder for anyone to integrate your plugin as they would not necessarily want to make use of the theme provided and would then have to add the customisations to their own theme manually. The problem with doing it from within the theme entirely is that the theme settings are an admin area rather than a teacher area. One thing to look at may be the existing MyCourses/MyHome page where it already looks at forum/noticeboard posts and tells users if they have any unread messages. Possibly what you could look at is a block that extends that, pulling them all into one area for display - still uses the News and Notices to create the announcements (familiar for staff posting the notices) but displays as a pop-up over the frontpage/myHome page.",

This use of a hash is not designed to prevent a deliberate attack (there are other mechanisms in place to prevent that), but the accidental misuse of a feature, so discussions about how secure or otherwise md5 is in that case are totally irrelevant. You do not need to change that file, because it has no security implications at all. If you want someone to go through each and every one of those uses for you, then you are going to need to employ a developer with a good understanding of how Moodle works to check them all. However, I am pretty confident that you will find that none of these 'insecure' hash functions is used in a place whereby they are actually being used as a security measure. The places that matter (password hashing) are already following best practice in terms of secure hashing.",

This means the resultant hash is compared with a password to see if there is a match when the hashing algorithm is run. This means that the actual password is not stored on the system. If an attacker has access to the user hashes in the database you probably have bigger problems than the strength of the hashing algorithm because they would normally have access to all your data \"in the clear\". Of course you would still want the best hash algorithm you could have. Recent versions of Moodle have a system for adding \"salts\" to hashes which makes them much harder to break as a result. I have spent many hours attempting to break standard unsalted hashes with multi gigabyte rainbow tables and given a non dictionary password I have never managed to break in (and that was either Moodle 2.7 or earlier, so it would have got more difficult since. Moodle uses hashing for storing file names, but this has nothing to do with security. In relation to Davo's comment the password_hash function accepts a parameter to indicate what algorithm is used and I believe this will depend on the version of PHP being used, you can read about that here https://docs.moodle.org/30/en/Password_salting Security is a very complex business.",

          "Text": "As part of my ongoing project to create ER (Entity Relationships) diagrams for Moodle I have been working on enhancing the tool I use to generate the SQL that I reverse engineer into the diagram. The latest feature is to allow me to create some XML that stores \"inferred relationships\", i.e. tables/columns that look like they should have primary/foreign key relationships (PK/FK) but where that data is not in the Moodle table source code. The first fruit of this is a diagram that I believe to show the relationships between the tables in the competencies module delivered for Moodle 3.1. You can see a first attempt at this at http://www.examulator.com/er/3.1/components/competency.png and http://www.examulator.com/er/3.1/components/competency.pdf (same diagram different format). Note that if the image appears fuzzy, click your mouse and it will come into focus. I intend to produce a diagram for 3.1 in the same way as I have for previous versions of Moodle (see the 3.0 diagram here http://www.examulator.com/er/ ) and will work through each of the sub components as seen here http://www.examulator.com/er/components/index.html The code that generates the SQL and manages the additional relationships can be found here https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle_local-sqlgenerator All feedback greatly appreciated.",

          "Text": "I'm working on a settings page for my Block. What's the correct, moodle y way that I can use a moodle form element (e.g. select) to automatically post back, without validation, and then be able to pick up the value of that form element? Say I have a drop down with 5 elements, and I not only want to capture the value of that dropdown, but also change the display of the next element in the form based on what is selected in the drop down. The course edit form does this with its format dropdown, but it also works somewhat differently to how a block settings form is built so the comparison isn't completely analogous. \n```text\n$contexts = array('system' => 'System', 'category' => 'Category', 'course' => 'Course', 'group' => 'Group', 'user' => 'User');\n\n\n$attribs = array('onchange' => 'document.querySelector(\"#id_updatecontext\").click()');\n\n\n$mform->addElement('select', '\ncontext\n', 'select context', $contexts, $attribs);\n\n\n$mform->setDefault('context', 'System');\n\n\n$mform->registerNoSubmitButton('updatecontext');\n\n\n$mform->addElement('submit', 'updatecontext', 'update context'); // get_string('updatecontext','block_doclib')\n\n\n$PAGE->requires->js_init_call('document.querySelector(\"#id_updatecontext\").style.display=\"none\";', null, true);\n```\n When the 'context' select postback occurs, I'd like to then perform some kind of switch statement in php to redraw the rest of the form. (switch postback_value) - when \"system\", draw a set of form element; when \"category\" draw a different set of form elements, etc. Do I just use a $_POST variable? I haven't seen that used elsewhere in the same way in Moodle.",

So here's the main bit of the message, with the associated SQL to grab the user's current courses and the expiry dates; desired is to grab the associated timecompleted so a quick check on whether it's NULL will determine whether \"(completed)\" is printed beside the course or not. \n```text\n$rs = $DB->get_recordset_select('user', \"id $in\", $params);\n\nforeach ($rs as $user) {\n    $msg = 'Hello ' . $user->firstname .

If you want to use Javascript as well, you'll need to know how to use jQuery to detect the radio button being selected, make an AJAX request to send the selected value to a PHP script, and display the new table.  You'll then need to create a Javascript module containing the Javascript, and a PHP script for it to call which either returns the data for the table, or the HTML for the table itself.",

How exactly does the templatable interface work (how to use the export_for_template method) ?  Can someone provide a clear, from beginning-to-end example? 2. Javascript re-rendering of templates.  Does this work with blocks, or only on pages.  I cannot get this to work with either.  How does the core/templates AMD module know which area to refresh?  Specifically, I'm looking to trigger an ajax call with a button, and have the html within the BLOCK re-render with new data.  Is this possible?  Or does it only work with the main page (the entire page would be reloaded, and I can't control the div/template that gets re-rendered) ? ANY help here would be super appreciated, I've been at this for a while and can't get past these issues. Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hi Jacek, the \"hello world\" example for templates would be something like this: \n```text\nclass some_class implements \\templatable {\n\n\n\n\n\tpublic function export_for_template(\\renderer_base $output) {\n\n\n\t\treturn ['name' => 'world'];\n\n\n\t}\n\n\n\n\n}\n```\n and in templates/hello.mustache \n```text\n<p>hello, {name}</p>\n```\n The export_from_template() method is just to let you make data from your class available as a simple data structure. For example, if your class has some property that is only available through a getter method (get_something()), you'd call that method in export_from_template() to get the property value. For your other question about Javascript, core/templates will just render the template to a string - you need to explicitly add it to your page. The example code at https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Templates#How_do_I_call_a_template_from_javascript.3F doesn't show this, but you'd be looking to do something like this inside the promise.done callback (with jquery as a dependency): \n```text\n$('#mydiv').html(source);\n```\n Hope this helps.",

According to https://support.draw.io/display/DO/2015/09/21/Simple+draw.io+embedding+walk-through this looks as if it should be reasonably easy for someone who knows what they are doing (which unfortunately isn't me!) as draw.io specifically allows for being embedded in other applications. Allowing draw.io diagrams to be part of an assignment or other activity would provide an option that should be useful to a large number of users. I can follow how the data is passed to the other window and then back again and presumably what is needed is a way for that returned data to be stored in Moodle rather than in the originating window. I am guessing this might be implemented either as an assignment plugin or as a specific activity. Ideally the activity should allow draw.io to be initiated with a specified template and library so that the teacher can tailor draw.io to the specific needs of the assignment.",

The display message of the activity includes a link to this page with contextid from \"$info->contextid\" (link to code: https://github.com/danielneis/moodle-availability_paypal/blob/master/classes/condition.php#L113 ). In the view, I am handling this context with the following code ( https://github.com/danielneis/moodle-availability_paypal/blob/master/view.php#L35 ): \n```text\n$context = context::instance_by_id($contextid);\n$instanceid = $context->__get('instanceid');\nif ($context instanceof context_module) {\n    $availability = $DB->get_field('course_modules', 'availability', array('id' => $instanceid), MUST_EXIST);\n    $availability = json_decode($availability);\n    foreach ($availability->c as $condition) {\n        if ($condition->type == 'paypal') {\n            // TODO: handle more than one paypal for this context\n            $paypal = $condition;\n            break;\n        } else {\n            // TODO: no paypal for this context\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    //TODO: handle sections\n}\n```\n It is already working for course modules with only one paypal condition, but I'm afraid it is not the best code from to continue to work with and then I would like some advices on how to hande these things. About the link, I can change the contextid, no problem, feel free to advice for the better, no matter how much rework would be needed. This is already free software on github and it is intended to be on Moodle plugins directory. Kind regards, Daniel",

What you're suggesting will first off give you unpredictable numbers, and secondly could generate the same number for 2 different courses. You could just use the $course->id or $course->shortname as the name of the Jitsi room, that way you know it will be unique with the added bonus that you can easily tell which room is for which course. I'd say you could still use the URL module for this as it allows you to append course variables to the specified URL, but unfortunately it doesn't support doing that with clean URLs at the moment (only ?foo=bar form, which doesn't look like Jitsi Meet will accept). You could write a simple block to do this, which creates the link based on the course page it's displayed on. If you make the Jitsi server name configurable, I'd imagine it could be useful to other members of the community too. If you have a read through that tutorial, inside the get_content() method you can do $this->page->course to get the current course, then use $OUTPUT->single_button(); to create the button (or use a template if you want to do things properly). As an aside, \"link\" isn't actually a valid value for a form's method attribute . In this case you want \"get\".",

It incorporates relationships missing from the release code which can be found in this bug report https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-49795 Also the SQL code that was used to reverse engineer the diagram included field comments. When Moodle is installed it will normally throw away all field level comments. I updated the code so it kept the comments. Due to some quirks the comments may be truncated but I decided some information is better than none. This diagram is probably most helpful if you download the *.mwb file and load it up in MySQL workbench (a free cross platform tool) but I hope the graphics/png files are also useful.

There are a lot of courses there, and every employee can enroll into them. This environment is available both through the intranet and the Internet (or the extranet, as we call the external access here). Now, they want to restrict access to some courses when the access comes through the extranet. That is, a worker can access moodle from home, but not every course will be available for him, even if he is already enrolled in it. Altough, if he is connected through the intranet, every course will be available. For courses available both from extranet and intranet, the workers' progress should be kept sincronized, preferably by using the same database . I can't find a way to do such thing, so I need you to point me in the right direction. Is there a way to do this kind of control (at course level) through a plugin?

So we would have to keep a list of the extranet-available course ids in the .htaccess file, and this list may change at any time (e.g.: when a new course is created). Also, a logged user would still see the unavailable courses in the list of courses when accessing through extranet, but this is a minor problem. Your first solution is more likely what I was trying to achieve, except that even if the user is already enrolled in an intranet-only course, the plugin shouldn't allow the user to see the course (or at least do any activity/see the course content), and even if the user is outside the intranet, there are courses that should be accessible.",

          "Text": "Seems counter to usual use of e-learning, but if you have a real need to prevent people doing courses in their own time... I can imagine a hack that does not mess with core moodle. However it would not prevent them accessing the course from external access once enrolled in a course. I suppose that courses that were to be completed in under a day could kick them out once completed after they accessed/ enrolled in the intranet only course. Honestly I have not thought so much about that part. Put the 'Intranet only' courses in a hidden category in moodle called maybe Main Office. Link to the courses from a page on an intranet only server , or within a non-moodle folder on the moodle server that only permits access within the intranet ip range and subnet. Put a Link in a html block in moodle to access Intranet only courses, which opens a page with these links in - doesn't load when outside intranet. A more technical fix would be a php block that displays links for the courses inside the intranet and \"contact HR for details of further courses available at the main office\" when not inside the intranet based on ip address of user.",

For security purposes, every file request is processed via the plugin in the 'component' part of the URL, so that Moodle can confirm that the user should have access to that file. In the case of the 'course' component, this is handled in the 'file_pluginfile' function in lib/filelib.php (around line 4314, in the Moodle 2.6 site I have open in front of me). You will need to update this code, to let Moodle know that 'myarea' is a valid area for saving files (but I'm still not clear what you are trying to achieve by saving the files from the text editor into a new location).",
