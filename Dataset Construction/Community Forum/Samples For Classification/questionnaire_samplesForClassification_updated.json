As way of explanation, I'll be asking people to react to some scenarios of possible futures. I wanted to keep the initial demographic questions together as one group, in set order, but shuffle the order of the scenarios (to prevent survey fagitue). Survey Monkey doesn't support this (randomizes multiple choice answers to each question only) and other software that looks promising (Survey Gizmo) is outside my budget. I'd explored Question Bank, but the quiz feature in Moodle wasn't offering the types of questions and flexibility I needed so I thought perhaps Questionnaire would work. In the end, I may just create 3 versions of the survey in Survey Monkey and do it that way. Thanks again, Kara",

You see, the problem is that usually survey type of activities such as Questionnaire (in Moodle) are supposed to gather data which will ultimately exported to either a spreadsheet or a more sophisticated stats package in order to examine the data and possibly draw conclusions from it. If the questions are shuffled when presented to the student, then this can lead to all kind of problems later on upon export and data-mining. In your list of survey software you don't mention LimeSurvey . I don't know if it would to what you want, but it's a good alternative to Moodle's questionnaire, except that it would be totally outside of your moodle site, of course. Joseph",

I would like to ask you for a functionality that would improve even more this plugin and sure help a lot of people using it. I'm talking about printing / copypaste the VIEW ALL ANSWERS / SUMMARY / VIEW DEFAULT ORDER feedback. I'm using this plugin to collect students feedback related to the teachers work and I can only copy/paste the numerical feedback. The graphical feedback just don't paste to a word sheet, and we need to have this graphical view available in order to send to the teachers. What I'm looking for: one button to print directly this feedback to a pdf file (or word) one button to copy all the feedback to the clipboard in order to paste it to a word document This would really be great. Many thanks in advance. Keep up with the fine work. Luís",

It was a \"public\" questionnaire , was shared to other courses, and students can (and are) enrolled in multiple courses that the questionnaire was shared with. Is that a problem, if they are in enrolled in multiple courses that have the shared questionnaire? What I mean by \"student's answers are associated with the wrong course\" is that when we download the answers to text file (from the main course), that student's answers say they correlate to course 1058 (it's one of the fields in the download file), but the student isn't enrolled in 1058, and that student's answers are really in response to the questionnaire shared in course 1078. (We spoke with the student so we know what course the questionnaire was filled out in.) Does that make more sense? I'm not sure how else to describe it. The full scenario: Our faculty wanted to use the questionnaire as a course evaluation, which they read other schools were doing. They created a questionnaire in one of their existing courses, shared to other courses and asked students to fill it out. The questionnaire (course evaluation) was shared with all business department courses so students would be in multiple business courses, but would fill out a separate questionnaire in each course. The instructor of the \"main\" course would download the answers and distribute them out to the appropriate instructors as appropriate. It sounds like they should have created a new course to house the questionnaire as the \"main course\" rather than using one of their courses that the students answer the questionnaire in, correct? I've tried to recreate the situation in our test system and haven't been able to.",

The idea of a public questionnaire is to create it in a \"special\" course which is not available to students (and even not available to teachers if the responses are to be visible only to the admin, for example). 2.-\"Is that a problem, if they are in enrolled in multiple courses that have the shared questionnaire?\" Well, if that is the case, nothing prevents the students to answer that questionnaire several times, in each course where they are enroled and where the questionnaire is made available. 3.- \"What I mean by \"student's answers are associated with the wrong course\" is that when we download the answers to text file (from the main course), a) that student's answers say they correlate to course 1058 (it's one of the fields in the download file), but the student isn't enrolled in 1058, b) and that student's answers are really in response to the questionnaire shared in course 1078. (We spoke with the student so we know what course the questionnaire was filled out in.) Does that make more sense? I'm not sure how else to describe it. \" a) This seems quite unlikely. b) If the original public questionnaire was copied to several courses on your moodle site, and that student is enrolled in those courses, how can you be certain that that student only answered the questionnaire in course 1078? Anyway, if you cannot reproduce the problem on your moodle site any more than I can reproduce it on my moodle test site, I do not see how we can sort things out. Joseph PS.

The students may be in multiple courses so they might answer the questionnaire mutiple times, but that's OK (with us) since the questionnaire is a course evaluation. When we download the answers to a text file, the course is included along with their responses, so we can sort out what answers go to which course then. Other schools have said they were doing course evaluations this way so we didn't think having a student fill out a questionnaire from multiple courses would be a problem. Is it?

As Admin, can you try turning debug mode on to see whether you have any specific error messages displayed when things go wrong? When you say that \"the questionnaire disappears\" from teachers websites, what do you mean? Do you have a standard Moodle installation or heavily customized? Do you have 3rd-party modules installes besides Questionnaire? Joseph",

The questionnaire output is processed using a software to generate pdf reports. Unlike in moodle 1.8, when questionnaire data is retrieved, for each question, now the file gives the choice number instead of the actual choice text. For example, if the different choices for a question are a)Excellent b)Very Good c)Satisfactory, in the old version, the actual choice text would be recorded in the questionnaire file, but in moodle 1.9, it records the choice number (i think).

Statistical packages will want to use numbers to produce tables, statistics and graphs, not words. So my answer is that if you need the original wording of choices rather than the choice numbers, you can do it very easily in Excel or the stats package. For example, if you import the exported data file of results from Moodle -Questionnaire into Excel you might get this table: Response Submitted on: Institution Department Course Group ID Full name Username Q01_favorite color 332 29/10/2008 12:15 Course Fullname 101 3 Bella Ben benbella 2 333 29/10/2008 12:16 Course Fullname 101 4 Dupont Jean dupont 3 Using Excel's Search & Replace on the Q01_favorite color column you can easily change 1 to blue, 2 to red and 3 to yellow and get: Response Submitted on: Institution Department Course Group ID Full name Username Q01_favorite color 332 29/10/2008 12:15 Course Fullname 101 3 Bella Ben benbella red 333 29/10/2008 12:16 Course Fullname 101 4 Dupont Jean dupont yellow",

Example:  at the end of week one student 1 was able to do a running exercise for 3 minutes, at the end of week two student 1 was able to do same running exercise for 5 minutes, week three for 7 minutes, etc. We had envisioned creating a private questionnaire (to that PE course) and including that questionnaire in each weeks topics (we use weekly topics).  We can add it but it does not append the answers week to week so there is no way to track progress by user. Is this something that we should be able to do with base Moodle?  If so, what are we missing here?  Is there another method we should use to accomplish this? Eric",

I've checked the database schema (admin/cli/check_database_schema.php) and found several errors related to Questionnaire plugin : \n```text\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nquestionnaire_question\n* column 'surveyid' should be NOT NULL (I)\n* column 'surveyid' has default 'NULL', expected '0' (I)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nquestionnaire_response_rank\n\n\n* column 'rankvalue' has default 'NULL', expected '0' (I)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nquestionnaire_fb_sections\n* column 'surveyid' should be NOT NULL (I)\n* column 'surveyid' has default 'NULL', expected '0' (I)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nquestionnaire_feedback\n* column 'sectionid' should be NOT NULL (I)\n* column 'sectionid' has default 'NULL', expected '0' (I)\n```\n I suspect there's a coherence problem between files db/upgrade.php and db/install. xml . Do you think you can make something to correct this? Or is the problem only in my (3) Moodle installations? And if it's the case, how to correct this? Thanks in advance if you can provide information. Séverin",

          "Text": "Hello Anita, \" User can take quiz and after one of the question he will be directed to Questionnaire and back to Quiz depending on question responses. \" That is quite impossible. What you must understand first of all is that the Moodle Quiz activity is a Test -like activity, whereas Questionnaire is a survey -like activity. Tests are used to test an individual respondent's knowledge , and to give them a score of aptitude. Surveys are used to gather the opinions of a panel of respondents , and do not lead to a score of aptitude. Thus these two types of activities have their own, totally different uses. Your only option , if you want to test a respondent's knowledge or aptitude and use a branching feature, is the Moodle Lesson activity. However, as you may already have noticed, the Lesson activity does not offer the variety of questions that are available to the Quiz activity. Hope that helps, Joseph",

          "Text": "Hello Mike, I found the problem and the solution. When you backup the questionnaire from an old version and try to restore it into a new version, you get this error.  The is a field in the questionnaire table called qtype. This field used to be enum('unlimited','once') and it is now an interger. So when you try to restore, the insert_record function is trying to insert a string into an integer location, hence it fails. Please add this to the restorelib.php (questionnaire_restore_mods) if ( $questionnaire->qtype == 'unlimited' || $questionnaire->qtype == 'once' ) { $qtype = 0; This will ensure this value is only changed when qtype is one of the two strings. Also, in the questionnaire/db/{ mysql , postgres7}.php files, you need to remove all if ($record->qtype == 'unlimited') { $qtype = 0; } else if ($record->type == 'once') { $qtype = 1; } set_field('questionnaire_response', 'qtype', $qtype, 'id', $record->id from the first part when updating questionnaire_response since this table does not have any field called qtype in function questionnaire_upgrade_2006031700() Please let me know if you have any questions and when this is complete.",

Does it have a working seat height adjustment? Most of the questions are basic Yes and No questions with a few sentence based answer questions. For certain questions if the user selects 'Yes' then additional questions are shown and the participant has to answer the additional questions, if they select 'No' then the additional questions don't show and the participant can move onto the next mandatory question. At the end once the participant has completed the Workstation Assessment an e-mail needs to be sent to their relevant department admin notifying that they've completed the Workstation Assessment. Has anyone done something similar to this on Moodle? If so how did you go about starting it?",

Different users will fill out a survey, which relates to a certain person. Later i have to analyze the data regarding to average values, etc. So far, so good. But now it shows, that the answers have to be categorized for the later report. That´s why: The user doesn´t see the categories, the possible answers are mixed up regarding the categories, but the answers indeed belong to certain categories, for example \"social skills\" or \"projectmanagement abilities\", and so on. I can´t think of a way to categorize answers with the questionnaire module, can anybody else? (The only solution which came to my mind is to add a special field to each possible answer, but...how to do?) Now when i export my answers into Excel, i have the answers there, but i don´t know how to sort them into certain categories. Has anybody ideas regarding this problem or has this been done before?

So there's no provision to upload and use our own pictures, which is justified, as I see \"feedback\" module as a survey, and text is usually sufficient for that purpose. If you have a fixed set of pictures to be used for all feedbacks in your moodle site, you can place them in the \"/mod/feedback/item/picture/library\" directory (and remove all the flags if you have no use of them : ) If you really need to have customised set of pictures for each feedback, then you will have to hack the lib.php file of the picture item. I have done that for fun, so let me know if you need that hacked file. May I know how you intend to use feedback with pictures?",

There are in fact 2 \"names\" for a questionnaire instance: the usual module name, which appears in the list of activities , as for all other activities and another name, or \"title\", which you can change in the Advanced settings tab. Anyway, before Moodle was fully UTF-8, and as far as I can remamber, it was necessary to use an ASCII character string to save the \"survey name\" in the database . This is no longer necessary. So, to fix this bug, all we have to do is to remove some string handling in questionnaire/locallib.php. Because it is difficult for me to test this in Hebrew, could you please test it on your local test moodle site and, if you report that it works, then I can fix it for good.

Within our four active courses, I went in recently to change a question's text, and realized that I was looking at a questionnaire based on a public questionnaire that \"lived\" in another course.  I have gone through every course checking for this question to edit, and cannot nail down where this questionnaire lives. I'm afraid someone may have been trying to solve this and changed one or more of the existing questionnaires from private to public (or vice versa). Two questions here: 1) What happens to a child questionnaire, that is based on a public questionnaire if the public one gets switched to private or template?  Does the ability to edit that child survey completely go away? 2) Other than manually entering every course to check dependency, is there a simpler way to find out what course the source survey lives in?  I've got database access and did look around recently there too, but did not have any luck tying the two together. As a fix, I can simply create a new survey and make it private, however, the course lasts an entire school year, and the grades and data from that original survey are important to keep.  Ideally, i'd like to be able to just edit a question without having to recreate the survey, then copy over grades manually, and reconfigure our external grade database.

I have a question regarding the de-anonymizing of questionnaires: - I set up a course which consists of around 4 separate questionnaires - unfortunately one of them is set to \"Respondent Type\" = anonymous. I have never set it to anonymous (at least not consiously). However the option is \"greyed out\" so I cannot change it. I was later able to start a new questionnaire as a copy of this anonymized one and now its no longer anonymous. - nevertheless some classes already took the questionaire which was anonymous. With the result that the text-exports are, well .. anonymous. I would hate to see all the efforts of the students being for nothing. Therefore I am looking to restore the original usernames to export them in csv form. I would be very grateful, if someone 1) could point me the right way to unset the \"anonymous\" for respond type (and therefore later export the data with userids) 2) or show me how the database model allows me to find the original submitters of the questions 3) or even show me where in the php file I could alter some code to export the data fully.

Similarly if I go to delete a question, it tells me there are x responses in the confirm message.  But that includes complete and incomplete responses.  If I look in the \"view responses\" report, I cannot see all of these responses. Is it just me or is this confusing?  I think it the view all responses page should be clearer that only completed responses are displayed - and the message at the top should only count them.  And the delete page should be clearer that complete and incomplete responses are displayed, and include the total count.  Otherwise, people might wonder where some of the responses have gone?",

In brief, everything works as expected for me. Maybe the problem arises from the ambiguity of the word \"response\". Maybe we should revise its use and use the word \"answer\" for answer to an individual question, and reserve the word \"response\" for a complete response to a whole questionnaire. So instead of \"Are you sure you want to delete the question at position 1 (aaa)? This will also delete the 4 response(s) already given to that question.\" we should have: \"Are you sure you want to delete the question at position 1 (aaa)? This will also delete the 4 answer(s) already given to that question.\" Is that more clear? Joseph",

The Moodle Questionnaire module includes a \"section text\" option to introduce text/HTML between questions; how could this possibly be used to create multiple pages in a survey? I have two reasons to use multiple pages: (a) not all my respondents answer the same questions, thus an alternative to branching (which I assume is not possible) could be to instruct them to scroll down to the bottom and click the submit button to continue, and (b) I would like to group thematically similar questions on the same page. If submission of multiple pages is not possible, I guess one could introduce HTML anchors in the section text to facilitate within-page links to help users navigate to appropriate sections .

The latest questionnaire.php language file for English has 246 strings . pt_br_utf8 is very outdated and has only 138 strings and it is not UTF-8 but made with HTML entities, which is strange. pt_utf8 has only 216 strings There is a further complication, which we also had in the Spanish version. The same word is used to translate Quiz and Questionnaire. This is of course impossible and leads to confusion. For want of a better solution I have agreed with the Spanish translators to keep the English word Questionnaire. We should do the same in Portuguese, rather than having the word Questionários for both modules. I think there is a need for a Portuguese (and Brazilian) translator to revise the language files for those languages against the current English file. The names I have are for Brazil: Translated for : Luiz Paulo Leite Machado (lunixbr@gmail.com) // Date of translation : 2006/06/21 // Date of the last revision : 2006/07/12 // Translated for project Casa Brasil ( www.casabrasil.gov.br ) and for Portugal: antonio vilela (but he is no longer visiting this forum...) So Angelo, could you please contact a Brazilian and a Portuguese moodle translator and ask them to update the translations and contact me so I can update in CVS . Thank you, Joseph",

With my installation - which is pretty standard (PHP, Apache , Moodle 1.5.x) - I find it very hard to construct a questionnaire. The flow of the the process is clunky and not at all intuitive. Worse though is that many of the actions lead to odd results or errors. Reorder questions goes nowhere. Trying to create a new field sometimes leads to an error page indicating that no survey exists. Save and return doesn't return you to the editing page and puts you back to the initial questionnaire creation page. The help file is largely useless for constructing anything but the most basic of surveys. So, if anyone is actually doing some work on this module it would be helpful to see some updating going on.

Over the past few years, a colleague has been using the module for anonymous course feedback and to encourage feedback has given a prize to a randomly picked respondent  - they have previously been able to ascertain who has responded via the course participation report and course logs. (last year we were running version 2014041804 of the module on Moodle 2.6) and were able to make sure they didn't give the prize to someone who had not responded. It seems they are no longer able to access who has or has not responded via reports available through the UI. Does anyone know if there has been a change in what is logged by this module between versions 2014111004 & 2014041804 . If there hasn't been we will need to investigate if this change is due to a bug. I have seen some discussions regarding tightening up of anonymity but can't seem to find anything that tells me if changes in logging behaviour have been made to the module.

Did you a) upgrade from Moodle 1.8 to Moodle 1.9 and then upgrade from Questionnaire for moodle 1.8 to Questionnaire for moodle 1.9? After the Questionnaire for moodle 1.9 upgrade, did you, logged in as Admin, go to the front page of your moodle site and click on the Notifications link to update your moodle database? If not, can you do it now and see what happens? When you create a new questionnaire, instead of Create new, can you try Copy existing (supposing you have existing formerly created Questionnaires in that course)? Does it work? Which type of moodle database are you using ( mySql , MS- SQL or other?) If you had already created some questionnaires in your moodle site, do they still work? All the best, Joseph",

We are looking for a way to streamline the existing assessment component within our Moodle platform, which currently consists of a combination of the \" Upload Single File\" acitivties and the Questionnaire Mod. As both of these activities handle assessment in different ways this makes grading overall student performance across the course a challenge. What we would ideally like to find is a Mod/Activity which is a hybrid of the two, combining the assessment side of the \"Upload Single File\" activity with the flexibilty of the Questionnaire Mod. The ideal solution would be to have the \"Upload Single File\" as a question type within the questionnaire, so that all the assessment is carried with it, however I've read in a number of places that this may not be possible? Is there any way of adding File Uploads to the Questionnaire Mod, or is there another way that we could achive this?

Issue: Questionnaires which worked before update from 3.11 to 4.0 now redirect to https://domainname/my/. Questionnaire settings can be accessed, modified, and saved. Questionnaires can be found in the database. New questionnaires can be created and they appear in the database. Things attempted: - Looked at server php.error.log, log which has the traffic (\"GET\" and \"POST\" records), and every other error log file I could find on the server. There are no recent php errors, and you can see the requests for the questionnaire instances. - Went through the questionnaire/view.php files from the old working instance and this one. I do not have a strong background in the code, but it seems that in the line calling for the questionnaire, the variable parameters passed are in a different order. I figured this was not an issue, as when I checked to see on the Moodle plugins download site to see if people were using the plugin successfully, it seems like a lot of people have it running on 4.0 and 4.1. - Reinstalled the questionnaire files. It was the same version as before, as our update to 4.0 was after this plugin was last updated. - I cannot easily edit the php.ini file due to hosting server limitations. Followed the recommendations here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=316343 to change the config.php file. The final lines in the file now read \n```text\n@ini_set('log_errors', 'on');\n@ini_set('error_log', '/error/err_log.txt');\n@ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);\n\nrequire_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php');\n\n// There is no php closing tag in this file,\n// it is intentional because it prevents trailing whitespace problems!\n```\n Where err_log.txt is a file I created in the moodle/error/ folder. Permissions on the file are 0666 and the folder 0755. After creating the file, I purged caches and attempted to open a questionnaire. The redirect still happened. Nothing was written to the err_log.txt. Server phpinfo.php says that the following values are set: Directive Local Value Master Value error_log /error/err_log.txt error_log log_errors On On Questions: Has anyone encountered this before? Were you able to fix it, and if so, how? Does anyone in general have suggestions as to what to try next? Have I set up error logging correctly?",

If this has been asked before, I apologize, I couldn't find using the search, pointer to those threads will be much appreciated. I have about 30 questions. Some of them are multiple choice (one or more options correct) and others are rating type (1-5). I have 5-6 categories under which I want to report the score in (something like \"quality of engagement, quality of workplace, short-term success, etc.\"). Each option in each question contributes a score to each of these categories (this part is different from 'personality test' included in Questionnaire where each score contributes to the score of the section). For example, if someone selects option A of Question 4, I want to say, add 1 to \"Quality of Engagement\", 2 to \"Quality of workplace, and 5 to \"short-term success\". Thus I get aggregate for each category after completion by a student, which I then want to show in exactly the same way as 'personality test'. I am trying to see if this is possible to do, and if so how, in Questionnaire. If there is another way to model this question set so that it fits current 'personality test', I will appreciate those inputs too. Thanks in advance for your help.",

Here is an example question (somewhat changed from original, I am sorry it may sound a bit complicated) In my 1-1 with my manager, most of the time goes in discussing [select one or more] Project issues My career goals and interests Random topics No 1-1 I have 3 categories of behaviors that I am tracking about Manager's engagement with employee: Manager Engagement, Work Alignment, Career Alignment. If user selects option #1, I add 4 to \"Work Alignment\" and 0 to \"Career Alignment\", If #2, add 4 to \"Career Alignment\" and 0 to Work Alignment. For #3 and 4 0 for both. For #1 and #2, I will add 4 for Manager Engagement, and for #3 and 4, I will add 0 for Manager Engagement. Basically, I am trying to ask minimum number of questions and trying to track a few workplace behaviors, and each response actually tells about more than one such behaviors.",

Q2: How do you delete a questionnaire file (item bank) that is no longer in use?  I see that the question file for a public questionnaire I deleted continues to show up as available for use when I create a new questionnaire.  Or have I overlooked something? Q3: If a text box appears as the first item in a questionnaire, it is backlighted yellow with a shadow frame and appears active.  But after a question of a different format, it is simply white with a plain border and appears inactive (even though it's active).  Is there a way around this so that all text boxes have the \"active\" appearance? Comments: If anyone else is wondering how to get NA in a ratings scale, it appears you set the \"Precision\" field non-zero (I don't know what it does for other types).  The \"Length\" field can be used to set the number of rating divisions (default=5).  It also sets the visible width of a text box, but I don't know what else it does.  Any further info on these two fields will be appreciated. Beware of \"Use Public\" if you want to create a different survey -- when it appears you are selecting a new file name on the \"edit general\" screen, you are simply renaming the old public file, and any changes you make are being made in the public source file.  You also apparently mess up of some of the links, since backup/restore fails.  But \"Use Public\" is a great tool if you want to have a standard format with limited privileges for most users (e.g., teacher evaluations by students).

When I create a new questionnaire, the Use Public list contains one file (OldPublicXX_copy) that is not attached to any instance.  I think I copied a public (with new setting public), then aborted and returned directly to the couse without saving changes for the new (aborted) questionnaire. 3. I am using \"default\" as the theme.  Our site theme (Moodle 1.4.4) is based on OSX_White (downloaded) but the effect is the same for standard, standardwhite, and standardblue (tested just now).  You can see a similar effect on the Edit General page, where \"Name\" and \"Email\" have the \"active\" appearance, while \"Title\", \"Subtitle\", and \"Confirmation\" do not. 4. If you look into the backup/restore error, here is the full scenario FYI : I created Questionnaire #1 (Q1) as public.  I created Questionnaire #2 (Q2) and selected Q1 from the Use Public list, when I should have copied.  I went to Reorder Questions and selected Edit General, and changed the file name (thinking I was specifiying a new file).  Then I edited, added, and deleted questions and saved.  I also created other questionnaires using Copy and New Content. When reviewing I saw that Q1 and Q2 both use the same file, which I had modified (and renamed) into Q2 content.  Not understanding the problem, I tried a backup/restore (without user data).  Backup appeared successful, but I got an error on the restore (I don' recall what it said), which created 1 instance of each questionnaire but no attached content. I deleted the restored course.  I created Q1 again (New Content). I created another Q2 (Copy public).  I deleted the bogus Q1.  Old Q2 remained, but without content (the file had belonged to old Q1), so I deleted old Q2 also.  I didn't do anything to the others.  I tested Backup and restore -- I kept the default user settings on backup but restored without user data.  No errors, so I restored to the production site, also without error.

Sorry to drag out an old question with a new answer (that's not related to Questionnaires but rather to Quizzes), but this question shows up high on the list in Google when I searched for Moodle Question Undelete. I have the problem using Moodle 2.7 (I explain after the answer). The deleted questions for me showed up as \"old questions\" in the quiz editing GUI (if you have checked \" Also show old questions \" in the GUI. You can get these questions back with a little creativity. Edit (gear icon) one of these \"old questions\", and inside the Editor, click the \"Make copy\" button. The new copy of the question won't be flagged as an \"old question\", so you have re-created the deleted question. It's not quite an un-delete (the \"old question\" remains), but at least you can move forward. Now for the context that got me here. I had for some unknown reason duplicated questions in many categories (perhaps by copying a course and/or importing questions from other courses, since we're not able to share the question banks easily). See my other various posts about that... While trying to delete the duplicates, I was informed by Moodle that it wasn't possible because the questions were in use in quizzes (they all had \"*\" next to them). However, later I saw that they actually were deleted (even though they show up now as \"old questions\"). The problem is that the quizzes that used these \"old questions\" are now broken, because they had random questions that drew from the category. My students got an error that there are not enough questions in the category, and the quiz fails.",

I am currently being asked to scope out whether within Moodle we would be able to do a form of upward/360 degree feedback for learners - does anyone know if this is possible? Essentially we ask a range of students a whole host of questionns about themselves, and from the results we produce a graph which shows areas where they are stronger or weaker.  All this is done on a paper based system & the results later manipulated in excel & emailed to the person for storage on their own record. With the moodle questionnaire, is there anyway we could display a graph of results to screen on completion, so that the learner could immediately see feedback?  I know we could take the results from moodle & manipulate the data in excel, but this would mean an additional job for someone & a delay in getting the results.",

Is the first line : $Id: download.inc,v 1.3.10.1 2007/06/13 15:35:14 mchurch Exp $ ? If it's older, and maybe your other Questionnaire files are older too, you might try to dowload a more recent version (of the whole Questionnaire). How many questions does your questionnaire have? I expect it has 3725 respondents , not responses. Example: a questinnaire has 10 questions and has been answered by 20 people, this gives 20 respondents and 200 responses. Which is which in your case? Finally, you might e-mail me privately (see my profile) and attach your exported questionnaire with its data. I will treat it strictly confidentially, if this OK with your organization, of course. Joseph",

What you want to achieve (for your colleague) is not possible at the moment. Please remember that the goal of the rating question type is to rate responses along a scale, hence the use of numbers , not words! If your colleague wants to export the response data as text, then I suppose the aim is to process that data either ina a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel) or a statistical package. Those programs will want to use numbers to produce tables, statistics and graphs, not words. If your colleague needs to establish a table of equivalences between labels and numbers, she can do it easily in Excel or the stats package. I have spent a lot of time - in answer to Marija's request - to make the data exported by Questionnaire as straightforwardly useable as possible in a stats package and am certainly not going to change it now (unless you have strong arguments to convince me that it is needed).

I was wondering I could conduct this survey in a secure, confidential manner for out moodle courses using the questionnaire module? I can think of two possible ways: Either create an \"Evaluation Course\" and enroll all students that are asked to evaluate courses into the evaluation course Add the survey into each course Option 2. seems to have the drawback that each instructor can \"fiddle\" with the survey parameters, like clicking the \"Update Questionnaire\" button, and change the \"respondent type\" from \"fullname\" to \"anonymous,\" or change the open/closed dates, and in other ways affect the responses. Is there any way to prevent instructors from fiddling with the survey setup? Option 1 has the drawback that students need to login to another course to make the evaluation, and that one needs to makr an association between intructor and student so that students can't choose to evaluate an instructor of a course thet are not signed up for. I'm not sure how to do that. Any advice appreciated on how to conduct such surveys in a way that is confidential is appreciated. Thanks, Lars.",

          "Text": "Lars... We have been using phpESP for our student evaluations. We have a standard form that they use, and the department TechEd person sets them up (or I do). We have sent the link to the teacher and they have distributed it for the surveys. The teacher tells someone with permissions that the survey is complete, and then we print the results to pdf and send it to the instructor/Chair/whatever. In theory they have been able to \"pack the ballot box\" by taking the survey themselves since it allowed for multiple submissions. Being paranoid, I have sorted by IP address in an export to CSV, and I claim they are not being abused. We have just installed the questionnaire module, and I have moved the former surveys and templates into the Moodle module. I suspect that we will use the surveys in a very similar way. I will set up a survey and ask them to administer it. I need to see what the permissions are and how they work. Will they be able to access the results of any survey they can assign? It may be necessary for me to administratively set the survey up so that I can create the link to a survey \"owned\" by someone from the TechEd group? Here at least there is an incentive for teachers to get a fairly complete set of surveys. It is not \"high stakes\" for us in the eval process, and there would not be much incentive to fudge numbers. I guess I need to play with the new install. Regards...   Tom",

We just did 15 sections , and it went very smoothly.  I used a method you didn't describe.  First, I created a separate questionnaire for each section by copying a template and renaming it  (This is actually quite quick, and if you want uncrackable confidentiality you could rename it with a long alpha-numeric name).  I then made a simple html page that contained a link to each questionnaire.  We brought our students into 3 labs at 5 different times.  These html pages were only made available for the 15 minutes or so that students were evaluating.  When the students left the rooms, we restarted the machines to erase any history (DeepFreeze installed).  IP addresses on the .csv files were double-checked to ensure that no extra questionnaires were submitted (you might not have static IP addresses). If you have any questions, let me know. Sincerely, Mark",

What my client wants to have is a course for school governors which can be automated - the end result should be some feedback about a school policy based on how they complete the course. I think a final questionnaire would provide the vehicle for the questions to be asked - and the responses used to provide the feedback. Is there a way either in this module, or another, to generate a document (selecting pre-written text, for example) based on responses? If not, is it possible to query the database directly to get the student results and create a page in php? I assume it is - where would this be documented?

Currently, I have the information entered through the questionnaire and then I have to download the information as a csv file.  From there, I created a database in MS Access which is generating the required reports.

In my (forthcoming) proposal for a new version of Questionnaire, I have made this date formatting dependent on language files, so you will have e.g. 23/4/2007 in the English lang file, 23-4-2007 in the French file, 4/23/2007 in the US_English file, etc. Please note that at the moment there is not a very robust format checking for the Date question type in Questionnaire. If a respondent enters a response which does not correspond to the expected format, it will simply be ignored, the respondent will not receive a \"wrong format\" error message. Joseph",

You might replace \n```text\nformat_text($this->content, FORMAT_HTML)\n```\n with \n```text\n$this->content\n```\n and the radio-buttons, etc. that you want to display will be displayed. However, I don't think it's a good idea, for safety reasons. So I will certainly not change this in the regular distribution of the Questionnaire module. I would suggest another solution. Why don't you simply do a screenshot of the part of the questionnaire you want to \"demonstrate\" as an introduction and paste that screenshot into the text of your label? Joseph",

I have drafted together some 'level descriptions' of five levels of user skill. I have started to create a questionnaire with Yes/No questions relating to these skills (each level on a separate page, with a label at the top of each page describing the level on that page). Questionnaire has done a very good job so far... however, after completing the self-assessment questionnaire for the first time, I would then like users to be able to revisit their responses and update as necessary. When I have tried returning to the questionnaire all the responses are blank and the user must complete the whole questionnaire again (i.e. once a user has selected 'Yes' for one of the skills, it is unnecessary for them to have to select 'Yes' again for that skill every time they repeat the self-assessment). Is there a way of achieving this? I.e. when a user returns to the questionnaire they start it with their previous responses already selected? Alternatively, would the Quiz tool be more suited to this? Thanks in advance, Dan",

You could use a yes/no format or you could use some kind of likert scale format to have them assess on a scale that could show improvement over time. I believe that there are two ways to look at subsequent assessments. One way is to just have each participant edit their original entry with a thought of printing the first entry so you can measure progress. The second way is to just have the participants do the assessment again (my preference). Now you have a record with a date of each assessment. When you create the template for the list view of the results, you can configure it in such a way that the participant will see all of their attempts in a table sorted by date, which will easily show progress and growth. You also have the option of turning on comments so the instructor could comment on progress etc... This kind of self assessment using the Database module works really well. You can find an example of this referenced in this post, http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=118496&parent=760485 . The sample database and data are still live. It is a bit different than what I have described but should give you an idea of how this process could work. Good Luck!",

One \"variety\" of Questionnaire that I created was a kind of \"portfolio\", which allowed participants to enter data, save it and review it at will. However, this feature never made it to the \"normal\" distribution of Questionnaire. These discussions will show you how the question was discussed. As you may know (or not), there are plans to make a brand-new module in Moodle 2.1 (some time at the end of this year or more likely some time next year), called \"Survey\", which will incorporate the current features of the Survey, Feedback and Questionnaire modules combined, plus maybe some more features. See this documentation page: Development:Survey 2 brainstorm . Right now there is a kind of workaround to do what you want. If you set your questionnaire to \"Save/Resume answers = Yes\", then the participants can fill in their responses, save them, review them, save again etc. This works exactly like you want except that, once the participants have clicked the Submit button, they can no longer review/edit/save their responses.

In fact, it was nostalgic to see that Questionnaire is based on phpESP, a tool I used in a site about 8 years ago! The first step a user of our application will take will be the completion of a questionnaire/survey. The questionnaire is a series of rate-scale (values of 1 - 5) questions grouped into sub-scales. Each group of questions is tied to one management/supervision 'style' and each group consists of 6-8 questions distributed throughout the questionnaire. The questions belonging to a common group will be assessed together to compile a total score/rank/value for that group of questions. I don't see anything in the docs or forums about how to compose question 'groups'. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",

          "Text": "Apologies if this is a known issue, but in searching the forum and bug tracker I have not seen it mentioned... I've found that, on our installation, by giving a user account the \"Manager\" role (default configuration) at the system level, her account displays as a potential respondent in all questionnaires across the site (Moodle v. 2.7.1+, Build: 20140807 ; Questionnaire v 2.7.0, Build: 2014070401). This issue arose when a teacher sent a reminder (via questionnaire/show_nonrespondents.php ) to all of the non-respondents to an anonymous questionnaire, generating an email (Moodle internal messaging is disabled on our system) to the staff member with Manager role. The staff Manager is not \"enrolled\" with any role in the course in question. Given the questionnaire's anonymity, the teacher could not see the staff member as being on the list, but my subsequent testing on other questionnaires/courses with demo accounts confirms that apparently any account with the Manager-role appears as a potential respondent or non-respondent, as the case may be, regardless of the questionnaire or course. Further, clicking on the Manager user's name in the list of non-respondents generates a message confirming that the user is not enrolled in the course, rather than displaying the user profile. The Manager role is one our site rarely uses, so the problem for us is minor, but assuming the issue is not peculiar to our installation, it could be a bigger problem for others, if not a security issue (for example if one or more functions are mistakenly assessing user capabilities in assembling the non-respondents list for a questionnaire). It may also happen with other roles, as Manager is the only one I have tested. I hesitate to file a bug report, as this could be unique to our installation or just a boneheaded misunderstanding on my part. We've used Questionnaire with much satisfaction for years - many thanks to the developers who have provide it for us!",

The purpose of this post is to help others who might be after the same thing. 1) Open /mod/questionnaire/locallib.php for editing, and find the function ' response_send_email '. 2) Find the following code within the above function: $mail->Sender = $CFG->noreplyaddress; $mail->From = $CFG->noreplyaddress; // un-comment & replace validemailaddress in next 2 lines for tests on localhost (noreply address not allowed on localhost? JR DEV) // $mail->Sender = 'validemailaddress'; // $mail->From = 'validemailaddress';",

          "Text": "Further to my answer in this discussion here , I am contemplating some changes to the \"anonymous\" questionnaire behaviour (in version 2.6 and maybe porting back to 2.5). 1.- Up to version 2.4, the \"List of (individual) responses\"  was available to the teacher, through a navbar displaying only numbers. If the questionnaire was set to \"anonymous\", then each individual response was displayed with the heading \"Respondent: - Anonymous\". 2.- In version 2.5, that same \"List of (individual) responses\"  was available to the teacher, through a navbar displaying the names of the respondents. In an anonymous questionnnaire, in order to preserve anonymity, the \"List of responses\" link was simply removed from the tabs (and from the Questionnaire Administration bock). Now, considering the discussion mentioned above, I think that was perhaps not the best decision, and I am thinking of making the list of individual responses available again to the teacher, by displaying a list of links called \"Response 1\", \"Response 2\", etc. There may be situations when a teacher wants to view all \"anonymized\" individual responses to a questionnaire, I think. That is the system currently used by the Feedback plugin. 3.- Now, we need to examine the \"Show non-respondents\" feature. Since that feature became available (in 2.5), it is available to the teacher, for full-name as well as anonymous questionnaires. My view is that - even for an anonymous questionnaire - a teacher may want to check non-respondents in order to send them an email reminder. However, the availability of that feature may pose a problem with anonymity, as a teacher may deduce from the list of non-respondents the list of those who have responded, and even the identity in the case of one student only having responded. The Feedback plugin has taken the position to obviate this potential problem by removing the \"show non-respondents\" feature from anonymous feedbacks. Should I do the same with questionnaire? I'm waiting for your reactions, Joseph",

See CONTRIB-4785 . 3.- In order to retain for a teacher or tutor role the possibility to send reminder messages to the non-respondents, even to an anonymous questionnaire, this is my idea. On the Show nonrespondents page, just display the number of non-respondents together with one or 2 checkboxes.

I appreciate that this is tool intended for teachers and organisations to gather data. In one particular course however we are using the questionnaire module as a reflection tool firstly and a data gathering tool secondly. The reflection is not assessed. The assignment module is not suitable for our purpose because there are multiple questions. The quiz tool would meet this requirement but as it is geared towards assessment, it does not invite personal reflection. So the questionnaire was used. It also gives us the opportunity to gather some valuable empirical data. So for our use having \"Export to portfolio\" makes sense but I wonder if it would be counter-productive in the typical use of the Questionnaire.",

When you visit the admin page, your moodle thinks that you have installed a new module in the /mod/ folder, and it tries to install it, but of course it fails... Here is what you could try, to start from a clean start (remember to do a backup first if you have important data you want to save). Delete moodle/mod/questionnaire.old/ folder Go to Administration ► Modules ► Activities ► Manage activities and Delete the Questionnaire module. Immediately after that, completely delete /moodle/mod/questionnaire/ folder. Re-install the Questionnaire module in /moodle/mod/questionnaire/ folder. That should you start you from a clean installation. Hope that works, Joseph",

When duplicating a questionnaire it brings the name and title filled in already with the same value. So to change what the questionnaire is called, you have to change both values, on two different forms. The title is defaulting to the name, but it seems to actually copy the 'name' value to 'title'. A different approach would be to allow the title to be empty and default it to the name when it's used. For example, in the print_survey_start function there is a line: echo '<h3 class=\"surveyTitle\">'.s($this->survey->title).'</h3>'; that could be changed to echo '<h3 class=\"surveyTitle\">'.s((strlen($this->survey->title)>0?$this->survey->title:$this->survey->name).'</h3>'; You would also have to make the title field not a required field. This would solve the problem above such that unless you specified a custom title, you would only have to change the name to get it to display correctly.",

Once my Questionnaire 01 has been duplicated, it is displayed in my course's list of activities under the same name, Questionnaire 01. So I click the little pen icon next to that name, and change this to Questionnaire 02. The title of the questionnaire remains unchanged (\"Course evaluation\"). You write \"[...] to change what the questionnaire is called [...]\". This is not clear, please refer to Name and Title, not \"is called\" which is ambiguous. I agree that it may seem unnecessary and confusing to have both a Name and a Title for a Questionnaire instance, but I do not quite understand why you see this as a problem. Please explain. Joseph",

I propose an alternative to copying the value of the name field to the title field when the questionnaire is created.  Allow the title field to be left blank and when displaying the title field, the plugin should check to see if the field has been given an explicit value and if not it should display the name field.  In this way, when users make a copy of the questionnaire without realizing there are two fields, they will only have to change the name of the Questionnaire once, in the name field, and the title field will inherit that value implicitly.",

If I understood the previous entries correctly, the student is able to answer next Wednesday one minute after s/he did last week, not Monday one minute after midnight and not Tuesday one minute after the start date, isn't it? We run the questionnair every week to asses the weekly progress, and we would like that the Q. can be answered once between Mo-Su every week. It get's complicated to tell the students to always answer it exactly on Sunday. The only way around is to allow any number of answers and hope the students only answer once, or does weekly mean once between Mo-Su respectively between the start date + 7 days? Thanks, Kurt",

Therefore, when I found no solution for it, I started recreating it again. While doing so, in the questionnaire there is an option which asks for using 1. New one 2. Existing one.... I choose the existing one and to my surprise I found the questionnaire got restored by itself. All those who have this type of problem can try out this solution. thanks KJM",

The questionnaire has 20 questions which are similar to this: Leave blank Disagree Strongly Disagree Disagree Slightly Agree Slightly Agree Agree strongly Q1 I don’t think often about my thoughts E Q2 I’m not really interested in analyzing my behavior N When the student finishes completing the 20 questions, I would like the questionnaire to add specific question in other to provide three different scores to the students: score Total E Engagement in reflection 1 (R) 8 (R) 10 13 (R) 16 19 N Need for self-reflection 2 (R) 5 7 12 15 18 I Insight 3 4 (R) 6 9 11 (R) 14 (R) 17 (R) 20 where the numbers mean question 1, question 8, question 10, question 13,  16 and 19. and the same for the other three rows. Would it be an easy way of modifying the questionnaire so that the results of certain questions are added and a numeric score is given to the student? Otherwise, what would be the right tool to use in Moodle? Thank you very much for your advice.",

At this point, all I can say is that some people have taken the questionnaire and it's assigned them the proper grade, and others have not gotten it assigned. I don't know how to determine what circumstances trigger this. It is a fairly old install of Moodle that has been upgraded over the years, so it is possible that it could be some of the legacy questionnaires that were added years ago behave erratically. Can you just confirm though that if you set a questionnaire to give people a grade of 100 on completion then a grade of 100 should show in the grade table every time a questionnaire is submitted?

This caused us a problem when trying to restore courses from a different site that upgraded the Questionnaire to a site that had a clean installation of the same version, the null values couldn't be inserted on the clean installation. that were inserted in the first site.

I then removed the Questionnaire module then reinstalled it. That not only fixed the creation error but also revealed that the module was not correctly installed. The set up screens for a Questionnaire are now easier to read and are more explanatory. It appeared that this issue arose after upgrading to Moodle 1.6 so, perhaps, the ugrade affected something.

Some 250 students have answered the questionnaire and all\nthe results appear within the Moodle interface. However, when I export\nthe results as a CSV file the results for the items that used the 'Rate\n(scale 1 ..5)' Type question are wrong. There are two versions of this problem: On my production site I am using Moodle 1.4.3, and Questionnaire Module\nversion 2005030101. In this case all of the item names appear in the\ntop row of the CSV file, but all of the results for the 'Rate\n(scale 1 ..5)' Type are missing. On my experimental site I am using Moodle 1.5, and Questionnaire Module\nversion 2005062701. With this set up, only the result of the last 'Rate\n(scale 1 ..5)' Type is reported. What is more, the reported results is\none less (minus 1) than the actual number chosen. Having\ndone a search for 'CSV export' within the Questionnaire forum, it seems\nthat I am not the only Moodler to have experienced this problem. For\nexample see Peter Noelle's posting , and Alex Walker's posting . I realise that for any future questionnaires I make, the solution\nwill be to use another item type (e.g. radio buttons), however is there\nanyway that I can extract the results for the 'Rate\n(scale 1 ..5)' Type items in the questionnaire that has already\nbeen answerd by 250 students on my production site . I had the results\nsent to my email, so it may be possible for me to convert these 250\nemails into a CSV file, however, if anyone knows a simpler solution, I'd\nmuch appeciate your advice.

This seems to happen with both versions on our installation. I have not added any hacks and this is a bog-standard installation. The problem arises when I click on 'Add Field' button, and it doesn't seem to matter what type of field I have just created. It seems intermmitent in that it is guaranteed to happen, but it could be after adding the 1st question, 2nd etc. Once the problem occurs, I only have the option to continue, after which the questionnaire dissapears for a while - and I was initially uncertain as to whether it had been created. However, the system seems to create the template and it is displayed some time after. If I try using IE 's 'back' button instead of continuing, all of the fields (even those that successfully saved) dissapear - sometimes it displays the first question for each of the questions I created (in this case 7). The good news is that once it appears within the system, I can edit the template and add questions. It appears to have stored the new fields added, but the problem can arise again. It's just a bit messy and convoluted and can take some time to create a single questionnaire. Looking at the forums, no-one seems to have experienced a similar problem. All very strange! Stuart",

We also put PDFs and exams  in the Moodle course.  When the course repeats, we use a backup of the old without student data and restore it to a new course. We also have 3 or 4 day F2F courses, that may run once or twice a year.  We use the same course, copy the old eval activity and give it a new name (add a date like Spring 2017) so when we do a summary we see the date.    Ditto with the exam. We hide the old eval and exam,  We change the password to get into the course. Hope those two ideas help you figure out a system that works for you.  You could also add a certificate using the same techniques. Chris",

Then click view all responses.\" Why would you do that? You can't blame a piece of software for not anticipating your careless use of it.🙃 This is tantamount to blaming your car makers if you inadvertently pressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal and had an accident. I have tried what you suggested, i.e. the weird idea of \"enabling feedback sections with empty feedback sections\" and I confirm that PHP 8 does throw out warnings ( not errors). The reason being that PHP 8 is less tolerant than PHP 7 of approximate syntax. These are minor annoyances but do not prevent the program from working. I expect the current Questionnaire maintainer, Mike, will take some time to check Questinnaire against PHP 8 in due course.",

Because of this, we're trying to find a way to do the following: Either bulk upload the responses/results of the student's questionnaires to our LMS, or allow a teacher to mark the questionnaires as completed for those which completed their surveys on Google Forms. For all other students, completion should be tracked by answering the questionnaire. Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide.",

My questions are:  1.  Will the above strategy work?  2.  Is there a simpler way to accompish this (ie: make completion of the questionnaire the condition for showing the certificate, and link directly to it upon completion)? Thanks so much for any suggestions you can give!",

Secondly,\nas for your question: For my research, either Questionnaire or Quiz\nwill work fine. In my classes, I use Questionnaire for...\nquestionnaires, because it blows the default plugin out of the water. I\nuse quizzes in my classes for graded quizzes. However, for my research, the only thing I actually need is the ability to download the responses. In the present study, they will be presented with a question, then they will watch a video, then they will be presented with the question and multiple choice options. As long as something can present that info and let the respondent pick answers, I'm good to go. I have typically used Questionnaire for research like this; however, I could also use Quiz. Actually, a lot of people use Questionnaire for assessment research; it's versatile and straightforward and easy to get your data out when you're ready. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one using Questionnaire on this server ... I bet I could get away with \"breaking\" it while I'm doing this study...",

I think It would be desirable in the phpESP questionnaire to have a proper \"add help item\" option in the phpESP admin interface . Adding a help icon to a question is a fairly\nstraightforward hack but the task becomes tedious when adding a help icon to a number\nof options under one question (e.g. list of check boxes or radio buttons). In terms of usability , I think it is much clearer if there is a minimum of instructions in the survey, but a help button if people want to ask for clarification. We did a rather imperfect hack in question 14 in the covcell survey .  It would be interesting to know if someone has already done\nthis, or feels the need for such a feature. The help texts were not translated but they were provided for with sets of help files for each language. A couple of years ago we also did some work (i.e. it was partly done) on answering questions on images, but that may have been lost in a server crash. I can check it out if there are some potential collaborators out there. brgds Paul",

          "Text": "Hi Mike, Thanks for your reply, I've found an easier solution, on closer look I found the problem was due to an attempt to insert a null value in the mdl_questionnaire_survey table > feebackscores column. The column is set to \"not null\" and has a default value of '0' but the null constraint was still raising an error due to the code explicitly inserting a null value. For now I have allowed null values for the column. We are in the middle of migrating approx. 4,500 courses from Moodle 2.8.8 to a new 3.1 instance, after the migration is complete I will reapply the null constraint. Once again many thanks for your reply.",

One example is if a course uses 2 types of questionnaires where 1 questionnaire View all responses is set to never and another questionnaire where View all responses is set to visible. It wouldn't take much for a student to figure out that changing the instance parameter from the questionnaire where view all responses is visible will take you to another questionnaire and the View all set to never will not restrict the student from viewing the report.

The only variable from getting a permission error and getting through to view the View all report was that I made a submission. For now the only way to prevent this seems to manually set the role permissions for each questionnaire to prevent viewing all responses from the student role.",

Approximately six other people would then answer the same questions about person A. 4. All the data / responses would need to be private. 5. Ideally I would like to generate a report comparing person A's responses against the average of the other peoples' responses. 6. Could the statistics be exportable to Excel? 7. Could I set Moodle to send invitation, reminder, completion emails to respondents and progress report emails to be sent to me? 8. Can I brand the questionnaire? 9. If the above is possible, I would need to use the questionnaire for fairly large numbers, say 100 x person A. Is there a maximum number of times, respondents for this sort of activity?

          "Text": "Hi Di, 1. An online questionnaire with approximately 25 questions. The questions are multiple choice with scaled answers (1-4). OK 2. Person A would complete the questionnaire about themselves. OK 3. Approximately six other people would then answer the same questions about person A. OK 4. All the data / responses would need to be private. I suppose you mean that respondents B, C...G would know - of course - that they are answering questions about person A, but person A would not know how those 6 other respondents have answered. Yes, that is possible. 5. Ideally I would like to generate a report comparing person A's responses against the average of the other peoples' responses. 6. Could the statistics be exportable to Excel? Well, you could export all the responses as text/csv and process the data in Excel . 7. Could I set Moodle to send invitation, reminder, completion emails to respondents and progress report emails to be sent to me? Some of those features are available in Questionnaire. 8. Can I brand the questionnaire ? No idea what this means. 9. If the above is possible, I would need to use the questionnaire for fairly large numbers, say 100 x person A. Is there a maximum number of times, respondents for this sort of activity? That should be OK. I suggest you install Questionnaire and start a small-scale test to see for yourself how things work. Could you give us a few examples of what the questions look like? Joseph",

However, for longish choice texts, I would really advise using the \"hidden\" option, for exporting - in responses - shorter label s instead of the longer text values. This is explained (but needs improvement) in the Questionnaire documentation wiki. Here is what I would suggest for your question #8: Q.- What are you most likely to do when you see someone being bullied? Possible answers (choices): report=Report it to a teacher or staff member ask to stop=Ask the bully or bullies to stop Join in Nothing step in for friend=Step in if it’s a friend, don’t get involved if I don’t know the person(s) being bullied The full text of choices will still be displayed to the students taking the questionnaire, but the exported responses file will display the shortened form, much easier to read in your spreadsheet anyway. Q01->report    Q01->ask to stop    Q01->Join in    Q01->Nothing    Q01->step in for friend Oh, and you can actually edit your questions and introduce the shortened choice texts even after students have answered the questionnaire. It does not change anything to their answers. Hope that helps, Joseph",

          "Text": "Hello, I have just downloaded the Feedback module (version 2006092900) into my Moodle system (1.6.2+), and it seems to be working as intended. However, there are two question types of which I am not sure the purpose: 'Dropdownlist (rated)' and 'Radiobutton (rated)'. They seem to perform exactly the same function as 'Multiple choice - single answer allowed (dropdownlist)' and 'Multiple choice - single answer' respectively. I have made a sample Feedback activity and used all 8 question types and have named each question according to its type. Click here to see a screenshot of the questions . I have then answered the questions as a student. Looking at both the questions and results page, it is not clear to me how the 'rated' type questions differ from the traditional dropdownlist or radio buttons. Since they have the label 'rated', I was expecting students to be able to select, or rate, the choices in order of preference, but it seems they simply select one of the choices, which is exactly the same as they do for the 'Multiple choice - single answer allowed (dropdownlist)' and 'Multiple choice - single answer' type questions. I must be missing something. Below you can find links to some relevant screenshots: screenshot of the questions screenshot of the results screen screenshot of the Excel file results Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",

Having read your explanation, I realised that the results of one 'student' were not enough to understand the purpose of the rated questions. So, I again logged into my experimental moodle course as another 'student' and completed the Feedback activity. I then looked at the results for the 2 'students' and now feel I understand the purpose of the 'rated' type questions. The 'rated' type questions calculate an average, whereas the other questions do not. I have made a screenshot of the results for those that are interested: screenshot of results (see questions 3 & 6). Thank you Andreas for enlightening me.",

Results from such questions appear as \"time\" type data. So if, for example, a dropdown list has choices 2,3,4,5,6 the spreadsheet will produce: 01: 02 02: 03 03: 04 04: 05 05: 06 These appear to be interpreted by Excel as hours and minutes. I do not mind the format above, but when I try to use search and replace to change say, 02: 03 , to plain 3 , Excel refuses. I have to use =MINUTES() just to get rid of the question numbers (ie the hours). Very frustrating for teachers trying to interpret the spreadsheet. Moodle's own graphics look fine, the problem is with the spreadsheet and I only encounter it when responses to questions are numerical.

What am I doing I am proposing a questionnaire where a user (with a role specifically created by me and with few permissions) can fill and submit his/her answers as many time as he/she wants. What's the issue When I set the questionnaire settings, I chose \"No\" for the option \"Save/resume responses\", because I need that every user always reaches the end of the questionnaire. If he/she leaves it halfway, closing the browser or logging out, I need the system not to retain the partial data in memory and, above all, I don't want that the user can get in later on to finish the questionnaire. What I am seeing so far is that the option \"Save/resume responses: No\", doesn't work. The user who leaves the questionnaire without finishing it, still has the questionnaire available once he gets back to it. Scenario I don't want Mark sees the questionnaire and wants to do it. He logs in and starts to fill it, but he doesn't have time to finish it, so it leaves closing the browser or logging out. Mark gets back to the questionnaire few hours later, logs in, and finds the questionnaire at the same point where he left it. So he goes on filling and then submit it. Scenario I want Mark sees the questionnaire and wants to do it. He logs in and starts to fill it, but he doesn't have time to finish it, so it leaves closing the browser or logging out. Mark gets back to the questionnaire few hours later, logs in, and finds the questionnaire is starting from the first question, forcing him to restart from the beginning.

By loging out, gets a warning message: \"Changes you made may not be saved\". 2.- Student logs in, goes to questionnaire: All previous answers have disappeared, except for the text entered in the Essay question .

The only things I don't need are the warning message (we will already have one in the page introducing the questionnaire) and, most important, no answer of any type must be retained. All users leaving and coming back later on should restart the questionnaire from the very beginning. There is a logic here: the questionnaire is built to create and follow a stream of perceptions in the user, a kind of \"narration\", which the evaluators would then take into account. Interrupting that stream is not desired in the questionnaire logic. I add to this that it doesn't matter if the \"interrupted questionnaires\" and their partial results will remain in the final report, the one downloadable in Excel. In case, the file will be cleaned up from all partial results directly by the evaluators. I reply here to your answer to my other question, so we can unify the feedbacks here. The new role I created has as archetype \"Student\", you can see all its settings in the PDF here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZkETJFzVE5VF3dESICzYoeRYvMAnYUH/view?usp=sharing .

Advantages of 3.1: Long support life - two full years longer than 3.0. Many new performance optimizations and improvements. Great new features . Additionally, the 3.1 version of questionnaire has been refactored to add performance improvements, and will perform much better than any previous version. Hope that helps. mike",

Working with the tables, I see only the new elements are there, but moodle used the same ID for the course, questionnaire and users as they had on the old course. Also, the log from the old course is still there, and somehow I think that is causing the problem. I have thought of changing the ID of the questionnaires to new values (differente from the ones the old questionnaires had), but before starting modifying several tables I decided to try and ask for an easier solution. I have searched the forum and found no similar problems, but maybe is something common to other activities , not only questionnaire. Regards.",

If you can complete the translations, please ask your Moodle language maintainer how to proceed. Also if you want to submit missing languages.

I installed this version of Questionnaire on my Moodle 2.4 just 2 days ago, before you released the news, updating the module ‘manually’, so to say, copy-pasting folders from github into mod/questionnaire in my localhost. Am I supposed to change something now that the thing has become official? If I may, I also wanted to ask you two questions I was so far unable to find the answer to: i. Is it possible to have a check boxes type of question with one last box saying \"Other\" and a gap to be filled by the user? I mean, I know I can just put a text box right after the check boxes question, but I was wondering whether there were a way to put the text box within the check boxes question. ii. I noticed I cannot make questions dependent to answers that go further than answers to the 8th question. For instance I could not make my last (20th) question conditional to one of the check boxes in the 19th question. Is it normal? And if so, is there a way to sidestep such ‘bug’? Thanks and keep up the good work! Giuseppe",

Replace the [surveyname] with the name you gave the survey. But this won't use Moodle users, and isn't working within Moodle. You'll also have to add the line \" require_once ( \"../../../../config.php\" ); \" to the top if your /mod/questionnaire/phpESP/public/survey.php file (or use the one I've attached here - I'll move it into CVS ).

The original questionnaire does not, as you say, \"duplicate itself\", but unfortunately the copy you made from the original does not automatically take its new Title from its Name; rather it keeps its original title, hence the confusion. Here is how to proceed to avoid the confusion. Create questionnaire T01 Advanced settings, set Questionnaire Type as Template create your questions Create questionnaire Q01 Content options / Copy existing: T01 Advanced settings, Content options: Title: change from T01 to Q01 (i.e. match Questionnaire Title with Questionnaire Name. edit questions etc. Create questionnaire Q02 Now in Content options / Copy existing you see : T01 (your original template questionnaire) Q01 (the questionnaire you copied from T01) Hope this is clear.

Any ideas?  Should I report it as a bug? FYI : I've attached the last (1.5) backup (it won't have the logo graphic).  Look at the last survey, \"Surg_Tech_Emp_Alpha\" (\"Surgical Technology -- Employer Evaluates Graduate\", form mandated by licensing agency). The 6th thing should be a section text that includes \"Part I\" and the instructions for that section.  The Part III section text should be followed by four questions (not two), the first two required, \"Identify the graduate's strengths\" and \"Identify the graduate's weakensses.\" Thanks, Jim Robertson.",

We're now using it to enable voting for positioning on the Nominating Commitee. There are three positions open and so I created three 'questions' one per position. However, the sets of candidates are rather large; position 1 has 42 candidate names, position 2 has 23, and position 3 has 27. Voters are allowed to vote for as many candidates as they choose. Finally, all the voting is anonymous (hooray for questionnaire for allowing this). There have been 115 responses to this questionnaire and all have been recorded successfully and the online display shows no problems. The issue comes when I execute a text download (All responses : download in text format -- include choice codes, include choice text both checked). The table is laid out with the respondents going down and the candidates across (>92 columns = sum of all candidate names + other info) and all the columns are present and corrected labelled.  The fields Response, Submitted on, Course and Full name have contents but since most of this is repeating it's really not useful. However all the remaining fields have no contents whatsoever. In addition, what is rather puzzling is that each candidate's name is split into two fields so that instead of 92 columns of names there are 184 columns with second name / first name. This is not a massive issue for us -- I just wanted to do some deeper analysis -- but I do think it's a consequence of a code bug so I thought I would report it. Mark",

Have you (or your admin) actually installed the Indonesian Bahasa language pack to your Moodle site? And have you tried to see which Questionnaire strings have not been translated?

If you just need people to be able to hear the questionnaire text, if you use a combination of the PoodLL filter and PoodLL Anywhere editor tools (Atto or TinyMCE versions are available) you can record directly in each question of the questionnaire. This is possibly of somewhat limited use as you cannot record in the answers. Probably a better possibility is to use the Generico filter with your \"read speaker plugin\" as I have tested it and used it to embed both audio and video into the possible questionnaire answers. A Video with Generico examples are available in the filter addons at https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=filter_generico HTH , AL",

The labels before the radio buttons are right-aligned! Which makes the reading very uncomfortable. It would be better, to aling them left! The same problem --> I cant find, where to set this. I have searched in every php, css , inc files, without finding them... Finally... I would like to change the value of some buttons such as \"next page\" and \"previous page\".

It is far\neasier for users to create surveys and get the information and it does\nprovide much of the functionality that the questionnaire module does;\nhowever, a couple things from my cursory glance are not yet obvious to\nme how to accomplish. For example, the concept of a public\nquestionnaire where you can have multiple classes dumping results into\na common bank. I did notice the capability to sort by course and I\nsuppose that the functionality is there but I have not discovered it\nyet. What I did find was some undefined language strings. In particular sort_by_course , filter_by_course , and search course . I\nfound these strings in /lang/en/feedback.php; however, they were not in\n/lang/en_utf8/feedback.php and I believe that they should be. I went to\ncompare the 2 files and found that there were numerous differences\nbetween the 2. I was expecting that they would be nearly identical? The\nEnglish seemed better in the utf_8 and I suspect that it is more up to\ndate; however, it seems that a little cleaning up may be desired here.\nI would be happy to do so but wanted to make sure that I was on the\nright path. I suspect that I should have installed both files in\n/lang/en_utf8/ and /lang/en. I am curious if the ideal would be to have\n/lang/en_utf8/ complete and if so do the /lang/en/ files need to be\nupdated to correspond with what is in /lang/en_utf8? If someone could\nclarify what the ideal situation is, I would be happy to help\ncontribute to getting the files cleaned up (if any cleaning is needed).\nPeace.",

We did not set this plugin up for them, so I don't know if this was the best option for the particular task, but they're using it so I'll assume they thought it was best at the time. It seems their questionnaire, which is related to collecting agency and work information has some dropdown responses which in some cases have a large number of options, such as the \"which agency do you work for question\" which has nearly a hundred. Every so often they have to add additional agencies to this list as they support new groups, and this works just fine if you add the new groups to the end of the dropdown list. Given the large number of possibilities they want this alphabetized, but when adding new selections to anything but the bottom it appears to cause previous answers to be changed to the one which occupies its former position in the list. This may be something as simple as a setting in the questionnaire they've overlooked, or perhaps this is just a limitation of the dropdown menu in questionnaires. I've searched for guidance on this particular conundrum, but no specific hits. As always any guidance would be appreciated.",

When it was developed, it was assumed that questions would remain mostly static, so that response reports made sense. The problem with changing choices in a drop down (for example), is there is no easy way to determine if a change is being made to the text of an existing choice, if a choice is being removed, or if a choice is being added. The code assumes position is important, and assumes that if the text changed for an existing position, then that choice's text changed. If the list gets shorter, choices are deleted from the end of the list. If the list gets longer, choices are added to the end of the list. What needs to happen is that there needs to be a more extensive choice editor, so that selections can be made from defined choices. It is not a small change. mike",

However we don't want the students to see the second rose chart representing 'All participants' responses for confidentiality reasons. The docs state: On an Individual Responses page, the current user's current results Chart will be displayed, and also the All participants (or current group) results Chart.

One way of doing this is by evaluating the impact of the courses, did the student improve his knowledge or attitude after taking the course? We want the managers of these employees to answer questions about these improvements. I would like to do this using the questionnaire. However, I need to know which student is being evaluated, and each manager should evaluate about 4 employees. I thought about developing a new type of question, which I can get the parameter through url somethin like: Http: //mymoodle/mod/questionnaire/complete.php? Id = 1410 & resume = & USEREVALUETED = USERID Then a label would fill in the value of the variable, and I would just need to send the links to the managers. Has anyone tried something similar?

I suspect there may be a demand for this as 'quality control' is quite a big thing and the whole guidance side of education I think quite rightly has a place in a VLE. I have used the questionnaire module extensively for student and staff surveys cross college and so it was a natural step to transform the student questionnaires which make up part of their individual learning plans to an online environment. Since these questionnaires are used cross college, the ability to have one course in which all students and their respective class tutors are enrolled in groups is preferable to replicating the same materials within every course, for statistical analysis I am sure also. It was only when I tried to set up the groups that I ran into problems. I posed my issue too to the Scottish Moodle Users Group (SMUG) and found that others had tried to do the same thing as me. One suggested solution was to give a non-editing teacher the rights to login as another user and so view their groups' questionnaire responses but again this was not group specific and teacher from group A was able to login as a student from group B. So I have given up on using the questionnaire module for this situation and will have to make them assignments, as this gives the required confidentiality within groups. I am not happy to do this as it is harder to train staff and students to use the assignment module than the questionnaire module, but as I need a solution for Tuesday 21st August, I am left with little choice I fear.

We have nursing courses in which students evaluate the course and instructor and then have to evaluate their clinical instructor and the clinical site. Problem is that studnets may only work with one of four possible clinical instructors and one of 12 available sites. One unattractive solution is to create a very long survey and ask them to skip the sites or instructors that they did not work with. We have tried this with other software packages and students did not like it. I guess I could use groups to separate the individual responses??? I was also wondering if there was a way to use the certificate activity in the closing page of the questionnaire that students could print and bring as a ticket to the final? We would like to require survey completion but don't want to track individual courses. Any thoughts on this? I was thinking of creating a \"course\" that would just hold surveys and linking to the surveys in the individual courses. Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!",

Unfortunately we are the end of the semester and I don't have time yet to play around with this actually using Moodle. So it is a problem stuck in my head that I want to figure out. If you set up a \"public\" questionnaire, how would students access the evaluations? Through their actual course or through the course created for questionnaires? Here's a scenario...whatever details you can provide through this process would be great: NUR 101 is a course in which all 60 students need to evaluate the course. They also have smaller clinical groups (8 students in each) who will need to do separate evaluations of their specific instructor and site. So I am trying to figure out if I need to set up separate questionnaires and link to these individual questionnaires through their NUR 101 (e.g., Clinical Site and Instructor A eval, Clinical Site and Instructor B eval). Does that make sense? Also, if the certificate is set to be available once the questionnaire is complete, on what page is the certificate set up: the course set up for evals or their actual course page? I know this is a lot of questions, but we have the option of purchasing somewhat costly software to do this or use Moodle. I would prefer to use Moodle for a number of reasons, but I don't want to leave the software out of the budget if Moodle will not work with this. Thanks again for any of your thoughts...",

Our organization was hoping to run one or the other of these two modules for course evaluations at the end of the current semester (in early May of this year). But we are now leaning more toward something like SurveyMonkey. Please help us stay with a Moodle-based solution. Are there satisfied users of either module who have actually gathered successful sets of data? Is either module truly \"ready for prime time\"? We've installed and tested both but find there are limitations to each one. Our ideal module for course evaluations through Moodle would do things that we have not found entirely true of either module: 1. Allow for anonymity but also allow the admin to see who has and has not completed the evaluation, by means of a log or automated email notification. 2. Allow a responder to stop part-way through, save, and resume the evaluation later, from a different computer/IP address if necessary. 3. Allow for export of all responses to Excel spreadsheet. 4. Allow for creation of questions in an intuitive manner and easily replicated format. 5. Not interfere with the rest of the Moodle installation in any way (Backup, etc.).",

Before the upgrade, we used a questionnaire for over 100 younger students where radio option responses are accompanied by small images. We also wrapped the question text in a div tag and used inline styles to make the question stand out more. Unfortunately, however, the questionnaire now fails to display the images and the styles don't work either. I suspect the problem is connected with my use of 'dodgy' HTML. But I have tried various alternatives and no joy! Any advice greatly appreciated beacuse we'd like to continue using this 'user friendly' format that seems to appeal to younger students.

Can you provide me with a update on how you've progressed with this if you've successfully managed to create one. Bob, excuse my ignorance but how are the scripts entered within Moodle? Your help would very much be appreciated.",

If you want a questionnaire to be available for all users in your Moodle you can make it public as in the documentation I referenced earlier http://docs.moodle.org/en/Adding/editing_a_questionnaire but you need permissions to make it public.

Having read the public section relating to the use of questionnaires I get the impression this will grant availability to other users on the system but tutors still need to copy it in to their own courses.

Mapping via feedback certainly sounds like the better option for my specific needs and I'll certainly be trying this facility.",

          "Text": "Hi Joseph, To clarify, it's not exactly a jQuery issue, it is a javascript issue (thus affecting jQuery as well).  These two links explain it better than I can: http://thedesignspace.net/MT2archives/000292.html https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAP5-947 Basically, since \"submit\" is already a method of the form object, naming the submit button \"submit\" overrides the method \"submit\" thus making any calls to form.submit() void. If you are wondering what I am trying to do with this, basically I am putting a questionnaire form in an HTML block in the front page , and using javascript/jquery to validate the form before sending it off to mod/questionnaire/view.php (this is solely for design purposes - my client wants the questionnaire on the front page).  So I basically hide the submit button and add a regular button that triggers a event when clicked.  In the event function, the form is processed and (theoretically) submitted via javascript to mod/questionnaire/view.php.  This, however, doesn't happen since the submit button is named \"submit\". What does happen, is that the button doesn't trigger the event.  If I rename the button to \"qsubmit\", then the event is triggered, but even if all of the fields are filled out correctly, the form is still rejected and I am presented with the standard questionnaire field screen with all the fields filled out from the screen. What I think is happening is that somewhere in the validation, the script is checking to see if there is an object named \"submit\" in the post data.  Thus, we just have to find that check and rename it to \"qsubmit\" or the like.

If you upgrade your Moodle to sub versions, you should also upgrade your plugins to those stop points. So, if your Moodle goes from 2.5 to 2.9 and then to 3.4, upgrade your plugins to their 2.9 versions as well. The questionnaire uses Moodle's standard upgrade process, which is designed to manage the data and ensure no loss or corruption. So as long as you do things properly with the upgrade process, you should be fine. That said, it is software, ans surprises can happen. You should always do a test upgrade on a non-production copy of your site first, and then verify everything went fine. Then make sure you keep a backup of your production data before you do the main upgrade. mike",

As a result, I would like the questionnaire to automatically capture the IP address of the survey-taker. Is it possible for a questionnaire to automatically capture the IP address (or machine name, or anything that that I can use to match before and after)?\n\n(I know I can manually allocate students to fake user names as they come into the lab, and ask them to re-use them in the \"after\" questionnaire, but this is tedious, time-consuming, messy and prone to error).

          "Text": "OK, now I understand the problem (only occurring in 1.8). For guests to be allowed to take a questionnaire, it has to be set to Anonymous ( and to Respond many times ). In version 1.8, Questionnaire assumes that students (identified or Guests) are always allowed to see their own responses. The only possible setting about viewing responses is the View all responses (i.e. the statistics view). Unfortunately (from your point of view), this means that for anonymous responses, when a Guest displays \" all your responses \", he displays the responses by the previous people who logged in as Guests as if they were his own , because \"Guest is Guest\". This complicated situation of Guests taking questionnaires has been discussed before in this forum. Actually, because Questinnaire has no way to distinguish one Guest from another Guest, using Questionnaire to collect data from Guests cannot work satisfactorily, simply because there is no way to prevent the same person to take the Questionnaire again and again, as \"Guest\". So the final results of your Questionnaire will always be questionnable. If your only problem is that of not displaying all responses to Guest users, then upgrading to Moodle 1.9 (and the 1.9 version of Questionnaire) will be the answer. Joseph",

Why would future Questionnaires be invisible in the gradebook but visible in the summary? A different instructor has used Questionnaire for a few years (also setting open and close dates), and all of hers appear in the gradebook regardless of the open/close date.  However, those Questionnaires were created in an older version of the plugin (not sure which version) and the courses have been copied over and over, with the Questionnaire details modified for each semester. None of the Questionnaires in either course are \"anonymous\".  All of them use \"fullname\". I've done my best to compare the two uses, but can find nothing that would explain why the new instructor cannot see future Questionnaires in the gradebook. Thoughts?  Suggestions? Many thanks!",

Both machines are running the latest version of Questionnaire - 2018121000. To replicate the issue: 1. Create three courses - we'll refer to them as Questionnaire Home, Questionnaire Outpost 1, and Questionnaire Outpost 2. 2. Make a questionnaire in the Questionnaire Home course, set it as a Public questionnaire. Give it at least one question. 3. Make a questionnaire on the two \"Outpost\" courses, using the content from the questionnaire on the \"Questionnaire Home\" course. 4. Submit responses on the two questionnaires in the \"Outpost\" courses, so that you end up with two responses visible in the \"Home\" questionnaire. 5. Attempt to use the \"Delete ALL Responses\" control in the \"Home\" questionnaire to delete the responses. You'll get a blank white screen, with no error messages in any log I was able to find, even with debugging at maximum. You can get around the error by submitting at least one response in the \"Home\" questionnaire - then \"Delete ALL Responses\" will work. This leads me to think that the error happens when you try to use \"Delete ALL Responses\" in a questionnaire that has responses, but all of those responses come from questionnaires other than the one you're using the \"Delete ALL Responses\" control on.",

          "Text": "Dear developers of Questionnaire and Feedback modules, I was wondering is it possible to add a new features called \"Unique Ans for Drop-down Boxes\" to added into your module. Currently, Questionnaire support Rate scale but however have one problem, which is if there are more answer than the radio boxes, the module will not accept user to submit a form. (Example: A question have 6 choices and in which user are told to rank 3 choices and these 3 choices must be unique. If the user select choice 1 as #1, then of course he/she cannot select #1 for other choices) To solve the problem, there are basically two ways. 1) Allows y to have the option 3 instead of 1 (which is add a column of N/A) or 2 (Unique Answers only). The option 3 will allows user to select N/A for options that the user does not want. The N/A options should not be marked unique so that if there are more than 1 answers that have N/A as option can be submitted. Of course, the same rule apply for those answer that was given a rank - unique rank!) (Example: Suppose the question have 6 choices and in which user are told to rank 3 choices only and these 3 choices must have unique ranking. So If the user select choice 1 as rank #1, choice 2 as rank #2 and choice 3 as rank #3, then he/she will have to rank the rest of the choices, which is choice 4, 5 and 6 with the rank N/A. The program will make sure that the following rules are followed:",

Visual analogue scales have many advantages over Likert responses types, both from a statistical and a practical point of view. New psychometric models are being developed for them, in the line of Item Response Theory. See for instance: Noel, Y. & Dauvier, B. (2007). A beta item response model for continuous bounded responses, Applied Psychological Measurement , 31, 47-73. Noel, Y. (in press). A beta unfolding model for continuous bounded responses, Psychometrika , . http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-013-9361-1 and the discussion therein on the advantages. I have written javascript/php code to implement them. Here is an example (in French): http://yvonnick.noel.free.fr/qst/ I am quite willing to share the code but cannot engage in writing the moodle integration.

If the learner selects \"2\" on the above questions, then 1 point goes to the counter \"Amiable\" Personality, if \"3\", then counter \"Rational\" and if 4, \"Expressive\".

For testing personality traits, you should ask questions where the answers are the opposite of each other. For instance, if you want to test the “Detail-Oriented” vs. “Delegates Details” Personality Trait, you should ask questions like the following: (taken from this site ) Q1 a. I like projects made up of many small tasks (0) b. I like to look at the big picture and develop new projects (1) Q2 a. I can see patterns in complex problems quickly (1) b. I enjoy research projects that allow me to hunt for specifics and spot errors (0) Q3 a. I am good with numbers, including positions in accounting and finance (0) b. I am good at strategic thinking and being creative (1) ... To test Extrovert vs. Introvert: (taken from this site ) Q4 a. I get more excited by ideas than by external activities . (0) b. I am primarily interested in and concerned with the external world. (1) Q5 a. I prefer a few deep, close relationships to many casual ones. (0) b. I prefer talking with someone rather than sitting alone and thinking. (1) ... Subsequent analysis of the responses would look like this: Respondent #1 Q1 to Q3 : score 0 = \"Detail-Oriented\" personality score 3 = \"Delegates Details\" personality I hope this makes sense.

It is always the same person who answers \"their\" questionnaire, (by the way, this is the reason why I had been asking earlier on whether it would be possible to save incomplete questionnaires before starting anew with another answer while keeping a copy of incomplete questionnaires for later completion). The thing is that when we want to edit the model, we then have to delete all the agents' forms before replacing them with the new updated version of the form. It would be a real time-saver for us if we could synchronize all of these questionnaires at once whenever we modify the source model. I can understand this is not really the primary use that was initially intended for this plugin but do you think this is something possible ? Thanks for helping, Best, Yannick",

The intent of this application with Moodle is to use the Moodle access. When you add a questionnaire to a Moodle course, you have already limited access to the survey by the nature of the users who can access the course. Likewise, you can use Moodle groups. We may be using an older version of phpESP than you were using. In which case, it won't have the same feature you're used to. And on that note, are you trying to use an existing version of phpESP as a Moodle module? If so, that's probably why you're having difficulty. Moodle's questionnaire module is a customized version of phpESP, modified to work as a Moodle module. You can't just use any version of phpESP as a Moodle module - it won't have Moodle hooks in it. If you have installed the Moodle module version, you will see the settings for number of responses, and other settings, when you add the questionnaire activity to the course. mike",

          "Text": "Hi Tom - If I understand correctly, you want to move existing phpESP data into Moodle's questionnaire module, correct? First off, this explanation will be possible only if this is brand new (empty) installation of the questionnaire module - in other words, you haven't created any questionnaires yet in Moodle. And, you need to be using some Moodle table prefix - default is 'mdl_'; if you haven't changed it, you're okay. Using phpMyAdmin (or other suitable MySQL program), copy all of the phpESP table into your Moodle database. You can export them to a file using phpMyAdmin and import the same file into your Moodle database. After that, rename each of the phpESP tables you imported into Moodle to the Moodle naming convention. This means adding the Moodle database prefix (if any, usually 'mdl_') and the questionnaire prefix ('questionnaire_') to the new tables. For example, the phpESP table called 'survey' will become 'mdl_questionnaire_survey'. If you aren't using any Moodle data table prefix, copy your phpESP database to a new database, rename all the tables in the copy as above, and then export/import. Hope this helps. mike",

I often have courses open for a couple months and would like survey availability based on the user's completion date of the course. Is this possible today? Student access : It would appear that students can be made aware of questionnaire in two ways: Finding the questionnaire in the course as an activity. Perhaps at the end and made available once all of the required learning is complete If a due date is set, a participant can view the activity due date on the calendar. This could also trigger an event email reminder In an attempt to help students manage their required coursework and optional Questionnaire responses, I'm curious if there are ways to differentiate these activities . Are there any other options available to drive participation by using a Questionnaire block on the dashboard that contains links to these activities? On some LMS environments I have seen a separate list of feedback/surveys to be completed that makes it easy to do this. Might this be possible?",

Since what is displayed is the distribution of choices the users made on that specific question. (plus, the count. at the end of each line) Am I correct or or misunderstanding something? BTW , on earlier versions of the plugin, I remember it used to display an actual average calculation in brackets. Where did it go?",

What I do is to copy the text into Notepad (or another text editor) to strip out the Word code and copy it from there into Questionnaire or any other webpage. You may need to redo the formatting. It's usually quicker to write directly in the online html editor. If you want to prepare offline, you could use something like KompoZer (free) to write the webpage. Then you can copy directly into Questionnaire . Word is designed to give instructions to a printer, which it does very well, not to create webpages, which it will do but very badly.",

Here an extract from the Questionnaire online Help which should help you understand your problem. Joseph Questionnaire Type There are three types of questionnaires: Private - belongs to the course it is defined in only. This is the standard Moodle module concept. You create a questionnaire and its questionnaire content for the course it is defined in. Editing teachers of that course can change the questionnaire and all teachers can review the results. Template - can be copied and edited. This type of questionnaire cannot be used directly, but its content can be copied into a new questionnaire and edited. Public - can be shared among courses. If a questionnaire has already been created (in another course on the same Moodle site) with the \"public\" setting, then you may use that \"public\" questionnaire in your own course(s). The number of settings available to such questionnaires is limited and you cannot edit its questions nor view the responses. Example .- If a public questionnaire has been created in course A, it can be \"used\" in courses B, C, ... All the responses from courses A, B, C, ... are collected in the public questionnaire created in course A (the original course where it was created) and are viewable there by the person (admin or teacher) who originally created it.",
