That is, each student should see  their own unique version of a handout pdf file when they click a link. I can upload all 40 versions of the assignment easily enough. The main problem is that I do not want each student to see or access the other students versions of the handout. In other words, each student should only see one version of the handout which is their own, and no one else's. is there anyway to do this? Mike",

          "Text": "Unfortunately, I am using moodle version 1.5.2, so that may have a bearing on the answer (if there is one).\n\nWhen a user clicks on a resource link, I have set the resource to launch in a New Window and, according to the instructions, left the fields blank. I had set the windows to open 800x600 but that was cumbersome. Leaving the size fields blank is supposed to open the new window the same size as the window it was launched from.\n\nHere's the (edited) instructions from the moodle:\n\n1. Determine the size window you wish to open.\n\nIf you leave these fields blank then the new popup window will be exactly the same size as the window they clicked on to get the popup.\n\nWhen I set the size to 800x600, the new window always launched as an 800x600 window. However, when the I leave the fields blank, the following happens:\n\nIf the browser is IE , then the new window opens to the correct width(!) but the height is very, very small... The new window looks like a ribbon.\n\nIf the browser is FireFox , then the new window opens correctly!\n\nIn my opinion, this behavior should be the exact opposite: works perfectly in IE, but kludgy in FireFox. If that were the case, the prerequiste for the course would be: Must use an IE browser... Unfortunately, this is not the case...\n\nSo, anyone seen this behavior? Any suggestions? Is there a workaround (besides upgrading to a more current version of moodle)?\n\nThanks for your help...\n\nmadea",

If I click on this link, my .swf file loads and everything works just fine. The problem is, I would like for the .swf file to be immediately launched when the lesson is clicked on, rather than forcing our students to have to get an intermediate screen that forces them to click something called '(Direct link to file).' Does anyone know of a way to do this... that is, to make a swf file load immediately upon clicking on the lesson ? Or is there a way to modify this intermediate web page that pops up with the '(Direct link to this file)' link so that I can at least provide a better introductory screen for the lesson ? (Also, I tried pointing to the resources to loading an html file that points to the swf file, but after trying about a dozen things to try to get it to resize--all which were unsuccessful--I went back to having the resources point directly to .swf files.)

I have a single html file with flash content. The flash is just a single button that open a powerpoint file in a new window. Here's the package for you to download (52kb) It should just launch a new browser window and prompt me to open/save/cancel as usual. If I open the html file using my web browser and click the button (Internet Explorer 7) it works fine but once I have imported as an IMS package, it opens the new window for a split second and closes it immediately. Interestingly, I do hear the little bleep that is usually accopanied by the open/save/cancel dialog but it doesn't appear. Also, if I hold the control key down for the duration of the 'click' and 'release' of the button, it functions correctly?? I don't want people to have to use this ropey hack. Please give it a go and help as I'm at my wits end. Thank you all!",

Apologies, but I'm actually posting in two places as the I'm not sure if this is a Resource issue or/and a Text Filter issue. When (text filtered) autolinks to Resources are clicked, the resource opens up inside the embedded area that the uploaded HTML document resource was occupying rather than the _top level window. This leads to the \"double banner\" effect which is obviously very ugly and undesirable. Is this a known bug? Or is there a setting I need to enable to avoid this happening?

I have a web design background and I am comfortable editing the source HTML directly if required. I am a relative beginner to Moodle, so my inclination was to jump straight into web pages. As to why I didn't upload files: I wanted students to have a click-through experience. For example, the course is designed in such as way as each page continues the \"narrative\" -- the links then lead to other web pages, with text such as \"let's learn more\" or \"let's find out how that works\", etc.",

It would be a setting you never want to turn off, and unnecessary settings are just bad usability . If possible, the icons should be configurable, and managed using the same screen where you manage the other file type icons. The only difficulty I see is that for other file types, the icons are controlled just by the file extension. Here you would need to look at more of the URL. I don't know if the current API extends naturally to handle that, I have not looked. Note that the current API does use the file extension to determine the icon. For example if you like to http://example.com/file.pdf you get a pdf icon. This is good. I think that even after your change, if you like to https://drive.google.com/file.pdf , it should be a PDF icon. It should only be a Google doc, or Google spreadsheet icon, if you are linking to one of those. Thanks for working on this.",

Now: what if I would like to link one topic of my course to this material? I tried to login as administrator, as Course Creator etc, but no way: the only solution is to upload the (same) resource in my own directory/course. But what if my web/ server space wouldn't be unlimited? Briefly: I would like someone to tell me how I could link a resource (such as pdf, doc, html etc) that is not in my own course. Thank you very much!",

If the sharing can be planned in advance (e.g., all the courses in the math department will share) then you can use a metacourse for the shared resources. However if you want sharing to be spontaneous (e.g., a teacher in a math course decides to use a file in a colleague's science course), then the shared file must exist in a publicly-accessible place on the Web. I use Site Files for shared files. Unfortunately, teachers do not typically have write access to Site Files. Most people use copy as an alternative to sharing. But copying is not sharing. Not only do you use more space, but as soon as you make a copy, you have two versions to maintain.",

The idea for the future is that we use a separate repository for all user files (the respository can be all kinds of things from Internet hard drives to specialised document repository software) which Moodle accesses via a plugin to give a nice consistent interface. This is the first priority after the Bugathon. In the meantime, even now you can store files externally somewhere and reference them in resources using their URL .

(A setting in your user profile) Display a dropdown box with different formatting choices (markdown, html format, etc...) if there is just a textarea. Why a user has to choose upfront if he/she is going to use the HTML editor when adding a resource? Personally I like the way you can select a text resource and then just use markdown syntax to quickly write a note, but I think it may be confusing to other users to have to choose between a textpage or a webpage (both of which allow links and formatting to be added) and it is not consistent with the rest of Moodle.

          "Text": "Hi David I have done a little tinkering with Moodle and SVG. SVG is a good way to introduce XML , as well as vector graphic concepts, to students. However, I have encountered similar inconsistent behaviour with browsers. Even the FireFox SVG1.1 native support is incomplete. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/svg_in_firefox In general, I have found recent versions of Opera to have the best native SVG support, closely followed by Chrome & Safari. See also this useful summary: http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php Incidentally, Opera now host an excellent Web Standards Curriculum that includes some useful articles on SVG . I usually just add .svg files as resources (I don't try to embed them in, say, course pages). Students can similarly attach them to forum posts or submit as assignment files. It may be worth checking you have the SVG mime-type in your Moodle's /lib/fileslib.php. There should be the following entry: 'svg' => array ('type'=>'image/svg+xml', 'icon'=>'image.gif'), It *should* be there anyway, but just in case! Similarly, it may be worth confirming your Webserver is serving up the correct SVG mime-type, particularly if you are hosting .svg files outside Moodle. It *may* also be worth trying the Google Chrome Frame plugin or SVG Web for Internet Explorer or rather than the 'no-longer-supported' Adobe SVG plugin. That said, I have not actually tried these and, in the case of SVG Web, it does seem rather daft to have to use Flash to render SVG! http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/10/svg-at-google-and-in-internet-explorer.html http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/ http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/ Roll-on HTML5 and IE9 !! Was also going to recommend http://wiki.svg.org as an invaluable source of practical SVG information but the link is currently dead. Not sure if this is temporary or permanent.",

          "Text": "Thanks Geoffrey, I had forgotten about the Opera curriculum, but yes, it is good and I might be able to use some of it! Alas, the browser inconsistencies I'm observing in this case are unique to Moodle, since the content renders properly outside Moodle. It looks as though <embed> rather than <object> allows in-line display of pre-built objects in Moodle (with scripting enabled to boot!) in IE/Opera/Chrome/Safari/FF. I think I'll have IE students use the ASV plugin until IE9 (with native SVG support) ships (the Beta will be out next month). With FF4beta now supporting SMIL (quite well), both Opera and FF are now competitive with IE/ASV in both breadth of support and speed. Webkit is fast but a bit spotty in its support. Being new to Moodle, I'm still feeling my way, but I had hoped for students to be able to draft source code directly within a Moodle resource editor without having to use a separate authoring system. I get the sense though that that would require a redefinition of what Moodle means by \"resource\" so that it is language neutral and not based in HTML. Wiki.svg.org was largely replaced by http://www.planetsvg.com/ though even it seems to have had little new activity this year. I'll convey your tip about mime-type configuration to our systems admin folks, though the fact that it is being served at all makes me think we've got that right. Would be happy to take this offline too. cheers david dot dailey of sru dot edu",

(at this moment it works as explained into the Moodledocs : http://docs.moodle.org/en/File_or_website_link#Keep_page_navigation_visible_on_the_same_page ) - if you choose \"No menu\" or \"Frame menu\", the resource will be managed by the user browser. For example on a Mac, MP3 files will be played by Quicktime with these options. - if you choose \"Menu without frame\", the resource will be displayed into an object tag. The tag is created following the file extension. For example, MP3 will be played by the Moodle flash player with this option.

I am on a quest to make our moodle site more attractive for students rather than lists of links - I made a web page, zipped up & uploaded as a file resource, set index.html as the main file etc... this works great when accessed through a web browser - this also looks/works great on the app until I attempt to open another resource from the web page. When attempting to open another resource/activity it forces the user out of the app into a browser losing the offline capability - is there a way to modify the links to force it to access the link from the main course page within the app? Hope I've explained this well enough - I'd prefer to access all activities /resources through the web page, in an effort to maintain a cleaner look I have made activities/resources hidden/available with access to the web page file resource gained through clicking hyper linked image in a label.",

A 600kb Powerpoint takes some time to upload but then, when used as a resource, it takes a long time to run. If we short circuit the procedure and load the ppt to the Moodle server using MyComputer and hyperlinking it from a document in Moodle then this gives no problem and is very fast. We even tried a 16mb file this way and were impressed by the speed. This seems to indicate that there is something in the coding of Moodle that is slowing the process or it could be our settings for Moodle? Has anybody come across this before and is there a remedy?

          "Text": "Hi and thanks to all for this very useful discussion and help. From this documentation I have learned how to a. compose webpages within moodle that include links to MP3 files which play through the cool little flash player, rather than downloading and opening in a separate media player. b. link directly to MP3 files in the directory of uploaded files and have them play through the cool little media player. All great BUT here's what I additionally want to do: upload htm webpages composed offline to the directory, and have the links to MP3 files in those webpages play with the cool little flash player. Obviously I have uploaded the MP3 files too so the links do work but I cant get them to stop downloading and opening in a separate media player. I hope I have explained my problem so someone can understand and help! I would absolutely love to be able to do this - would save heaps of time to be able to compose offline and upload folders of pages and associated audio files. Thanks in advance Helen",

I also *think* it happens if you have just upgraded Jmol or are viewing pages with different versions of the Jmol applet e.g. if you have different versions of Jmol in the filter and resource. I tend to keep both updated with the latest stable Jmol applet (currently 11.4.2). Any Java gurus out there may be able to give more precise explanations/fixes. I am very aware that this impacts the usability of the Jmol resource and filter. As part of a general review and update, I'm considering the workaround, used on the http://jmol.sf.net homepage, of initially displaying an image (.jpg) rather the interactive applet. The applet would then be rendered when the user selected the image. This should speed up the loading/display of Moodle pages containing (multiple) Jmols, and also give some meaningful visual content to those without Java. Displaying the applets one-at-a-time should also be better for performance on 'legacy' client hardware. Due to other commitments, this probably won't happen for a month or two - but I'm on the case! Hope this helps",

One thing I noticed was that, although the problem existed with MY site, it does NOT exist with the jmol resources and filters at http://moodle.yeovil.ac.uk/ ! Why does jmol at moodle.yeovil.ac.uk work, even with Java 6 (JRE), I wonder? It is the same browser that gets the errors above from one site, and works with jmol at the other site. What makes the difference? It may be the Moodle version. Of course, it is a combination of factors - perhaps Moodle 1.9 and Java 6, and ... who knows? You mentioned keeping the same version of jmol for both resource and filter. Anyway, thanks for you suggestions, Geoffrey. I started downgrading Java from 6, but today was a busy day, so I dropped work on jmol for other things. I hope to continue that and try your other suggestions also when time permits.",

It isn't a pressing problem because the files I convert with Acrobat work fine so I just reconvert the old ones, but I wonder if anyone else has run across this or if anyone understands it.  It makes me a little uneasy about using pdf format since many of our students use Firefox, but pdf also has many advantages, so if the problem is predictable and preventable I would like to use pdf.

When I try to add an MP3 file (exported from a recording on Audacity) I get a black rectangle instead of the expected MP3 player (play icon and timeline slider) that I have seen before in previous versions.

I found a previous reference to this problem here but this user's problem was not answered at all.

I have a document, a glossary, that is 15 Word document pages long.  Is this too big to add as a Resource?  Should it be a download for the student instead?  Again, did my searches and aside from getting 6,488 returns of unrelated discussion no help there.

That way, when you click on its name, whatever is on the PDF will be displayed on the screen. You can also try doing a print screen of the PDF, save it as an image and then show it on the course page, but that might bring about other problems, since an image doesn't allow for the same things as a PDF (like searching text, copying, editing, etc.). When you choose to add an image you must either select it from the folder you uploaded it to, or browse your files, select the image, upload it to Moodle and then select it. The URL field indicates the place, in Moodle, where the image was saved. Alternate text is the like a tooltip. It's the text that appears when you go over the image with the mouse. The size of a file isn't measured by its number of pages, but by the space it occupies in the computer. You can add it as a resource (link to file) so that the student can download it. Anyway, if it is a Glossary, why not use Moodle's glossary activity instead? You can import the list of terms from a XML file. Resources can be downloaded, as well as displayed on the course page. That is the case for linked files, and any other files that might be saved in displayed folders, for instance. Hope it helped!",

If my students were a bit dishonest and smart enough to look at the URL , they could change ex1.pdf to read ex4.pdf and view a file which I have currently set as hidden. I suspect this could be fixed by altering some of the folder permissions as, when installing, I was setting all the folders to be very open, just to get Moodle running.

I then added a resource \"Link to a file/website.\"  Next, I entered the html file that was created by Camtasia and it worked.  I guess the Camtasia folks wanted to make it easy.  I did not realize that the html file contained all the pointers to the other files and that they would retain their correct relationships once they were moved around from location to location. (i.e my computer to the server) Anyway, I am not a programmer type - but more a plug-in-play capable person.  So far Moodle has been great!

          "Text": "I am setting up a Moodle Site and most (if not all) of our users will be using an Android Phone. For the most part, Moodle has worked great on a mobile phone (using HTC Incredible). I've only made a few changes to the default theme, and in general, Moodle looks great as long as the phone is in Lanscape Mode. The last thing I plan to do is use browser detection and increase the font size in a few places (load alternate CSS ). So far, the only issue that I can't seem to work around deals with PDF downloads. Here are the scenarios - all using the Resource Module \"Link to a file or website\" : 1) Force Download CHECKED - After the link is tapped, the user is prompted with the message \"The content is not support on the phone. No application can be found to open this file. Do you still want to download it?\" The next options are to \"Download\" or \"Exit\". If you click download, the file downloads, but when you try to open the file, the file does not open. You can browse to the file using the PDF Reader and then open. 2) Force Download UNCHECKED - Browser loads loads and appears to redirect to the URL of the file but then just returns to the page it is on. The file does not open or download. 3) External Link to PDF (hosted on the same server , domain , etc.) - It works perfectly! The file downloads automatically and the user is prompted to open in the default application or if there are multiple PDF apps, then the user can pick which app to use. I would prefer for the course creator to be able to use the built-in upload /file manager and all that the resource module has to offer. Since it doesn't appear to be a server issue, it seems that the code could be edited to fix this problem. Does anyone have any suggestions? P.S, I also have this same issue with the Certificate Module, downloading the generated PDF certificate. This module doesn't generate a link but instead, a form button that the user clicks on. There are no settings - so I haven't been able to try anything else with it, but I plan on making a post in its forum.",

It other words, if it was asked to load into its file manager window resources located somewhere in non-public storage, it would attempt to login to that Moodle site (hence the login screen).  In fact, I suspect that if you have any files/resources used in Moodle A, and stored in Moodle B, this problem may occur. The good news is that build 2004043001 (April 30th and later) seems to have fixed the problem.  Try as I might, I cannot get things to go south when I fire up the HTML editor, even with resources at another location.  The file manager simply displays an error message in the view pane on right, and then nicely lets you select a local Moodle resourse in the left view pane without sending you to the login screen.  A fairly stable build I'm finding, so far. As an aside, if your teacher has more than one cookie for the same Moodle site in their cache, this might also be a problem.  Have them flush browser cache while not logged in, and see if problem still persists.",

So my question - is it possible to get FTP/similar access to the directory where the resources created by \"Compose a web page\" are stored as files?

          "Text": "May I suggest you use a Lesson ? You can make each page in the Lesson a policy document, or part of a document. End each page with a question that has three answers, like: Choose one of the following: 1. I have read the document and want to continue to the next document [score 1 and jump to next page] 2. I have read the document and want to exit [score 1 and exit] 3. I have not read the document and want to exit [score 0 and exit] If the policy documents are long, break them up into multiple lessons. Make a page for each section. The end of lesson page can have a \"congratulations you've finished this document\" message and a link to download the pdf version of the document. And by default, when a student re-enters a Lesson, (s)he sees the last page or branch table that (s)he viewed. That's a nice feature to ensure continuity for your readers. You can also use the Certificate module to send an email to someone when the student completes the lesson (reads the entire document). See the discussion here http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=95672 . You can set up the Certificate module so that the student gets the certificate only after scoring 100% (reading all the sections ). See the \"Lesson dependency trick\" here http://docs.moodle.org/en/Certificate_module#Lesson_dependency_trick_1 . At this point you might be wondering, \"How does displaying a certificate equal sending an email?\" The answer is that you can set the Certificate module to email the certificate, to the student and the teacher. It's a workaround to get Moodle to send an email upon completion of a Lesson, but it gets the job done. Hope this helps. I'd be interested to hear the solution you finally go with.",

I have read Mark Dreschsler's explanations of why the new Moodle file system is great and while I have a basic grasp of it, I need it simplified. It is my feeble understanding that it is best practice not to link to files from a web page, forum, assignment etc. because they don't have a persistent URL and exist only relative to the activity into which they were loaded. However, what about the case of Legacy course files in a course restored from a previous version of Moodle? Should I go through the curse and unlink all the links to PDFs and docs that exist in Lessons and web pages, and break them out into files or folders of files? Or will they be okay so long as they don't need to be updated? Thanks! KerryJ",

I currently have a tv store on a server holding WMV files that i have linked through to moodle via creating a virtuall directory and this is working fine. I can link the WMV files and all play fine but i am currentally having to do this myself as the staff would have no idea on how to find the WMV files and Link to them. So i was wondering if it is possiable to add a new resource totally that would basically point to the Virtual directory and they could select the videos and this would link them to the course. Or Add another tab onto the \"add a link or website\" resource that would say \"Choose a video\" that would then open the browser to the directory of the WMV files and link to them. i dont want to copy them to the course as i dont want to start using loads of space on the moodle server when they already sit on another server. I know this is being developed into moodle 2.0 but and currentaly spending ages adding links to these videos as it is not very easy to do for the staff. Currentally i am getting to the wmv files by linking to http://mymoodleinstall.ac.uk/tvstore/ thuis alowing me to browse directly to the wmv files. Any ideas would be very helpfull.",

Provided it is something the media manager does then it should embed it in your course. The reason it is just downloading is that it needs to be loaded in the player you wish it to play in.

Many faculty feel that good summaries will act like \"Cliff notes\" the students will read the summaries and not read the full articles. It also is a big human resource hit for large sites-if you have 1000 faculty each now spending an extra 3 minutes per resource writing decent summaries, your total cost to run Moodle has just shot through the roof. Suggested solutions: There should be a way to turn this off in the Admin module config along with all the other settings that can be set for resources. Or even nicer, a new resource capability:imakeyousummarize, so that a single site could have some courses where summaries are forced and others where they are not. Anyway, think this is a bug as described above, so I've put it in the tracker as: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-9485",

I wanted a simple way to use the html editor within the resource module to create pages that otherwise look like plain text resources but with a column of images on the left side (which would display a \"caption\" on mouseover) and text on the right. I wanted the image column to stay a constant width, whereas I wanted the text to be able to be resized if the user resized his browser. Bryan Williams suggested to someone that they might use tables to reduce the width of text in the generaltextbox and this inspired me to use tables to create the effect I wanted as well. I have now created a \"template\" that simply requires entering the lecture text, the image paths and caption text into the html template. This could even be used offline and then the resulting html simply needs to be pasted into the editor. I have been doing all this with the test moodle account at opensourcecms.com since I don't have my own Moodle set up yet, so I can't show you an example of what it looks like, but I've attached the html with the usage instructions embedded if anyone is interested in playing around with it.",

          "Text": "Interesting question. I suppose a good answer depends.. I don't know that MS has built ftp capabilities into their software, but you could essentially do the same thing instead of uploading by using a link for your resources to a file at say google shared documents. With this, you've work in your browser, log into your google account, edit as you wanted. This could even be a collaborative document. Then I wonder what's the big hassle about your ' upload ' process. Perhaps if you used something like Dreamweaver, which produces good html and also manages websites, in one click, your MSword document revision would be 'uploaded'. And, if you were willing to go with a simpler text editor rather than requiring all the formatting of the bloatware Word, you could probably use something like BBEdit (Mac) and open and edit your document on the server . Care, and probably not too helpful.",

Unfortunately, the window has neither status bar or address bar showing. It also has no progress bar. It is not possible to ascertain if the upload is happening/progressing without further tinkering in the browser. Perhaps: -the address bar (which shows progress in the browser that I use) could be retained OR -the status bar could be retained at the bottom OR -a progress indicator could be implemented? (More work, understood.) As it stands now, there is no normal indicator that the upload is progressing without specifically turning on the status bar for EACH upload you implement. All this is assuming that I am asking in the right place for this feature. I assume someone will tell me, if I am off base asking here.",

There is a list of about 10 tutorials and what I would like to do is to just click on each tutorial and it open up a page that has an embedded flash video in it. I know how to embed flash videos so that's not the problem. The think I'm not sure is how do I create a page (or pop up window) for each of my 10 tutorials? The only way I know how to create a webpage at the moment is by creating a resource and I don't want to have then on the course page. Hope that makes sense. Dave",

I mean, in Moodle we can set a single file resource so that a user who is set with a custom role cannot see the file. In Moodle we can also set a Folder resource so that a user who is set with a custom role cannot see the folder. But what I want is for all users to access a Folder resource, but some files inside the folder are hidden from one group of students, whilst the other files are visible to another group of students. I don't think this is possible in Moodle, yet. Anyone? Regards Frankie Kam http://moodurian.blogspot.com",

We're now rewriting the interface as a separate module, instead of interfacing with the program resource code. So I guess it really doesn't matter for us how you rewrite this code. However just a few comments on your proposed list of information to be passed to an external program.  In my interface with WeBWorK, it is much more convenient to use a single password to the interface, instead of distinct passwords for every URL which accesses the interface, as you are proposing. I don't want to have course creators to have to enter this password every time they create such a URL.  Indeed for the sake of security, I don't want them to know this password. I think you should allow this alternative means of setting up a password. Also I pass the current time (at which the URL was invoked) and hash it with the other information, to guard against replay attacks into WeBWorK. Zig",

In my webwork module, the http exchange includes the time of invocation sent in the clear and also hashed with the other login information.  On the other end, the WeBWorK server looks at the time of invocation (sent in the clear) and if it is over 40 seconds old, rejects it.  If not, it hashes the time of invocation into the other secure login information and compares the resulting hash with the one which was sent over by Moodle. Only then  is the login to WeBWorK granted. The relevant code on the Moodle end of the webwork module is \n```text\n               if ($webwork->type == GATEWAY) {\n\n\n\t\t $temp .= urlencode(md5(\"My top secret\" .$temptime. urlencode($USER->username) . $webwork->quiz_time));\n\n\n\t\t    } else {\n\n\n\t\t $temp .= urlencode(md5(\"My top secret\" .$temptime. urlencode($USER->username)));\n\n\n\t\t   }\n```\n in http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/moodle/contrib/webwork/moodle/mod/webwork/view.php?rev=1.2&view=auto (The GATEWAY version (for a WeBWorK quiz) also has the amount of time allowed for the quiz added to the hash.) The corresponding code on WeBWorK end of the webwork module is my $digest0 = \"My top secret\"; [deletia] my $moodle_user = $q->param(\"extern_usr\"); my $moodle_name = $q->param(\"extern_nam\"); my $moodle_time = $q->param(\"extern_tim\"); my $moodle_md5 = $q->param(\"extern_pwd\"); my $time = time(); my $digest =  md5_hex($digest0 . $moodle_time . $moodle_user); in http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/moodle/contrib/webwork/webwork/system/cgi/cgi-scripts/moodle2wwk.pl?rev=1.2&view=auto (for homework assignments) and similar code in http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/moodle/contrib/webwork/webwork/system/cgi/cgi-scripts/moodle2gway.pl?rev=1.2&view=auto (for quizes).

This should give you an idea of the type of applications: an equation plotter (see also this discussion ) multiple regression time series analysis lots of descriptive statistics apps The idea is to have students do assignments with the online applications, based on datasets in a database (maintained by the web application). I would like to be able to do the following: record student analysis activity inside Moodle (the web applications should return information of the type of instruction, and the data that was used) allow students to upload data to the web application's database (Moodle should record the upload in the student's stats - the actual data is stored and maintained by the web app) the output of the web application (either html, xls, doc or pdf) should be displayed in a frame (or a pop-up window) - students should have the option to print, or store the output in their personal archive (stored by Moodle - teachers should be able to define the amount of storage space per student). Stored output can always be retrieved, copied, deleted, or transmitted to students/educators without the need to recompute (or reconnect to the web app). Educators can browse through the archives and leave 'comments'. It should be easy to refer to stored output in forums, etc.. What should I do to achieve this? If I am not mistaken the 'Program' interface is part of the Resource module. Wouldn't it be better to have a separate module? Also, it would be nice if we could have some sort of (PHP) wrapper code to make it easier for the web applications developers to make the web software available to students/Moodlers. Is there anything I can do to make this work?",

The changes are significant, and old-style program resources are not upgraded to the new system, so please redo your old program resources if you had any. The way it works now is as extra parameters on the standard resource type for adding a file (both uploaded files and external URLs).  There is a big list of data to choose from (suggestions for more are welcome!), and you can assign it any parameter name you like.

          "Text": "Hello: I publish Moodle content using Moodle 1.9.4, I receive from the instructors.  I do not have access to the Moodle source code or the server which it rests on, it is in another time zone.  I have published all our courses for the summer by using absolute URLs in iframes.  I have made it so I can update the files in one course and all the other courses get updated.  It works great!  So, all resources have the same iframe code to a specific course id.  The students just have to enrollment themselves in the “Master” course and then they view all the resources from the course in their main course. However, I am nervous about the number of students we are going to have and so I want to create a course that has all the files stored locally.  In the past, our first trial with Moodle before I started, everything was on .htm pages and was linked through the resource “Link to file or webpage.”  All the html was appearing without issues, links to other html files in the same classroom were working and pictures were appearing.  Now, if I link to the document that html file is broken.  All pictures only show the alt text and all internal links are broken.  Even past courses, which I have never touched, are breaking.  I wish I could provide you with when it happened.  I would guess sometime around the use of iframes. I use Dreamweaver to make the html file the way I like than I either copy it into the HTML editor or zip the files and unzip them in Moodle.  Any file in the course files section that I “link to” will not work, including composing a webpage and pasting the code.  It seems to only want to use absolute links now.   However the iframe(d) code works fine. If the server holds and there is no problem with the number of users (about 1,200 students, 30 instructors, at any point about 670 students could be attempting to load the same resource at one time) this issue is not important.  I do not know the type of server or OS running.  I have asked repeatedly but I have not received an answer.  However I also am in charge of the backup plan and I would like to have one ready to go when the course starts so that the students always have a class ready to go. I have read threads about the HTML editor breaking because of bad code, the max number of users in Moodle http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/User_site_capacities , and other trackers about html issues http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-10769 . I would like to know if using iframes has messed up my linking to courses or if I have done something incorrectly when creating my classes.  I do have access to the administrator login to Moodle but I cannot see any code.    If anyone has any suggestions on why this is happening so suddenly, please let me know what I need to do to fix it.  Thank you so much in advance!",

I use lesson back up whenever I can, and I had some code written sothat every time a course is created, it automatically generates a symlink that points to a shared directory for all courses. So I can always get a file a need from anywhere provided I upload it in that shared directory. My point was, one you've created an activity, like a test for example, (with a title, comment, specific parameters etc.) it would nice to just duplicate it and move it around without having to re-create it through the \"add\" pull menu. Maybe this post belongs to the \"developpers forum\" then?",

However there was a link including the name of this video sitting over the top of the big arrow and I could click on this and another window would open with the You tube website and the video would play on this window. So at least I am getting the video to play but it still doesnt seem quite right. Cheers, Sue",

I created some SWF files before, and created them larger than the 620x450, and the videos got cropped. Quicktime movies that were larger than this were scaled down. I noticed a quicktime video I had was played at 600x480. I was thinking about doing the videos at 600x432 for FLV files, because, with the player controls, it would wind up being 600x450.

A problem that i'm having, is that the summary is generated from the first 100 characters of the resource body. This means that if the resource body had some content that starts out like this: \"Here is some content. I hope that someone can help me solve this problem because I am having some difficulty with it. Moodle Forums are very active and helpful.\" Then the summary would look like this: \"Here if some content. I hope that someone can help me solve this problem because I am having some diff\" You can see that the most undesirable thing is that the summaries end up being chopped off in the middle of words/sentences. I thought of a few possible solutions: 1: Delete the summary from the resources page or force it to be blank. 2: Extend the length of the summary from 100 chars to something larger. 3: Make the summary by reading until the first end of sentence character (period, exclamation, or question mark).",

When I add a resourse by uploading a file, the file is not veiwable(doesn't show) when the link created is clicked. I tried all types of files i.e. 1)JPEG image 2)excel document & 3)Power point presentation. I tried Power point presentation after saving it as a web page i.e. with .htm extention. I checked the settings of Internet Explorer i.e. security settings, allowing pop-ups, active X controls etc. When the link created is clicked, Internet explorer opens in a new window(chose the option of new window in resourse settings) & shows the message http404 not found. When I click the details of error, it shows that IE was able to contact the website but required web page not found. Problem is with Moodle's data directory or something else? Link on the course page is created properly, file is uploaded properly only unable to see the file content. Anybody please help. Rgds Mahesh",

All of the courses on my server use uploaded files for the content, but while upgrading to 1.4.2, I have discovered that the navigation bar is no longer displayed by when viewing such resources. This seems to be due to a new feature allowing the user to specify whether or not the nav bar is visible for individual resource, unfortuantly the default for this feature changes the previous behavour of moodle, which showed the nav bar above uploaded pages. The new feature is good and potentially useful, but it really should preserve the previous behaviour as the default. There is no way I can roll out 1.4.2 onto our main server, since this would break every single course on our server and require every single page resource in every course to be edited to get back the nav bar. There are 1000's of such resources and this would take weeks to do ! Is there any way of globally re-enabling the nav bar for uploaded resource without having to spend weeks editing every single resource ? I've looked and can't find any options.",

The files all display nicely in alphabetical order. However, if I create a subfolder inside there and then do the same drag and drop the files appear to display with the most recently uploaded at the top. I don't mind which display order I use, but it seems that it changes depending on how deep into the folder tree I am resulting in confused users... Anybody else get the same thing? Thanks, Tim",

Sin embargo Dreamweaver la mayoria de los modulos te serviran pero no se con seguridad si las conexiones a bases de datos seran del mismo modo en Mac, aunque creo que si pues para poder trabajar con ellas debes tener un servidor local como appserv instalado, por lo que tambien creo que te seriran, los videotutoriales, pues las conexiones las tendras que realizar con myadmind y eso no cambia en Mac.

I mean, suppose I have 1.html, 2.html and 3.html. And suppose I have a link inside 1.html that points to 2.html file. And a link inside 2.html file tha points to 3.html file. Making 1.html the main file, if I navigate (using the links) to 2.html and 3.html, the student log would show me only the 1.html visited. But I want that it tracks and show on reports also 2.html and 3.html access? The book module seems to allow me create .html files traceable but it has the drawbacks I cannot use any . css , or .js. In the book module I am restricted to .html that is wrapped by moodle. The solution it seems possible so far is to use a SCORM package. But it seems SCORM is not very flexible in termos of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript . I can also create each .html file as a resource. But it could be very tiring to set an entire course full of hundreds of .html pages. Anyone that had the same requirements and could share a solution?",

It seems the book option will not work since we want do use css and js so as to create rich interfaces (something like: circular menus, accordions, lightboxes, image galleries, drag and drop interaction and animations). I will study the \"Additional HTML\" settings you mentioned. The File activity as you pointed is at the moment our best choise but it has a drawback that it does not track the pages individually so we could see which pages the student has visited. For instance: Making 1.html the main file, if I navigate (using the links) to 2.html and 3.html, the student log would show me only the 1.html visited. But I want that it tracks and show on reports also 2.html and 3.html access? Maybe I am doing something wrong. Thanks in advance.",

Up until now, once a year I move all course files (lessons, assignments, foro attachments and so on)  from my web server to a backup copy. I need to do that because I have to pay for any extra disc I use.  Besides, I want to keep the courses structure so I can keep students enrolments, grades, etc...which is quite necessary for my organization. That's why I can not delete old courses. My question is, how can I move all those files out of the repository in one go without deleting a course? Is there any moodle function that I can use? Thanks in advance.",

Then you can delete them from the pay-for server while still having access to the marks etc when you need them.

If I paste the Classes from the import files into the one file, so that all the javascript code is in a single file with the HTML, then the 'app' works fine.

In this case, it turns out I needed AZW/mobi. Huh. (2) Out of desperation, I threw my same mobi.png files into the core pix/f/ folder, and the mobi icons all of a sudden appeared as expected. That didn't make sense, since my epub icons in my theme's pix_core/f/ folder were overriding the original epub icons. And then it did make sense—I'm guessing that my mobi icons in my theme's folder weren't overriding Moodle's default icon because there was no default icon to override in the first place. When I added a mobi icon to the core, everything clicked into place. Main lesson ? When adding a completely new mimetype, add the icons to the core instead of the theme. (I suppose.)",

Then when you have got the folder (ending in .zip) into your course files, click to unzip it - it will list all the contents and you click OK to accept it. You'll then get the folder again, unzipped and you can either display each individual resource separately or you can do as suggested and use the 'display a directory' option in Add a Resource to show the whole folder on the page. Students then just click on the folder and can access the resources themselves. This makes the page a bit neater.",

Last year he used a forum for his AP class to do something similar with each student submitting ideas and questions, but now I'm stuck with having to separate that content from the user/profiles. I believe if I were to reset the course I would have to be careful not reset that forum in fear of loosing that data.

I had set the windows to open 800x600 but that was cumbersome. Leaving the size fields blank is supposed to open the new window the same size as the window it was launched from. Here's the (edited) instructions from the moodle: Determine the size window you wish to open. If you leave these fields blank then the new popup window will be exactly the same size as the window they clicked on to get the popup. When I set the size to 800x600, the new window always launched as an 800x600 window. However, when the I leave the fields blank, the following happens: If the browser is IE , then the new window opens to the correct width(!) but the height is very, very small...

          "Text": "Good day, We have been experiencing problems with htm files in our migration process from another LMS to Moodle (applies only to htm files produced in Microsoft Word or PowerPoint).  Question marks are appearing instead of long dashes,  single quotes (magic quotes I believe they're called), and repeated spaces. In all the posts I've read, the question mark issue comes up for non-English characters when the default Character Set is not set to UTF-8.  I'm wondering if this is our problem as well. Our install is Moodle 1.5.3: Fedora Core 2 MySQL 3.23.58 PHP 4.3.4 mbstring enabled (OK status for all these in Moodle Environment page). In order to test if this is a UTF-8 related issue, I then installed Moodle 1.6.3 on a different machine (running CentOS 4.3). I uploaded a couple of the htm files, and the same problem occurs.  Note though, this second Moodle instance  is not yet UTF-8, since the Environment page mbstring status says Check.  The Environment page also says that the My SQL version installed needs to be upgraded in order to guarantee that all data will be converted to UTF-8 in the future. I'm still new to linux, and have been unsuccessful thus far in upgrading MySql or installing/enabling mbstring (GD also has to be installed/enabled). My question is, with respect to the question marks, can anyone say for sure that this is definitely (or definitely not) a UTF-8 related issue? We have quite alot of these htm files to clean up (a number of work-arounds have been discovered, but they involve processing each htm file, one at a time).  Our hope is that there is some setting to change which will allow all such files to display correctly. Thanks, Lindsay.",

One concern for me has always been the question of client apps, and for me the fewer and more open the client apps the better all are. That being said, I think you are well served by converting the ppt file to flash or converting the ppt to web. In the former case you can simply upload and link to one file (and you are requiring that all have access to a flash viewer) and in the latter you would need to zip up all the files produced and upload them to an appropriate directory and unzip, linking to the contents html doc from you resource page, in which case you need no additional clients. Of course you could always look at using something like S5 . Critical issues for me have been: Whether the format deployed can be opened with an open client (ppt can not) Whether the format deployed has helper apps on all platforms (again, nix on ppt) Whether the format deployed is easily managed (ppt ranks a so-so in my book) Having supported students using OS X, MS-Windows and a variety of linux flavors, my choice has been S5 or html first, followed by flash.",

VBA can do some pretty nasty stuff and many network admins will not allow the security settings to be changed to allow it with good reason.

When students open the file, and have chosen to enable macros, they are asked to type in their student ID number. If they number they type in is incorrect, they receive an error message, but the file reopens and the students are again prompted to enable macros. If they enable macros the second time 'round, the worksheet open up. However, if a student attempts to launch any macros in the worksheet, Excel crashes. One workaround is to instruct students to save the Excel file before opening it. In this case, if student type in an incorrect ID number, the worksheet closes and does not reopen.

I've tried putting in some html in the name field, but Moodle strips it out. I could of course use an html block and embed images with links, but this takes up more space than a simple list of links.

From the main menu, a student is given an introductory statement to each module. Each module has been created in a 'topic box' which was created when I created the course. Under the introductory statement is a link going to a webpage created within moodle. Inside the webpage is the module course material, made up of course material, external websites, moodle quizes, moodle assignments, moodle resources. At the moment, I've had to create a Fifth topic which I've called \"Course Resource Material - Do Not Touch\". In this topic I've created the Moodle quizes and assignments that I have linked inside each of the four modules webpages. This looks really ugly and I need to think of a way around it, but can't think of anything! My question is this: Is there anyway I can create the moodle resources (quizes, assignments, resource) straight into my Web page (which has also been created with Moodle)? If not, is there anyway to create them somewhere else (maybe in another course?) and link them back? Or even have them hidden to the student but still accessible through the page? Any ideas would be muchly appreciated!! Thanks, Cory",

Yes, when I needed to add a resource I had to go to the course settings, set the number of topics to 5, add the resource and then change the settings again. Not very elegant but in courses which had a stable predefined structure this solution worked reasonably well. An alternative way which I started to use recently for a slightly different purpose but should work in this case too is to show the topic block only in editing mode. I add to course sites an html block in the bottom right corner. In this block I insert javascript which detects whether the page is in editing mode, and if it is not, I set the style.display of certain sections on the page to 'none' so that they are not displayed when not in editing mode which means that even I don't see them and bothered by their ugliness when I don't need to make changes in them. Now, you can get the editing mode from the body tag by // detect edit mode var arTmp=document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\"); var theBody=arTmp[0]; var editMode=theBody.className.search(/editing/gi);",

I understand the low priority this tracker has, however many of my collegues use a lot of labels so this is throwing off the aesthetic/spacing. Any ideas on how we can correct this?",

Consequently, many of us are leaving. I want to delete my resources off of my classes as quickly as possible. I've deleted the course files, but this does not delete resources that are links to other sites. Is there a quick and easy way to clear a course as a Teacher? I know that if they really wanted to, the admin could restore my courses, but as the site is in dire straights, I doubt that they will. Thanks, ~Devi~",

At one level I do agree with Mary's answer but there are very many people who have uploaded PowerPoint presentations on our Moodle and they still need for them to work the way they expect them to. I have today convinced our network team here to make the following registry change (as advised in a Microsoft technical post): Start Registry Editor Locate and click this key in the registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\PowerPoint.Show.8 Double click on the Data type: REG_DWORD Change the Value data: to 8 Close Registry Editor Try this on your local PC and it should fix the problem. The bigger issue is that you can't control what's happening for all your other users. For us in the college the change will be rolled out to all our users but even then we can't influence our users when they are at home. Sorry this is a bit wordy - I do hope it helps with your immediate problem. P.S. This is not a Moodle problem - you would hit the same problem with the presentations on any server",

At first a thought this might be an issue with encoding, however the problem lies outside Moodle. After having debugging I found that the function ressource_pluginfile contains a varible called args, wich gets the filename in the URI. If running an IIS with Fast CGI any non ascii characters will be cut of, which will result in Moodle not being able to return the file to the user (file not found error). Microsoft has issue a hotfix for this error, which can be found at following URLs: IIS 7.5 : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2277918/ IIS 7.0 : http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c17a72bd-7009-4830-85e0-06290f3b8367 More information about this issue can be seen at http://www.redolivedesign.com/utah-web-designers-blog/2010/10/18/how-to-fix-utf-8charset-problem-with-iis-7-5-and-php-fastcgi/ I hope this post will help others fix the issue, without going through hours of debugging.

From top to bottom in the dialog box, there is window for the url of the file to be inserted, an alternative text window, a large blank area with the label \"file browser\" above it, a preview window, and the upload browser(complete). The files definitely upload, I can browse through the site to the files.php/1/images folder and find them there, so the insert image dialog is functioning insofar as you can upload through it, and - once you deduce the url for the uploaded image - insert it, but for some reason the server-side file browser is absent, even though there's clearly a space for it. Please, can anyone suggest a remedy?",

At section number 0 the new resource url is like this: http://mydomain.com/moodle/course/modedit.php?add=resource&type=html&course=2&section=0&return=0 And in other sections the url is the same one instead section number.

This might cause these problems (and others if you get past that stage). Database table creation is all done using the Moodle cross-platform system but some of the queries use Postgres-specific features (well, mostly SQL standard features, but whatever) that are not supported in MySQL. I have edited the description to make this clearer. It's in bold now! And in a clear list. (Before it was just one sentence towards the end in normal type, so it was a bit easy to miss.) We are hoping to enhance resourcepages to also support MySQL, perhaps in the next few months (I can't promise a date! or even that we actually get it done. but it looks hopeful). If using Postgres is not an option for you, then maybe you can try again then. Apologies for the inconvenience. --sam",

I can unpack them manually into the right folders, and even select the unpacked items from a list that I'm given when trying to add an IMS. But that's it, they just don't show up on the page when previewed or run? Has anyone out there actually managed to get NLN Materials running on version 1.6 without some form of black magic?

Until the IMS CP part of release 1.6 is sorted out, I'd suggest to anyone, as you did, to use the Object module from Moodles site. I installed it and miracle of miracles I can now use the NLN Materials with great ease. Many thanks to you and everyone else who's helped out with replies in the past.

          "Text": "I thought I'd try asking the excellent Moodle community about this even though it is probably only indirectly related to Moodle but we are seeing students having issues downloading files from Moodle under the following conditions: OS: Mac OS 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" Browser: Either Firefox or Safari Connection: Offsite ( a slower connection than LAN speed) Basically, any Macbooks with Snow Leopard on them have trouble downloading files (through a resources module) that are greater than 1MB if they are offsite no matter what browser they use (if they are on Campus the files come through just fine). What happens is the download starts and then gets to 1MB and just stops (stalls out). No error, no nothing. You can try to resume, etc and the same thing happens over and over again. When I look in the Apache access logs I see a successful hit on the file.php URL (200) and exactly 1MB of data sent (almost like the browser sent an ACK command saying they were done). I've checked into all of our time-out settings and nothing seems very low (in fact, the downloads hit 1MB and stop pretty quickly before a time-out could possibly be triggered it seems). The other oddity is that they can go to a non-Moodle section of our portal with a file download repository (just straight URLs, no fancy send_file calls or chunking) during the same session and those files will download flawlessly. So, it seems like it is some combo of how Moodle does file downloading and how Snow Leopard receives files. Any help would be appreciated as I have found nothing on the subject and the number of students who can't access files offsite is mounting. The specs: Moodle 1.9.3+ is running on Windows 2003 with MySQL 5.0.21, Apache 2.0.58 and PHP 5.2.3 The site is running as pure SSL and we have all files forced to download (we've had display problems in Safari and Firefox with some embedded file types).",

Resources are mostly MS-Word documents but also MS-Excel, PDF, html etc. It takes a long time to update a resource doesn’t it! Delete existing resource. Upload new one from local machine. Very tedious. We found a way to access the files directly, which means we can edit and save them directly on the moodle server . Updates are ‘live’ as soon as the new version is saved. (Basically, we can use Windows Explorer to open the moodle server folder like any other file folder). I understand that with moodle 2 this will not be possible. I don’t think I’ll be using moodle now because it takes too long to update existing resources. If I open a file through moodle, it is always read-only – even if it’s a file I wrote and uploaded myself. Why?",

If using a youtube video, I can just copy and paste the embed code provided, that works fine - But, with flash content we had created ourselves, we used to upload the video to the files section, right click on the uploaded file, go to \"copy link location\" and then paste the location of the file into a manually typed in HTML Embed code in a label. In 1.9, we got a URL such as http://moodle.ac.uk/file.php/40/Hairdressing_2.swf - we'd then do something along the lines of <embed src=\"http://moodle.ac.uk/file.php/40/Hairdressing_2.swf\" /> to paraphrase and it'd work. In 2.2, I don't seem to get this static link to the file - I have tried uploading as normal in the file picker and also uploading in my \"private files\" block too - the \"link location\" of the file doesn't seem to work. Does anyone know how I can do this?????  We have literally moved to 2.2 last week, so may be missing a useful plugin or something that may help. If I use \"add a file\" to add the video - or if use the \"Moodle media\" button at the top of the label box to add the flash file - I just get a link to it the file, which then opens in a new window, not it displayed on the main page you do when embedding it.

As is well known not all students are patient, not read, just log in for inercia... there is when my investigation take place. I will study the student interactions on moodle, then based in that result i will change the activities, the resources, or hide unhide, my course will have two, three, four, etc, alternatives activities/resources for a specific tiopics, i just wanna put the student a easy way to learn. Ex: Course Lesson 1 Reading - Default Activity Movie - Hide Activity Images - Hide Activity All three activities are the same but in a diferent way, my idea is show only one to the student after analize their inteactions, this implies the same course with diferent activities per student. After analize. Lesson 1 Reading - Hide Activity Movie - Defualt Activity Images - Hide Activity And this repeat with all students",

I can find the ID of the page to link to by going into the database and searching for the relevant entry but this is very long winded & slow process and the ID's don't seem to tie up with the URL 's that the generated page indicates For example I have a (HTML) resource in the database with an ID of 21 but if I try http://ibdtraining.org/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&id=21 I just get a message Resource ID incorrect. Similarly a known working URL such as http://ibdtraining.org/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&id=17 doesn't have a corresponding ID in the database. (It's there but with an ID of 12) Can anyone put me right on this please? 2.  Also I'm having an error saving HTML files,links or text files as Pop-ups (error message windowobj is null or not an object.) It's being generated in this function: function openpopup(url,name,options,fullscreen) { fullurl = \" http://ibdtraining.org/moodle \" + url; windowobj = window.open(fullurl,name,options); if (fullscreen) { windowobj.moveTo(0,0); windowobj.resizeTo(screen.availWidth,screen.availHeight); } windowobj.focus(); return false; Looking through the Forums I see that others have posted this error but there has been no reply.

The 'resource' table ids are the \"instance\" of the module which is included in the 'course_module' table. The best way to discover the proper URL is to launch it from within the course that was used to create it and note the address in the address bar. Simply paste this as your target from anywhere within Moodle and the course and module will be called up. The user must be enrolled in the course to view the resource. I set up a general course with unrestricted access to setup and host these types of resources. Regarding pop-ups. I use the resource setting to launch in a new window. This seems to be a very reliable way to launch resources from anywhere in Moodle in a popup window. However, the main window will navigate to the hosting course. I hope this helps. Jamie",

(or make optional or use an \"open/close\" mechanism like hiding the window parameters). I can do this manually by editing mod/resource/type/common.html to do it properly, I would need to add a \"resource\" configuration variable and put a small amount of PHP code in common.html At the same time, I could put in the \"summary text appears in weekly block\" option -- that would actually make the summary useful.

I'm trying to be lazy, and filter the existing filepicker down to only allow the two plugins that we want to show at this time. The only method of filtering that I've found so far is to use the supported_returntypes and filter that on FILE_REFERENCE, but this returns the 2 plugins that I want, and server files (close, but not close enough). I tried to add a custom return type, but it's ignored. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to filter this down to just the two plugins I want to show? Thanks!",

          "Text": "I've started using HTML5 output from MadCap Flare. To use this in my courses I do the following: Create a zip file of the output HTML5 folder. Upload this as a file resource to my course. In the resource settings, unzip the file. Set default.htm as the default file. Set Appearance to \"Open\". And that works great. I can pull URLs from within the package to link to directly and all works as I would hope. Until I need to update the resource. No biggie, just repeat the steps above, selecting overwrite when uploading the new zip. However, the URLs for all the pages change! The first unzip creates the URLs as \"mymoodle/pluginfile.php/18282/mod_resource/content/ 1 /\" The second unzip yields \"mymoodle/pluginfile.php/18282/mod_resource/content/ 2 /\" And it keeps increasing that number. That means I have to update all my links every time I update resource. That's a mess. Worse still, the old versions seem to be archived/cached somewhere, so if I don't update all my links, they point to outdated material. Is there any way to stop this? It also happens for file resources that are a single file when you upload a new version. There it is somewhat okay as I can link to the file resource, but with these HTML5 folders, I can't point directly to the file and get my nice skin layout. I'm using Moodle 3.9.12. Thanks, Aaron",

You can add resources and activities to a course and that is it. If what you are really after is just the navigation bar then you could probably hack the build_navigation function within weblib.php to alter the navigation bar based upon the order of activities/resources within a course section, and then indent the activities/resources within the section to fake the appearance, however it would require changing core core so would probably not be a great idea. Hope this helps. Cheers Sam",

          "Text": "Hi Kirk, Presently I'm flat tack at work so can't stop to look too much into it however at a glance I would suggest trying the following. I see that build_navigation takes a $cm object and part way through the function it checks if its an object and then adds stuff to the navigation. I would think that $cm contains both the course id and section id/number which should be enough for what you need. To begin I would use the course id to retrieve the course (which is likely $COURSE) and then call $modinfo = get_fast_modinfo($course) with it to get all of the information about the resources/activities in the course. Within $modinfo you will need to locate the section that the $cm is within and then iterate through its activities/resources adding each to the $navlinks array stopping when you get to the end OR you find the activity/resource that matches $cm's instanceid. It sounds a little complex but when you plan it out it shouldn't be too bad. That being said you will probably need pretty good development skills to get through it. Sorry I can't help more at this point hopefully the above is enough to get you through, all focus is on Moodle 2.0 development presently. Cheers Sam",

So we restored the data in the Live-System. Afterwards we copied (and renamed) the moodledata directory for the test system. But now we've created the problem that there are only a few courses in the database of the test system but the data of all courses are in the moodledata directory for the test system. We can'te delete the courses in the test system, because they are already deleted but we waste a lot of storage on our server if we keep the data of the courses in the moodledata directory of the test system.

          "Text": "Hi Amit, The short answer is no, you can't protect your SWF files from being copied when they are displayed using Moodle. There are ways to make it more difficult but ultimately, anyone can install one of the many plugins for Firefox that'll circumvent any security measures that you introduce. Basically, Flash is inherently insecure as it's very easy to download , copy and decompile (read the Actionscript code). The only thing that I can think of, off the top of my head, is to embed your SWF files in secure PDF files. I believe that Adobe Acrobat allows you to do this from version 8 (or earlier?) onwards. The PDF would be encrypted and fairly secure but nothing's 100%! Also, don't be conned into buying SWF Actionscript encryption applications. All they are is obfuscators which only serve to make the code more difficult to read. A very simple security measure you can include is for the SWF to check the URL it's on before it runs the program. So if anyone downloads and copies to another location, it won't run. You can also configure it to show a copyright message and give a link to your website. But again, anyone can decompile your SWF and change the code.",

Two, there was no simple way to create a link/path to another PDF, reading assignment, or directions. Using Book's had multiple advantages. I could edit, if needed, right in Moodle. I could break up long PDF's by splitting into chapters and sub-chapters. And the one you need, I could enter HTML links that would take my students directly to the next needed location in the course. Just go to the location I wanted to go to, copy the URL , go to the point in the book where I wanted to jump from, insert the URL link, then save the book. In many cases, I would have multiple links since I taught 7th and 8th graders, and depending on the grade of the student, they would need to jump to different places, sometimes.",

See what you get Download the latest version of Moodle and update your local version (remember to include all your 3rd-party module with the upgrade - refer to google docs for more help on upgrading) One other thing: check that you have sufficient server memory allocated for your installation.",

The subtitles will then be displayed in the video. Note that it takes a few seconds before the control bar fades away and the subtitles become clearly visible.

This allows the teaching materials to be presented in a more logical and more organized way. This seem to require the availability of the URL (or path) to the resources to be used in the iframe tag.

But when my students try to download those files with their PC, they get files with the extension .c.txt. For example: the uploaded file was manyfork.c and the downloaded file is manyfork.c.txt. I tried from the computer on the teacher's desk, at school, and I confirm that on all the computers in the school the files are downloaded as manyfork.c.txt. I do not think this is a Moodle server problem because the files are downloaded correctly from my home computer. So, what could be the reason for this behaviour? I use Moodle 3.5 on a Moodlecloud hosting. Thank you so much, Luigi.",

These flash animation files consist of two swf files, one that is the place-holder and controls of the animation and another that is the actual content. The place-holder flash links to the content and displays it within the controls. Since upgrading to 1.9 the placeholders will only load now and it will not link to the content. This has made almost the whole of our Years 7, 8 and 9 Science courses unusable. I have attached one of these animations so you can have a look and see what I mean. It is two files zipped up that need extracting into teh same folder. If you link to the file as a resource (through view.php), it does not play; however if you use the direct link (through file.php) it works fine.",

Since adding an extra topic to my course the Resource summary page and the drop-down \"Jump To\" box display the wrong information. (1) The manually added links to the various resources on the main page work perfectly and are in my preferred order. (2) The automatically generated Resource overview page has Topic 1 at the bottom of the list and starts at Topic 2 (i.e. completely out of sequence and this cannot be manually moved) (3) The \"Jump To\" box delivers the wrong resource for the displayed title (even though this exactly matches the titles on the course home page) What can have happened and how best should I try to resolve this? Thanks for any help. Andrew",

          "Text": "Creo que es mejor tomar responsabilidad por los backups como administrador y no utilizar las capacidades por dentro de Moodle para hacer lo mismo. Asi, recomiendo pensar del proceso de hacer un backup como la Santa Trinidad (tres partes distintas en uno) que uno se debe practicar religiosamente (por lo menos diaramente). Las partes consisten en 1) un backup del base de archivos utilizando una herramienta como MySQL Admin para exportar los datos a un archivo de formato SQL 2) hacer una copia de todos los archivos en la carpeta de MoodleData y 3) ultimamente, hacer una copia de los archivos que consisten su instalación de Moodle, quiere decir el código (especialmente el archivo config.php). Con los archivos de MoodleData, despues de archivar todos los archivos me parece aceptable hacer un backup parcial de solo los archivos que han cambiado pero cada semana haria otro backup completo. Al respeto del número 3 es importante si uno ha aplicado cambios especializados para su sitio. Si se usa del programa como es pues siempre es posible bajarlo de nuevo del internet. Con estes tres pedazitos, se puede reconstruir su sitio. Espero que este responde a la pregunta y no le ha dejado con mas preguntas. Suerte y feliz Moodle-ando - Antonio",

The idea I have in mind is that I want a database activity in which users can add entries. Each entry contains, as one of it fields, a file. I would want these files to be accessible from the File Picker, so that, for example, a teacher could pick it (or link it by creating an alias) to use it somewhere else in Moodle, just like he would be able to do it with a dropbox, webdav, google drive or whatever repository if the appropiate repository plugin is enabled.

Is this going to work with a quiz?  Or am I asking too much and need to use some sort of external tool?  Even thinking of looking at the H5P stuff.  At present it's just an idea that I'm presenting so don't want to spend too many hours creating something.

I can't share the resources with other courses!!! They are in a folder outside of the public_html, so I can't link to it. I've tried place them into the FILES folder in my moodle folder, but then everyone can access the files(not possible when it's outisde of public_html), plus the autolinking doesn't seem to work. Do I assume that I'll have to duplicate the entire resource folder for each new courses that I want to add?",

It's like Dan said in his other post: file.php handles permissions very strictly and as such if you are not enrolled in the course to which the glossary belongs (even if it's a global one), you will not have access to the pictures in it: they will not display. I agree with Dan that hacking file.php to take away some of the security is a dangerous thing. But how about this: file.php checks if you are logged in (course doesn't matter) file.php only serves images / no other filetypes file.php only serves images that are inside a directory called `public` or `sitewide` to make sure no teacher puts files in there which should be available to students of a particular course only.",

They are not stored in the folder where they used to be. Therefore, when Moodle goes to find the video...they are in the \"wrong\" place. Thus, your popup is looking in the wrong place. You either have to get your files in the right place and/or direct your popup to the right folder. I hope that points you in the right direction. Dan",

By the way, it's not just the video files that are stored differently under 2.0+ - all files are stored in a proprietary setup.  The former moodledata directories corresponding to the course ids are all empty.  It has moved to prorpietary files in the filedata directory.  Now everything must be accessed through the database and/or program code.  I think the developers did this in an attempt to improve overall data integrity. : ) Chris",

I cannot get any powerpoint file over 2M to open successfully.  In IE , the window hangs for awhile then gives a 'file not found' error.  In Firefox , the file downloads but I then get an error that it cannot be opened.  All files less than 2M open great - everything over has this problem. I can open the large files successfully on my hard drive before I load them.  I can load them successfully using Moodle (so the 8M max upload seems okay).  I can also link directly to them in the data directory and they open fine there.  It's only when I am clicking on the resource link and going through file.php that it fails. Any ideas?  I've seen the suggestion to convert large ppt to flash, but until our developers can get to that point? Thanks, Jodi",

          "Text": "Hi everyone. Just wondering if there is anyway I can get this type of function within my course. I'm anticipating that the solution will involve a mix of html coding and using existing/new tools within moodle that I'm not aware of The issue surrounds having a series of text boxes on a single web page. The format on the page should be question --> text box;; question --> text box;; question --> text box etc. I'd like the student to be able to be able to save what they have written in the text boxes then have the following options: - Edit their text - Convert page to a print-friendly version Their answers in the text boxes would be stored there for them and wouldn't be graded - which makes me think that some kind of basic e-portfolio plug-in might help. There is something that looks similar to what I want on moodle (Activity --> Assignments - Online text) but this only allows 1 question on the web page and would also be graded. Any help would be grand! Thanks",

I can get it so that I can click the browse repository and see the list of items. If I try to preview it I get cannot find it. If I just go ahead and add it and then try to view it I get the requested url ... was not found on the server and the url isn't correct for where the repository is located and can't seem to make it locate it. I have a 1.9.3 version set up did the same to that and this time I get the url looking in the right place but told I don't have permission to view that folder. Clearly if I do the same to both and get two different results for where it thinks the repository is, there is something going on. This is what is making me wonder if it works at all on 1.9.1 Anybody know the definitive answer? If I move to 1.9.3 it seems to be an apache security issue which I have no idea how to fix as it is a folder in a folder that already says we can all view it. I've seen this http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=99290 posting that seems to have a similar security issue, but I'm not using Linux and am not in a position to get scripts written for security that sounds a tad overkill. I'm going through this pain because I want to try MrCUTE and getting IMS content package to work seems to be a pre-requisite. Thoughts and ideas (other than upgrading Moodle) much appreciated.",
