Scenario 1 Self-registered user, is prompted at registration, and on clicking 'Link to site policy agreement' is taken to my T&C page on my website (in a new Tab). As it is a new tab, I feel that I need to include the instruction: '\"Please read the following terms and conditions. When you have done so, you should close this window to return to registration.'\" else they may not know what to do, as the Back link is broken. That's all fine I think. Scenario 2 Admin-registered user, is taken at login to the page: [website]/user/policy.php which has my T&C page embedded in a frame, with: ' You must agree to this policy to continue using this site. Do you agree?' at the bottom (outside the frame) and a Yes and a No button. Clicking Yes gives access, No keeps them out.

I have not found a possibility to do that. As far as I can see, you can only switch coursecontact on / of globally, not depending on the user's login status. This seems to be true for 2.0 as well. We do, however, feel that teachers need to be visible at some point in order to enable users to contact them in case they want to join a course. Any solution for that?

In the GDPR FAQ documentation , (under 'See also'), there is a link to a response to an earlier question similar to yours, \"Is there a way to completely delete users including all their data?\", which is quite detailed, and I think will help answer your questions (you can find that response here ). Some of the other responses in that forum discussion may also be helpful. If you are using an older version of Moodle (3.4 or earlier), this pre-dates GDPR support and I believe users are simply flagged as deleted, so their accounts become inactive (but upgrading your site should make the improved deletion method available).",

We'd like to stay with Formal White for desktop devices.  We use Bootstrap for mobile and tablet devices, and it works fine under proxy SSL, but of course it displays the \"menu\" information differently. I assume the problem is related to CSS .  Can any suggest a fix, or at least a debugging approach so I can discover the source of the problem?.",

These users are then enrolled as \"guests\" on the course to distinguish them from users who are actually \"students\". This works perfectly well apart from the fact that it may contravene copyright legislation if \"guests\" can view uploaded PDFs of scanned texts intended for the sole use of the \"students\" on a particular course. I'm wondering: is there a way to hide attached resources from specified user roles? I can't see an option for this in the role definitions, but maybe I missed it. Any suggestions greatly received!",

Now what? users have to register to moodle and they will be able to login with their open id? but in the registration form there is no option for the open id... 2) I tried to type yahoo.com in the open id box, but a blank page appeared... maybe something went wrong with the installation? Sorry if the questions are silly, but I'm new with this and I really don't know what is this all about! Thank you in advance for your time and assistance! Ilona",

It's not clear from the information available whether that's triggered by part of the course content you have created, or something a student has submitted, so it's also not clear whether that could be a legitimate risk or something intentionally included in your course content. I think you'll need to look closely through that course to pinpoint the cause and determine if there is an issue there (or at least figure out which user's content is causing your anti-virus to pick it up, so you can follow up to get to the bottom of it). Also just a side note, your site is working via HTTP, but it appears the HTTPS version is having some problems (an SSL error and then redirecting to a cpanel error message that the site may have moved).",

Burp Security Suite identifies forms with autocomplete enabled as a warning. These are all shown as \"Password field does not have \"autocomplete=off\"\" warnings. These warnings turn into security issues on our monthly review. These monthly reviews have to be turned in to the Federal Government, which is unhappy with the flagged issues. Previously we could just enable this setting, and the problem would be solved. Regardless of whether or not browsers respect this setting, that is ENTIRELY the clients issue, not Moodles. Moodle has no business telling clients what their browsers do or do not respect. There are configurations of browsers within secured federal government environments that DO respect these settings, and removing them is just playing pretend that there isnt a group of users that this impacts. I would like this removal to be reconsidered. What do people think?",

This is because the files must be downloaded into the browser cache before they can be viewed. There are various techniques to make it more difficult but those come at the cost of excluding some users. Media companies are in a constant battle with download manager developers to come up with new ways to prevent users from saving downloads. If their best and brightest are having a difficult time, how well do you think your department would do? Following best practices, i.e. keeping presentation and content separate (SWF + XML + images, text, audio, video and/or animations), rather than combining them in a single binary file (single SWF file), will make it more difficult for others to reuse your content. Just my €0.02!",

It's possible to add encryption to AMF3 streams but, at the end of the day, the downloaded files still have to be cached somewhere and a tech-savvy user will know how to get at them. The internet was designed for sharing and it does it very well. While you can make it more difficult to take and re-use content, you can't stop it all together, and in trying to do so you may end up losing more, i.e. clients and/or students who won't or can't install software to view your content, than you gain, i.e. less loss of revenue from re-use without permission .

The reason is that in the last fantastico install I saw, it stores moodle data files in the public_html directory and calls it uploaddata (see also this post ). Fantastico should also create a .htaccess file to prevent public access to this folder. That message is a notice - so check that there is a .htaccess file in public_html/moodle/uploaddata similar to the one here . If you have such a file, then it may be OK to ignore the notice, but if you want absolute security (as Dan suggests), move the file uploaddata to outside home/XXXXXXXX/uploaddata, check that the permissions are the same and change the $CFG->dataroot path in the moodle config.php file.

Why is there not an htaccess-dist.txt file installed in the moodledata directory during installation and creation of the directories in moodledata?   This related to those unfortunate users whose providers do NOT allow the setup of moodledata outside of the code base(s). Also, why is there not an htaccess-dist.txt file in the moodle code distribution that has recommended re-write rules to make the moodle code directory 'less fluffy'? What do I mean by 'less fluffy'?   Have learned a trick that works on any moodle installation where I can acquire certain files from directories NOT logged onto the site which, when downloaded and viewed does give one a potential attack plan/vector IF one were inclined to attack/hack. Example: try this on your own Moodle: Using a browser, without logging on, go to: http://yoursite/cache/upgrade.txt At the top of that file: \" ﻿ This files describes API changes in /cache/stores/* - cache store plugins. Information provided here is intended especially for developers.\" Ok, I get that ... am not a developer ... but at the same time, I can figure out what version of Moodle they are running ... at least series which could then lend itself to whatever malicious thing I've developed. Of course, to some, this is not a security issue ... or is it? An htaccess-dist.txt file that had re-write rules to block/re-direct request for such .txt files found in directories of Moodle code might actually enhance security.   Downloaders of Moodle code have option to read and understand it's ramification (check if their server is allowing re-write, etc.) then 'turn it on' by simply changing the name of the file from htaccess-dist.txt to .htaccess. The htaccess-dist.txt file would have comments/warnings, etc. at the top of the file. Or am I wrong and being too 'dramatic'? My 2 cents ... 'in the spirit of sharing', Ken",

I think it would be best to handle this at the networking level and you can quite easily setup a secure tunnel between the two servers to achieve this and Moodle plugins will work fine with that. For example, a quick and dirty solution would be ssh tunnel between the two servers and connect to that tunnel. However, i'm sure other more robust solutions exist. Hopefully someone will have a good example of doing this in production. Dan",

The head of enrichment activities (extra-curricular clubs) has asked that I set up courses and give students control over them. This worries me- it's only a year since I was a student and had this existed last year, probably at least half of the computing class would have had a go at attacking it just to see if we could. The first attack that came to mind was just a JS redirect to a phishing page with a timeout error; chances are this would get at least one teachers password (the same as the novell network- not good). I'm sure between a thousand odd students at least a few will be knowledgeable/imaginative enough to figure out plenty of attacks given free reign over courses. Would there be a way to let them only add activities , clean all their html as if it were forum posts and maybe do something about stopping them just linking directly to such a phishing page as a resource? Anyone got previous experience of this? Anything else I should be looking out for? Thanks a lot, Mike",

Moodle itself takes security very seriously - my professional experience is in development and also penetration testing, and Moodle stands up incredibly well to any security issue you could think of. I have worked with Moodle since 2009, and I struggle to recall any major security incidents it has had. Consider also you still need to get the basics right (good strong random passwords, close un-needed services, patch regularly, upgrade regularly) and that security is a process that is constantly evolving and changing. You can't just declare something SECURE and expect it to remain that way indefinitely without constant maintenance and upgrades.",

I have not a lot of student for the moment, but I want to have the assurance they can connect whenever they want as they can work during WE also. So what are the solution regarding the failover with Moodle?  (between 2 or more instances?) I have 2 dedicated webservers, Moodle is currently in one of them. Is there any extnesion/plugin under moodle that enable a kind of synchronisation between both systems?? If not, we certainly have to proceed under OS level, is there any tutorial?  What are the pros & cons regarding synchronisation (realtime ? only during night once a day sync ? ??) Thanks for your expertise! Cheers",

I think there is the issue with ADFS server configuration, because: - If I login to moodle with Firefox (46 version) SSO works fine. ( https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/10.0.1/secu_enabling_iwa_in_firefox.html ) - If I login with Chrome (92 version) ADFS prompt for credential and if I entered it login successful. But SSO no working. Try add Chrome GPO called 'authentication server whitelisting' with ADFS server name, no result. Also try the same with Edge GPO. - If I login wth Edge (version 101) then ADFS prompt for login then enter the credential and it re-prompted for credential, and it become the infinity cycle. - If I try login with IE11, then prompt for credential enter it and get HTTP 400 Bad request. WIASupportedUserAgents added mozilla/5.0. Also try add „Chrome“ but no work. Set-ADFSProperties –ExtendedProtectionTokenCheck try to „none“ and „allow“ I think if SSO work with Firefox, then miniorange plugin configuration is correct and the problem is with ADFS? Also SPN is correct HTTP://<federationservice domain > on one Federation service account Also set Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdpInitiatedSignonPage $true Can you advise where to troubleshoot problem? Can it be workstation or server GPO? I need SSO login for MS Egde. Thank You",

Within moodle I have enabled ClamAV and added the ClamAV path as: /usr/bin/clamscan When a file is uploaded this does get scanned and I have tested with EICAR test file. however, this is really slow to scan a simple 200KB PDF file can take up-to 30 seconds to complete ( upload is almost instant, majority of time is the scan taking place). Due to the long processing time for these scans I have decided to change this to the daemon so have updated the ClamAV path to: /usr/bin/clamdscan Now whenever I upload anything it instantly fails (I have On ClamAV Failure set: Treat files like viruses) its almost as though Moodle is not able to call the clamdscan function. I've SSH onto the server (as root) and I'm able to run clamdscan on any directory and this works with no issues. I've changed php variable sys_temp_dir to a different directory and also change httpd to PrivateTmp = false but still no luck. I'm stuck, any advice would be appreciated.",

The next user would come and register and might see courses A, C and G. What is this called? I know I can create a role for each user or I can create a course with a key. But the role seems to broad and the course key seems too specific.

Add the following lines right after: $CFG->admin     = 'admin'; of that file. $CFG->allowedip=''; $CFG->blockedip=''; Save file.   That overrides values in tables of DB and sets both columns for ip allow/blocking to 'nothing'.   As long as those lines are in config.php file one cannot set/add/change the settings as admin or any other moodle user. No need to restart any service or server. Just access with browser. When it comes to allow or blocking ip addresses, there must be a reason ... are you having issues related? IMHO , best way to handle such is by using the operating system tools/config for networking on server.   That then works at the network layer of the server and not the application layer.  How easily that is done depends upon access to server.

In other words, quizzes are not secret or hidden anymore in this scenario, even when the activity is hidden (after being active) the user can still download attempts with questions and answer texts?

I understand that when I install moodle that the moodledata folder should be located outside the publically available area. However in all the help I've found it relates to the public_html and www folders. When I go into the CPanel with my hosting company (or ftp ) I only see a '/' root folder and then the subfolders that I add. At the moment I have moodle located at '/moodle' and moodledata at '/moodle/moodledata'. '/moodle' is accessed via \" http://vle.somedomain.co.uk \" and works fine but I'm sure the location of moodledata is wrong so where should it be? I can setup protected directories with the CPanel. Is this something I should be using? Thanks for any advise",

Yes, I know, but in order to close a directory to web access, you need to make sure that it isn't web accessible.  Just saying to put it outside of DocumentRoot isn't enough -- it has to be outside of an area that Apache would serve, and if you move moodledata to some place that is outside of DocumentRoot but still accessible, then you have not denied access to it. Do you mean file (directory) permissions of Unix? Try putting moodledata under moodle and protecting it through file permissions. LOL No, using file permissions would not work, since the directory must be accessible to Apache.  There are other ways, but I won't mention what they are, because I don't want to encourage people to use them, since the best thing to do is to put the directory outside of a publicly accessible area.",

Essentially I am unable to access the page remotely except from one specific network. I assumed that there was an IP blocking issue going on yet there were no entries to be found in the security settings within moodle. I have checked my sql remote access in cpanel thinking that may be the culprit yet that does not seem to be the case. I added IPs to be allowed but there is no change. As far as I am aware no one has made any changes to the existing moodle deployment. The interesting thing is that this network which has always been able to access moodle had a ISP change recently with a change of IPs, yet moodle access has been unaffected. I have been searching through discussions on the topic and looking through various tables and php config files mentioned looking for anything related but everything points to nothing being explicitly blocked or specifically allowed. So basically I have a remote host of moodle that only one network can access and I can't figure out how to open it up. Trying from various hotspots or other remote networks just result in a 502 bad gateway but I find nothing explicitly blocking or allowing access. Any recommendations on what to look into would be greatly appreciated.",

          "Text": "You probably heard by now of an extension for Firefox , called Firesheep, that is intended to highlight the problem of stealing session cookies. This is not a new exploit, just a new tool for doing it that has gone a long way in raising awareness of the issue due to its ease-of-use. I've come up with a Moodle handler script for Firesheep, so that you can easily demonstrate if your Moodle site is vulnerable to session cookie theft. If your users are likely to access your site over unencrypted shared media (e.g. public wi-fi hotspots), you ought to consider running your entire site through HTTPS. My intent in posting this handler script is to encourage adoption of HTTPS and, depending on your deployment, possibly to help you justify the cost of SSL accelerators, etc. to management. It is not my intent for you to use this for malicious purposes. It might not be perfect since I had no documented Firesheep API to go on, was too lazy to read all the Firesheep code, and have never done anything in JavaScript before. \n```text\nregister({\n    name: 'Moodle',\n    \n    matchPacket: function (packet) {\n        for (var cookieName in packet.cookies) {\n            if (cookieName == 'MOODLEID_') {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \n    sessionCookieNames: [ 'MOODLEID_', 'MoodleSession' ],\n\n    identifyUser: function () {\n        var resp = this.httpGet(this.siteUrl);\n        var logininfo = resp.body.querySelector('div.logininfo a');    \n        if (logininfo != null) {\n            if (logininfo.textContent != \"Login\") {\n                var userIdNum = logininfo.href.split('.php?id=')[1].split('&')[0];\n                this.userName = logininfo.textContent;\n                this.userAvatar = logininfo.href.split('/user/')[0] + '/user/pix.php/' + userIdNum + '/f1.jpg';\n            }\n        }\n        this.siteName = 'Moodle (' + this.firstPacket.\nhost\n + ')';\n    }\n});\n```\n I have also attached it as a file, if you want to just use the \"Import\" button in Firesheep instead of pasting.",

Firesheep happens to be a recently-publicized way to do it, but is not the only way. The reasoning behind having HTTPS for the login site is that the login credentials are then encrypted. So even though an attacker could steal your unencrypted session cookies, he/she still doesn't know your password because the password was sent using HTTPS. In many cases, this has traditionally been considered good enough. This is the behaviour that many large sites such as Facebook use by default. Arguably, it is increasingly becoming considered poor practice. Tools such as Firesheep provide a good example of why using HTTPS for the entire site is worth considering.",

On further investigation (looking at each HTTP request in the FireBug Net panel) I found that files requested over HTTPS were being cached, and 304 Not Modified responses being returned as expected in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th page loads.  Note that I have mod_expires configured as per the Performance guidelines . The other consideration to make is that enabling HTTPS will almost certainly impact on server CPU load.  We are planning to enable HTTPS as a trial at the start of next year and monitor this.

The problem Firesheep intends to highlight isn't just session stealing - it's the broader necessity for sites to be responsible with user's data, and the necessity for users to be savvy about how their data is transmitted. Moodle pages contain a lot of sensitive data, be it names and contact details, grading history, or student's work itself.  If this is transmitted over an insecure network (open WiFi, the Internet, etc.) then it can be intercepted whether the user's session has been stolen or not.  A certain amount of user education can help this by encouraging users only to access their data over secure networks, but the only way to guarantee security of users' data is end-to-end encryption using HTTPS (or possibly a secure VPN). Perhaps it would be useful to have a user-enabled option on login allowing them to select HTTPS for their session when accessing Moodle over insecure networks - this could be disabled when a user is on a secure network to take advantage of caching.",

Obviously the only 100% solution is to migrate the entire site to SSL, however I will not be able to do this until I have tested that the performance hit of doing this will not cripple the web server (making sure caching still works etc).  In fact, does anybody have any experience of this?

          "Text": "I don't know the settings of your system but at least that memory limit issue sounds like a false alert. The original advisory said: \"The memory_limit functionality in PHP 4.x up to 4.3.7, and 5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, under certain conditions such as when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by triggering a memory_limit abort during execution of the zend_hash_init function and overwriting a HashTable destructor pointer before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\" Too low php memory limit or a couple of other php/ server settings can cause troubles - moodle can stop responding or particularly IE (browser) can stop responding for various reasons and they don't mean an attack. For example administrator or teacher tries to take course backup from a very large course or user tries to paste directly a very large document from word to wiki... If your IPS drops regularly particular users or connections it might be good to check other logs of moodle and server to find out what actually happened. Another thing is that when people save something that is copied or uploaded from net or other programs you may sometimes find malicious links, worms/viruses, iframe attacks, injected images or direct attack attempts ... and sometimes false positive alerts. Moodle may have some vulnerabilities that nobody has noticed before (for example latest upgrade fixes several of them) but the links you gave can be considered \"false alerts\" - in my opinion... Server access logs, error logs and auth logs may show more info about bots or direct attacks from particular ips - and you might check once more that settings of http://docs.moodle.org/en/Security_overview are ok.",

Before using it, you must have created dynamic audiences with the rules that you want to apply to the visibility conditions you want to enforce. Let me use your example. You have to start by adding a custom field called \"Type\" within the user's profile. For user trainee1 you must add \"Trainer\" to \"Type\" and  \"Partner\" for user partner1. Then you must create 2 dynamic audiences, TRAINING and PARTNER, with 1 simple rule, that only users with \"Trainer\" or \"Partner\" on field \"Type\" respectively can be added automatically. Then, within course settings you must go to \"Audience Visibility\" and select \"Visible to enrolled users and members of the selected audiences\" and select \"TRAINING\" or \"PARTNER\" depending on the course. Because user trainee1 can only see courses visible to his/her audiences, courses within \"PARTNER\" category will be invisible and therefore that particular category won't be listed.

I'm unsure exactly how many, but looking at around 6000 at the most. Rather than setting up a username and password per person,  I'm hoping to set up one username and password which all the learners can log in with. I'm not sure yet how many people will be accessing the course at one time (it definitely wont be all all 6000) but I wondered - Is there a limit to how many people can access a SCORM package at the same time? And is there a limit to how many can log in at the same time using the same username and password? Thanks Andy",

I HIGHLY suggest you look at the ways of setting up individual logins - we've always used LDAP to manage our access for students and staff, but I think there are ways like bulk-uploading CSV with the basic details for each user. I don't believe there's a limit on the number of access for a SCORM per day in answer to that question.",

A non-editing teacher can see results and e-mailadress in H5P-activity by changing user-id in URL . I have a non-editing teacher and students in groups in course. Course is set with separate groups. The non-editing teacher access the Grades by the navigation meny in the course  to see the students results. By clicking the grade analysis button at a h5p activity, the score is shown, so is the students e-mail-adress. If the non-editing-teacher changes the user-id in the URL, the teacher will se the results and e-mailadress to an other user, that is not connected to this non-editing teacher, and is in an other group. When I try the same in a Moodle quiz, the non-editing teacher get the message: «You are not allowed to review this attempt.» Is this a known issue? Kind regards, Bjørn",

And there is non editing teacher in group 1. So I have submissions for both groups and activities for all students. When I am logged in as non editing teacher and I am on gradebook page I am experiencing this (see attached screen recording for Moodle 3.9): Teacher clicks 'Grade analysis' for grade for quiz for student in group 1 -> Teacher is on Attempt review page and see grade, user info etc Teacher clicks 'Grade analysis' for grade for h5p for student in group 1 -> There is permission denied page oddly Teacher changes URL to access grade for quiz for student in group 2 (so not his group) -> Teacher is redirected on review attempts for quiz for group 1 Teacher changes URL to access grade for h5p for student in group 2 (so not his group) -> There is permission denied page Not sure why I am getting permission denied for case 2.

In that case, it sounds like users were able to login after a few attempts. I'm not sure if you are seeing the same result, but the suggestion in that case was that perhaps there's a third party plugin somehow interfering with the login process. Failing that, how were the users given their password? For example, are they set using \"Generate password and notify user\" or manually generated and distributed? If manually, are they being set to \"force password change\", and if so, are they failing before or after the password is reset by the user? If the passwords are completely manual and consistently failing for the same users, is it possible the passwords distributed could be incorrect? Perhaps that can be confirmed/ruled out by performing a password reset on one of the users to see if it resolves the issue. If it doesn't, then it could identify that the password itself isn't the cause and this needs further investigation.",

There are probably a number of rules within mod_security that you can tweak to allow Moodle to function while mod_security is enabled but I am not aware of anyone that has spent the time compiling a list of the different settings that need to be modified - most people just give up and disable it. Many of the issues with mod_security relate to \"features\" in Moodle that cannot be easily designed to meet mod_security's default rule set without decreasing the functionality or completely removing the feature. If mod_security is really important to your site you might consider spending some time searching the forums for people that have modified other settings and you may want to experiment with the mod_security settings yourself. If you manage to compile a list of configuration changes please make sure you share them with the community so that others may benefit. Alternatively if you continue to have issues hosting your Moodle site you might consider asking a Moodle Partner to help with hosting or managing the hosting of your site.",

Yep, the issue was that Moodle is triggering the default configuration of mod_evasive for Apache. mod_evasive is a DoS Protection module. Relaxing the configuration slightly has stopped the 403's from occurring. For those interested, the following is our configuration, inside /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/evasive.conf \n```text\n<IfModule mod_evasive20.c>\n\n\n    DOSHashTableSize    5000\n\n\n    DOSPageCount    10\n\n\n    DOSSiteCount    100\n\n\n    DOSPageInterval    1\n```\n Hope this helps?

However ... 2 cents more ... to be used with caution ... some suggestions: Read: https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban A recommended approach ... ssh on the standard port 22 makes it an easy target as that is a well-known port. Consider setting up sshd to use a high un-registered port within the range of 49152 to 65535 Make sure port chosen is in the firewall of your system to allow and consider restricting access to that port to a single or range of IP addresses you use. Do a whois on that IP address. You will see: IF you have no customers (persons using your moodle) from that IP range (can be seen in mdl_user table - lastip), consider blocking the route shown above as that is a range of IP addresses in your server firewall.  See manual on your server's firewall for how to do that. lastb - show a listing of last logged in users Do you have a: lifengde or mingrui user in your moodle or in your system? Now your turn ... is this activity on your new server - the one with cPanel?   If so, consult with hosting provider .   If this activity is on old server ... the one with command line only ... then above suggestions apply but as I said before exercise caution as you don't have a panel on that server thus only one way to get to ssh on server. Sometime ago, I had suggested you install Webmin on that server ... it is a free perl based panel and could be your primary means of accessing.   It has a Terminal icon ... runs on port 10000 by default, but it's port could also be set to one of the high ports. Also note: on new server where you have cPanel, do not ... repeat DO NOT ... attempt to install webmin. 'SoS', Ken",

Name new student role based on organization c. Make no changes as of yet except allow context use in all areas 3) Create New Category and hide it 4) Manage New Category “Permissions” a. Assign newly created role to new category and\nallow hidden categories to be seen b. Save overwrite changes 5) Manage New Category “Assign Roles” a. Choose newly created role again b. Assign Users you want to be able to have access\nto this New category. 6) Done.

Doesn't prevent the 'access' bit you are looking for, and it's cumbersome, but hear me out: Lets say you have 2 managers (ManagerA and ManagerB) and you only want them to see their respective categories (ie. CategoryA and CategoryB). For the managers to see only a certain category, you'll need to hide both  categories (but not the courses within). Then duplicate the Manager role* per manager and append the name (ie. ManagerA, ManagerB). Now use these roles instead of the original Manger role to assign both managers at the site level. So instead of all your managers sharing 1 site role, they will all have their own (identical) role. So at this point, your managers will still be able to see all the hidden categories. Now, navigate to the specific Category(s) you want the that manager (ie. ManagerB) to NOT see and click on Permissions. Change 'See Hidden Categories' to Prevent for each manager role you don't want to see that category on the Front Page . Now, when on the Front Page, ManagerB will not see the CategoryA. *If ManagerB does a course search, then in the course search results they'll still see (and be able to enter) courses that were in CategoryA, so consider using some CSS to the hide the course search button.",

First, I thought that was an unfixed security bug, but I found this comment in Moodle code , and then I found this discussion on this forum . So, this behavior seems to be known. However, today, multimedia contents doesn't require anymore javascript to work, Flash is almost dead and all teachers are still not javascript experts. So, shouldn't we restrict javascript usage to administrators and only administrators ? Or at least, create an option / a permission for this ? What's your opinion ? Thanks.",

          "Text": "We have a policy in Moodle that, at the moment, all bug fixes go into 2.6 and 2.5 branches, and only security fixes go into Moodle 2.4. This means we need to know what is a security bug. At the moment, we seem to be implicit using the definition \"a bug that an evil hacker could exploit\", however, I am not sure that I agree. I actually have a text-book definition of what IT security is, thanks to the OU course M886 Information Security Management. Security is ensuring (as far as possible) the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information (that is important to your users). The next stage in the analysis is to look a threats (things that might compromise one of those things) and vulnerabilities (the weaknesses in your system (and that is the whole system, software + hardware + users) that might be a way that one of the threats can actually damage confidentiality, integrity or availability. OK, enough theory for now. Just note that a threat does not have to be some sort of evil hacker. It could be something like a power cut or hard disc failure, and the corresponding vulnerabilities would be not having a failover server , or a backup. So anyway, the suggestion I want to make is that our current definition \"bug someone could exploit\" is not quite right. For example, issues like An issue where some data is not written to the backup file correctly (e.g. MDL-44018 ), or where some incorrect SQL can corrupt other data, as well as the DB update it is supposed to do (e.g. MDL-34451 ) are security bugs, and should be fixed in 2.4 too. This then leads to a second point. At the moment, another part of the security policy is that all security bugs get held for integration until just before the next stable release. This is where the issue of \"bug someone could exploit\" is important. If a bug is exploitable, then delaying integration is correct. If, however, the bug is a security issue, but not exploitable by a malicious hacker, then we should be integrating it as soon as possible. So, in summary: we still need to track which bugs are exploitable, and handle the patches appropriately, but that does not mean that only exploitable bugs should have the fix back-ported to 2.4.",

Even though we are promising that security related issues will be backported one branch further than general bug fixes, this should not be a restriction for developers willing to invest their time with non-security issues. This happens rarely and usually only when there is a pressing need, so I don't think this sends an unclear message about what versions we support. We still need to have a distinction between a \"bug someone could exploit\" and other issues, though. The reason I say this is because we want to be as open as possible about the problems with Moodle, but we want to be responsible when it comes to reporting exploitable bugs, revealing them only after a fix has been released. If an issue is not exploitable it can be integrated as soon as possible, but such a fix may not become available in that trailing version until a minor release, simply because of the effort needed to maintain that version continuously when so little is being done there until a release is imminent.",

However, if that data could be further used as part of a data set for profiling someone, then possibly the answer is yes. GDPR Recital 24 discusses this issue where \"potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person\" would not be allowed. So if you were to add up all the various personal settings of otherwise anonymized Moodle user, could that be used with other data you have to then be able to re-identify them? To give an actual example, HTML5 Canvas fingerprinting in browsers works by collecting a combination of a number of hardware and software settings that at some point are sufficient to identify a user uniquely who then could be personally identified by combining that with other data. (Which is exactly the type of technique that Recital 24 is addressing.) So, the answer depends not just on what data you have in Moodle, but what other data you have in your organization about someone and to what extent that could all be subsequently combined to identify someone.",

So, it will depend on what the \"personal\" nature of the setting. Your theme example is a good one, or settings that are basic on/off or yes/no and are really generic. But just making a choice per se is not identifiable: it would depend on the context . I chose tacos for lunch today but so did millions of others around me. When I lived in India and had tacos for lunch, I was the only one among millions to do that. I've read interpretations of GDPR that subjective data can count as personally identifiable - if you have enough of them to be able to assist in re-identifying the person, which is easier if the choices are contextually specific and you have lots of them. For instance, for profiling. Is whether someone has Moodle forum emails as a digest or one at a time\npersonally identifiable? I'd say no by itself. But tags from user\nprofiles? Definitely on the personal side of things because it would be easier to infer a user based on the uniqueness of the combination. Assuming a normal not admin user, could someone guess it was your Moodle account if they had a collection of all of your user settings without the obvious personal items like location etc.?",

I am thinking about the more interesting case of anonymizing. For data integrity, I would prefer to anonymize anything I can before having to delete it. So, the question is, how far do you have to go to get something really anonymous? Use case that actually came up in conversation: multiple institutions want to combine anonymized course data for the training of analytics. If it is anonymous, you don't need consent, and therefore you can use older historical data and continue to add year after year -- if and only if it is truly  anonymous. Is just changing the usernames and other obvious profile information sufficient? What user fields could you keep as is? Do you need to change enrollment settings, user forum subscription settings, other settings including the course settings that teachers might have made, not just students? Etc. So the question \"is a setting personal data?\" matters a lot in that case.",

I am unsure about your teaching environment. In the college-level courses that I have taught, I have always included the teacher's name in the Syllabus. For the 12 years that I have been using Moodle, I have never shown the teacher's name within Moodle. It is always in the Syllabus, which each teacher is expected to manage and customize.  In the schools where I have taught, students who are not yet in a course can see who is teaching it within the school's course registration system. There might be a way to have Moodle automatically show the Teacher's name in a text and media resources. There's a plugin that allows one to use many internally defined variables (like teacher name and student name.). I forget what this plugin is called. Maybe Helen remembers.",

The first video only manges to 'hack' the example site because: 1. the system being attacked has a blatant SQL -injection vulnerability. 2. the system being attacked stores the password in the database as plain text. Moodle does neither of these things. Well, it is hard to prove that there is not an SQL injection attack anywhere in Moodle, but Moodle does two systematic things to prevent SQL-injection: a. all incoming data is filtered using the clean_param function to strip out undexpected input. b. values are substituted into SQL statements using prepared statements and placeholders. Moodle stores passwords in the database only after hashing them. If you have set a password salt in your config.php file, then it will be very hard for an attacker to reverse any strong passwords, and I hope your admin knows to choose a strong password. (There are two imporvements that Moodle could make to security: We could switch to a better hashing agorithm like Blowfish, and we could use a per-user salt in addtion to the system-wide salt. However, these would just take Moodle's security from Very, very good, to Excellent.) The more serious worry is session stealing or network traffic sniffing. The only real defense there is to use HTTPS.",

When I did a search on my system, I came up with an old plugin that made use of Red5 back in the day when it was using log4j (which is over 10 years ago). At one point, back in the CVS days, I liked the idea of being able to search all of the plugins for particular vulnerabilities. This would require a bit of scripting but I think the community could probably identify the plugins that might potentially be impacted and flag them. Again, just to be clear, Red5 reports that the current version is not affected by the log4j vulnerability.  If folks have any questions about a particular plugin, it never hurts to ask. I would be interested in seeing a list of plugins that would require Java to be installed on a server and then go through that list and ensure that they are unaffected. Peace - Anthony",

          "Text": "I would like to have some discussion / comparison about how people ended up implementing the GDPR plugins at their sites, and maybe have some questions answered in the process. Our implementation School: Austrian university with around 6000 active students Moodle: 3.4.3 Current Data policy / purposes: Users will be deleted after 1 year of inactivity No current policy on course content Problems / Experiences Since implementing the GDPR plugins and site policy on May 25th, we only had 2 data requests and no deletion requests from users We now have over 6000 inactive user accounts waiting for deletion, but I havent gotten around to actually deleting them, because I was hoping that the deletion lists get improved, or maybe get around improving them myself (see https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-62590 ). I don't want to delete such a massive amount of data without re-checking it, but the current list makes it impossible (cant export, sort, or display all on one page) - how have others handled this? Is there a good way to pull this data out of the database directly? We discussed setting a retention period for course content, but it seemed impractical to start deleting information from old courses that students can still access before they even finish their degrees - how have others handled this? what policies are you using? Questions Is there any exhaustive documentation on the GDPR plugins? I find the current documentation in the moodle docs severely lacking in depth, I couldnt find any answers to any of the questions below What happens if a user or course gets flagged for deletion, but afterwards the criteria changes, for example A user is flagged for deletion because he is inactive for >1 year, but then logs on again before he is actually deleted - does he get removed from the deletion list? Course content is flagged for deletion, but then the teacher changes the course end date so it is within the retention period - does the course content get removed from the deletion list? How exactly does course content deletion work? Does it really only delete personal data from activities ? What exactly gets deleted? Is there any documentation or list out there that shows exactly what gets deleted? What happens if all the personal data gets deleted from a course, the course is removed from the data deletion list, but then new personal data is added - for example, after a retention period of 1 year, all forum posts are deleted, but then a student goes back to that course and adds another forum post - will the course immediately show up on the deletion list again? What process actually deletes content after I press delete in the data deletion list? Does it get deleted immediately, or by the next cron job? Is deletion logged anywhere? It seems to me, that the whole implementation of GDPR right now is pretty bare and rushed, which is understandable, since everyone was in a hurry to meet the 05-25 deadline. Are further features planned or already requested or even needed by other persons, such as A usable data deletion list (see above) The possibility in the data registry to assign purposes / data retention periods to specific types of modules, for example assign a specific purpose to all quizzes in all courses? Thanks in advance for any input, I hope to get a good discussion going that benefits everyone, now that some time has passed after the general rush to implement the GDPR plugins.",

We have received a very specific request for \"D atabase encryption at\nrest.  This is not full disk encryption from a physical security\nperspective but we require file or field level encryption of our data.  If/when a cyber adversary gets on your back end\nnetwork and somehow exfiltrates the database, this must be encrypted \". I'm sure I can't be the only person with this query, but having trawled the forums there is not a lot of help around this issue - and certainly not much in the way of resolution.  I have read in this post here that encryption would be largely pointless when using Azure, as whilst the server is up and running the data is unlocked anyway - but I'm not sure how this might apply to our dedicated server instance.

You have to consider what threat/risk you are mitigating. It sounds like they are worried that someone will have access to your network, and have access to the database files, but won't have an SQL user credential or the ability to modify the moodle files to make it spit out the data anyways. That's a fairly narrow/specific threat, but I guess if that's what they require, that's what you can implement. Implementation details will depend on your specific database server software. Here's Microsoft's docs for SQL Server: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/sql-server-encryption",

I have installed the Moodle modules and run the diagnostics and everything is reported as being configured correctly. I have entered all of the relevant settings into the Google Control Panel and again everything seems to look OK. The problem occurs as soon as I tick the Enable SSO box. Once ticked the login redirect works, but it will no longer accept any combination of username and password. Untick the Enable SSO box in Google and I can log into the two systems separately again without problems. I have spoken to support at Google and they have suggested there is an exception on our server which terminates the SSO flow before sending the SAMLResponse. Any suggestions? I'd really like to get this sorted as we are secondary school and we plan to have this SSO up and running for the new term in September. Thanks in advance.",

When someone who is assigned to the CC role creates a course they are assigned to that course in the Teacher role. It is the Teacher role that provides the course editing permissions.

Of course any third party content (plugins,\nthemes, search engines or other software etc set up on your infrastructure) would need to be verified by server administrators to\nconfirm whether those may be affected in their instance. Tim Hunt has actually referenced Solr specifically in one of the other log4shell discussions as an example of something that should be reviewed. In any case, thanks for confirming this is one of the cases admins need to look into, hopefully this will provide some visibility to those who may be affected.",

I have seen others posting here with the same results and at a dead end with no further way to proceed further. https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=379216 I have tirelessly read EVERYTHING I  can find in the docs, forums and tracker. I know that this is new functionality and may have some gaps in the docs or a few bugs, but I am simply unable to produce any successful results with the most basic settings. I had been testing the data requests\nfunctionality on 3.6.1 as well as 3.6.2 and have found that a \"export\"\nrequest or \"delete\" request after being approved by the admin stays in a perpetual state of\n\"processing\". I have the data registries defined and have 'set' their defaults, or at least I believe I have done so correctly based upon the current documentation. So I'd like to help out with my end goal being to document a best practice with step-by-step instructions to share with everyone.  However,  I simply don't have any additional paths to test for a successful outcome at this point.

Most people have multiple devices they will access from, and potentially from multiple locations - a student could have a laptop and phone or tablet in use on campus, that's two IP's at least straight away, then if they access from home that's another one immediately (assuming they're using NAT at home). Then if they go to a friends place, or a cafe, they will run out of IP's straight away. Those IP's often rotate too, the rotation time can be short in the order of a day or two, or longer in the order of weeks, depending on a number of factors, none of which are in the control of the school. The point I'm trying to get to is that IP restrictions are not likely to be successful and will likely cause more problems than they solve. It should be more of a policy thing stating that only the owner of an account can access that account, and anyone else doing so would be reprimanded. Forcing password changes, while ultimately reducing security in a number of instances, could be one way to help.",

I've done various updates and improvements to the site and this has raised an interesting problem: In order to customise two \"groups\" of people, I set up two similar roles - call them role 1 & 2 for now - and made a few functions and configuration changes that work out what role they are in and produce different content (layout etc). Now - here's the problem... The different roles should have access to different courses. Some need to be automatically assigned, some do not. The way the site is designed is that users should effectly have privacy in their \"role's version of the site\"... For example - users i, ii, iii in role 1 should be auto enrolled to course a, b. users iv, v, vi in role 2 should be not be enrolled to anything by default, but may manually be invited to say - courses c, d, e. Having done a quick google and look around the forums, I suspect it's something to do with default role... BUT, can I control default roles and their subscription to courses? When I add a new user he has no site subscriptions, which is correct behaviour. It is ONLY when they get assigned to roles that they see ALL the courses (and hence private to their group content). To re-iterate what I've described above... I need to be able to auto enrol ONLY certain roles to a course.",

For a month now I have been seeing selinux alerts in my logs/messages file to the effect: SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/httpd from using potentially mislabeled files /boo t I have observed that these alerts occur simultaneously with page hits on any moodle pages (from the httpd access_logs.) I have only seen one other admin indicate that their moodle install was attempting to access the /boot partition on their server , so this is probably not a common problem (although one has to look in their logs to observer the problem, AND have SELinux set to enforcing). To be clear the moodle install is operational. We have upgraded this moodle instance since ~release 1.4 and have had SELinux set to enforcing since about release 1.6. The sole issue is the fact that this moodle install is attempting to access files in our /boot partition. And that this is a new alert (the first occurrence was on June 21st 2011). I have even run grep '/boot' on every file in the moodle directory (and moodledata) and found no matches (for '/boot'). Any thoughts?",

It appears that some versions of the plugin do not have a correct or complete implementation of the Privacy API, which is why you are seeing these errors.

I have raised an issue against the plugin on your behalf and hopefully Valery will be able to release an updated version of the plugin soon. In the mean time you can safely copy this file into the one listed in the error message. Best wishes, Andrew",

As of 2017/11/21, I believe that would be any version older than 3.1.9 or 3.2.6) 2. When it comes to \"risk management,\" what are the risks to fall out of the currently supported version? Let's say that if we are running a heavily customized Moodle 2.7.x instance, what would the risks of having the instance hacked by hackers, and how would you manage such risks (if you can not get your 2.7.x instance upgraded to 3.1.9 or above right away)?

Judging by the versions It looks roughly like 1/3rd of sites are 3.0.x or later at the moment. How many of those are 'mission-critical, enterprise-level' though is anyone's guess though I think. I'm not sure how many admins of sites like that would even admit to being out of date, since that also makes you an obvious target. 2) Look at the security issues fixed in the versions that are missed and extrapolate.. Are there serious remotely exploitable server busting type vulnerabilities fixed or is it something like a student being able to see other student's email addresses? For managing risk, you probably won't be able to do much to get around security/privacy level bugs in Moodle but should atleast harden your servers so that even if someone can run PHP code arbitrarily on your server, they can't get much other than Moodle data, which while still sensitive isn't as bad as getting remote admin on your servers and breaking into everything in your org.",

My aim is to find out, wether there are damages in the existing Moodle systems. A diagnosis so to speak... Of course I want to secure our server in order to prevent SQL-injections an other assaults.

I'd agree with Howard and say it's likely a vulnerability scanner, Acunetix does appear to be well used among script kiddies. It appears it simply hit a registration page filled in all the fields, and submitted it automatically. I personally believe Moodle has excellent SQLi protections, so without further evidence (such as WAF logs, or web server logs) I would find it hard to instantly attribute this data to an SQL injection directly.",

So for the example of Moodle assuming you are running the popular Linux Apache My SQL PHP stack ( LAMP ), they are a source of vulnerabilities. PHP runs about 80% of all web sites so there are huge numbers of people trying to break it and vastly fewer trying to break Moodle.  So to ensure that is as secure as possible you need to ensure you read security updates/patch information and that your system is up to date.

          "Text": "Here's the dilemma.  We have to send students to an offline course, but somehow record whether or not they passed the offline course in our Moodle LMS as well.  The offline course developer says they can provide a link at the end of the offline course which can go wherever we like, and suggested that we set that link to an unlisted web link which would trigger our moodle to generate a certificate at that time.  Since a student couldn't get at that link without completing the offline course, they couldn't find it by themselves.  Yes, it's not totally foolproof from a security standpoint (since theoretically a clever student might figure out that the link could be shared with someone else), but we believe that would be unlikely given the small number of students this affects. I know I can create an area in Moodle that, upon a student view, becomes automatically \"complete\".  I know I can auto-generate a certificate for a student on the condition of \"completing\" a certain thing.  So theoretically, if I had a way to create a page in my moodle course that was live but unlisted, I could accomplish this goal. As far as I can tell, however, a page or item in a course is either in \"show\" or \"hide\" mode.  When in \"hide\" mode, even a direct link will not show the content except when logged in as a master admin.  An \"unlisted\" mode is really what I'd be looking for, but I don't see anything like that. Does anyone know either (1) how to make an unlisted page as described above, or (2) any other way of accomplishing the goal of having an external site trigger a page view, completion, or cert gen?  (For example, a passcode shown at the end which could be typed into Moodle to generate a cert?)",

You can use the very same suggestion that John pointed out in courses with the Choice activity but you can then use the access restrictions on it to restrict it to a particular Group in the course. You can automatically have Cohorts synchronize into course Groups by using this plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/enrol_groupsync which is very good. So, make a Choice with the policies for Cohort A in it, restrict it to Group A, and use the plugin to create and synchronize the members of the Cohort A with the Group A automatically. Same for Cohort B, etc. The limitation of this method is that a user may have to do it in several courses, if you add it to more than one course. Since Cohorts don't have any \"space\" for the group (it's an enrolment method after all), inside a course is really the only place to do this.",

The site is hosted on a Network Solutions server (not recommened) with a usual enrolment of some 130-160 students. On the 7th of Jan new files were uploaded and the site appeared to be running file. Howeever by the 8th this error message was reported - Parse error : syntax error, unexpected T_CASE in /data/20/1/128/99/1780425/user/1925684/htdocs/moodle/index.php on line 8 Inspection of the index.php server log file reported it had not been modified since 28th March 2010, yet the contents accounted for only 20 lines of code. Compared to the origional file upoaded two years before it was obvioulsy diiferent, about 6kb rather than 12kb. after uploading the original index.php file with Cmod 6640 back into the server the site ran as expected - although other files, for example grader/index.php appear to have also been altered and student grades can not be accessed. The following day afer the upload the site returned to the error message and the index.php again altered. Initially I thought the site had been hacked (an http file had been uploaded four years ago with malicious code, which is why we turned to moodle) however I am confused as to why the server logs show no change - and my experience with hackers it that there is usually some purpose, this has none. So my question is, how can the script in index.php be rewritten? We are keep the site in working mode (rather than maintainance) to try to probe more errors - www.ieltsinternational.com/moodle/ Any help would be greatly appreciate, it seems we may be about to loose 3 years of work.

Of course - if you run this in a live scenario on a single box that everyone can access, be prepared for the first student to completely break the site - preventing your other students from being able to do much. Then you could create other scripts that provide examples for other issues - csrf/xss etc etc..",

There are few ways to do that, one of them being Profile field based cohort membership plugin https://moodle.org/plugins/local_profilecohort . You can create new custom role that can view particular reports and data that you need about students. Let's call that role Learning manager role. After that you can assign the Learning manager role to particular users from schools but in the context of their cohort (their school). In that way, they will have permissions to view the particular data and reports about students but only for students from their school (their cohort). I must admit I didn't tried that yet but hopefully it works. Please, if you try it, write here your feedback so everyone can read if this works or not. According to this example: https://docs.moodle.org/36/en/Learning_plan_viewer , it should work. Here you will also find step by step guide how to achieve what I have described but you will use different set of permissions (capabilities) instead of planview capability used in the example.

To change the site addresses I updated $CFG-> wwwroot to have the https address, I also set $CFG->sslproxy =1 and finally I ran the /admin/tool/replace to replace http://domain.com with https://domain.com . All seemed okay, the site loads, but we have teachers reporting issues. Now my teachers are unable to access any of the drop-down menus in the Navigation Blocks or Settings Block. When you click link  My Profile, for example, (or the arrow) nothing loads. The link highlights but the tree doesn’t expand. I decided to switch back to standard http and removed the sslproxy setting and all works as expected. I am unsure how to proceed, any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Seth",

So I'm trying to implement Moodle's mail-bounce policy as described in http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Email_processing#Enable_bounce_handling , but run into troubles. In my case, the Moodle installation has only an IP address (no domain name) and e-mail is handled by an external server : in cPanel, \"MX Entry Maintenance\" > \"Email Routing\" is set to \"Remote Mail Exchanger\". I don't know what to put in this part of the config.php: \n```text\n$CFG->mailprefix = 'mdl+'; // + is the separator for Exim and Postfix.\n\n\n$CFG->mailprefix = 'mdl-'; // - is the separator for qmail \n\n\n$CFG->maildomain = 'youremaildomain.com';\n```\n Should I ask the people running the \"Remote Mail Exchanger\"? Or as Moodle sends e-mail by it self, \"mdl+\" should be used to match Exim on my server? What about the domain name? Should I use the IP address? Any help will be much appreciated.",

What the lines send me to are other parts of the site vaguely related to, say, the Discussion Forum. But not necessarily. I also noticed when trying to edit the intro to the quiz paragraph on a Windows 7 machine with IE 9 a message at the bottom telling me there was a \"long script\" trying to execute and asking me if I'd like to kill it or something along those lines. Any idea what's going on here? I should mention that my course was transferred from another domain in I believe a slightly earlier version (though I'm not 100% certain about the version, perhaps it was the same). Any ideas what's up. Might my site be infected by whatever the others are talking about above or what you did? And the question is what to do about this. It's almost so bad that I'm tempted to change the wording in the quiz to avoid the unwanted links (which does work!), but that is very difficult in some cases.",

          "Text": "Dear all, We managed to upgrade+migrate our moodle website from 3.5 to 3.9 and from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04.1. The initial issues we got along the way, required a lot of tracing back, also considering that the former sysadmin left little or nothing documentation... The problem we are now facing is about configuring the new moodle 3.9 at best and to this regard, I searched the forum and found no other threads regarding moodle running on ubuntu 20.04: are we the only ones or moodle is better relying on other OS?. Our goal right now is to have clamav running as \"Unix domain socket\", as perfectly described here (thank you Mark Sharp ) but to no avail as the system denied the clamd daemon access to the /tmp directory despite all the workarounds were implemented as described by Mark. I don't want to set/try apache in PHP fast-cgi, so I am asking if there's something more I could try to fix the file scanning issue. **on the old system (18.04 and moodle 3.5) everything works as expected, but we are unable to replicate it on the 20.04. To recap, here follows what I have tried so far: 1) add the user (clamav) to the apache group (www-data) ---> no change 2) Tried the PrivateTmp=true in the /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/apache2.service ---> it works but overrides the security feature. 3) Tried re-enabling the PrivateTmp of the apache2.service and implemented JoinsNamespaceOf=apache2.service in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/clamav-daemon.service ---> issues shows up again. Each time I  changed the files/configuration, I have restarted clamav/apache. Please help us out to finalize the operation. At the moment, the only options are running the file scan via CLI or disabling the PrivateTmp for apache2. Thank you, Davide",

          "Text": "Hi everyone. I have questions concerning the deletion requests with plugins. I'm currently integrating the GDPR in my plagiarism plugin (through the Privacy API indeed). Everything works fine and as expected except when a user make a deletion request. It's not that it don't works, but there's something strange. As I said, the plugin is of type plagiarism. So, my plugin stores user data related to files attached to assignments, workshops and discussion's posts as well as the message / online text content. The point is, when a user request to delete all his data (function delete_plagiarism_for_user in my provider.php), everything is deleted from the plugin database except the stuff related to forums posts (the fields in the database linked to messages and files attached). As a reminder, the function delete_plagiarism_for_user has two parameters : the user id and the context where data have to be deleted. After a lot of tests and experiments, I finally understood that the problem was not coming from my function but from that context in parameter. In fact, it seems like contexts from assignments and workshops are given as a parameter, but not the contexts from forums (so it's totally normal that after deletion, there is still data related to forums posts in the plugin database). So, my questions are : Is it normal that the contexts in parameter don't includes forums ? Should I try to bypass it and delete the data from the plugin database anyway, or that's the way it's supposed to be ? I hope I've been clear. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.",

Using the data privacy plugin on Moodle 3.3.5, after making a DSAR as a user, and running the cron it hangs at: \n```text\nExecute adhoc task: tool_dataprivacy\\task\\initiate_data_request_task\n\n\n... started 09:38:58.

I accept that this maybe/likely is an issue with my instance of Moodle but something is causing this process to hang with no obvious cause that I can fix. Am I alone in this or has anyone else reported this issue? Moodle version: git pull as of this morning of 3.3.5. Moodle server: Debian 8 running Nginx and php-fpm5.6 Database server Debian 8 running MariaDB 10.1.32 (accessed via ssh tunnel from Moodle server) If I cant find anything - I am going to try a rebuild of a new virtual server and try again on 3.3.5 - and then 3.4 and see if either works ok for me.  I DONT want to go to 3.4 yet (plan to go to 3.5 over summer) as I don't want to install php7 on my production server mid year - so I hope that 3.3.5 can work.",

We currently don't have any debugging in there to show which plugin is executing (I have just created MDL-62371 for this). If you can, I'd suggest opening the privacy/classes/manager.php file, find the get_contexts_for_userid function, and add the following just after the foreach line: mtrace(\"Processing {$component}\"); Then run the cron task and have a look at the output. That should tell you where it's getting stuck and help us to track it down. The other thing you can do is to add look at your DB server and see what query it is getting stuck on. You mention that this is a test system, does that mean that the DB server is not well tuned?",

Thanks again for the debug code Andrew.   I think our issue is our tutors - who horde old assignments (this will have to change with GDPR ).   For Turnitin assignments I delete ALL assignments (after moving the current year to an archive server) and they have to recreate each year.  For standard Moodle assignments however they have some assignments that span multiple years and so I have not in the past been able to remove them on the year end rollover. Needless to say we probably have a \"LOT\" of assignments - probably at least half are defunct (likely many more).   The debug code not surprisingly is now stuck at \"Processing mod_assign\".   I will leave it running to see if it actually DOES finish eventually! I am going to have to address this issue with the assignments I think before we can use this tool.  For testing purposes, I may just delete all assignments on the dev server and ensure that there are no other issues but I think the issue is the amount of assignments. Just looked into this and there are only around 4000 assignments - but as they are reused each year and currently submissions are not cleared there are nearly 94,000 submissions so I expect this is where the processing bottleneck is.",

As it is currently the cron is still running from yesterday and is currently sitting on mod_lesson.   This one surprises me as I am not aware of our tutors using lessons much (seems I may be wrong!).   It is then progressing - but its taken several hours so far I am very interested to see how long it does take in the end.  Once it has finished I will repeat the process on another test server with a local database rather than a remote database over an ssh tunnel and see if the overhead is causing issues there.",

In some ways that is more secure. On the other hand, the system administrators you can afford to hire are probably less expert that one ones Siteground can afford, since they host many more sites and can spread the cost. To demonstrate that Moodle is more secure than another LMS, you would need to do a detailed review of all the code of both systems. (Is the other LMS even open source.) That is probably several person-years of work. So, basically, you can't do that. Moodle's approach to security is on two levels: First, general practices that make things naturally secure: the clean_param function for filtering input. Using placeholders to instert values into queries to avoid SQL injection. sesskey to protect against XSRF, ... Then there are specifics. Lots of bits of the code have been reviewed by different people. Particular security holes are reported to the tracker, and then fixed.",

I can explain that a little bit by mentioning that I work for a contractor English language provider at a university in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The deanship has a limited understanding of the web. Here is the LMS of a company ( MKCL ERA ) that is lobbying to roll out elearning for our students. We have used Moodle for a couple of years separate to the university domain , and have recently been proposing making it available to other courses within our Deanship of about 2,000 students; as an added value service provided by our company. I can't convince them to trust us, and one of the things is \"security.\" This security issue is presently being defined for them by the representative of MKCL, and he is a native Arabic speaker, I am not. My present quest is to simplify the subject and create some infographics to support our cause. One may say that we are also lobbying for business reasons, but that would be my company president, under my advisement. Profit and contract security is not my motive for retaining and further developing an elearning program with Moodle. I am in it for pure love of media, knowledge, and digital cultures. Once more, thank you for interacting and offering your suggestions. Have a great day!",

We are using LDAP for user authentification in Moodle, and I'm aware that there is an admin setting ( \"preventpassindb\") that allows caching of passwords in Moodle, which would actually be the default setting. If I understand this correctly, having the LDAP passwords cached would allow users to log into Moodle even when the LDAP server is not available, right? Unfortunately, a security audit of our IT infrastructure a few years back told us that caching all our LDAP passwords on the Moodle server is a security issue, and since then we disabled this, setting preventpassindb to YES. How do other sites handle this? Is it even any security problem at all to have the LDAP passwords cached?",

In the case of the LDAP authentication plugin, it is completely ignored. That is, cached passwords are never used. The LDAP server is always contacted for username/password validation. You might some success with some kind of LDAP caching proxy (maybe slapo-pcache from OpenLDAP project can fit the bill, but I have never used it myself). Saludos. Iñaki.",

(My thinking is that GDPR Article 25, Data protection by design and by default , requires this approach, since Teachers can communicate with students via Moodle, without knowing their email address.) However, I then discovered that if a Teacher exports course grades to a file, the email address is still included in the exported data anyway, which seems incorrect. It turns out that the Site administration > Grades > General settings > Grade export user profile fields field controls what data is included when exporting grades. This setting seems to take precedence over the Show user identity field, though it should be the other way around, I think. Administrators control both fields, but many might think like me, and believe that setting the user policy does enough to implement a desired policy.",

As I say, it's been working quite well. But now the spammers are using that form. (Even with captcha enabled and configured.) It just goes to the admin. But today, she got a phishing email. They used that form to determine the admin email address and sent the phishing email. I thought I would restrict that process to by adding \"Allowed Email Domains\". I can manage those and we can direct unusual email addresses to contact us. The Denied Email Domains would just be an ongoing battle. Now my problem. The \"Allowed Email Domains\" setting works well - but provides an error message below the email field. Which is fine. But it lists all the allowed email domains - which kind of defeats what I'm trying to do. Is there a way to prevent those email domains from showing?",

To edit it from the command line edit the line `$string['emailonlyallowed'] = 'This email cannot be used. Allowed email domains are: {$a}.';` to read `$string['emailonlyallowed'] = 'This email cannot be used. Allowed email domains are: {$a}.';` $a is the string that contains the list of email addresses that you want to hide. So if yo're not using English the text will be different but the variable name, which is what you want to hide, will be the same. This change will need to be made after each update. Note that Moodle caches these strings so your browser may not show the changes immediately. To disable the caches, in order to test, navigate to Site Administration > General > Language > Language Settings and uncheck Cache language menu and Cache all language strings . Re-enable once the changes are show in your browser on the signup page. To do it from the UI navigate to Site Administration > General > Language > Language Customisation . Choose your language and select Open Language Pack for editing . Once it's loaded click continue and choose moodle.php . In the search field called String identifier enter the text emailonlyallowed and click show strings. Change the text to \"This email cannot be used.\", ensuring there is no reference to the $a variable and click Save Changes to the language pack . This change will need to be made after each update but the export/import options will help here.",

          "Text": "Wow, sounds like you have some real problems... Without trying to sound patronizing or telling grandma how to suck eggs, I would suggest the following: OK, first things first, your ISP or network service provider should provide you with a modicum of security to begin with, and offer advice on how you can secure your sites. I would have to agree that no site is bulletproof, no such thing, but this seems a little lax. I would also seriously suggest that you seek some sort of further accreditation training in web site management/security, and while this won't necessarily fix the problem, or be timely enough to provide immediate relief, the longer term benefits would be much greater I suspect. Also, you may chose to use a CMS like Drupal or Joomla rather than WordPress. My understanding is that there are additional layers of security in those not present in WordPress. I have no idea if this is actually right or not, just from forums here and other places that indicate that either Joomla or Drupal may be a better option. I do know that WordPress has some really good things about it, but if it is presenting security problems, then change the tool. I don't know what the learning curve for either tool is, but I understand they both have community supports that would be willing to help. There is also any number of books and online learning support options available for either tool as well. I don't know what your web sites actually do, but if all you are doing is running a blog for one and a static web site for the other, then Moodle may be akin to hunting ants with a sledgehammer. I am sure there are any number of alternative tools that might be more attractive, but if security is the major issue, then Moodle may help far more than most of those alternatives. So far, we have seen Moodle being used from everything from a basic information kiosk, to a medical training program, in higher education, to actors discussing character development for a Shakespearean Company and hundreds of other uses I had not considered. Moodle will, more than likely, fill your requirements, but you may need to be very definite about what those requirements are. Anyway, I hope this gives you some ideas, in a positive spirit.",

WP and Joomla have improved to the point where keeping the core code up-to-date is trivial.   By that I mean those have a built in process to update built into it.   One button/one click updates that, so far, have been reliable and work. More often than not, with any open sourced web based app, it's not the core code that's vulnerable, but the addons/plugins.   And, both Joomla and WP also make that trivial to keep up to date ... but, there's the rub ... up to providers of the addons/plugins that are not part of core to keep their contribution up to date.  Same with Moodle. While I've seen others Moodle as a content management system before, it didn't last.   Moodle, while it is quite flexible, is still geared more towards teaching online and not the sorts of things a WP or Joomla does (better, I might add). So I'd say (bottom line), no to the question about using Moodle as a web site (content management system). 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

WordPress fixes security holes constantly. Not running the current version is like asking to be hacked. Make sure any plugins you run are also the current version. Also, check your plugins in the WordPress plugin directory. If the plugin was last updated years ago, it may indicate that no one is maintaining it and it might be contributing to your security problem. Run a good security plugin. iThemes Security for example (no affiliation here). Lock everything down as tight as you can handle. Less open attack possibilities = better security. As good as WordPress security is, it means nothing if a hacker can use the operating system, apache or php to attack your website. If this is your responsibility, make sure updates are applied regularly. If it's under the control of your hosting company, ask for their help is blocking these hacks. And if they insist on running older, vulnerable software, then take your business to another hosting company. I've had to do that once.",

          "Text": "Hi Neil, Permissions depend on your setup (e.g. mod_php or fastCGI). Minimal permissions (700 for /moodledata and 400 for /moodle) only can be realized in connection with fastCGI. I am using linux and my /moodledata-folder is located on an extra partition, too. Using linux it is possible to mount this partition noexec which means that no programms located on this partition can be executed. The PHP-/tmp-folder should be there, too. Maybe there is a similar mechanism when using windows. The /moodledata-folder in my opinion is the most critical thing.  If it  is possible to put executables there started through any kind of security leaks from moodle or PHP - not good - but the implemented moodle filters mechanisms are becoming rapidly better. Most rootkits require executables inside the /tmp-folder. You should have a look on mod_security for apache. With a good ruleset you can protect your installation before malicious code is even reaching it. regards,",

All CA providers do things similar, but not necessarily *exactly* the same so IF I've not answered the question, suggest you visit the CA's web site where you have acquired the CA and see if they have an FAQ/Knowledge base, etc. for customers.

Some details about both of\nthose cookies are included in the School site's cookie policy , which is linked in the page footer. The\nless important one is the MoodleID, which is just used to retain users'\nusernames for next time they want to log in. As mentioned in the cookie\npolicy, that's safe to remove. I can see that the rememberusername settings exists in Site Administration > Security > Site security settings, which\ncontrols whether the site stores a permanent cookie with usernames\nduring login. I have not tested it, but suspect that disabling that\nfeature would avoid that cookie being set. For\nthe session cookie - although you're not logged in, you are still using\nthe site as a guest user. The site is not read-only and a session\ncookie is therefore still required because there may be things you\ninteract with that need to be associated with your individual session\n(and session cookies are generally how websites achieve this). For\nexample, this ensures that if you change the language on the site (say,\nfrom English to French), that setting is retained when you navigate\nbetween pages, or if you return to the site later and your session is\nstill valid. It also means that any preferences etc only impact you, and\nnot everyone visiting the site as a guest (since they will all have\ntheir own session). Session cookies are also essential for users to be\nable to log in, so there is no way to avoid using them. I hope that helps answer your questions!",

Technically it should be possible as any user who's not logged in gets logged in as guest or \"authenticated user\" automatically anyway, so there's no need to save that information in a Cookie. Things like the language could be saved or asked to get saved after it was changed from the default for example. At login of course a Cookie needs to be saved but only then is it really necessary. Or is there a way to have a read-only start page after all?",

They all have similar configurations as far as authentication, they query LDAP on Edirectory, with a primary query to their contexts, and a root query that searches sub-containers. The issue is that it is querying the LDAP, I can see the traffic in a Netware DSTrace, and it is looking up the users, because if you put in an invalid user it says invalid user. When you enter a valid user you can enter either the correct password, or the wrong password and it still logs the user in. This is not affecting user accounts that are not set for LDAP. These accounts still log in correctly, and stop incorrect logins.\" I have never heard of this kind of thing before. Anyone out there have any ideas? Tim",

I would probably set up a new server and install the latest versions of Moodle/Joomla, Virtumart (make sure you don't install the old versions you are probably using) - I would also be tempted to isolate those 3 applications further onto separate servers - so that if you get hacked again it's likely only one of those systems that will be affected. If you have installed any 3rd party add-ons/plugins to Moodle/Joomla/Virtumart I'd check to make sure none of those are known to have security issues - there's a big warning about older versions of virtuemart here: https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/security-advisory-virtuemart-for-joomla.html Then I would make sure the main webroot file permissions are set on the new server to be read-only. Then after installing fresh/new copies of the sites I would use the tools' backup/restore facilities to transfer data from your hacked system to the newer system - but would suggest being very careful about this because it's possible that the code in your current site has been modified to include extra rubbish in the backup files. If this is all a bit much for you it might be better to start fresh and just copy/paste text/content into your new updated site.",

Am certain concentrating on just the web server and via the panels/tools you have available to you that route isn't gonna work very well.    To 'clean up' requires making sure the versions of the apps are highest/most secure and that any addons/plugins you have are also highest/most secure.   Plus, finding and eradicating the malicious files ... many of which probably 'look' like they belong, but don't, is a task best handled via command line in a bash shell. Example: an fgrep checking the access_log of web server looking for all log entries that 'POST' to a directory (like that of the Joomla). ﻿ fgrep \"POST /\"$1 /var/log/httpd/access_log |more and then inspecting any php file that looks out of place ... which means one has to know what files come with Joomla. See what I mean? :\\ Moodle is generally secure even if running out of date core.   Joomla is a different story. Gotta ask this: what's the version of Joomla? Is register globals on in PHP?  Turn that off!   Can see that in php info of Moodle. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

          "Text": "What both Ken and Dan have said are on the money, but my paranoia makes me take it a step further. Access to the server from the whole world needs to be stopped immediately; using the built in firewall restrict access to all services (web and shell) from ONLY your IP address to allow you to get access and backup the data needed to restore to a new server. Nothing on the existing server can be trusted any longer, especially database and web-directory content - meaning you will need to be VERY careful when restoring. Make sure you start from known-good sources from the vendors, and check everything. To me it sounds like someone had (but probably still has) shell access; meaning they have likely established persistence and even if you update the software on the existing server to versions which are not vulnerable to external attack, this means they will continue to have access at will. This could be via a .php file installed on the system in one of the virtual hosts (likely not in an obvious location), or via a backdoored binary in the system. Through local privilege escalation vulnerabilities the attackers will likely have root access. Given you have had attackers on your system, this means all passwords on the system are compromised - including all your Moodle users, all the usernames/passwords stored in Joomla and VirtueMart and if they had root or sudo access your local SSH/shell accounts are all compromised, too . Do not use ANY of the same passwords on your new server. You MUST advise your users ASAP that their data has been compromised so they can take steps to change their passwords and to protect themselves. If you accept credit card payments there may be additional, legally required, steps you may need to take as far as PCI compliance goes (I'm not sure about the laws where you are, however). Depending on the size of your organisation, and if you really want to know how they got in and what they did, you could contract a security company to do incident response - but if you've deleted files already it might be too late for that. Good luck. Not a nice thing to go through.",

In my case, sometimes it was the application software or plugins, but when Moodle was getting hacked it was because PHP had security holes in it. My web host was so unhelpful, informing me that if I needed a different version of PHP, I'd have to install it myself. I have since moved to cloud servers where I control the versions of everything and can upgrade quickly when there are CVE's in various server components. So, since you're on a dedicated server, make sure you check the versions of server components in addition to the application software. If the server components have holes, there is likely nothing the application is going to be able to do to prevent hacking.",

IF the malicious stuff is a spam bot (which is what I helped clean up on a server hosting WordPresses and Joomla's  in Sept of this year) .... those aren't near that bad .   The php files just distribute spam ... didn't inject any data into DB. If hit by one of those ... turn off/block outbound port 25 for a while ( SMTP ) - that's a PostFix/Sendmail/FireWall thang). I had the help of SBL ... they had a notice link for blocked EMail with a link to the malicious spambot file.   Inspecting the file found they were NOT part of any of the Joomla code but a file dropped into random locations and used names such that one looking at files might think such a php file should belong there.    So I unzipped (locally) a Joomla package and then created a reference .txt file of all the files contained there in (ls -lR ./joomladir/ > allfiles.txt).  I then used that allfiles.txt as a reference for what one shuld find in directories (note: in this case most the Joomla's on that server were generic ... none or very few additional addons/plugins added. I did one of two things to the \"infected\" files when found: 1. deleted the file ... then re-created a .php file by same name replacing spambot code with a warning that the IP address has been recorded (little addition to the file dumped IP address accessing the file to a text file) and an auto-forward to Govt site that had info on computer crimes - just in case there was an actual human behind this access. 2. just put the word Caught! in there .... and then ran nightly script that parsed apache access logs by that file into a text file for easily seeing the IP address.   Then blackholed not only the single IP address, but in some cases, the entire network from which it came. Did upgrade the Joomla ... removed third party extensions not used and locked down the files/directory permissions. Did monitor the system ... just for access to those 'malicous' (now harmless) spambot scripts and would blackhole immediately the IP that was accessing ... as long as it wasn't SBL checking. In the end ... cleaned up ... didn't have to rebuild ... but like I said before ... took time ... and one had to have a level of access to the file system itself to do it.

New OS, new copies of all installed web apps from trusted sources (from vendors, not from backups), data restored from a known good backup (yes, with possible data loss as data added recently is compromised). If I need to explain this in detail for OP, then I would suggest running a server is not a good idea, and it should be left to professionals. That may sound harsh, and it probably is a touch, but at the end of the day these are things that need considerable skill to manage and maintain and the risks of putting services online are often not known or understood by amateurs. The only reason I raised my background was that I thought it might be important to clarify why I made the recommendations I did, and that they have been made from a best practices perspective in a large Uni environment, from someone who is passionate about InfoSec, and involved in that community. I wasn't trying to start a pissing contest. I actually neglected to mention my experience in the penetration testing space (both in CTF and testing our own internal applications) where, with permission from the owner of an application or server, it is literally attacked using many of the same tools the bad guys use to try and compromise the server or application. This allows us to find the same vulnerabilities they would find, and fix them before they're found by the bad guys. White hat hacking, if you wish to give it a hat. I believe removing the malware and trying to move forward from there is incredibly dangerous and, in my experience as a sysadmin (before I was a developer), this approach results in an unstable environment that can never, ever be trusted again. These are often then compromised again, as we have seen in this case, the attackers often maintain persistence by leaving a backdoor in a hidden place (in an existing file, hidden directory etc..) I'm also yet to see anyone else mention the users and their data. That of all this is the most disappointing thing to me (and I'm sure to them if they knew!). Even if the server was cleaned up (which I don't recommend) there has been unknown malicious users on the system, they have likely exfiltrated the data from the applications (especially if there is credit card data around) and either on-selling it or using it for other purposes. So at the end of the day, this is really just a difference of opinion - but it just so happens InfoSec is just one area I'm incredibly passionate about, have considerable skills in, and firmly believe that in situations such as this that the worst case should be assumed. You're a valued member of the Moodle community Ken, please don't take any of my comments as an attack. They're not intended that way. Thanks",

One thing for sure ... OP is learning how to admin a server.   Sometimes, new OP's have to learn taking the long route and lessons learned are painful but ....   Would agree that the OP needs to inform users of the event and make recommendations users change their passwords - or force users to change password via Moodle (as OP should do also).

          "Text": "Hi, I've never tried it with several forests, only with several domains in the same forests, so it might or might not work. The trick is using a global catalog server as the LDAP server Moodle uses, and query the Global Catalog service instead of the LDAP service. See http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/LDAP_authentication#Using_a_multi-domain_AD_environment for some details. I've never used NTLM SSO with a setup like that, so I can't say whether it'll work or not. To start with, NTLM doesn't work if you have users with the same sAMAccountName in different domains, as it's unable to tell them appart (doesn't use the domain part at all). You could overcome this using SSPI/Kerberos instead of NTLM, but the setup is a bit more complicated. A second option worth exploring is using the SAML authentication plugin against ADFS. I've never used it myself, but several people in the forums have talked about its possibilities. A third option is keeping the same strategy your client is using right now: have several LDAP auth plugins, each querying a different LDAP server. There's a patch to the standard LDAP auth plugin (maintained by me) to do this. I currently have versions of the patch for Moodle 2.2 onwards. I publish new or updated versions from time to time in a forum discussion here at Moodle.org. If you don't find it or don't find the version you need, feel free to send me a private messege here on Moodle.org. Saludos. Iñaki.",

The plugin approval process in Moodle undergoes a detailed review to ensure that all best practices for development and security are followed. For this, there is clear documentation on how to contribute plugins, which you can check out here: Plugin Contribution . There, you’ll find a comprehensive guide on the necessary steps to submit and review plugins. Additionally, there is a specific checklist for validation, which analyzes various aspects such as security, functionality, and compatibility. You can review the items in this checklist here: Plugin Contribution Checklist . If you’re interested in seeing how this process works in practice, the Moodle Tracker is an excellent place to follow plugin reviews in real time. For example, here are some recent cases that showcase how these analyses are conducted: CONTRIB-9761 CONTRIB-9743 In these discussions, you’ll see how Moodle reviewers evaluate submissions and provide feedback for necessary adjustments to ensure the quality and security of plugins before their approval and publication. I hope this information helps you better understand the process! If you have any questions or need further clarification, I’m here to help! 🚀 Eduardo Kraus Teacher and programmer",

For example I have had feedback on my plugins from someone who is the maintainer (or possibly co-maintainer) of around 18 plugins, has contributed over 1000 commits to core Moodle and has been accessing this site since 2004, and works full time for a Moodle partner (reviewing plugins is not his main job) . Another reviewer who has looked at my code first posted on this site in 2012. I am not aware of any specific selection mechanism. I believe it is possible for anyone to contribute to the MDL tickets in the tracker which would make you a peer reviewer. However review requires a deep knowledge of the standards there are things that \"would be nice\" but are not mandatory, and there are things that break the expectations because of the history of the code. For example standards suggest that a question editing form should be in the classes subfolder. However because of 20 years of development history it is acceptable to put them in the root of the plugin folder. My understanding is that the primary purposes of review are to ensure the quality of plugins and not to follow arbitrary standards for their own sake. To give you an example of feedback from a review, I am an experienced developer but a recent submission caught a subtle issue with possible \"namespace clashes\" in the future. So the plugin was well tested and would almost certainly work on any Moodle setup within the given version name, but there was a possibility of problems with a yet unknown plugin. So of course I worked on modifications to address that issue.",

          "Text": "The Same Origin Policy ( SOP ) is the policy browsers implement to prevent vulnerabilities via Cross Site Scripting (XSS). In other words, the browser would not allow any site to make a request to any other site. It would prevent different origins from interacting with each other through such requests, like AJAX . This policy exists because it is too easy to inject a link to a javascript file  that is on a different domain. This is a security risk - you really only want code that comes from the site you are on to execute and not just any code that is out there. The Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is one of the few techniques for relaxing the SOP. Because SOP is \"on\" by default, setting CORS at the server -side will allow a request to be sent to the server via an XMLHttpRequest even if the request was sent from a different domain. This becomes useful if your server was intended to serve requests from other domains (e.g. if you are providing an API). JSON with Padding is just a way to circumvent same-origin policy, when CORS is not an option. This is risky and a bad practice. Avoid using this. If you want to bypass that restriction when fetching the contents with fetch API or XMLHttpRequest in javascript , you can use a proxy server so that it sets the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin to *. If you need to enable CORS on the server in case of localhost, you need to have the following on request header. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:9999",

(Note: If yourself, or anyone reading this did happen to find some evidence of this being exploitable, please report your findings via our Security Submission Form , and we will investigate further). To answer your questions: 1) Though there does not appear to be much risk in waiting for this to be introduced into core, I think theoretically you could upgrade it yourself, but be aware that the next time you upgrade the site that change may be overwritten (so you might have to repeat the process). As far as I could tell from a quick look at the diff between the versions, there don't appear to be any breaking changes introduced within the library itself moving from 2.3.5 to 2.3.7 (but I'd suggest verifying that yourself before attempting any manual upgrades). 2) Yes, we are planning to upgrade the included library to 2.3.7.",

The story behind this is, that we needed to change the path, so we can access moodle from internet as well. So, we added code to config file- see attachment, and it does work. But the cron somehow doesnt like it. Please let me know if there is a way to fix it.. either altering the code or changing the way cron runs. Thank you",

Your permissions are 755. This means that only the user who owns the 'theme' folder can upload to it. Which user owns that folder? Is it the user you're using to FTP the files, or is it Apache 's own user (depending on the distro, it could be wwwuser, apache, www_data) I don't use FileZilla (I use Transmit for FTP), but somewhere in the file or folder's properties, you should be able to see the user that owns that folder. If it's not the username you're using to connect, that's why you can't write. If this is your problem, your best bet is to add the Apache user and your FTP user to a group, set that group to own the folder, and set permissions to 775. The cowboy fix is to set the folder to 777, upload the files, and then change it back to 755. You must remember to set the permissions back. Leaving anything set to '777', especially the theme folder, means that any security issues in Moodle will leave your site vulnerable to people maliciously changing code. We've seen it happen.",

          "Text": "Hi Sa Ku, To me, it sounds like what you want is a 3rd party streaming video service provider. Video served from a Moodle installation uses progressive download. This means that the entire video is downloaded into the user's browser cache and the user can view as much of the video as has been downloaded so far. This protocol is very easy to copy videos from. Additionally, progressive download from Moodle's file system is very demanding (Moodle's media serving is quite inefficient) and takes up a lot of memory. It's more efficient and less likely to overload your Moodle installation if you serve videos from outside of it. A media server uses a different protocol (RTMP) and serves short sections of video as and when they're requested. The user never has the entire video in their browser cache. This protocol is more difficult to copy videos from but there are multiple browser plugins that will save video to the user's file system, thus creating a copy. The most secure option is to use a media server and encryption, i.e. the sections of video are encrypted and temporarily decrypted during viewing. This often requires proprietary software installed on the user's computer/device, known as Digital Rights Management ( DRM ). This is the most difficult to copy but it's still not impossible: Visit any pirate video site and you'll find that everything's available as soon as it's been streamed/released. So the question is, how willing and able your learners are to make copies of your videos? When you've decided, you can shop around for a media service that suits your needs. I hope this helps. Matt",

The bottom line is, it's really difficult (impossible?) to prevent users from copying materials that are broadcast. Also, for each measure you use to try to prevent it, you're likely to make the video difficult or impossible to view on more computers & devices, which can be frustrating & disappointing for users, especially if they've paid for it. Then there's the increased costs in providing additional IT support for more users who are experiencing technical difficulties with viewing the video because of the DRM. Oh, and video streaming doesn't work well on slow &/or intermittent internet connections, e.g. public WiFi & people who live in remote areas. In these cases, progressive download is more reliable.

Further nothing happens anymore. At other times, I again see a barely filled page where I can tickmark the \"I am not a robot\" text. Forever. The most annoying one, however, is a collection of low quality pictures from which I have to select those which belong to a (for me as non native English speaker) vague definition of something like traffic sign or shop window. Do the letters below the sign belong to the selection or not? Is the entrance of a workshop including a window, a shop window or not?  Although, I do my best to select the right pictures, I fail forever .

Couple of follow up questions I have: Understanding security issues can be identified by someone creating a bug, are there any proactive ways Moodle identifies security threats through any sort of security tests that you run as part of major/minor release deployment? For moodlecloud, is there anywhere that documents which patches have been applied?  Assuming the responsibility of patching/upgrading moodlecloud for each instance is the responsibility of Moodle's moodlecloud team and not each site owner is this correct? If after all of this, our corp wanted to run a Vulnerability Assessment on moodlecloud ourselves, is that an option? I appreciate the fact that a VA only gives a certain level of confidence at a given point in time and its code testing code. Thanks again!",

          "Text": "Hi Monty, Not a problem. Regarding your follow up questions: There are several stages within both our general development cycle and release process which aim to proactively identify any implementation problems or bugs. These aren't specifically security threat based (such as an automated threat analysis tool), but checking for security risks does form part of their scope, so where possible we can identify and rectify any issues prior to them being released. Detailed information about the development process is covered in the process documentation , but here's an outline of the relevant stages where security issues will ideally be proactively identified: During development of all issues, the assignee will write manual testing instructions, automated testing, and where applicable, both. Automated and manual testing is run at various stages in the process, which confirms any new automated testing is successful, any additions do not break existing functionality, and changes are working as intended. Major releases also go through a manual QA testing cycle to ensure features are still working as expected in the latest version. (The testing documentation has more details on each of those if you'd like to learn more). A peer reviewer (another developer) will then check the code and testing for errors. In addition to things like code syntax and structure, they are also looking for logic issues, missing test cases and so on, including anything they identify as a security risk (such as missing permissions checks, missing test cases etc). They will usually also perform some testing of the changes. The next stage is integration review, which is performed by a senior development team. This also includes reviewing (by a highly experienced Moodle developer), with the addition of looking at its impact on Moodle as a whole, and confirming no conflicts with other code also being integrated. Finally, the changes are passed to a testing team (or further developer), who perform any manual testing included on the issue, checking everything is working as expected in all affected versions. Issues won't progress to the next phase of the above until the current one has been signed off by the relevant reviewer/tester. In terms of testing security fixes themselves, these are performed twice; once when the patch is first completed, and again in the week prior to release when being integrated into the final build, to ensure the fix still works as intended, and no side effects are identified. You are correct, the HQ MoodleCloud team take care of patching and upgrades within MoodleCloud. They don't specifically publish a list of the patches that have been applied, so you won't be able to confirm which issues have been manually patched prior to an upgrade, but as a site admin you would have access to view the current Moodle version, so looking at the previously mentioned publication of security fixes, you can see which fixes were applied in the current version. Since MoodleCloud is a production environment, I wouldn't recommend running a vulnerability assessment there, since it may inadvertently impact other users of the service. In the first instance, if you would like to perform a VA on the Moodle LMS itself, I'd suggest downloading a copy (or cloning with git ), and installing it on your own test servers (or local machine) and assessing there. However, if there is anything you have in mind that would specifically require testing on MoodleCloud, before you do so, please send those details to the security inbox (security@moodle.org), and I will forward them to the relevant manager to review and get in touch with you directly. Also keep in mind if you do run a VA on your own instance of Moodle, that generally automated testing has produced a lot of false positive results in Moodle, so the results will need some manual analysis (I've posted some information about this and some common false positives you may find helpful in another forum post ). If you do have any specific concerns within the results, please also don't hesitate to send me the examples to security@moodle.org, and we can review and discuss them further. Thanks!",

I need anonymity as I have mixed ages and parents - I want them to be able to participate without knowing the names or seeing the profiles of other students - in most scenarios usual settings work out fine, however in forum posts full names are visible and I cannot see how to hide them. I am looking for either a way to create an alias name or another clever workaround at achieving total anonymity in forums.

I had them as lowercase in my CSV file. Solution: Using the PHPMyAdmin tool on the hosting site, changed all country codes to uppercase using the following SQL : UPDATE mdl_user SET country = UCASE(country) After making this change users were able to login without issues. While the Moodle documentation (shown below and found here ) hints at it with the text, I didn't get the hint. Should state explicitly that country must be UPPERCASE (for slow people like me) Country- use a country TWO LETTER CODE",

          "Text": "One of the most common security issues that we see in Moodle sites is profile spam . Profile spam is primarily a problem on sites with the combination of these two settings: email authentication is enabled , allowing people to self-create an account on the site the admin setting forceloginforprofiles is disabled , allowing anyone to see and link to user profiles Some older versions of Moodle had these as default. The problems with these settings is that spammers can create a page on the Moodle site which they can fill with links and pictures of porn and other nasty stuff. This in turn comes up in Google searches for those things, and is used to boost ratings to porn sites or hacking sites designed to take over your personal computer. Note that this content is designed for people using search engines, and is usually not available from within the Moodle site itself (since spammers don't join any courses) so users and admins are usually not even aware their site is having this problem. Please pass the word to all Moodle admins that you know to check these Moodle site settings and make sure their sites are not vulnerable to profile spam. Email authentication should be disabled if not needed, and if it can't then forceloginforprofiles should definitely be enabled. Please also use our spam-cleaning tool to scan your site to find affected profiles and delete them. This page in the docs has more details: Reducing_spam_in_Moodle or ask for help here.",

          "Text": "I can not discuss any details of this, for obvious reasons, but the issue revolves around the legal culpability of what the analytics does. The situation involves multiple companies in multiple jurisdictions (including the EU) with various contracts in a industry regulated somewhat differently country to country. Basically, they want to uncouple the entire analytics engine from Moodle, but it can not be easily removed as it is not a proper plugin; there's no master on/off switch; no tool or documentation about removing the data; and honestly, I got no help in figuring that out --- these were all red flags to my client that Moodle has not thought this through for the various scenarios it might be used in, but rather, as one person put, just \"assumes that educational system attitude that they can do whatever they please with student data.\" The product they are going to use instead is from a corporate vendor (that I had never heard of before) that has an analytics engine but it is a distinct package and product that works independently. You can use it or not, and you when you do, you have a lot of control over what it does. Now, the client lawyers disagree strongly with the view this is just reporting, as Emma says. This is not just reporting, this is algorithmic: it learns and changes its decisions based on how it is trained and it also changes as it augments its training based on the ongoing data. It is not just reporting, it's doing more than that, it's analyzing. And that brings up a big legal red flag for the client due to their situation because someone somewhere has to own the responsibility for that, with a contract. Consider this scenario: the algorithm improperly or inaccurately flags a student as having issues, this influences teacher and school attitudes and decisions, the student drops out, burdened with debt. Later, under GDPR right to view, the student find this out. The student sues. The teachers clamor, \"It wasn't us, it was the algorithm!”  The lawyers arrive…. Student, data, and teachers both employee and contract, are in different countries with different laws in and out of the EU, different companies, different contracts, and so forth. So, who's responsible for what? The answer is: you don’t want to be put into that situation to begin with ;) Call it FUD if you like, I call it prudence. They want full knowledge and control of these aspects of analysis so they can meet various and sometimes conflicting contractual and regulatory (including GDPR) obligations. If Moodle pushes things into core that cause legal complications for a user, then the safest course may very well be, as in this case, for the user to choose another product. Analytics is a minefield of privacy and legal issues, with somewhat differing minefields for different users. I guess what it comes down to is my client is not confident that Moodle can help them cross their particular minefield. And from what I have seen to date, I would have to agree.",

The questions are filled out during registration and then the student answers them again at various points throughout the course to confirm that the person sitting at the keyboard is the same one who registered. The way I have it setup using the user profile custom field options works great except that the user can go back and see the answers to his authentication questions in his profile. Although prohibiting them from seeing their profile answers doesn't seem to be a requirement, it seems to violate the spirit of the idea. Thx.",

          "Title": "Comment request on vulnerability results",
          "Text": "Hi everyone, One of our clients ordered a vulnerability assessment of the Moodle installation delivered. The third party company gave the client the following results that I would like your technical opinion and advice. Vulnerability Name Description Impact Recommendation Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information through SSL We have observed that the Web site transmits sensitive or\nsecurity-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that\ncan be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Many communication channels\nsuch as the SSL protocol can be \"sniffed\" by attackers during data\ntransmission. A malicious user could perform Man in the middle attack and\nintercept the traffic between a legitimate user and the Web site\nthus access the sensitive data that are being exchanged in clear\ntext, thus breaching the confidentiality of the data. You should consider encrypting the sensitive data being transmitted\neven in the case that the channel of transmission is Secure\n(SSL/TLS). By using SSL only, an attacker could still perform a\nMan-In-The-Middle attack similar to the Beast threat and obtain the\nsensitive information. Please note that SSL has been removed as example of strong\ncryptography and can no longer be suggested as a security\ncontrol. You should therefore consider disabling SSL entirely and migrate to\na more modern encryption protocol, which at the time of publication\nis a minimum of TLS v1.1, although you are strongly encouraged to\nconsider TLS v1.2. Also note that not all implementations of TLS\nv1.1 are considered secure – refer to NIST SP 800-52 rev 1 for\nguidance on secure TLS configurations. HTML form without CSRF protection We have identified a form submission at the remote Web Site that\ndoes not implement protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery\n(CSRF) attacks. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack which forces an end\nuser to execute unwanted actions on a web site in which he/she is\ncurrently authenticated. By leveraging this vulnerability an\nattacker can compromise end user data and operation by inheriting\nthe identity and privileges of the victim user to perform undesired\nfunctions on the victim's behalf to the remote Web Site. These\nfunctions are executed without the user's knowledge, either\ndirectly (tricking user to click a link containing the action to be\nexecuted) or by utilizing a Cross-site Scripting flaw. You should enforce the \"Referer\" and “Origin\" HTTP header\nchecking in the remote Web Server as a matter of priority. You should also implement a CSRF filter which can intercept\nresponses, detect if it is an html document and insert a token into\nthe forms and optionally insert script to insert tokens in Ajax functions. Please refer to the following articles for information on the\nrecommended remediation options: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-SiteRequestForgery(CSRF)PreventionCheatSheet https://www.owasp.org/index.php/.NetCSRFGuard Weak Algorithm for HTTP Session Cookies We have observed that the application running on the remote host utilizes a custom \"SecurityToken\" within a cookie to identify a\nuser's session. The token is generated using a predictable\nalgorithm while the generation mechanism increments the value\nnumerically. The \"SessionToken\" cookie is Base64 encoded.We have\nidentified that the Web Application does not employ data integrity\nchecking on the parameter values exchanged between client and\nserver, thus allowing the modification of sensitive application\ndata, such as user credentials and permissions, organization unit\nand authorities. An attacker who can request the page can decode, observe and\nreverse engineer the algorithm easily since the session identifier\nis generated and set when the logon page is loaded and Base64 can\nbe trivially decoded.Several application security tools have\nspecific functionality designed to discover and exploit this\nvulnerability.An attacker may perform a man in the middle attack\nand intercept the traffic between hosts connected to the network.\nThis will allow the attacker to manipulate the application data\nincluding the viewstate information and thus breach the integrity\nof the information. It is recommended to utilize an existing session management\nlibrary. The simplest method of implementing a session management\nmechanism for a given application is to utilize an existing session\nmanagement library. These libraries have undergone a degree of\npublic scrutiny and conformance testing. Most development\nframeworks and languages offer such mechanisms.ASP.NET provides a\nnumber of libraries to maintain user state, the most powerful of\nwhich is session state. This feature provides a convenient\nprogrammatic interface for associating arbitrary application state\nwith a user session, and securely handles back-end state storage\nand client session management for the application.If the use of the\nASP.NET session state features is not possible then it is suggested\nthat you re-engineer the application to use session identifiers\nthat are opaque, unpredictable, and are unique references to\nserver-side state in order to help prevent session hijacking. Web Parameter Tampering attack An authenticated malicious user can leverage this issue to read\nthe Web Application data, or execute a number of commands in the context of that user for unlimited time. You should implement a hash algorithm for the integrity checking of\nthe information exchanged between client and server such as the one\nprovided by the Message Authentication Code (MAC) feature of the\nASP.NET framework.The MAC protection mechanism can be applied for\neach web page through the directive \"EnableViewStateMac\" or through\nthe application’s web.config file using the below coding:<%@\nPage EnableViewStateMac=\"true\" %> Session Fixation vulnerability We have identified Web Application pages vulnerable to Session\nFixation (Session Identifier \"SID\" Reuse) attacks via HTTP POST\nRequests. Authenticating a user without invalidating any existing session\nidentifier allows an attacker to steal authenticated sessions.A\nremote attacker can leverage this issue to access the Web\nApplication's data by using a Web Session Identifier associated\nwith a user. After successful login on the Web Application, an\nattacker may read the contents, or execute a number of commands in\nthe context of that user. When using cookie-based session state, the Web Application\nframework should not allocate storage for session data until the\nSession object is used. As a result, a new session ID should be\ngenerated for each page request until the session object is\naccessed. I would like to give some information on the security settings already implemented before the vulnerability test. a. Moodle runs completely over TLS (1.0 or higher) b. Secure cookies only enabled c. Only http cookies enabled d. Password policy and lockout enabled Could you please give your opinion on the following: 1. How technically correct are the findings? 2. Is it possible to implement the recommendations on Moodle? 3. Can the recommendations (especially session regeneration on each page) be implemented on any elearning platform without breaking basic functionality like popup usage or Flash and Java Applet usage on SCORM content?

In a former life, working at an entity that provided internet services for some 30+ school district networks, the entity where employed, requested an audit of what was to be the segment of core services which would be used to provide network services to our clients. The company that performed the audit, hired someone to do it.   At the end of the day, the auditor came out of the MDF 'closet' and had a something like 30 page report (which I read ... all of it).   That person's expertise was in only one platform ... that of Windows ... not surprising as this was in/around early 1990's.   Funny parts ... * what auditor has used was open sourced software (had seen it before, and even ran it myself ... to scan the Windows segment of the LAN). * most of the services provided were on Linux/Unix and the options/settings for what to scan, etc. this consultant thought in terms of Windws too much ... like DNS ... and failed to really ID any issues of significance for the platform from which we were providing DNS services.

But, here's a resource for ya ... since it's hosted on Amazon consult with their security experts.  The 'rush' to get to 'Cloud' has been like any other 'popular movement' in Tech.   Always 'catch 22's' discovered after the fact (but that's also true of any tech).  There is a  thing called \"Nosiy Neighbors' now ... customers on same cloud based networks who are there poking probing, maybe even attempting to do harm.  Is Amazon providing any help with that?   Should they? Another reason I wouldn't even consider assisting ... non-disclosure of company that provided the report.  In this day and age, unless there was some non-discloser agreement that had to be signed and notorized,  is not acceptable.  If that company is good at what they do, would think satisfied customers who could give 'testimony' would be desired.   Of course, if they are FUD based, then they should be exposed. Besides that, even if someone did provide/refuted all of what you listed, where does that leave things?   Think your client will forward onto the 'security' company, which they then would 'debunk' in a response (they are bound to protect their rep)  so then begins round two .... and back and forth and back and forth.   Yes, client is caught in the middle - and you are also are in the middle. So, despite what is normally thought to be a good position ... in the middle ... is not such a good place to be in this case.

Am not a business person ... but I've been learning over the last few years to be very cautious with entering into any legalese based contracts or not having a clear understanding of 'deliverables' with the 'client'.

          "Text": "Tim, I know you are surprised as was I, when I first read the findings. Yes they were looking at a Moodle site but they had no clue what an elearning platform is, the technologies used (SCORM, Flash Object). They even considered being able to upload compressed files a finding whereas we all know that SCORM packages are compressed files. I managed to explain that no elearning platform can function without uploading SCORM compressed packages and I consider a success they accepted that. I will try to give more info on the findings based on the phone conversation I had with the company and the client. If you think anything I write, could be considered a real security issue, we can move the conversation to a PM. They do not provide Proof of Concept for any finding apart from the CSRF where they provide the form HTML code as evidence! 1. Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information through SSL They consider TLS (all versions) already broken and possible to do Man in the Middle Attacks even if it is fully functional and properly configured. So they recommend the username and password are already encrypted before they are encrypted by TLS. When I asked what are the industry best practices to do it (apart from JavaScript encryption on the browser), they answered that there are ways and they will answer us. I am still waiting for their answer about best practices. 2. HTML form without CSRF protection They are writing about the login form. I know it is an extreme case described in the following paper https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf I don’t consider it any real threat in Moodle and I think it breaks Moodle functionality about the alternate login form. My company can certainly implement it in Moodle, using a hidden token field, to get over this finding although I am not sure it will break any functionality. 3. Weak Algorithm for HTTP Session Cookies I believe they were using the following technique https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_test_session_identifier_strength_with_WebScarab and they got an image that had a pattern of some kind. Reading below in the above web page “Predictability and randomness are relative terms. If the algorithm appears to be \"predictable\", but the key space that you'd have to check is greater than about 100000 items, it is likely to be infeasible to actually find a session belonging to someone else during that session's lifetime. Obviously, this depends on your own CPU power, network bandwidth, the target's CPU power and network bandwidth, the typical lifetime of a session, and a bunch of other factors. Please look at the scale of the numbers before deciding that a predictable identifier is a realistic risk. It is possible for something to be \"predictable\" in the strictest mathematical sense, but not exploitable in a practical sense.” In the phone conversation we were informed that the key space value detected in the Moodle system was between -3.000.000.000.000 and 3.000.000.000.000 that is 6.000.000.000.000 items. Despite the fact that 6.000.000.000.000 is a lot bigger than 100.000 the company considers this is a real finding and they want us to increase -3.000.000.000.000 and 3.000.000.000.000 to a bigger available space. Of course they did not specify what space is enough for them and they are to judge if the new space is enough or not. 4. Web Parameter Tampering attack The description and the recommendations are not clear as you can see. Also they do not provide any Proof of Concept of any vulnerability. The reference to ASP EnableViewStateMac is not clear or relevant. The only relevant thing I found searching is the following https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/ModSecurity-Advanced-Topic-of-the-Week--HMAC-Token-Protection/ As we all know even without that protection in place, a user cannot do anything he is not allowed to. For example even if they change the courseid in the URL they cannot enter any course they don’t have the permission to. So they do not provide any real Proof of Concept of any vulnerability. 5. Session Fixation vulnerability I think it is referred as Session Fixation but they mess Session Fixation with Session Hijacking. We all know Session Fixation is not possible in Moodle as a new session is created after login. I believe what they recommend is the following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation#Regenerate_SID_on_each_request Unfortunately session regeneration is not always possible. Problems are known to occur when third-party software such as ActiveX or Java applets is used, and when browser plugins communicate with the server. Third-party software could cause logouts, or the session could be split into two separate sessions. Also in the following URL something similar is described https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Session_hijacking From the above link I see this could create a lot of problems or make an elearning platform nonfunctional. Apart from ActiveX and Java applets, this technique does not work with popup windows or multiple windows. Is it even possible to implement this technique in Moodle? I believe that most of the findings (maybe except the CSRF but without any real danger) are in the FUD category but I need all the evidence I can get to support it. Thanks in advance Panagiotis",

For example you could setup you Hardware (perimeter) firewall to only allow Moodle related services that you have enabled to the public Internet, such as http(80)/https(443) ONLY. Of course these same services will need to be allowed on the software firewall that could be running on the host server running the moodle instance. Their a pros/cons to multi-layer firewall strategies. One big advantage is that typically hardware firewalls nowadays also provide other inspection modules, such GeoLocation ACL (blocking by source of country) and IPS that are harder to find on software firewalls.

I was considering Bluehost or Hostgator as their shared hosting offerings are very reasonable, but I'm certainly not opposed to considering a VPS solution if it's a better fit. I'm looking at roughly 30-40 entities that could have multiple concurrent users (I can't imagine the number will be tremendously high - I'd guess truthfully the max per entity at any given time concurrent would be at most 5). I'd like feedback on: 1. Performance - would a shared hosting setup be able to handle that load? I understand it's exactly that by nature and it's sharing resources with other sites. I'm just curious to know if others have/are using Bluehost and/or others with shared and has it been successful. 2. Security - What is the best way to force SSL on a Moodle setup? I'm happy to purchase the cert and work out getting it added, but wasn't sure what needs to be done Moodle-wise (I hadn't reached that in the docs yet....). 3. Familiarity/Training time - There seems to be a significant learning curve to the platform, but I'm in no way implying it's bad. We just don't know what we don't know and I'm trying to get a handle on time frame for orientation with the platform. What kind of time frame can we expect realistically when it comes to learning the platform? I understand it's documented, but can anyone give us anything realistic based on their experiences?",

I think this is a tricky problem to solve, and I don't think it'll be something you can track through Moodle logs, because it exists outside of the browser. If you're receiving screen recordings of the students, perhaps you can include some instructions before the test begins, that they record themselves opening whichever menu on their computer is required to show that TeamViewer is either not installed, or if it is, open it and show that there are no active connections, and then have them exit TeamViewer in a way that prevents it being connected to in the background by a friend. The upside of that is you are confirming nobody is connected via TeamViewer, one downsides are that it might give a false sense of security if students are able to move the tool elsewhere, or find another similar tool to use. Sorry I can't give a move definitive answer!",

How do we protect the Moodle system when we set the Safe Mode of PHP to OFF?  Are there any security measures (e.g. firewall, IPS, ant-virus etc) we could implement to strengthen the security of Moodle system? Thank you in advance for your advice. Best regards, Freddy Mok",

          "Text": "Hey folks. Got a very troubling problem here, and I'm hoping someone who knows more about Apache , etc. will be able to allay my fears. I'm hosting Moodle 2.6.2 on a Mac running OS X Server 3.1. That uses Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.4. The moodle directory is in the web root; the data directory is elsewhere on the hard disk. The site is only about a month old. I woke up this morning to find that Moodle was throwing up the \" dataroot is not writable\" error. This made no sense, since I have had it working since late March. I think I chmodded that directory to 707, and I have this line in config.php: \n```text\n$CFG->directorypermissions = 0777;\n```\n I re-chmodded it to 707 remotely, but Moodle still said the directory was unwriteable. I also noted that the data directory was only 28MB! Searching the Apache error log, I found that an IP address from Taiwan was trying to brute force my server via SSH, just trying one bogus username after the other. I ran down to the office and was able to restore the data directory from backup, and after a lot of twiddling, I restored access to it by adding everyone execute permissions to the parent directory, despite the fact that I don't think I'd done that when I set it up (I had a lot of problems setting it up, but the data directory part was no problem). We seem to be back in business. My question is this: With the permissions as I have them set, is there any way someone could have gotten in there and gutted the data directory and/or fiddled with the permissions? I can't find any record of a user being on the system proper during the critical period (I know it was working as of 12:54 AM, because a student submitted her homework then, and the last good copy of the data directory in backup was from 9:22 this morning), and the active firewall didn't block any IPs for multiple failures to login. I've turned off FTP service, but that just goes to the webroot anyway. I've turned off remote login via SSH, because I tend to just manage it from another copy of OS X Server and/or Screen Sharing through that. I've changed the admin account password, but again, I don't see any indication that it was compromised. Now I'm seeing occasional IPs from places we don't have users trying to do things like list directories and whatnot, which of course they can't. Obviously this isn't a *NIX or Apache discussion board, but does anything about my setup on the Moodle end sound suspect? I don't understand how a bunch of data could disappear from moodledata, or permissions change. I've been administering Moodle for quite a few years now, but this is my first time administering the hardware/OS too...",

          "Text": "Hi all, I'm trying to get some ideas as to what is a reasonable cycle to upgrade Moodle to \"stay covered\" in terms of security vulnerabilities. We're trying to come up with something of a fixed schedule for our upgrades so we don't get behind (i.e. annualy? twice a year? once every two years?). We just upgraded to 3.5.1 in February. Though we are a university, Moodle is not our main LMS and is not heavily used at all. Initially, it seemed like going to the long-term support releases (LTS) would be the best option, but 2 years between upgrades is a long time so I'm wondering how feasible this is. I realize that it depends on the needs of the organization, but I'm just looking for some ideas on how best to approach this. Any info would help! Thank you, Rauhan",

Do a DB query of mdl_user table for ID 2 to see if that still has manual. \n```text\nuse db4moodle;select id,auth,username,firstname,lastname,email from mdl_user where id like '2'\n```\n You won't see the password in clear text, but you can change it in /admin/cli/ IF using Moodle 3's ... cd /path/to/moodlecode/admin/cli/ \n```text\nphp reset_password.php\n```\n You will be prompted for a manual account username ... use the one you saw in the query above (assuming that account is still set as an admin level user) Then prompted for the password which must meet the character settings for site.

One error I have noticed is cron.php maintenance script is not set-up. We are using shared hosting, with a provider that offered one-click Moodle installation. There is a default cron operational at this time. I cannot locate this error message again. There are no messages in notifications. Where would I find it? Also we would like to optimize student security. We do not need to contact students through Moodle with emails. Our registration process will be done outside Moodle and we will manually enroll students. Would there be any problem with entering one email address for all students when creating their profiles? We, of course, would have their actual email addresses in our off-Moodle site files. We are not using Moodle at this time for forums, feedback, comments, etc. Just a venue for students to watch the course and take a quiz. Also any advice on doing backups? I have scanned info at this site and in books. Easiest way would be to copy from web host control panel and onto external drive? Courses themselves will be saved in their original format (captivate). Concerned about student progress, etc. Thank you. Sandy Stockholm",

PHP 8.2.x is supported too (since Moodle 4.2.3). See PHP for details. PHP extension sodium is required. See Environment - PHP extension sodium. PHP extension exif is recommended. PHP setting max_input_vars must be >= 5000. For further details, see Environment - max input vars. Kinda strange cause the highest point release of that 4.2 is 4.2.2+ (Build: 20230929) - git acquired just this AM! According to above, if your Moodle version is below 4.2.3 one might face issues. So ... am guessing you have 2 options ... 1. downgrade php to 8.1 or 2. upgrade your moodle to highest 4.2.x which is now 4.2.2+ (Build: 20230929) Plesk is your panel - and I assume you have a tool there to set the PHP version per domain /site?  Can you set to 8.1 of PHP? The comodo thang isn't about your version so one would be going down a rabbit hole chasing that one! :| 'SoS', Ken",

If an unregistered user clicks on a course to take, from the landing page, then that user will be taken to paypal to be pay to enrol in the course, and register on the site. But, if an unregistered user clicks on the (log in) link on the upper right corner of the landing page, then the user will be able to register on the site, but not be able enrol in any of the pay courses without going through paypal. This, I assume, is how the Russian guy registered. This is not exactly what I want. I only want users to be able to register if they are buying a course. The free courses require no registration, they have guest access, which is granted automatically.

I am not talking here only about grades, but locking any changes to quizes, adding documents to a previous year course etc. For example, I have a Moodle 1.9 that we used in academic year 2011, now for this year (2012) we used Moodle 2.3 and for the new year 2013 we will use 2.5 version of Moodle. Is there a way in Moodle to have a single user interface where they can view data for 2011 and 2012 however, they (users including faculty) will not be able to make any changes to the 2011 and 2012 data but can to 2013. Currently we are keeping dual sites with multiple database and year based dedicated url's. Thanks, D.",

I didn't find any hint, what the utilisation of the prefix changed... :-O (I deleted all my cookies and didn't use my test system ;)) This couldn't be the reason).

For example, the NEPA 1 section would always be displayed, but displaying the NEPA 2 section would be dependent upon the grade of the final quiz of NEPA 1. To do this: Enter your course Click the Turn on editing button, if it is not turned on. Click the wrench at the top of your NEPA 2 section with the tool tip \"edit section\" The \"Summary of NEPA 2\" page will display. Expand the \"Restrict Access\" section. In the \"Grad Condition\" dropdown, select \"Quiz: NEPA 1\" In the \"must be at least\" textbox type the % grade that the student must accomplish to advance to the NEPA 2 section. Note that multiple conditions can be added, these can be interpreted as AND conditions, in which more than one criteria must be met to display the section. In the \"Before section can be accessed\" dropdown select \"Hide section entirely\" to not display it to the user until they are ready to take it, or select \"Show Section Greyed out with Restriction Information\" to display it to the user before they complete the quiz.

Christain and I have had a 'side bar'.    In that 'side bar' from what I gather,  it appears GoDaddy installer script installs a version less than 1.9.19+ (highest/most secure of that series).  After installation, it warns about setting the salt (which was introduce in version 1.9.6), it has php error reporting turned on, and installs moodledata in space directly accessible via the web.  (appears to be installing 1.9.7).  Even installing 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 the moodledata folder should not be in a directory that is directly accessible via the web. Not long ago, MS computers came with pre-installed malware from an OEM in the distrubtion channel.   Wonder GD is now suffering something similar in that php files in whatever installer they have provided for customers has already been compromised. Surely, if php files appear in your site, GoDaddy security folks would be able to at least investigate that and report finding. Have already suggested he check into a GD VPS.

          "Text": "Hi Yusuf, You can request location access in-browser, but you cannot force access - you can imagine the privacy implications if any website could automatically enable that feature, even if a visitor has explicitly disabled it. You can find some information about requesting this access in the Mozilla geolocation API documentation . I don't know the exact assessment/device conditions etc, but a few other important factors to keep in mind that might be relevant: Though you can definitely ask for location access in-browser, it's possible to configure a browser to ignore requests for location access altogether, so students are not guaranteed to see the prompt even if you request it. A workaround for that might be to add a note to the assessment with instructions on what needs to be configured to allow that if it is a requirement for sitting the assessment. You're expecting quite granular location information to get within 20m. Browser location does not solely rely on GPS for its data, but on non-cellular devices such as most laptops, it's a reasonably safe assumption they won't have GPS available, so (in my opinion) you're not guaranteed to have data accurate/reliable enough to check students' exact distance from each other with any certainty. As an example, I tested my laptop browser location and it was off by about 10km. It's also possible for GPS to be disabled on a mobile device even if location access is granted. Location would be calculated from the data available, which could be much less accurate. It's possible to spoof the data points used to calculate location if someone is motivated enough to do so.",

That way if the ldap authentication fails for whatever reason I can still login as an admin to try and sort out why it failed and get it working again. Not that it matters anymore as the school are scrapping it! As to how you change it to a local login: If you look at the database table mdl_user (I'm using MySQL so I have to use My SQL workbench you'll use whatever you need to) you'll see the auth field lists the authentication method to be used against a user, most will be ldap of course, but if you change that to manual and put an md5 encoded password in the password field then the user is locally controlled. Whether this would rid you of the IIS login screen I don't know, our Moodle uses ldap and I've never had an IIS login screen mainly because internally it's an apache webserver; IIS is used for our secure external facing site but even then I've only gotten the login screen from Moodle.

It's a common request & ultimately problematic for the reasons stated on this thread & the other that Marcus linked to. Not mentioned so far... One strategy is to use Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) which means using strong encryption, proprietary software, & often browser-incompatible formats so that only specified users can decrypt the content in order to view it, e.g. DRM enabled ebooks & PDF readers. This also means that the content will not be compatible with some users' computers, i.e. can't or won't install DRM because it sometimes contains malware, e.g. Sony rootkit scandal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal or is not compatible with their computer. Another drawback is that the more steps, the more requirements, etc. that you put users through necessarily excludes a greater number of users. Whichever DRM software you choose would also need to be installed on users' tablets, phones, etc.. Also, how would you feel if you've paid to access content &/or a training/educational programme but then find out that you can't? There's the added expense of providing support to a greater number of users who have difficulties in accessing your content, some of whom will inevitably spend a lot of time on the phone, in good faith, trying to resolve their difficulties, but ultimately be left frustrated & disappointed. As stated elsewhere in this thread, this strategy ultimately fails because someone can always find a way to circumvent DRM & copy & redistribute content. Only one person has to have to technical skills & be willing & able to do this, whereas all users of DRM-ed content at all technical skill-levels should be able to view it legitimately. In short, I haven't heard of any feasible strategies to prevent users from redistributing digital content. Publishers don't like this because it means they have to adapt their business models to it. However, the good news is that it doesn't affect trainers & educators because that's not where the value of education & training lies, In fact, the trend is moving towards making educational & training content freely accessible, editable, & redistributable: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources This strategy is supported by the OECD, UNESCO, the World Bank, many universities & colleges, & many governments around the world. I hope this makes sense. Matt",

Is there any verification done as to the code of these plugins and subsequent updates? What are the risks that someone posts a plugin/update containing malicious code? 2. Are there any checks done on these plugins to verify that the author does not include code/spyware that silently send user data or system information to some third party on the internet?

They do not have real emails (just firstname.lastname@noemail.com) so new passwords cannot be sent to their emails. Currently only people with admin rights can change the password, and we can't give admin rights to our customers (they would see other customer info as well). We want the customers to be able to reset the passwords (and only their own employee's passwords), because it takes time if a customer needs to contact us.

The authentication database could be hosted in the same DB server as Moodle's one, but should be a different database. This way, you could create a read-only user for Moodle to query the username/password combinations (to manage logins) and read/write access user for the (additional to Moodle) application that would manage password resets. You could add additional columns in the external users table to store the \"managing customer organization\", and then a second table where you would map \"password manager users\" to \"managing customer organization\". When those password manager users log into the additional application, the application would make sure they would only see and manage the user accounts belongin to their managing customer organization. You could even develop a Moodle plugin (e.g., using a local plugin) to implement all this, if you don't want to develop a complete external application. Saludos.\nIñaki",

As your servers are based on university based internet, so nothing much really you can do in terms of asking your hosting provider to give you DDos protection, if someone is capable enough to setup Juniper SSG, then go ahead with it, lastly get your server passed through Incapsula or CloudFlare, even free versions would give you some sort of protection. Lastly, if your server haven't went down, then dont worry about it, chances are it wont be attacked again, but keep eye on the logs for sometime. Additionally, because this all was done from PTCL Karachi servers, so, now, you have chance, to submit complain with FIA Cyber Crime Cell, additionally recently passed Cyber Crime bill has clause for attacking server with intentions to gain access as well.",

So if username is username , and email address is email @institution.com , the username field in the data table now reads: email@instution.com.1678115634 Does anybody know why this is? Is it GDPR and privacy best practice compliant to still have the email address, albeit embedded in a text string, present in the database ? We're trying to find the best way of complying with our privacy notice which states that after four years of inactivity, data will be deleted. Thank you!",

          "Title": "Eliminating World Writable Files",
          "Text": "My organization has started using Rapid7 InsightVM to scan our servers for vulnerabilities. We have Moodle 4.4.6+ (Build: 20250214) installed on a stand alone Linux server (no other users/apps). The scan has identified world writable files as a security risk. After reviewing the links below, I've decided to modify the files and directories References : https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Security_recommendations#Running_Moodle_on_a_dedicated_server https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Installing_Moodle#Download_and_copy_files_into_place https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Installation_quick_guide#Install_Moodle_code Ran the following commands on my server: Change permissions for moodle app code: `sudo find /var/www/moodle -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \\;` `sudo find /var/www/moodle -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \\;` 0755 (dirs): Allows the owner full access and group/others to read and enter the directory. 0644 (files): Owner can read/write, group and others can read — no write access for anyone else. Change permissions for moodle app data: `sudo find /var/www/moodledata -type d -exec chmod 0750 {} \\;` `sudo find /var/www/moodledata -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \\;` 0750 (dirs): Allows the owner full access and group members to read/enter. 0640 (files): Owner can read/write, group can read — no access for \"others.\" After doing this, existing files and directories were no longer world writable, but moodle continued to produce new world writable files. So I then made the following changes to moodle’s config file, as well as modifying apache’s `umask` setting. /var/www/html/config.php Originally: `$CFG->directorypermissions = 02777;` Changed to: `$CFG->directorypermissions = 02750;` 02750 - Apache + group can read/exec, Some group-based read access is needed Also, added this near the top of config.php: `umask(0027);` This ensures that Moodle uses the correct umask even if the server is misconfigured. /etc/apache2/envvars Add this at the end (or edit if it already exists): `umask 0027` Any new files or directories created by Apache processes will have permissions that do not allow world access. However, moodle is still creating world writable files (most recent identified was /var/www/moodledata/localcache/di/CompiledContainer.php (-rw-rw-rw-) While looking into this, I've come across one or two posts claiming that the entire moodledata directory should be world writable. I don't think this is correct based on the other links I have shared above (and many more that I read regarding \"hardening\" moodle). So my questions now are as follows: Can someone confirm if this directory should be world writable? If yes, please explain how moodle protects the files in there and the server from malicious behaviour (I will need this information to submit and exception request to my security team) If no, how can I prevent moodle from creating new world writable files? Can someone point me to official documentation that deals with directory and file creation permissions? I followed an assortment of guides when installing, but mostly the Step-by-step Installation Guide for Ubuntu - MoodleDocs . It briefly mentions changing permissions after install, but doing that (as I did) still results in world writable files Thank you all for any assistance you can provide.",

For example in Apache2 under Debian Linux, they are in the /etc/apache2/envvars. export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data, export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data. 2. Those web server processes need read access to the Moodle code, in your case /var/www/moodle/ (and everything below that). Yes, only _read_ access. 3. Those web server processes need write access to the \"moodledata\" directory, in your case /var/www/moodledata/. I repeat, _write_ access (and obviously read access too). Usually you give Moodle an empty moodledata directory and from there on Moodle manages moodledata/ on its own. I know, you know this, but to eliminate a common misconception: The \"everyone\" group in Unix, what you call the World, is not the 8 billion world population nor the 5 billion of them having web access, rather all the other shell user accounts of the server that runs Moodle (more accurately, the web server that powers it). P.S. It just occurred to me that, if you delegated the \"research\" to those odd characters like ChatGPT, etc., it is not a crime, but a courtesy to mention that.",

          "Text": "Good morning, I have a question regarding managing Cohorts in 2.4.My site is set up like a University, with several Sub-Categories (schools), each with their own groups of category cohorts.The school admins manage their respective cohorts.Each course that the school creates can Cohort Sync from the list of that school's cohorts.That has all been running fine. (Restricting access to only cohorts within their school.) Now the snag.The university wants to create some site-wide courses that can be accessed by individuals from any school.For example, a course called New Orientation , that will be available to anyone in the Math101 cohort (in School 1 Category), Psych101 cohort (in School 2 Category), etc. I tried creating the course on the University level, but it cannot see any cohorts listed on sub-category (school) levels. Course categories University Category (Only a few system level cohorts, hidden from view of the school admins) New Orientation Course -----School 1 SubCategory (Contains Cohorts for the school of Math) Math 101 course ... -----School 2 SubCategory (Contains Cohorts for the school of Psych) Psych 101 course ... It seems that a course can only look up the tree of categories to use Cohorts, in this case only University level cohorts.It cannot see any cohorts listed in sub-categories.(Maybe this is a setting somewhere that I have not yet found.If so, please direct me to where it is.) Since the students are all enrolled into their category cohorts by the school admins, I would prefer to not have to create distinct cohorts for these general courses.Is there any way to reference a cohort that is listed in a sub-category?

The category and courses then use groups and the \"auto create group\" function will allow you to create a group from a given cohort as a dropdown option. Please understand I haven't tried this, we don't use cohorts at all, so I may be entirely wrong or creating you a headache but is this maybe what you are looking for? I don't know how you would deal with a new student whether it would give your school level admins access to set a new student into their group and then this would become picked up by the cohort or it maybe that a new student would have to be added to the cohort and then filter down to the group. It would also mean that the school admins would have to be trusted to include the right cohort in their group, so maths wouldn't rather than couldn't add the psych cohort.

          "Text": "Hi everyone, our college uses moodle 1.9.6, which getting pretty old now, I know. Yesterday our all users got locked out, and when I had someone look into it they said the user database tables had crashed. They have fixed it, but when I just scrolled through the users I found about 20 accounts that were not proper accounts, often with a @outlook.com email address. The most recent activity is yesterday, and I wonder if they are what crashed the site somehow - virus? Hacker? I deleted them all, but more may come. So, my question is, has anybody else had this happen and is there anything I can do with the version I am using to prevent this issue occurring again? I am guessing that if this is a vulnerability of the version I have, that it is already fixed in the latest version, but I don't know that my boss will pay for it to be upgraded...so am looking at all options before I talk to her.

I have not had any replies yet specifically detailing any user database issues/crashes, so I don't know if it is 1.9.6 issue, a SQL database issue or if something else occurred. Not being an IT person its all guess work at the moment. Our site has not been upgraded for 2 reasons - we are very small and have no in house IT, so there is the cost for a consultant to consider, and 41.9.6 has met our needs. Any advice on how to chose the best option to upgrade if we do that? I cant make head or tail from all the versions available. Cheers Laine",

A couple of suggestions. - Be aware that user.com is a real domain : you might want to use your own domain or a fake, random one. - I would also change the authentication method to nologin. - I would also set timecreated and the various access times to 0. - Do you need to reset the idnumber, city, country or other standard profile fields? - If you have any tags, a picture, or custom profile fields, I would check those as well. I might consider also making the usernames unique. I am not sure if Moodle would complain about deleted users with the same username they way it would for non-deleted users. Since the user id always remains, a username like \"anon\" + id does not give away any new information. I'm not sure if you need to reset the password to an actual hash. Perhaps someone else who knows about the password field can chime in. It is just a normal varchar field. I think leaving it empty is okay, (The Moodle tool generator leaves this empty for the users it creates.) Since user activity in Moodle is tied to the userid, all the various user activity - grades, course work, logs - will remain just as they would for any deleted user, which may include personally identifiable information. That may be okay for the level of anonymization or pseudo-anonymization you are trying to achieve. But that is another issue.",

The path is correct and www-data has read and execute permissions on the file, and I can run it as that user. I've even set it to treat failure to scan as a virus detection but it still completes the upload. ClamAV has not logged anything in it's log files but does detect the file if I scan it manually. I'm running Moodle 2.0.3 (build 20110609) on Debian 6 with ClamAV 0.97. Just to rule out my ClamAV config, I created another VM with Ubuntu Server 11.04 with the same version of Moodle but ClamAV 0.97.1. It behaved the same they same way. I then installed a separate instance of Moodle 1.9 on the Debian server and as expected, it worked perfectly fine and detected the test files using the same settings. This leads me to believe it's an issue with Moodle 2.0.3. Can anyone else confirm this? I've seen some recent posts of others having a similar issue but unfortunately they received no replies. Thanks.

Something to note about directions found on Moodle.org:  hopefully, they declare the system for which the directions apply.   Some are for Ubuntu.   Some are for CentOS.   There are suttle differences in the locations of things as defaults for the OS.   CentOS is based on RedHat Enterprise and closely related to Fedora (the later being the community version of RH).   For as long as I can remember (near 20+ years now), the RH 'family' has ALWAYS used /var/www in apache config (but maybe that's why the author of the moodle docs changed things - security by obsecurity? However, having said that, a Linux AMP server is flexible enough so that a knowledgeable user can change the defaults to just about any daemon config to whatever they think appropriate.  Such might be the case with docs on Moodle.org.  Whomever wrote the docs might have thought  it best to provide 'off one' type directions ... that will still work (thought to be easier/more secure?) for most users.   Those directions, however, probably don't match the 1000's of web pages/blogs etc. on internet that show/tell how to. Having said that will also state it is difficult to provide ONE set of directions for all linux distros and the differences that providers might initiate on their own (for whatever reason). Bottom line for you ... yes, you should be ok. Would encourage you, however, to dive a little more into the config of apache, php, and my sql ... the pieces that make up what Moodle runs under.   Sooner or later that knowledge will be handy ... maybe even required.

We did the test with a coworker using a smart phone and confirmed the situation Presently the temporary option that I found is: Option 01: Suspend the account from the user profile and Un-enroll the student from the course Option 02: Suspend the account from the user profile and Reset their password. Questions: Anyone had the same issue? Do you know if it's an App bug? Any solutions from a Developer perspective? Thank you all, your help is appreciated. Z",

I'd like to enable the Secure Cookies Only and HTTP Cookies feature in Apache and Moodle, as this was being flagged as not being enabled for us. We're running Moodle 4.1.3 on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, with PHP v7.4.3 and Apache 2.4.57, using https. When I was first looking into this, the method I found suggested I add the following line to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf Header edit Set-Cookie ^(.*)$ $1;HttpOnly;Secure But Moodle wouldn't start up at all after restarting Apache, so I reverted that change. Now I see there are settings for both under Admin > HTTP Security. So, some questions: 1) Not sure--Is it still necessary to adjust the setting in Apache2.conf in addition to toggling those settings in Site Admin? (hopefully not, given what happened) 2) The description for 'Only http cookies' says 'This is not supported in all browsers and it may not be fully compatible with current code' and by default it is *not* enabled.",

There's very little information about exactly what that \"not fully compatible with current code\" text is referring to, so I am keen for us to update the description for Moodle 4.3, once we have a better idea of what may be impacted. I suspect that it relates to certain functionality that might interact with external systems (possibly LTI , for example), but have not had an opportunity to investigate further yet. If anyone else responds to this discussion with some more definitive answers, that would actually also help us with our research too! For your first question - I don't think you have to do it in both places. You should be able to confirm that by turning on the settings in Moodle and checking the headers are being included when you load a page in your browser (you can check that from your browser's developer tools).",

You must set `register_globals=off` . This setting is controlled by editing your `php.ini` , Apache / IIS configuration or `.htaccess` file. Your site configuration might not be secure. Please make sure that your dataroot directory (/home/bradford/public_html/learn/uploaddata) is not directly accessible via web. Enabling the PHP setting display_errors is not recommended on production sites because some error messages may reveal sensitive information about your server . I have just spent 2 hours pouring through the moodle forums and documentation, and while I find some direction, it remains too complex for me to turn into a simple 3 (or whatever number..) step process to correct the above. Hence, why this post for someone to provide me with direction. I searched through my site and found two instances of the .htaccess file. I tried adding the code lines recommended in moodle docs - register_globals = 0 display_errors = 0 - but this did not change the warning window in one instance and completely broke the file in the other instance. So I undid both. \n```text\nThank you anyone who can help this beginner secure the site.\n\n-George\n```",

          "Text": "Hello everybody. First of all, I think is important to thank the moodle team for such an useful tool and their continued support and evolution. I post this for helping people to secure their Mysql connections, because in moodle 2.0/2.1 is slightly more difficult to configure. I post too the reference for moodle 1.8/1.9 just in case someone needs it. Since the first time, we have been using moodle configured to use Mysql with an SSL connection. Our production server, which has Moodle 1.9.6 is using it without problems. The changes I made for it were very simple as the Adodb driver for mysql is written quite well and does all the magic. For further reference, the changes to the 1.9.6 moodle version we made are: # LANG=C diff ./lib/adodb/drivers/adodb-mysql.inc.php.orig ./lib/adodb/drivers/adodb-mysql.inc.php 38c38 <       var $clientFlags = 0; --- >       var $clientFlags = MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL; In the moodle 2.0/2.1 case, the changes are more because the new versions are not using adodb driver anymore and the code seems not to support the clientFlags. I have to say that we have decided to put all the config parameters for the secure connection in the /etc/mysql/my.cnf (in the [client] section) in order not to put them in the moodle source tree. The changes to the 2.0 or 2.1 moodle version are: # LANG=C diff moodle/lib/dml/mysqli_native_moodle_database.php.orig moodle/lib/dml/mysqli_native_moodle_database.php 75c75,80 <         $conn = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, '', $dbport, $dbsocket); /// Connect without db --- >         $conn = mysqli_init(); >         $errorno = $conn->options(MYSQLI_READ_DEFAULT_FILE,'/etc/mysql/my.cnf'); >         $errorno = $conn->options(MYSQLI_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,'client'); >         $conn->real_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, '', $dbport, $dbsocket, MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL); > 296c301,306 <         $this->mysqli = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname, $dbport, $dbsocket); --- >         $this->mysqli = mysqli_init(); >         $errorno = $this->mysqli->options(MYSQLI_READ_DEFAULT_FILE,'/etc/mysql/my.cnf'); >         $errorno = $this->mysqli->options(MYSQLI_READ_DEFAULT_GROUP,'client'); >         $this->mysqli->real_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname, $dbport, $dbsocket, MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL); > Besides, i would like to know how to improve this code in order to be able to update the moodle code with git without losing the changes. I think it would be very useful to have a variable in config.php called $CFG->clientflags equal to '0' if no SSL is going to be used with mysql, or 'MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL' if you want mysql+ssl, but is too much work for me to do all the changes. Anyway, greetings from Spain. I hope this helps. Omar",

The attacks started before you made the move to CloudFlare.   More than likely, those were conducted using IP address of your server and not FQDN. Try this your self from a work station: https://REALIPADDRESSOFSERVER/mod/readme.txt with FireFox , one will have to make an exception to view as the cert is tied to FQDN, but that URL will display. The theme is commercial .... so if this is really theme related, you need to communicate with support for the theme directly. You have AlmaLinux 8.   It's firewall has a drop zone.   Any iP address in the drop zone will be denied access to server without replying to request back to the IP address that requested with a browser code. I have a script called 'slogs': echo 'One param.'; echo 'Given: '$1 echo 'Paused ... press ENTER to continue searching logs.'; read $keypress; echo 'access_log'; fgrep $1 /var/log/httpd/access_log echo 'ssl_error_log'; fgrep $1 /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log echo 'ssl_access_log'; fgrep $1 /var/log/httpd/ssl_access_log echo 'error_log'; fgrep $1 /var/log/httpd/error_log echo 'secure log'; fgrep $1 /var/log/secure When I see an IP up to no good, I'll run the above to see what specifically they are attempting to access. If I decide too much ... I have another script that checks that IP: whois on that IP should show CIDR and yet another that blocks that IP or the CIDR: firewall-cmd --zone=drop --add-source=$1 I don't make the drop zone entry permanent so on reboots that rule is cleared out. Once that is applied to the firewall, my server goes dark to that IP or range of IP addresses if using CIDR.  If I see that the logs show a server IP, I think 'bot' ... and block. It's not automated ... not sure that would be a good idea to do that. The whois info should also give you an abuse email address ... consider sending. a 'Cease and Desist' message along with a clip of logs to that address. My 2 cents. 'SoS', Ken",

Now, the User agreements screen does have the option to set consents on a policy by policy basis and it includes a filter to show 'Not agreed' so this indicates the logic is there in the background to track non-consents (although it is unclear if it distinguishes between 'consent refused' and 'not yet consented' which it should.) You can't withdraw consent yet in the latest version of the plugin, which is required, so they will have to add that feature as well. What I would like the policy tool to do is allow the DPO/admin to set some policies as 'consent required' and the others as 'consent optional'. Granted a user may be required to consent to the primary purpose just to use Moodle,  but for policies for other purposes you must have the option to refuse consent initially or it may very well not be valid consent (per recital 42). The DPO needs to be able to make that decision and have it set up accordingly.",

We're in the process of trying to migrate a couple of our sites from 1.9 to 2.0 and, ideally, we'd like to move the users over to the new, clean site. The 1.9 site suffered from serious entropy and there are a number of (serious) problems with it that we'd rather not bring over (mis-assigned roles and permissions, large legacy files, bad content and code, etc). Doing a complete in-place upgrade of the 1.9 site is possible but, as we're finding, it's like making a copy of a copy of a copy...errors and problems are starting to appear. After doing an in-place upgrade of the old 1.9 site to Moodle 2.0, I tried making a backup of the mdl_user tables (mdl_user and mdl_user_preferences) and then imported them in to the new site. The user accounts seem to come over fine but the passwords won't work. Even resetting all of the passwords to \"changeme\" doesn't seem to do anything. If I've mis-categorized this discussion, please feel free to move. I wasn't sure whereelse to put it.",

I've tried the .csv import but we have some custom tables that link to the users (based on userid) for a custom set of registration and reporting tools. That was why I'd hoped to just bring in the mdl_user table directly: users would have the same userid and no \"new\" accounts would be created. In looking further into the import issues, I think I may have complicated things by not having a password salt on the older site (and including one on the new Moodle 2.0 instance).",

          "Text": "Hi Mahtab, I can’t help with your question directly, but can I suggest a couple of things.   First, can you post details of your setup? Your OS, Web Server ( Apache , IIS etc) , db and Moodle version.  This would be needed to give any real advice as to how to protect your web server. Secondly, I believe your basic web server must allow people to read the files so they can be displayed properly but this should not be a security concern as this should only contain the basic Moodle install files.  There are four things you need to be sure off, Make sure your documents data directory is not contained within the web directory, that way a scan will not provide any real files. Make sure your web server will not issue out *.ini files. By default most web servers will not. Make sure you are using the latest release of whichever version of Moodle you are using.  If you have an old version a scan may reveal a known vulnerability (should not be an issue for you with a new site). And Make sure you have patched your web server. With the details of which web server you are using some other people may be able to give more detailed advice.",

YouTube will re-code your video from the moment you start uploading & it won't be ready to playback for several minutes after it's finished uploading. YouTube uses dedicated, optimised, high-power servers to do this. Now imagine how long a regular server will take to do this. And then think about how easy it is for someone with a watermarked video to simply blur the text so that it can't be read. You can easily add a temporary overlay watermark as a subtitle/caption & this will show up in screenshots. I hope this helps! Matt",

          "Text": "Matthew, By design, Guest is a sort of anonymous role and not allowed to have or save any data about itself or in any courses it has access to. Think of it as exactly the same as a web page visitor, since its main use is actually to allow a specific course to made publicly available to anyone over the web to view only. All accesses by any users using Guest are the same user. Even if they could edit this profile, each new guest would overwrite the previous guest profile since the Guest is just one, single predefined view only account. If you are trying to set it up so that guests can edit their profiles, it tells me that you are really trying to collect data about individual people. If you really need to tell those people apart from one another, you need some actual user accounts with usernames, etc. So, something like \"Visitor1, Visitor2, Visitor3\" accounts and hand out the passwords is a common solution, if that is what you need. Now, if you are trying to do something like have anonymous folks reaching your site to fill out a short survey of questions, such as where they are or where they heard about the site, but are not interested in creating accounts, then one way to do this is use the Feedback module on your front page in anonymous mode. This allows you to collect survey type data before users even login at all. See https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/Feedback_FAQ#How_can_I_allow_non-logged_in_users_to_give_feedback.3F for more information on how to set that up. I have done this on a few sites and it works well for that scenario. You can use this in addition to or in place of the Guest account too, depending on what your needs are. Hope this is helpful.

However, they would (and therefore access to the gradebook). Deleting a cohort method removes lots of data so often not a feasible workaround. Hoping to draw attention to it in the right area here! Thanks Catherine",

This issue has had some attention recently due to also being raised on issue MDL-66257 (labelled as a minor security issue, so you may\nnot have access to the details). On that issue, one of the component leads has investigated this recently, and added some analysis of the problem, so it will hopefully be solved soon. I have now closed MDL-60799 so the team can focus on a single issue for the bug, but have made mention of this post on that issue, to bring further attention\nto it. Generally, I would suggest the best way to bring attention to an issue such as this would be to comment on the issue with your additional concerns,\nas the component leads will all be notified directly. In cases where you suspect there is a privacy/security issue that has not been identified as such, it can also be a good idea to assign it a security level, so that security supported versions (eg 3.5 LTS) will also be patched (and this also restricts the issue from early disclosure before being patched - though in this case the details have been available in the original forum post since 2017, so that is less relevant).",

However, other parts rely on various security measures. E.g. if you rent a safe deposit box at a bank, probably only you have a key and the bank does not. Similarly, probably only you have things like the database passwords. However, most databases are designed for speed, not security, so that raw data on disc is probably not secure. Your database is like a safe deposit box made of glass, so anyone who can get into the room where it is could see what was inside, even without unlocking it. This is probably not a major risk (?).

          "Text": "One small nit: the salt might be 22 characters. Moodle uses the default password hashing algorithm for the password_hash() function (since at least Moodle 2.7, which is the oldest version I have around to check for) . As of today, that algorithm is Bcrypt, which in the PHP implementation users a 22 character salt (it's actually a 128bits salt, encoded as 22 characters using Radix-64 encoding). But as the password_hash() documentation states, that might change as stronger algorithms are added to PHP (and you can see that Argon2 is already available, which is a stronger algorithm than Bcrypt). Going back to the original question, and assuming PHP continues to use the Bcrypt algorithm in the near term future, having a user configured salt might be better or worse depending on how that user salt is created. Three things to be taken into account are: Bcrypt always uses a 128 bit salt If you want to use a salt combining the user salt and the Moodle one[1], you'd need to combine both into a single 128 bit salt. From a security point of view, the more random the salt, the better. So if the user salt/Moodle salt are not very random, and/or you combine both salts in a way that the result is less random that any of them, you might end up with a worse salt and thus a waker overall results. Saludos.\nIñaki. [1] Moodle doesn't create any salt itself, it simply omits the salt option and lets PHP generate a random salt each time password_hash() is called. I haven't looked at PHP code, but I assume they are using a good CSPRNG[2] to generate those random salt values. [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSPRNG",
