          "Text": "Hello, everyone. I am currently using Moodle 4.5 (Build: 20241007). Last year, in a course I used, I had 94 badges set up. Some of them depended on the conclusion of activities , some of them depended on other badges, some of them were hidden, some of then were issed to students. This year, I asked the admin to copy the course so I could use it again. For some reason, the copy of the badges did not work properly, and now I have (not kidding) 352834 badges. Some of them (I assume most of them, but I didn't check them all) have the warning \"Completo: Emblema com id {$a} não existe\", which translates to \"Complete: Badge with id {$a} does not exist\". So, I was wondering if there is a way that I could delete all the badges, so that I could set them up again. Can anyone help me? Thank you.",

Like, let's say I create a plugin that would add a badge to the mdl_badge table (sticking to that schema, of course and also putting a badge image into to image handling system and linking it correctly) and then add a record to the mdl_badge_issued. The logic under which this particular plugin awarded the badges would be it's own business. To pick a random example, perhaps it awarded a badge if the user logged in on St. Patrick's Day? Would I be correct that you would only need to modify these three (mdl_badge mdl_files mdl_badgeissued) tables to \"issue\" a badge from a plugin? Or is that approach the wrong way to go to design a plugin to extend site-wide badges? Tay Moss ---------------- CHURCHx.ca",

          "Text": "This might sounds like a bit of an odd one, but stick with me. We have a project around Sustainability, and plan to be integrating badged activities into module qualifications. As part of this, we want to have three \"trees\" or focuses where students will complete tasks over the three levels of their qualification, earning a badges that then lead to a top level badge associated to that focus, triggered by the other badges. That's all well and good, and we're trialling a cross-course activity completion plug-in for that purpose. Where it gets tricky is the next part. We also want to be able to offer a more general badge for students that complete 3 or more of the badges from any of the focuses. In the event that there were 3 badges available across the three focuses, for example, this would mean we'd need up to 27 badges (3x3x3) to cover every eventuality. This would obviously be a lot of badges to appear in a students portfolio if they managed to get all of the 9 base badges during the course of their study. So we were wondering if it would be possible/useful do have an option that states \"If 'X' badge has been awarded, hide 'X' and show 'Y' instead\". Alternatively, If badges had a feature in their completion criteria where you could set \"If 'X' number of activities of selected activities is completed, award badge\", then that would cover this with one badge. We could select the 9 base badges as the completion criteria, and have the badge trigger of any 3 of them being completed. I have asked for this before in relation to badges on modules being awarded for a selection of activities, and still believe that this would be a very broadly useful feature.",

With badges on our system, we can link them fine to eu.badgr.com and then use the evidence link to view the badge on our systems.

Now, the link can be manually changed when sharing, but students aren't going to know how to do this, and I think it's going to put them of the experience of badging altogether if they have to be instructed how to \"fix\" their badge when sharing.

Go to Site Admin > Badges > Manage Badges. 2. Click on the Name of the Badge you want to assign. 3. Depending on your version of Moodle, either select the Recipients tab or select Recipients from the dropdown at the top of the screen. 4. Click on the Award Badge button. 5. Search for the user to assign the badge to. 6. Select the user and click on Award badge. 7. The badge is now assign to the user.",

I am seeking clarification about the purpose and contents of the 'Claim URL ' field in the 'Endorsement' tab when managing a badge, in this tab there are two headings: Issuer details Endorser name Email Issuer URL Date issued Claim Claim URL Endorsement comment When adding an endorsement the 'Claim URL' field is mandatory for completion. I understand the logic to have an 'Issuer URL' available so that the endorser's website is attached to the badge. However I do not understand the purpose of the claim URL. Is it to link to another page on the endorser's website with details about the badge being endorsed? Or perhaps something more technical that I am missing. I have been unable to find documentation or guidance about this, so I am hoping someone in the community can assist me. Many thanks in advance for your time.",

I have seen any number of courses where there are only grades or only completions and not both. Badges should be able to be awarded based on any grade item in the gradebook, either by the passing grade entry or by an different grade set in the badge. For example, you may want to award several badges based on the grade of an item based on a spread of grades: A, B, C or whatever (similar to the way Quizzes have distinct feedback levels based on the grade.) This is important for the use of badges as a motivational tool. These sorts of approaches are especially common in the US in K-12 schools. I've helped build such courses myself. To assume a badge would only be awarded based on only activity completion or only a specific passing grade is not sound pedagogy: there are many situations where you want to motivate students differently based on grades alone.",

This makes it possible for an organization to build their own backpack (using custom code of course to build one yourself).

Plus, having an organization specific backpack could be used for many other apps as well, any app that conforms to the open badges spec.",

For activity completion, you could have the badge criteria based on completion of an activity that has an access restriction to a particular group. Just set Restrict access in the Settings of an activity on it to a particular group. This, unfortunately, only works for specific groups. And it still awards the badge individually, not to all members of a group at once. However, if you are using Assignment, you can use the Group submission mode and then all the students in the group can be awarded the grade and activity completion at the same time. Unfortunately, this group submission feature is limited to Assignment. If your course has Separate Groups set and Teachers only see their own students in their particular group, then you could also use the Manual award by role. The Teacher would only be able to award the badge to the students in their group. That is a more work than automatically awarding a badge and the Teacher could award the badge to some of their students, not all of them. But this manual award could be useful in certain situations.",

In most of the cases I'm planning to give badges after completing specific Learning Plans, but in one case I would like to use additionally a badge expiry feature. In general it is working like a charm (\"expired\" watermark and so on), but I'm wondering whether it is possible to sort/filter somehow the students to whom the badges are already expired? Or to whom they will expire in the next month or so? To be honest I'm struggling in general with rather obvious filtering of participants. Here I would like to invite the students for the course re-participation (I tried earlier without badges but I did not find a way to \"show all students that completed the course between the defined dates\", or \"...in 2021\"). Now, with the badges, there is visual signal that the course need to be retaken. But the student needs to check it on his own and teacher has no chance to find it out. Any hints, please?",

Badges which have already been awarded will be colored in, while badges which the user does not yet have will be greyed out. When the user clicks on a greyed out badge, they would see the description which would tell them how they can earn said badge, this is a future feature however. I am aware of the API call core_badges_get_user_badges, but I also need some way to get all badges, site wide and course specific. Is there an API call I am unaware of? If there isn't an existing API call, what would be the best approach to wring a custom API call to achieve this? I have also been entertaining the idea of creating a badge overseer of sorts which would get all existing badges awarded to it and I would use core_badges_get_user_badges on that user to get all existing badges. Then I would compare with the badge on the current user and create the page that way. With this method however I am running into the issue that if a badge has a criteria for course/activity completion, it cannot be manually awarded. Could it be that I am doing it wrong and that it is actually possible? Thank you in advance! Kind Regards, Kalin Popov",

          "Title": "Guide/Documentation of best-practices when setting up badges?",
          "Text": "In trying to set up badges for my site it's been a little mind-bending trying to determine the best way to award the badges I want. Normally I want to add badges under these conditions: a user has completed a course a user has completed all courses in a category a user has interacted with a particular activity (which is usually conditionally restricted by its own set of criteria) a user was enrolled through a particular cohort I'd LIKE to be able to include criteria for filtering badges to users who were created through a given authentication method so I can differentiate between users who were synced through a directory as opposed to users who created themselves in the system (e.g. using the 'auth' field on the user record) but that's not a thing right now. Are badge criteria something than be created using a local plugin or similar, or are they a hard-coded list? My main head-scratcher is whether I want to set up SITE badges or COURSE badges. When I started out with Badges, I created everything as a Site badge because the menus are there in admin and it has a seemingly obvious 'Add a new badge' link right there. When I set up a SITE badge I can manage it through site admin. I can create a badge and set up a criteria that includes completion of a set of courses, but then only specify ONE course. It's pretty easy to see a list of the courses that have badges assigned this way, as the site admin lists them all. But when I want to generate a report of all the badges issued across a course the database is harder to understand. When I set up a COURSE badge I can manage I create the badge and set up a criteria that includes the completion of THE course. This seems to work just as well, I don't have a great way of figuring out which courses HAVE badges set and which ones don't, and if any of the badge endorsements have been set up improperly, and so on. It's a manual process of traversing through each course to take a look. It would be great to list ALL course badges in the site admin area too! I haven't found a way of converting a site badge to a course badge. I had to recreate them all. I use COURSE badges to issue badges based on the completion of one course. But for multiple courses I could either: set up a site badge based on the completion of more than one course (\"set of courses\") set up a site badge using the 'awarded badges' where the badge criteria are those badges issued by each course Is that just personal preference? What's best for performance? What's the easiest to manage across 100 courses? I'd typically go with the first way since it seems easier to visualise why the badge was awarded. The second way could be a badge was awarded by a badge that was awarded by a badge that was awarded by a badge that is awarded by the first badge (with a circular reference accidentally thrown in). Lastly, it wasn't obvious to me that a badge - the picture itself that a user can download - actually contains metadata that identifies the badge and its endorsements and the user that downloaded it, the site URL , and so on. I didn't see that mentioned anywhere in the documentation and it seems pretty important if people think they can just share the image around to other users.",

I have about 30 scorm packages, loaded as activities in one course. Each activity is it's own little course of learning (e.g How to write an email). The idea is as the student completes more and more of these little courses they get a badge. E.g. Complete one activity and get a novice learner badge, complete 3 activities and get an intermediate learner badge, complete 7 activities and get an advanced learner badge... and so on. I don't want to choose which activities the learner must do to earn the badges, there are heaps to choose from so I would like them to choose what is relevant to them on the day. I also don't want to wait for them to complete the entire course, which consists of these 30 scorm activities, because that could take forever and students may lose interest. I have tried to break up the scorm activities to create individual, structured courses but the option to award on course completion is limited to completing all of the courses selected. When I select all of the courses, I cannot simply say when any 3 courses are complete or when a grade of 3 is achieved ie. if every course was worth 1 mark. Any suggestions on how to award badges for progressive effort?",

( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_pulse ) Pulse can be configured to become complete once it’s available. This opens up lots of flexibility because it means that you can use all the availability conditions to decide when something should happen. For example: You have 30 scorm activities You want to award a badge to students that complete at least 3 scorms You create a pulse activity which becomes available once 3 scorms are completed (you can do that by grade, by course progress, by specifying which activities…., all using available conditions) You configure that pulse to become complete when it’s available You award a badge based on this pulse You can do that as many times as you want. Once it’s setup, it’ll work completely automated. Doing it across courses would also be possible I think, but requires a bit more setup. Any questions, please ask! Hope this helps Stefan",

It worked quite nicely with simple internal badges given to high-achieving students. Cf. https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Using_badges#Issuer_details Now, in Moodle 3.9 and up that option seems gone, and any badge added to a course only inherits the admin's default. I can no longer specify that, say, the badge is \"mine\" and not my School's.  If we go to https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Using_badges or higher, the subsection \"Issuer details\" is no longer to be found. Why the change ? And it is possible to bring back an editable \"Issuer details\" option to the badge's decription details ? Thanks for any help. Kind regards, Przemek",

The Open University currently issue digital badges to non-formal learners and students via their free learning platform OpenLearn . We would like to hear whether you’re currently using digital badges in your teaching, if so, how, or if not, if you’d like to. We are aware of a range of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the UK and Ireland issuing digital badges to support teaching and to reward ‘soft skills’ needed for employment. However, aside from forums associated with badging technology, there are no formal connections in place to share experiences or coordinate approach from the educators’ perspective. The data from this survey will allow us to discover whether there is an appetite for sharing information and learning about the use of digital badging, both current and desired, and work together to improve the nationwide use of digital credentials in HE. Hence, we would be extremely grateful if you could give 10 minutes of your time to complete this survey. Your responses will help us gauge the appetite for sharing data around the use of digital badges in HE for the benefit of all. The survey closes on 15 October .

You have to choose at least one role, but regardless of which role you choose, any Administrator can manually award the badge anyway without any other bother. I usually pick Non-editing teacher, since it is highly unlikely you have set such a role on the front page of the site. Effectively, it means only Administrators can then award such a badge. (That's the lazy way of course: making a specific site level Badge awarder type role is the better way ;). I don't choose Manager unless I really intend for site Managers to be awarding site badges.

For the badges, personally I have not come across a way to \"dynamically\" add the student's name on the badge design itself - as it is a static image uploaded by the admin. Perhaps, for a bit of customization you can explore the modification of the message that goes out from the moodle platform when the badge criteria is met and has been awarded.",

I've been searching to add a criteria that they can only get the badge if they are on a certain language. This way we could make a badge for every language and limit them to being given to people who don't understand that language. Having the description like this : English / French / Spanish / Dutch / German Isn't really an option if you have to search for your language with every badge you  open. I hope that you can help me.

A French badge could then be awarded for completing the activity in French and a German badge for completing the activity in German etc. However, as you mention, this would only work for course badges and not site badges. Could you explain what criteria you wish to use to award badges?",

I used the scheduled task part of Moodle and disabled it there and then set the Windows scheduled task going again. That seems to be fine at the minute for the rest of the cron. Still struggling with what to do with that part of the cron to make it work again. One thought is patch Moodle, put a later build of the same version on and see if that magically fixes it. The other is we need to edit that part of the cron so that it gives a useful log file of what is making it stick, but I'm not great at doing that. We have a suspicion about 'has a temp table got corrupted in the database ', but again not good at getting to the bottom of that because of the lack of skill at getting out put from the cron. The other issue of course is this is our live production site which is in heavy use because of the rise in distance learning owing to the pandemic that won't seem to go away, so we can't take it off line too much.

If you install the Configurable Reports plugin you can write a report with the option to download the result in CSV or XLS format.  Of course, this assumes you or someone you have access can write SQL queries.  If you do not have a SQL resource, fear not!  Their is an excellent resource HERE for community-contributed reports.  This link points to those badge-related reports you will be most interested in).  I hope this helps.",

One small bit of administrivia that would be useful to see who has created any of the badges (for a Course, but I believe this would apply to Site badges too).  This may be a SysAdmin or  Teacher(s) so it would be good to have clarity across each of them - a nice bit of polish in the platform. I've raised an enhancement request here - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46440 - and have proposed that the following fields are added in to the 'Manage Badges' screen so you can see who has created or modified it: 'Created By:' 'Last Modified by:' 'Last Modified:' The direction from the enhancement review was to raise it here to gauge interest across the community but also see if there were some technical wizards who were able to propose a code-snippet.",

With an activity I can restrict access based upon completion of (Activity A and Activity B) OR (Activity C and Activity D) However when using Activity Completion to a award a badge, I can only use Completing ANY or All of Activities A-D. Basically I need to create two paths of activity completion to get the badge. The only way I can think of is to create multiple badges with their own criteria. However there is the potential for students getting multiple badges, depending what they actually completed. Thank you in advance for any suggestions.",

Honestly I think that having multiple ways to achieve a course badge should be a default for Moodle. But here's what I came up with. We created a set of Page resources that have access restrictions on them. Depending on what path the learner takes through the course's content a corresponding Page will become available to them. All of these pages are formatted the same. They are titled \"Congratulations on completing the course! Click here to receive your badge.\"  The page contents provide directions to get their badge. Completion tracking on the pages is set to \"View\". So as soon as they click the page, it's marked as \"complete\". Then we have the course set to be complete if ANY of those pages are complete. And the course badge is set to award upon course completion So as soon as they click the page it triggers this chain of events. Page is completed, which completes the course, which awards the badge. It's all looking good in testing. We haven't tested it with a live course yet.",

We've had little success with implementing a badge solution for a site wide credential, specifically getting a backpack service to complete the badge verification (assertion).  If there are any of you that implemented badges such that you can award a badge via Moodle and users can upload the badge or connect the awarded badge to an external backpack service, would you share a bit about your overall architectures? For example are you self-hosted/hosted? What Moodle version? What Backpack service and badge specifications do you use? etc. Thanks so much for sharing. Michael",

          "Text": "I have been leading work on Badges at Moodle HQ for a few weeks now with the main aim to add support for Badgr ( https://badgr.io/ ) since the Mozilla Backpack ( https://backpack.openBadges.org/ ) site will be retired and Badgr will be the replacement. The Badges code so far looks really good and I appreciate all the time and effort that has brought it up to this point. The work on updating to the Open Badges 2.0 API that was added for 3.6 was a useful start. A list of the big changes that are due to land in Badges for 3.7: 1. Badgr - MDL-63262 Add support for the site backpack to be specified so a Moodle site can communicate with Badgr or Mozilla Backpack Refactoring to move classes (renderables, forms, backpack API) each into their own separate files under the core_badges namespace. Include changes to the coding style to bring it more up to date with https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding_style Admin settings to configure the backpack Extending the backpack API class to define the list of functions supported by each backpack and define a mapping for data going into and out of each backpack request New list of exporters that can export data required for a backpack request, or import the data returned from a backpack request New flow for issuing a Badge with the 2.0 API - make separate REST requests to issue the Badge instead of using a client-side JavaScript API 2. Upgrades - also MDL-63262 For existing sites already connected to the Open Badges backpack, no changes will happen until the site backpack is changed to Badgr. After changing the site backpack, each user's Badges already connected to the Open Badges backpack will not change immediately. They will see a warning saying they need to disconnect and reconnect to the backpack which will ask for their Badgr connection details. Once each user is connected to Badgr they will be able to publish Badges to Badgr and list the Badges in their public Badge collections from the Badgr site. 3. Add real support for Moodle competencies - MDL-63876 Rename Badges \"competencies\" to \"external alignments\" (as per the specification) Add support for Moodle competencies as a criterion for a Badge. 4. Improve Badges privacy export - MDL-64702 Extend the privacy export to include the related Badges in a privacy export. There is a demo site that is connected to Badgr.io and is viewable here: https://backpack.moodledemo.net/ The login details are on the front page and this site can be used to award badges and publish them to the backpack. This is a demo site and will be periodically reset. Regards, Damyon Wiese",

In the course there are around 100 students enrolled. The steps followed are: 1) Created a badge with details. description, etc. 2) Selected the criteria so that a manager awards it manually to students. 3) After steps 1 and 2, click on \"Enable\" button so that the badge can be awarded to the corresponding students that the manager should select 4) Right after confirming, 1 random student shows up in the list of awarded students without the manager intervention  but... if I click the \"Award button\" the \"Existing badge recipients list\" is completely empty. 5) If I repeat disabling and enablign the badge, it keeps adding students one by one...without manager action and the recipient list is still empty. I also checked error logs with no aparent hint of failures. Does anybody know if this could be a version bug or weird behaviour fixed in a newer version? Any patch or fix to apply?

The college has multiple Moodle courses (e.g. course A, course B, course C). Each course may contain different inductions that our students can complete and we would like to award them badges for completing the trainings. However, after testing out several scenarios of badge awarding, it seems that site badges are not able to use course badges as a prerequisite to award the site badge, but course badges are able to use site badges as their prerequisite.  Other than that, badges from different courses are also not able to use each other as prerequisites. This is a problem as we would like to award a site badge once students have completed trainings in both courses A and B. Is there a way to overcome these issues? - Not possible to have 2 way communication between site and course badges. - Not possible for badges between different courses to be related to each other.

I am exploring the creation of an IFrame within this external site that contains a Moodle page that displays only the user's badges.

          "Text": "I thought I would provide an update as I have made my own patch to do this. Essentially I had to configure Moodle via Home / Site administration / Security / HTTP security / Allow frame embedding and set it to enabled. Additionally, I had to edit httpd.conf in Apache and adjust the configuration options related to 'X-Frame-Options' so that they do not default to the \"sameorigin\" settings. Making the above changes and restarting Apache allowed an external site IFrame to load any page from the Moodle instance. The next step was to create a PHP file that would display only the badges. I duplicated the badges/badge.php file and modified it by removing the header/footer output statements. I also duplicated and modified the respective rendering classes in badges/renderer.php so that only the badge icons were displayed. Given that I had already done the single sign-on between the external site system and Moodle, the IFrame had access to the Moodle session and allowed seamless log-in + access to any Moodle pages. Completing the above steps resulted in a patch that now enables display of Moodle badges within the external site IFrame. This should be extensible to any aspect of Moodle e.g. displaying of enrolled course names as long as the corresponding Moodle php has been created. Hope this helps anyone with a similar use-case requirement. I would be glad to help if you have any queries on this.",

The badge details will display on the new site if they are linked to the badges in the backpack, or if the files are uploaded by the users, because the original issue information is  always embedded (\"baked\") into the image itself. However, as you probably suspect, all those links related to authentication will fail because the original source no longer exists. So it will be impossible for anyone to properly verify the authenticity of the badge issuer or the details of the issuing. It is rather like having a diploma from a university which no longer exists. A possible workaround would be to put up a redirect on the old domain so that any links that would have gone to user badges there will be redirected to a web page you make with information about the move to the new domain.",

A fundamental design concept is that once a badge is earned or \"baked\" with the data, it is fixed and belongs to the recipient. The intent is that the data never changes once a badge is awarded. The practical problem with this is that user identity is based on email and authority identity is based on domain names, which do and will change. Now, identities could  be based on something else, but that's not how Moodle implements them. There is no real world-wide standard for these things, sometimes not even national or industry standards. So, it's an inherent weakness but it can be planned for, more or less. I get the impression it is usually less ;)",

It defines multiple identity channels to get past this issue, among others: https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/#IdentityObject I recently heard that Moodle supports only v0.5 of OBI, but a quick scan indicates that it might be 1.0. That's still two versions back. I wonder what the plans are to upgrade to Open Badges 2.0? The last commit on GitHub was March 2016: https://github.com/totara/openbadges In addition to Teresa's Moodle server shutdown issue noted above, this is another reason to consider badging outside Moodle via external plugin to a dedicated badging platform, if you're doing badging for other than course gamification, i.e. transferable, lasting recognition value outside Moodle.

That's my impression, from working with both products, anyway. Certainly, a move to OB 2.0 would be good and a plan to keep up with the OB progress good too. I agree with the idea of external sources but there needs to be a lot more. Sooner or later badging will have to move to a solid accrediting validation protocol that is more centralized than the applications that generate badges. Backpacks are a good end user solution, but there needs to be some sort of  authority solution too. I've worked with people in the professional training area who see this as the key issue to get badges recognized at the industry level in the same way certificates are now.",

Using Moodle 3.4 I have been able to do the ground work of earning badges on a completed course. and work out badge enrollment to a course if user has a single badge.  This all works just dandy. I have one course which needs only one of a number of badges to enroll, this is what I can't work out. so there are multiple paths to get to enroll for this course. I have each path earning a badge, just need to use Badge enrollment for any of these badges to allow enrollment to this course. In Badge enrollment the list of badges required to enroll isn't explained very well. Is it ALL list badges have to be earnt, or is it ANY of the listed badges. Regards,",

          "Text": "i am working in Moodle 3.5 and i am helping an academic with awarding badges to students for hours completed. Each student must complete 8hrs of research each year. To verify this the student will submit the work to be validated by the academic. However the student may not complete all 8 hrs all in one go. As an incentive the academic wants to use badging to recognise the students current process. As such i have been asked to create a number of badges showing how much research they have achieved up to this point. i need a system whereby the academic can attribute hours to each student an when they cross each threshold (e.g 2hr, 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs) they will be issued a badge. At the end of the year each student will have all four badges.  how do i do this, i want it to be as automated as possible? I have experimented with assignments and linking grade to hours and then using course completion to issue a badge.  e.g course is complete when assignment 1 has been completed. if student has completed the course and got a minimum score of 4 issue them the 4hr badge.  However this only works once as the student can only complete the course once. This means that if they were to submit further evidence the system would not issue any further badges. Thanks in advance.",

This works well. The course I am creating is intended to be an annual training course, in which employees are required to take once a year. Is there a way to configure the badge settings in that a cumulative list of badges will populate every time an employee completes this course? As far as I can tell, only one badge is issued per course completion. Something to note - I have the plugin Course Recompletion enabled. This automatically resets the course after a specified period of time. The idea is that when a course resets, the employee takes it again, and then begins to collect badges each time that course is complete. Any help / insight would be much appreciated. Thanks.",

If I create a badge from within a course it gives me the option to make the badge dependent on Activity completion (i.e. complete post training quiz with passing grade).  But if I create the badge from within the Site Administration module I can only use Course completion as a criteria.  The badges created from within the course work exactly as I wish, but they are not visible in the Site Administration Badge Management screen which is strange.  But if I give it the same name as an existing badge I get an error.  So they're connected somewhat but not correctly.  If I create a badge in the Site Administration Badge Management screen it won't work at all. Somehow I also managed to accidentally assign completion criteria for several courses that requires that multiple courses be complete as a pre-requisite for completing the course the student is working on and there is currently no way to remove that pre-req course once selected.",

At the Open University in the UK we are using badges on two websites - OpenLearn and OpenLearn Create. We are aware that the community is working to make Moodle more compliant with this regulation, but haven't seen any details specifically about the badges. Would you please share what the plans for changes are. We have two areas of concern 1. Badges are not currently deleted if delete a user from Moodle 2. The URL baked into an issued badge continues to work even if you delete a user - two issues here. One, currently this shows to a user that their data isn't really deleted. Two, if badges start to be deleted when you delete a user, this URL will stop working and badges can not be validated. So this is a tricky problem, a solution to it could be to store such URLs even after badges are deleted. If someone visits such URL to just tell them that the badge it came from was indeed issued by the site, but not provide anymore details. Thanks, Kamen",

          "Text": "Hi Kamen, Thanks for the question. There are really two pieces of functionality mentioned here; the current 'delete user' function, and new GDPR personal data deletion. The existing 'delete user' functionality in Moodle will be unchanged when the GDPR changes land this release. This was a decision made to reduce risk, as making changes to this routine may have unforeseen consequences. The new functionality, made available through a data privacy tool, is responsible for deletion (or nullification, where required) of all personal data under certain situations, such as when a user requests to be forgotten, or when the institution is obligated to remove all personal data for the user. This works the same for all components, including badges. Each plugin must advertise which areas of it's internal database structure, file systems, etc, store personal data, and each plugin is also responsible for the deletion of said personal data. In the case of badges, any badge issued or manually awarded would be considered personal data of the recipient (awardee), and the personal data would, at a minimum, have to be nullified from any relevant award or backpack records. The problem I foresee here is that, strictly speaking, there is a legal requirement to remove things like the backpack email address of a user who has asked to be forgotten. This means that any badges that user has sent to backpacks (like open badges backpack for example) will no longer successfully validate because the hash in the assertion JSON will have changed when the email is nullified. Having a quick look at this, it seems this hash is generated on-the-fly, based on the backpack email, which will now be null. Nullification will however, stop other users who follow the criteria or evidence links from seeing the user's name and details, and this is a positive.",

Would it be possible to give a user who has been issued badges by Moodle a choice? IMS supports an approach that gives the badge recipient an option to choose to have the institution retain the minimum badge-related data necessary to allow the institution to verify the Open Badge. In an Open Badge, the recipient identifier may or may not be hashed. If a hashed recipient identifier is considered personal information and needs to be removed or nullified, then the badge would cease to be valid and verifiable. As mentioned in earlier comments, Open Badges may contain information about the evidence used by the recipient to earn the badge. Evidence may be a URL pointing to information or artifacts hosted elsewhere (like in Moodle). If those artifacts are removed or nullified, the badge itself will not become invalid. In rare cases, evidence may be a text narrative embedded in the badge that potentially contains personally identifiable information. I'm happy to liaison with the workgroup as further questions arise. Jeff Bohrer, IMS Global",

Since my last post, the privacy provider (the class responsible for handling personal data export & deletion) for the badges subsystem has been written and, as I suspected, we're deleting any badge backpack records for the user who requested to be forgotten. The tracker issue can be viewed here if you wish. With regard to the suggestion of this being the user's choice: We don't have the facility to allow a user to ask to be partially forgotten (i.e. leave some of their personal data behind, for cases like badge verification). This isn't to say that such an idea is impossible, it's just that it wasn't part of our MVP. Do you know of other systems using badges that has used this approach? As it stands, approving a 'forget me' request will remove all personal data for the requesting user, and this includes the emails (and hashes) stored in their badge backpack. In fact, we remove all records that a badge was issued to that user at all. After a user is forgotten from the Moodle site, any badges exported elsewhere during their time there will no longer be verifiable. This outcome really comes down to the fact that we have to be strict on what personal data can be kept. So far, there are only one or two cases in which we store personal data, and we do so only to provide evidence for GDPR auditing purposes, which is deemed acceptable. Regards, Jake",

I'm using moodle 3.2 and learners receive the notification alert but they have to click on it to read it. Ideally I'd really like something a little more immediate and a little less subtle. The other element I'd like to avoid is that learners click on the notification alert but then there is no breadcrumb back to the course they were on where they just received the badge. They have to go back to home or course to resume. Thanks Andrew",

Recently I've noticed that many of my students are not even aware that they have earned badges. I think this is because a lot of them are now using the Moodle Mobile app, which doesn't support the Latest Badges block. Looking through the Moodle Tracker , I spotted this issue ( MOBILE-2203 ) which raises the topic being discussed here. The issue mentions something like a pop-up when the badge is first earned as well as a way to display earned badges (or at least some of them) on the new dashboard /course overview page. Although the ideas are being pitched to the Moodle Mobile developers specifically, casting a vote for this issue is probably a good way of bringing this concern to the attention of Moodle HQ.",

Our hosting service alerted us that our server was nearing capacity, and recommended that we back-up courses and store .mbz files to a Google drive. We did intend to back up user data and course badges on the restore, and in most cases were successful. We then deleted the classes from our Moodle drive. This was poor advice on many levels, mostly because we realized we lost course history from the students' profiles. We restored the .mbz files to Moodle, but the Badge information did not restore with all of them -- likely because the box was not checked in those cases. Interestingly, the badges restored to the individuals' profiles - image and name of the course -- they even link back to a badge.php?hash=  page, which names the badge, but is otherwise blank About 100 individuals in 3 courses are in this situation - badge image is noted on their profile, but no criteria or award history. We have that information; we don't know if it is possible to restore or recreate it for these individuals without giving them a 2nd badge. I should say this is V. 2.9.6, so we are unable to delete the badge. Robin",

          "Text": "Hi Kevin: Good news that Moodle now supports the Backpack again. The Backpack is an example of the kind of free badge storing and display platform that needs to exist beyond the LMS for sustainability of issued badges. Others include Open Badge Passport (and CanCred Passport in Canada) and Credly and Badgr, which permit importing badges as part of their integrated badge issuing/sharing infrastrucuture. The student would normally share badges from the permanent badge storage platform to social media because otherwise: what happens when the student leaves the course or program? How long should the Moodle course preserve this record of their learning? what happens if the course is deleted and the information about issuing is lost? Badge rot is real... of course, decent shelf life is really only important for \"resume worthy\" badges with transferable value that employers might recognize. Otherwise, who cares: show off your badge to your friends for as long as it lasts. (though it does make it harder to take \"resume worthy\" badges more seriously...). Plugins to specialized badge issuing platforms are available for those who need to maintain badges outside an LMS, whether for sustainability or maybe because they also badge outside the LMS. The other aspect to consider is that Moodle, as an open source community-driven platform with many demands on it, may be reluctant to chase after the APIs and business models of for-profit platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a good example: it updated its API earlier this year, which broke automated publishing of badges to Certifications for all badge sharing platforms. The broader Open Badge community still trying to get that one fixed - the problem is not only technical.",

So here is my dilemma, I would like to do two things, one is probably entirely pie-in-the-sky, but I'll ask anyway. 1.  I have 3 related courses and I'd like to be able to create a badge that requires the user to complete all three and then get a badge.  You might say, hey, that's easy!...here's the hard part:  My site has 12 locations providing training, each location uses their own category area & structure as well as a centralized area for 5000+ users. The site has been running courses for 4 years, each year we copy the current courses to new categories.  We have a 5-6 category deep structure, sometimes more.  Some of the categories have ridiculously long titles.  There are more than 8400 courses on my site.  I go to the chooser to select required courses for the badge and I can't see my course titles because it wants to show the structure leading to the course.  And it sorts by id number, putting the oldest (generally) courses at the top.  I can't see my course titles because all it shows is the category location trails. Is there any way to change this chooser?  Maybe a way to enter course ids? That would make more sense for me. 2.  This is the Ha! Not likely one.  We code topics...because each of our 12 locations has its own way of doing things, Ethics training isn't the same everywhere, but all of them have a course idnumber which indicates it is ethics.  I'd like to be able to say...badges can be awarded if staff complete a course with this course idnumber (first four anyway, the number is our code plus the course id). Certainly not possible as far as I can see, but...I can dream, right?",

How this will affect the Moodle badges implementation depends on what emerges and how up to date the maintainers will keep it.

I was looking at the stamp module but really like the idea of badges since we can use the hash to verify them. Thanks, Robin",

          "Text": "They would have to earn a new badge each time. Properly speaking, a person can not re-earn the same badge. A badge is awarded based on an achievement. When you award it, you are asserting that person has fulfilled the criteria to earn it. Now, If you put an expiration date on it, you are saying that achievement is bounded or limited in time  (for whatever reason). It's a distinct act of achievement to fulfill the same criteria again at a late date after the first expiration. That's just the way that Open Badges see things. Think of it like a sports trophy, like a Super Bowl ring or an Olympic medal: you earn it and you will always have earned it, and you are the champ, that time. But if you want to stay champ, you have to keep earning it every time. And you get a new trophy each time. -Randy",

          "Text": "The short answer is yes, since you can have multiple badges per course and the criteria for earning those can be and almost always are different. A common way to do this is to choose different activities requiring completion for different badges in the same course. And since activity access restrictions can have dates on them, you can use this to help control activity completion by date, so you can do this over time too. The long answer is it sounds like the underlying problem you are trying to solve is how best to build the completion for recurring content over time. The most common solution is to make a separate version of the course. But, there's no one right answer to that; which approach is best depends a great deal on the details of your site and situation.",

Some of our badges have an expiring date and after that the students need to take the course again.  Problem is that not all of the badges are awarded straight after the course is completed. In this way the expiration date gains more time than what actually should be. (example: course is held in April 2016 and expiration of the badge is April 2017. The badges are awarded in June 2016 so the expiration date is June 2017 and students have two months of \"grace period\".) It would be great if we could create different badges, but with the same name, and give to them different expiration dates I hope I made myself clear! Thanks!",

I started setting up badges for all of my courses, and ran into a problem with issuing a Badge for a Quiz activity.  I'm fairly certain I've set the criteria correctly (having done so for the quizzes in 2 other courses), but no badges have been issued. To summarize: Badge Criteria tab - Activity completion checked off as quiz 1 - 'This criterion is complete when' radio button selected to All of the selected activities are complete Edit Settings of Quiz 1 - 'Grade category' is Uncategorized (same as the other courses I've set badges for) - 'Grade to pass' is set to 65 - 'Activity Completion' is checked as 'Require passing grade' When I enable access for the Badge, nothing happens (0 recipients).  I've tried re-calculating the grades, switching the Badge criteria to something else and back to Quiz 1 again, and I've run cron through URL for general clean up. I'm stumped, and would really like to get past this.  Any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks, Travis",

A strategy like this has other advantages in addition to avoiding \"badge rot\", such as: avoiding \"badge fragmentation\": the ability to develop a more centralized, coherent institutional badge strategy vs. course level implementations that can be difficult to maintain and replicate \"blended badging\": badge in other ways in addition to Moodle (face-to-face, eportfolio, other platforms, etc.) the increased functionality and more ambitious road map that comes from a dedicated platform vs. a module. For example, stacked Milestone badges, increased issuing flexibility, better reporting, etc. simply swapping plugins when you change LMS platforms (assuming your new LMS also has a plugin or you can get one developed) Your sustainability cost would then be maintaining an account in Open Badge Factory vs. maintaining a rump Moodle server. Apologies if this seems like an advertisement. There may be other badging platforms that connect to Moodle, but I only know about the Open Badge Factory one.",

The deadline for the activity was May 20th, 14.00 hours and when I set up the badge I set it up as having to be issued by 20th May on the badge management settings. Only one badge was issued (to myself, when I tested the assignment) when everyone in the group had completed the assignment by the deadline. Now, can anyone confirm that the probable cause of this is that when you set a badge issue date on the badge mangement system (i.e. 20th May) the activity has to be done BEFORE  that deadline (in this case, by midnight May 19th)? Is this where I am going wrong? Can anyone help? Mark.",

Rather than requiring everyone to re-complete their annual fire training from D1 of migrating, I'd like to be able to import their existing dates of completion (the training content is the same!), so that people who completed it a week before migration on the old system do not have to re-complete the course in order to earn a badge and be good for another 51 weeks... Any possibility of doing this? (although its moodle based we don't own the old system so I doubt we could export the completion data for the courses and import it into our system...) Any guidance you could give would be much appreciated. Peter",

I am writing to ask you about the possibility of taking back badges manually, or using an automatic condition or requirements. The idea is to remember the students no to relax with an specific content  which in a previous test he/she was awarded with a badge. For example if in the first year they had a badge for square roots and in the second year they fail badly another test about square roots, we could take back the first year badge to remind them that is it not just about passing tests but to understand the specific content for live. So in this case they should take again the first year test to regain the badge. I hope this makes sense. Thanks! Mercedes",

          "Text": "Hi Dirk, I am not sure why the exactly problem is happening, but we can think about it together as I explain how backup / restore works. You can backup course badges, but it requires backing up all of the user, role, activity, and completion data. This is done for a reason that when we restore a badge that relies on some specific role, the role won't be restored unless there is a user associated with it. This is how course back up works and I can't do anything about it. Also the point of backup is to be able to restore a course with all the data and get it to the state is was at the backup time. But here is where the problem with badges comes. Due to the nature of badges such as that we cannot issue the same badge to the same person twice we cannot backup already issued badges. What we do instead is we rely on all the information that was backed up with the course to recalculate completed criteria. All restored badges appear in the course inactive and once you enable them they will start calculating if there are any users who have completed badge criteria. Which means that if you restored your course with all the same users and completion records and then enabled your inactive badges, they will be awarded to users who meet the criteria. So, what we need to figure out now is which step fails... With what settings do you back up/restore your courses? Do you re-enrol the same users into the restored course? Do you restore completion data? Yuliya",

If not, am I misunderstanding what badges are for, and is there a better alternative? Right now our home-grown mod does all of the above and more, but has no interface for actually defining certifications and their requirements (I have to manually run sql statements in the DB). Writing such an interface would be a pain, hence why I am considering moving to badges, but if what I've got fills a niche that nothing else is filling and would be useful to people, especially people who would be willing to help write that admin interface, I can look into putting it up on GitHub.",

The alterntive is to create my badges at site level but then there are lots of badges not relevant to other members of staff (especially as there are no 'folders' or other organisational mechanism for badges). What I am actually trying to do is to award 'level' badges - ie. Python programing level 1, level 2, etc. I have 6 areas of proficiency, each with 8 levels, and as students move through the courses they gradually earn higher level badges. I don't think there's any easy way to do this though, as badges don't (yet) support multiple levels nor is there the ability for a higher level badges to replace/kill a lower level badge and thus avoid 'clogging up' a pupil's account withobsolete badges...",

To become an Eagle/Queen scout you must have achieved a certain number of badges. Suggestion in this thread was if you get all badges in a category. I think this logic is too simple and might need something with custom claim codes or by autocreating a csv file which then uses the https://moodle.org/plugins/view/block_badgeawarder plugin to award the students badges 3.

Adding course's badges with the Activity completion criteria (these in the first and basic course, ex. \"How to set up a course\" with the badge \"Newbie teacher\" ) 2. Adding course badges with Other Courses completion criteria (these in the courses that participants will attend after the basic one, ex. \"Improve your teaching methods\" with the badge \"Efficient teacher\" and \"Learn how to engage your students\" with the badge \"Proactive teacher\". Both of the badges can be awarded only after the completion of \"How to set up a course\") 3. Adding a site badge with Set of courses completion criteria (this one as the real Curricula Badge, ex. \"Expert teacher\" badge) What do you think about this setup? How do you use badges in your curricula? I'm waiting for your feedback and ideas.",

Also, is it just about the firewall or is the fact that Mozilla Backpack is hosted on foreign soil an issue? Also? What about importing and/or displaying badges earned outside inside the uni?

If a badge is a small scale \"Attaboy\" to students, instructors can be permitted great flexibility.  If the credibility of the institution is included in the value proposition, then the organization should provide oversight and policy guidance to creators. In my own case, I found that perceived value is almost entirely created by the issuer.  There is very little in the inherent advantages of badges that appeals to employers. They are basically unfamiliar with the paradigm of digital mini-credentials (badges and backpacks).  Any value they attach to them is mainly from the reputation of the issuer.  \"If Purdue issues these, they must be good...\" As my published friend like to remind me, there are no rough drafts.  Everything in writing is a first article because it will never stop circulating.  I have already had to revise badges while not being able to retract the old one. Once issued, they are chiseled in stone So I think the issuer must provide guidance and assure quality.  At least, tell the professors not to issue badges for just showing up.  We have enough of that already.

If you don't want to make the content of a badge publically available, then why use a badge in the first place? - the whole point of them is to be distributed and this allows for that to happen via the backpack process. Not to allow this would kill the backpack itself as users would not then be able to use the backpack mechanism to push their badges out to other sites. You will comply with all laws and regulations, including having a\nlegally compliant privacy policy describing your role and interaction\nwith the Mozilla Badge Backpack as well as your collection, use,\nretention or disclosure of information used in badges as well as the\nMozilla Badge Backpack Terms of Use . Put very simply, Moodle provides the ability for 'Earners' to create a link enabling them to push their badges out to the backpack as they wish, it is not an automated process by Moodle, it is entirely in the hands of the user what they share with their backpack. Information is collected and stored within the internal Moodle database in the same way - and is subject to the same data protection regulations - as every other piece of information held on students in Moodle. Your badges will comply with our Content Guidelines . Yes, fine You will get Earner consent prior to sending a Badge to the Mozilla Badge Backpack. Moodle doesn't automatically send them, the user has to upload the badge to their backpack - their action, their consent. You will not send us the information of any user under the age of 13. For more information, see the COPPA FAQ , below. Not applicable in this case - no users under 13 None of your badges will contain content or other information that\ninfringes the rights of any third party (including intellectual\nproperty, privacy or publicity rights); The institution has a copyright office and runs internal training and courses about use of content Badges may only contain the user's email address, the issuer's\nname, the badge name and specific data about what the badge means such\nas the badge description and criteria URL , which is a URL pointing to a\npage hosted by the issuer that details all the criteria required for\nearning the badge. You will minimize any personal information inserted\ninto a badge's description by limiting that information to the\nachievement or accomplishment of skills, attainment of certification or\ncredentials. See the technical specifications about badges for more information. Fine - guidelines on what goes into a badge, but not really sure why you would put anything else anyway If you are an educational institution, the criteria for earning\nbadges may list required grades or minimum grades but the badge itself\nmay not contain any information indicating the actual grade received by\nthat Earner. For more information, see the FERPA FAQ below. Again, fine - Badge content contains its criteria, no personal info about actual grade obtained I can see some of these issues being significant if the system automatically pushed the badges externally, but that's not the case. Users have to set up their backpack, create the link between Moodle and their backpack and then push any badges they receive out to their backpack, so they have control all the way through the process. Possibly someone with more legal experience can tell me that my viewing of this is overly simplistic and we need a 500 page policy and process before we even started piloting this - but I really don't see the major issue here. These privacy guidelines appear to be common sense to me! Badges are intended to be public, otherwise why issue them? Students have the ability to control whether they push them to a publicly viewable location (their backpack and from there anywhere else), its not forced, they can choose not to (well in fact they have to actively choose to push them). And the data related to badges is subject to exactly the same data retention and data protection guidelines as every other piece of student information in the institution - its not like keeping student data electronically is a new issue that has to be dealt with from scratch. Can you clarify what of those guildelines you are struggling with and maybe someone (as I said with more legal experience than me) can enlighten both of us? Richard",

This is only happening with only some people, most people do receive the email which successfully links to the badge within Moodle. This is also only a very recent problem. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of issue? Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

I have set activities , and set completion settings on them, and set up badges for rewarding completing the activity. Sometimes the badge is issued, sometimes not. Do you have to set the activity up first, then the badge? Or is it the opposite way round? Also, for issuing badges by role, why can't we select students by group, rather than individually? All members of a group completed an activity successfully. I would like to award a badge to them as a group. I can't. I have to issue them individually which is very time consuming. Also, in badge settings,when you set notifications to 'daily' in Badge Messages, does this mean that the badges are only going to be issued daily (and the notifications) or the badges are going to be issued immediately, but the notifications daily?

First of all you might like to read through the documentation Managing badges and Using badges If you want badges awarded for completing an  activity then you should really make the activity first and set its completion conditions, because then they will appear as options when you create the badge. I'm not sure what you mean by \"issuing badges by role\" - this is when you choose who will be allowed to add badges in the course -eg a teacher or a non-editing teacher and it doesn't affect the students. If you want to award badges to a group of students it might be best to award them based on criteria so they are automatically awarded. However, if you are talking about awarding them manually then in the selection screen you can bulk select students so you don't have to award them one at a time. And for your last question, it means the notifications will come to you daily.",

The problems arise from students who finish the quiz but don't actually \"view\" the certificate.  They keep asking, \"where is their badge?\"  I have to explain over and over to view the certificate to \"get\" their badge.  Despite the written and view explanation (which they don't read or listen to), they still don't get it. The solution would be a completion criteria on the quiz itself that was a grade level that would directly trigger badge award.  Til then, I work with what I've got. Bill",

          "Text": "Hi! Just getting ready to implement badges for one of my classes, and I noticed that when I export a test badge to Backpack, it initially displays a 220px badge image. I had originally designed my badges at 128px, and so this oversized image looked awful. Fortunately, I hadn't gotten too far in yet, so I redesigned my existing badges at 256px--that should be plenty big enough, I thought. Created a new test badge, issued it, and sent it to my Backpack . . . 220px image was still pixellated. Then it occurred to me that Moodle itself was perhaps physically resizing badge images--this isn't a CSS thing, they're actually shrunk from the 256px ones I'm uploading. If this is the case, can I stop this from happening? I want to force Moodle to store 256px badge images. I've got admin access, and am not afraid to poke around in code--I'm just not sure where to start poking. Thanks!",

Mozilla doesn't recommend large images since backpack is caching them and it would create a problem on their end. If you want to look around in code, the images are processed in badgesli.php in badges_process_badge_image() function. It would be great if someone could contribute a better solution, as I don't have much time right now to do these kind of changes. Yuliya",

          "Text": "I want to weigh in on the need for larger image, since I stressed about it a lot.  My initial design used 118 badges, so I knew from the beginning that I would not be able to design independent graphics for so many topics. I choose a single graphic with a main topic below and subtopic in the center. See: http://pipingdesignu.com/?page_id=12 As to why I decided to stay with the standard 100 x 100 size, it has to do with collection lots of badges: After two or three, bigger badges will clutter up the page.  If it displays, here is a category description with multiple badges: http://pipe.lms.infoassets.com/course/index.php?categoryid=15 Some topics have 7-8 badges. Eventually, the bigger badges would eat up the page and look out of place. Not to say that the wordy format wasn't a problem: Most graphic packages interlace the inserted text by default so it has to be shut off to remain readable in 8 pt or 7 pt size.  In paint.net, I also used a bold/compact Ariel font to fit in all the words necessary. So, my advice is to make the 100 x 100 size work and don't let Moodle compress it for you.  Every resampling and interlacing will make the image more fuzzy and is better controlled outside of Moodle.",

          "Text": "Hi Joshua, There are several reasons for that. First of all some badge criteria can include roles. Backup is designed the way that doesn't allow backing up/restoring roles without backing up users. Another reason is that we cannot backup/restore issued badges as that would involve baking badge images during restore which can be time/resource consuming. So, after badges are restored, all issued ones can be issued again to all the users who previously had them on the next cron run. Maybe there can be some kind of an additional setting that would allow to specify not to restore user badges. That would remove one of the constraints. But I am still not sure what to do with roles that depend on enrolled users... Please let me know if you have any suggestions or further questions. There is always room for improvements ;) Yuliya",

Do you think there should be some kind of visual indicator on a badge page (like this page https://moodle.org/badges/badge.php?hash=889e023f7e9b8e5e209b63bf9f9337d5513e81de ) that current recipient doesn't exist any more? To be clear, we don't want to delete badges when user is deleted. It's important to keep them because if a user has added their badges to the Mozilla backpack already, there is a link in badge details that goes back to Moodle site to show more information about this badge and the recipient.

Secondly, within the profile completion criteria, I notice (this could be my setup, so apologies if I'm being stupid) that there is no option for profile picture as a completion field. Is there are reason for this? How easy is it to add this on (I think there'd be a few people wanting to award small badges for users adding their own picture - I know we'd be one of those)?

Once we convert badge criteria into plugins, we expect that people will be able to create their own criteria for awarding badges and criteria options will expand. Yuliya",

I waited the appropriate 10 minutes for the Cron Job, and am sure activity completion was set up at the system, course, and activity levels. Is this an issue of order (badges need to be set up before the students take the quiz (or other assignment)?

Mozilla's Backpack (the only one currently supported in Moodle) requires you to use Persona, their identity mechanism, which in turn is linked to an email account that it has validated. All the external backpacks I have seen so far require some sort of email address. You can of course still issue badges to students in Moodle which will live on their Moodle profile in the Badges area without putting them in an external backpack at all. I presume you are using some sort of made-up email for the Moodle accounts of students who have no real email address? If so, be aware that when you issue a badge that it is valid only for that email address. Currently, Mozilla's Backpack will only allow you to upload a badge that was issued with the same email address as you are using for the backpack. By default, Moodle uses the user's Moodle email address for a badge. But, if the user has connected their external backpack to Moodle (in Administration > My profile settings> Badges > My backpack settings > Email address) with a different address, it will use that one instead as the badge recipient.",

The good news is that the recipient email address is added to the badge only at the moment of \"baking,\" that is, downloading or copying to the backpack.

Wouldn't that in effect invalidate an earned badge and do the same thing as deleting them? Perhaps adding options in the badge creation where several \"bar\" otions coud be added, like \"REVOKED, EXPIRED, INVALID\", or maybe a custom message could be put on badges.  Just an idea.

That's if you want the image file with the data in it. However, the data is always available in the database , so you can get all the information about an issued badge from there. Currently, Moodle only supports the Open Badges backpack for direct integation, but in the future it will probably support others. Some people in the corporate world are adding backpack capability to internal systems for collection. You might check out the OB Community site for more info: http://community.openbadges.org/",

For example on the Site badges page you could do something like this to hide the 'criteria' column: #page-badges-view .collection .criteria { display: none;} To hide other columns just change .criteria for one of the following: badgeimage name description awards If you wanted to shrink the badge image size you could do: #page-badges-view .collection .badgeimage img { width: 50px; height: 50px;} To shrink to half the current size. Not sure where you would want to apply a scrollbar but that can be done by setting the container height then using overflow: scroll; Simon",

          "Text": "Kat, For now, in a site with no internet access, assuming Moodle is already up and running, then for badges there are two considerations: 1) You should be able to make and issue badges without any problem even if Moodle is not connected to the net. But students will be able to download badges they have been awarded and possibly then use them elsewhere on the internet. In a sense badges are just image files with special data in them. So, like any file, they can be emailed or facebooked, etc. There is currently not a way in Moodle to prevent such downloading. 2) Each badge is given a unique 40 digit identifying number inside of it. If the badge is downloaded and saved by the student to their Open Badges backpack and the badge made public, then this number can be used in a URL that can be clicked on to take someone to the information page on your site about that badge. Here's one of mine: http://2013.imoot.org/badges/badge.php?hash=68f147136711f857deccbd5e74d689a72b1da8a9 If your site is not on the internet, of course, they won't be able to actually reach your site. But the URL is there to be seen. And if your site ever does show up on the web, then those links would work. One setting I suggest for badges is to turn off 'Site administration > Badges > Badge settings > Enable connection to external backpacks', since without an internet connection it won't work at all.",

In theory, I suppose any number would work as long as it was unique in your site for that badge issuance. The most proper way would be to make the number the same way as the code (in /lib/badgeslib.php) uniquehash = sha1(rand() . $userid . $this->id . $now) where $this->id is the badge id and $now is time(). You can use a site like http://www.sha1-lookup.com/ to generate the number if you have the time() and copy/paste in the id numbers to do this manually. I have not tried this at home ;) Randy",

First, when a user clicks on the badge or is awarded a new badge, there is a \" Download \" button. What's the purpose of this? How is it to be used? Secondly, I noticed that when I delete a badge from Moodle, it continues to show up for students. Is it possible to award a badge, then delete them? For example, if a teacher had mistakenly awarded one, or, if a student committed fraud that was later discovered... Can you check and see if this happens for you? Thirdly, I am wondering if I have to create all badges myself? I know that Mozilla has backpacks, but seeing as I am not using emails to award badges, where can I get a collection of badges? If I get them is the best place to put them in the repository? Thank you both for the quick response.",

          "Text": "Doug You might want to check out this http://openbadges.learningassistant.com/ from Mozilla on Open Badges. It will explain most of the background to answer your questions. Badges are not something created by or for Moodle, but an implementation in Moodle of Open Badges, which is an open source project made by Mozilla, already in use by lots of software in many industries besides education. To address your specific items: 1) Badges are downloadable since the whole idea is they belong to the person issued to, the recipient.  The recipient can download them to save to a badges collection known as the \"backpack\" - which is theirs and has nothing in particular to do with Moodle at all. 2) This is on purpose: badge templates deleted at the system or course level are archived, not truly deleted. This follows the Open Badges principle that once awarded, a badge belongs to the recipient, not the issuer. So badge once issued exist on its own, regardless of the status of the original badge template it came from. (My old junior high school exists no more, but I still have my diploma.) An issued badge has a unique URL that goes back to your Moodle site to allow validation. It needs to find information such as issuer, criteria, and other evidence of its validity somewhere. While the original template badge may not be active anymore, that data is required for reference (\"evidence\"). Currently, badges issued in error (for whatever reason) don't yet have a method of \"revocation.\" Mozilla is very aware and working on how to do that. 3) You don't have to make the images, as Mary noted, but you do have to make each badge. That is, you have to create each badge in Moodle with its criteria and so forth. A badge is the image file + the metadata associated with its recipient, issuer, criteria, a unique identifier, and so forth, and this metadata is 'baked' into it when it is awarded and issue to a user. Basically, once awarded, a badge is on its own out in the world, property of its recipient. Revocation will arrive one day, but as always ... Award wisely ;)",

Because it is an API change and requires database changes it will go into 2.6 rather than a 2.5 point release. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-39864 We will write a plugin authoring guide once the final format is confirmed. At the moment it is possible but not particularly easy. You can see what you need to change in the first comment in the tracker issue above.

Philosophically, I see badges as an exciting prospect to create permanent \"digital transcript\" of work as large as degrees and as small as small a tutorial or brief workshop. I sat through a demo of badges implementation in Moodle 2.5 at a Moot in Montana, USA last week and have also explored BadgePress in WordPress and also LearningDash/Credly systems. Here is a question I think we need to come up with an answer to this: badges seem somewhat universally tied to an email address. That makes sense as one of the few personally identifying pieces of data we have. That said... if you are using this framework in a University or K-12 infrastructure, the Moodle account is usually associated with an assigned K-12 or university address email address. It seems to me that those addresses are temporary and fleeting. We need to build functionality into this implementation of badges that allows students to direct their badge to a personal backback so that they can keep their records over time. Do I understand the issue correctly? Thanks, Jason",

          "Text": "That's right, the email address you use for your backpack can be any email address you like. However there are a few issues here: When you import a badge into a backpack the email address assigned to the badge must match. To get around this in Moodle we use the email address used to connect to your backpack when baking the badge, or fall back to your moodle email if that isn't set. This ensures badges exported from Moodle can be imported if you have connected to your backpack. The problem is, if you are issued several badges which are tied to your Moodle email, and then you manually download them and try to add them to a backpack that uses your personal email it won't let you (because the emails don't match). I think this can be solved by allowing a user to validate multiple email accounts within their backpack. That way a user could maintain control over a personal backpack but still import badges baked using their \"work/school\" email. There is an open badges issue about it here where I've posted my thoughts but it hasn't really progressed unfortunately: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/issues/42 A second way to interpret your comment is that you'd prefer badges not to be tied to any email address. I know Mozilla have designed their spec to support other identity \"types\" other than email, but email is the only one supported at the moment. Hope that helps, Simon",

Seems to me an obvious solution would be, on upload of the badge to the backpack, if the email does not match, query Persona whether that email is an already validated alternate one. (That may cross the 'authentication vs. authorization' line for them, but if so, I'd say then there's no point in using Persona for applications like backpacks then.) Personally, I consider this a blocker for using Moz Backpack until addressed. I can imagine all the privacy/policy issues trying to collect the email address for someone's backpack in Moodle. If someone has connected a backpack, that's one thing, but people should not be required to put that info in Moodle (or any other application) in order to be issued valid badges.",

Any trademark or copyright infringement would be the issuer's problem, not Mozilla's. One thing I'd suggest right away is that the \"badge issuer\" email should be carefully considered. I'd suggest creating a distinct one for this purpose at the site level and seriously consider whether to tell teachers at the course level that they can use their own email or not as Issuer. Next, since there is no method yet of revocation, I'd suggest telling course badge issuers to use expiration dates, especially for test badges. Until there's a way to have a sitewide collection of badges to pull from, a good practice would be to put all \"official\" images somewhere for teachers to use as blanks. Many schools have some sort of official policy already on copyrighted material use by faculty. The language probably covers images used in badges already, but it might be good to make that explicit.

It will depend on how your gradebook calculates: if you are using simple weighted mean of grades, the number would be the percentage (e.g. 80); if using points (sum of grades) then you'd put the number of points to pass. The purpose of a badge using grade criteria is to allow you to award a badge for a grade in the course that might be different from the course completion criteria grade. For example, course completion might be set at 80% to pass (which could earn a badge) but you could have a badge for 100% for a perfect score too. Or if someone did not complete the course at 80%, you could still award a badge for 'participation' set at a lower number, like 50 or 60, for example. Or, your course completion criteria might not have any grade requirement at all, only activity completion. A person could complete the course but not get a badge for that, but could get a badge for the score with this setting.

During analysing badges feature we found some issues that should be solved.  If we haven't found some existing features or settings. Most organization will start work with badges in test courses. The badges users get from this courses can't be deleted. This should be possible. If a students gets a quiz result and therefor a badge, but afterwords the teachers finds that the student cheated during the quiz, normally he would delete the quiz attempt and results. It should be possible to delete such badges by anybody inthe system. Its clear that there is no influence if the student exported the badge in between. There are lots or workers council contracts that personal data about performance data. Most of the time its not allowed to hold such data endless in databases. They have to be deleted fully if a students gets from the school/univesity, the employee leaves the company of time based after some years. Its  a little bit similar to log data that have to be deleted after weeks or months. We didn't found an option to really delete such data in the database fully. Our suggestion: Add system settings: - delete user badge data if the account is deleted - delete badges after x month, x years fully. Ralf Hilgenstock German Moodle Partner",

To do that securely will require cross network and application communication standards (yet to be decided on or built) and a ping back mechanism from the badge or backpack to the original issuer. That's not a trivial problem. Until all that happens, the best an application can do is add some features to better handle the badges at the local level - like marking a badge as \"test\" etc. - knowing that once the badge is downloaded by the user, it it an independent entity.",

          "Text": "Well I'm using Moodle as a bit of a pilot for my school, I'm running the whole thing alone and only I'm using it, but I like to play with the new toys I get given when they arrive so I've been messing with badges too. I've been playing with awarding them for various things but it's exam season now and no pupils are actually doing any Moodle work so feedback is quite hard to come by. I'll give you my ideas though: I've set every activity to award a badge on completion. My completion settings are set to only allow activity completion if the student scores above a certain grade, and attempts is set to 'unlimited'. The idea is to encourage pupils to do activities over and over until they get a good grade, thus learning the material much better. This is of limited usefulness with multiple choice questions as they tend to just click submit before attempting the quiz, get all the answers, write them down and input them. Fortunately I teach physics and this can't be done with a calculated question, so I use those extensively. I also award a course completion badge. Since the completion settings for each activity are set to only allow completion on receipt of a high enough grade this is aimed at encouraging pupils to complete every quiz in the course to a high standard to fill any gaps in their knowledge or understanding. I've dabbled with giving out badges to teachers who try out Moodle, but they are far less bothered by them than the pupils. In the future I'd like to award badges based on scores so I could give gold, silver and bronze badges for the same task with the very strong students striving for a complete set of gold badges (along with the big course completion badge) and lower ability pupils aiming for the lower badges but still being rewarded for completing activities. This isn't possible with the badge system at the moment though. I'll give you a bit more feedback about how this has worked when I actually see some pupils, which is likely to be around September now as we're off on Summer holidays in the not too distant future. Hope this helps.",

Which of the options do you think is the most suitable for this purpose? a) Badges? - I created a Peer Helper badge, but I realised manager A (in trainer's role) can only assign the badge once to manager B. If in the following month manager A posts a question again and again manager B submits the best response, manager A will not be able to issue another badge to manager B. b) Scales / Rating drop down in the forum? - in which case what would be the best way for tracking who collected how many points / stars in total (I tried to use the grader report, but for some reason I am not getting the results I want - I would like to be able to quickly track who collected e.g. 10 points in total and assign then to that person a badge manually). c) Facebook type \"likes\"?

It's definitely something that we'd like to do though and it should be fairly straightforward as criteria are designed to be extended. You could definitely create a feature bug in the tracker for that one. The second part (removing the earlier badges when the later ones are achieved) would be more work. I know Mozilla have some plans around badges that \"fill up\" as you progress so that might meet your needs. Currently that's scheduled to be implemented by Mozilla in version 1.5 (third quarter of this year): https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Open-Badge-Infrastructure-Roadmap The only info I can find on the open badges wiki is here: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Discussion:-Composite-and-Ranked-(or-Leveled)-badges./afa0e86bace1fe8e042eafb241f6743aea0ff08e but it's an old discussion from their wiki that has since been deleted.

          "Text": "Hi Mary, Yes you are right there is a bit of an issue here. If you set up an external backpack connection you are able to say which badges you want to display in Moodle. Since you are explicitly choosing to share those badges they appear on your profile automatically. On the other hand we originally didn't want to automatically push badges earnt on the site straight to the profile, in order to give the user control over what was shared. So as of right now new \"internal\" badges are hidden from the profile by default, and must be explicitly shared to be visible. We have subsequently realised what you say (about it requiring an extra step that people may not remember to do), so as part of some improvements to the backpack connection we've added a user setting - \" Automatically show badges I earn on my profile page \" which we've enabled by default. That means that: New badges earned from the site will appear on a user's profile by default They can still choose to hide individually badges (on their My Badges) page If they want they can have new badges default to hidden, and only show the ones the want to (by making them visible on their My Badges page). Hopefully that addresses your point but still gives the users control over their how they show their badges. The patch that includes this change is awaiting review here: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/ MDL-39063 We are hopeful it will make it into 2.5.0, if not it will be in 2.5.1. Simon",

          "Text": "I must apologise for what may be random, incoherent mumblings, but here are a few thoughts that popped into my head ... and as such are influenced by our local circumstances and may not therefore apply universally. A badge conveys a message about the holder, intended for an audience or audiences. If Moodle acts as  \"displayer\" and a \"issuer\" of badges, there at least two sets of audience: internal to the organisation and external. Assuming for a moment that a Badge recipient will wish to display to both sets, then we in our school need to ensure that the badge can 'get out.' Not being familiar with the mechanics(electronics?!) of how that might occur, I'm more than aware that data pathways in and out of our organisation aren't always ... free-flowing ... for valid reasons! Ports, proxies, protocols and IP addresses are just a few of the terms with which I have just sufficient knowledge to know they might be significant. If Moodle is to 'push' Badges to an external backpack, can anyone tell me whether whatever is implemented is likely to be able negotiate a communication pathway between a typical(?) school internal Moodle implementation, to an external backpack provider? Or is the 3rd option suggested (\"Don't implement the external backpack...\") likely to be more effective, whilst clearly not providing the same degree of seamless experience for the Badge recipient as we might like? Thinking also about the ' Assertions ' and specifically \"...hosting a public key at a well known, public URL .\" In the case of a local Moodle behind a an educational Gateway, is this possible? Or will the 'key' be held externally from the school Moodle? Will it be taken care of during the Module design process? Or (as is likely!), is my understanding currently too limited? On a separate, but related theme, if Badges are to carry 'weight' or have some degree of credence in more formal settings, it is likely that the 'audience' in those circumstances might want to inspect evidence of achievement - one of the 'optional' badge fields. Would I be right in thinking that this is where Mahara naturally sits? And if we don't have Mahara, we need to find an alternative way of surfacing the evidence produced en route to satisying the Badge criteria? OK, brain starting to hurt.",

          "Text": "Hi Ian, Excellent point - we'll definitely need to consider the technicalities of getting data in and out. For getting the badges out, ideally it would be possible to \"push\" then to your backpack automatically, but there is at least a manual fallback - the badges are PNG image files with all the metadata built into the image so the user could just download their badge and upload it into the backpack. As for verifying badges received from a moodle site behind a firewall, that's a very good question! I'm in discussions with the open badges folks at the moment so I'll ask them how this situation is handled - I'm sure it's something that must have come up before now. We hadn't put much thought into how to handle evidence yet - but as you said badges do support it - we'll add a couple of user stories to capture the ideas but it will have a lower priority than getting an initial implementation out there. Thanks very much, great feedback! Simon",
