          "Text": "I am using the Choice activity to have students sign up for in-class presentations over the course of several days. I can use the Choice function to let them sign up for times and limit how many can sign up for a single day so we spread people out. However, I'd like to have an option for them to then answer a short response with the topic of their presentation so I (and the class) can see what topics will be presented each day. Is there any way to add a second question to the Choice activity, or include a \"comment\" on the choice selected where students could input their topic? Alternatively, are there any question types available in the Feedback or Quiz modules that would accomplish the same function as the Choice? I could build the short answer question into a Feedback activity, but I couldn't find any option for a \"signup\" type question where the number of responses to each choice is limited. I could, of course, use two different modules for the two different questions, but that is awkward and likely to get poor response from students.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone! Trying to implement a guided route\non the educational material for my students using restricted access, I\nrealized that something is missing from Moodle. There is no way to\nrestrict access based on a choice activity. (*see note below) The restrictions that can be imposed on content are based on the following factors: activity completion date grades group grouping profile I strongly believe that adding the extra factor of \"choice\" on\nthe restrictions would help greatly and I believe that it shouldn't be\ntechnically difficult to do so. What do you think? This feature has been mentioned multiple times in earlier discussions: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=226273 (I agree with Mary and I have used this method, but this is different) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221923 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=335529 Thanks in advance! (*) Note: There is a complicated way to do something similar, but not exactly this. By using the group choice plugin and the restriction\nby group, we can partially achieve this, but it requires an extra\nplugin and makes the restriction global for the whole course, not just\nfor the part that is needed. Added to this, in case where groups are\nneeded for other use, this workaround is not suitable.",

We use choices almost like sign-ups, presenting time slots of availability. Some of our central workshops would like to use the Choice activity to allow students to book into their resources, without the need to be enrolled into their 'pages' (courses) - Wouldn't want student  dashboards to be full of 'upcoming' events. Appreciate that the end date could be removed, but it is useful. From a few historic posts, it suggests that Choice activities cannot be complete by unenrolled users by design, post Moodle 2.0 - Can anyone shed any light? If there are any alternatives in the standard Moodle activities that you can recommend instead, I'm more than happy to take a look. Many thanks as always, Anthony",

Currently, completion tracking does not distinguish between choices made. Such a change outlined above would also potentially require ability for a user to change their selection from \"stop\" to \"continue\" option. Dan, do you think such a change is practical in the wider Choice module, or should we look at a local customisation? Can you estimate the amount of work required to make such changes? Others here, do you have an alternative method (preferably that's not using the quiz module, since it's rather a clunky solution to the problem) for acting as a \"gatekeeper\" on a user's progress in the course?",

If I change roles to view the page as a \"student\", so that the voting displays anonymously, my CHOICE activity requires me to vote as the \"student\" before seeing the results...thereby skewing the actual voting by 1 vote! So....my question is: How, as the teacher, can I display the final voting results to my class for discussion....without also displaying the names of each student publicly? PS - I realize I could log in as one of the students in my classroom....but is there any other way?  Surely there must be! Thanks!",

In both cases, when I look at the Choice activity as a teacher, I can see a bar graph with the response count but without the names. The names appear only if I click on \"View responses\". These workarounds are not perfect if one uses Moodle as an alternative to clickers in that with (1) students may be influenced by the choices of classmates who vote before them (visible on their mobile devices) and with (2) it may be cumbersome to set up the right time to end the activity, especially if multiple activities are used in succession. Ideally, one would want the teacher to be able to see the graph even when the students cannot. If, however, the teacher asks the students to vote before the class and only wants to display the results in class, (2) seems fine. Best regards, Sergio Mazzarelli",

This was stopping the backup/export from working, although it never reported a problem. After physically emptying the log table and doing the backup again the import worked and the page works. It appears that the logs prevented the user table from importing which in turn stopped the articles as the user that created them did not exist. I hope our experience helps someone.",

I want to automate this completely, so I want to associate each question and option with an area of grammar so that when the students' responses are tabulated in the database , that I can then generate reports from. For an individual student I would like a report that shows the grammar areas that were passed and those that were failed. For a whole class I  would like to see the general trends with percentage breakdowns. Once I have this in place, a future development would be to then link the failed areas from the assessment to a customized set of online lessons and activities to address an individual student's weak areas. So is this level of customization easily do-able in Moodle? I'm  trying to decide now whether to try to use Moodle to make this, or to build it myself from scratch. Thanks for any advice...!",

I'd prefer it used it's own new capability instead of relying on the choice/delete capability. you will need to be careful with the limits and groups code to make sure it works with that. I'd also like to see the option to allow a teacher to make those selections even if the show unanswered column isn't shown. at the moment - a teacher can make a choice for a student if they have the \"login as\" capability, but that takes a lot more clicking around and is a much bigger capability, so I can see how adding this could be useful for some people! I don't have any \"standard tests\" documented, but it's something I should do at some point - it would be good to put some unit tests in place too! when you make your patch, it would be good if you could add it to a tracker issue in the Moodle Tracker (and link to the bug here!) To help facilitate getting it into Core, it would be really useful if you created a patch for 2.0 as well! thanks!",

I've been asked to find a way to allow students to select up to five from several (135) available projects. Each project can allow only five students to select it. Once all selections have been made the teacher will export the selections and use an algorithm someone else has provided to allocate one project to each student from their choices. So far I've worked out that I can restrict the number of students choosing a project using a Choice activity, but not allow more than one selection per choice. The Questionnaire/Feedback tool has the opposite problem; students can select up to 5 but the number of project selections can't be limited. Does anyone know of a way to do this? I'm open to third-party tools but would prefer to avoid patches to core code. Any help would be much appreciated.",

It even had a waiting queue feature, if I recall. It ensured that a student selected only a single date. So, in your case, you could have set up 5 identical instances for students to select their projects. I don't think that module is supported anymore but I haven't looked at it for quite a while.

Having seen it here first, I used it for my original primary school website as the children (and some of the staff!) prefered it to navigating menus. The custom menu option for Moodle 2 is a really useful tool to create menus without needing to go into the theme files themselves as you needed to do in Moodle1.9. It can be difficult to style, but if you find a theme you like as a starting point and explore how the menu is styled there, and then look at a few others, you can eventually find your way around it. The other thing with the Moodle2 custom menu is once you do get some experience playing round with the Moodle Themes , you can look at overriding the renderer to do all sorts of things with it. Maybe one step at a time, but keep on going - the moodle learning curve gets you there and with the support of the 2 Marys and others on these forums, everything is achievable!!! Rich",

Also i have another query once all my wonderful students have made their choice is their a simple way to create groups from the choice results.  Third and finally can students within a group be contacted without the information being broadcasted to those that are enrolled in the course. Our uni site has some courses running soon about this but they will be too late for the start of the session. Thanks Claire",

I've used both.  Feedback does everything I need and it seems a little easier to get a survey up and going. Hope this Helps! Scott",

I thought to make an exclusion list using the interface like assigning students to groups. However, this would require modifying the database , so ain't so trivial. I wonder whether in the interim I could whack it using groups. I'd have to be able to block one group from participating. Another alternative is for me to clone the choice into a new module.

Create a Choice in the 1st week of your course, then do a full backup of your course and save it seperately just in case you break something! then create a backup file with only the data you want - eg don't backup the user data and only include the choice module. - open a new copy of the moodle.xml file created inside the backup zip file. now follow the instructions in the attached file to this post - I couldn't get moodle to display the XML tags properly, so put these in a seperate file! after making the changes given in the attached file., restore the file - I would suggest to a new course first to make sure you didn't break anything! and then if that works restore it to your own course \"adding data to it\" - (you will end up with 2 choices in the first section, but you can just delete one of them!)

I I have poor php skills but I would envisage having to make a modification to the existing choice module so that when the choice_add_module() function is called a the forum_add_module() function is also called and passed some object with the relevent forum set up options. The text for the forum could be the choice question and the title of the forum the title of the choice. The database would have to be modified also , the choice_id would need to be present in the forum table and the forum_id stored to the choice table. Is there anyone who could offer help with this? Many Thanks, Colleen.",

I then notced that most of the user images displayed in the 'not answered yet' column were broken links. I tried cliking on some of the links. Only the teachers reported the correct users.

          "Title": "Weekend Activity Registration",
          "Text": "I teach at Linden Hall School, a private girls' boarding school with around 120 students.  We are looking for a better way to allow students to register for weekend activities , without being able to register their friends or remove others from the list to make room for themselves.  We typically have 20 to 25 activity choices on a given weekend. I have been playing around with using the quiz module for this, where we'd create a \"quiz\" each week that consisted of a single question with the ability to select several answer choices (each event they want to participate in) or a \"quiz\" where each event has a \"yes I want to attend this\" or \"No thank you\" response.  Then the student's name and their \"quiz\" results would be sent to the Residential Director who could create the list of those actually attending. The things that I think are missing though is a time-stamp so activities can be filled on a first-come-first-served basis with overflow going on a waiting list, or a way to set a limit to the number that can sign up for a particular event.  It would also be wonderful if we could have the Residential Director get a list of who selected which choices, in time order, but that's probably asking a bit much from a quiz module. Thomas Robb suggested that I take a look at the choice module, but the messages I've seen indicate that choices are limited to six options, which rather puts a crimp on how we can do the sign-ups when we run 20 to 25 activities each weekend.  We could seperate out in batches of 6 activities, but I'd rather just have a field of check boxes that the students can click on the activities they want to sign up for. Now, I haven't tried playing around with choice yet to make it fit, but can I get the outputs sorted by choice and time-stamp order?  That is, everyone who selected \"Grocery Trip, Fri, 3:15-4:15\" in the order that they submitted their request so that we can just fill up the vans and the rest are put on a waiting list when the van capacity is full? Also, is it possible to select more than one choice per question?  Sorry, I know I should probably try playing around with this myself, but I haven't had the time to get to it yet, and if these aren't possible, I'll keep trying to play with the quiz module.",

          "Text": "Hi! I've just discovered your very cool program and am extremely excited about adding it to my site! However, it looks like my usage will be a bit difference than most of your other examples. I run a website for a large, worldwide historical re-creation group called the Society for Creative Anachronism (\"SCA\") which researches and recreates the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. I will be using Moodle to allow various people in the SCA to offer classes on subjects they have researched.  As such, I don't have a pre-set, 100% reliable teacher base. Consequently, I'd love to be able to have the students rate the teachers after the class re: skill, knowledge, responsiveness, etc. so that I can weed out the not so good ones. Is there any function for something like this? Or any chance of one in a future version? Regardless, this looks like an awesome program and I'm thrilled to have found it! Thanks!",
