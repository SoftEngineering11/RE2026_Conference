          "Text": "Hi @Dan, We've recently noticed that for workshop registrations, the format of the listings for those currently enrolled in a listed workshop has changed from the order in which registrations are received, to A-Z listings based on first name when viewing as admin user. As the formatting has changed to A-Z, it's now unclear whether the waitlist function would still be able to track next-in-line if someone registered cancels their registration. Therefore, if a workshop becomes full and several individuals are waitlisted, is the first waitlisted person still offered a position first? Does the waitlist function recognise a time-stamp of when people register to manage this, or is this new A-Z listing structure likely to impact the waitlist function for students? We look forward to your advice.",

I have recently joined a new business who uses moodle as their LMS, they currently don't use face to face plugin (we require our service provider to update moodle version), at the moment F2F training is kept on a spreadsheet and separate etc. I am trying to show them the benefits of adopting the F2F plugin and how it will a more automated system and move away from manual tasks (calendars, emails etc). Does anyone have a video they can share of the F2F in action - planned calendar, booking people on, emails sent and taking attendance. I hope someone will be able to help me with this. Thanks",

          "Text": "Hi folks, We have an older version of Moodle (3.9.3 I believe - for a variety of reasons we can't currently shift to a newer version at the moment) with Face2Face - and one of our biggest issues is we need to do manual enrolment for each user, and then manually add them to the attendee list of events when we're doing bulk uploads for people who attended a session. This is a pretty common need in our LMS, as even though most groups within our organisation use F2F as intended, there are some that we need to add manually. So my query is this - is there a way to search users in bulk through the \"add/remove attendees\" screen? I'm aware that it seems to use the core moodle \"add potential users\" search function, or whatever the appropriate name for this bit is - and I've searched quite a bit without getting a definitive answer. What I'd like to be able to do is copy+paste a bunch of email addresses or usernames into the search and have it search for multiple at once, but I can't find a method. Is this even possible? Currently no matter what syntax I use in this search area I can't find a way to search for more than one email address at a time. My main reason for asking is that in other areas of the LMS (such as bulk enrolments) it seems quite doable. Cheers, Allan.",

As  we would like to customize this to include media such as images and colors, we are currently looking into modifying the code base to include the Moodle Atto Editor. We have replaced the plain 'text area' in the code base with a rich text editor that allows you to add html formatted messages for the confirmation. At the current stage, HTML Messages can be created, stored in the DB next to the appropriate F2F instance and values can be updated for the confirmation message. On testing the messages are also sent out as rich text to the users. We are currently facing an issue where when an user presses \"Edit Settings\" of the block, the section with Confirmation message does not show the latest updated message (although it is stored in the DB), instead it shows the default text that the editor has been initialized with. We are trying to locate the function that populates the \"Edit Settings\" Page of the block. So we could check why the Confirmation message field (which is now of type editor) is not able to fetch and populate with the updated message which is available in the DB.

I work in a hospital in the UK, and have a couple of major software deployments later on this year.  I've got E-Learning added and mandatory competency skills checks scheduled using the Face-to-face module starting in October. I have to report to the Trust board on a fortnightly basis. Until the competency checks have begun and we start marking students as having completed the check, I need to report on the face-to-face bookings made. Every User in the course (1500+) is enrolled as a student and added to a group (so I can track where they actually work and their work role, (ie., central theatres, Practitioner). I use Configurable Reports in my Moodle instance, and have a lovely report that I put together to show every enrolled user, their group, and whether they have been marked as competent (completed by a trainer) when they have successfully completed the mandatory skills check. This report works beautifully. Until we start doing the competency skills checks my reporting criteria is that users are scheduled on to a competency check.  Once we hit 90% of users scheduled the focus moves to competency skills checks successfully completed. So, I can get the students, in groups, who have completed the skills check, in one single report, using the Configurable Reports plugin. To get the scheduled users, I have to export the face-to-face sessions to a spreadsheet, create a unique ID, copy in to the configurable report downloaded spreadsheet, then do VLOOKUPs and CountIF(s) to get the percentage of users in each group who are scheduled for a check. Can anyone help me get this on to one configurable report please?  I've been trying, but having no look. Here's the configurable report to get the username, group and completion status for the competency skills check: *********************************** SELECT c.shortname AS Course, g.name AS Groupname, u.firstname, u.lastname, CONCAT(u.firstname ,'',u.lastname) AS 'Unique ID', er.enrol AS enrolmethod,  FROM_UNIXTIME(cc.timecompleted) AS CompletionDate FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_groups AS g ON g.courseid = c.id JOIN prefix_groups_members AS m ON g.id = m.groupid JOIN prefix_user AS u ON  m.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_enrol AS er ON er.courseid = c.id JOIN prefix_user_enrolments AS ue ON ue.enrolid = er.id AND ue.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_course_completions AS cc ON cc.course = c.id AND cc.userid = u.id WHERE c.id = %%COURSEID%% ***************************************** I'd be forever in your debt Thanks in advance if anyone can help Alan",

However, we have very large population of participants and very few people to actually watch the attendance. It would be hard to compare each person and mark people who didn't show up as no-show.  Is there a way to just open up the registration list to allow multiple signing up? Thanks!!",

Back in '08, still in the days of 1.9...I did a bunch of research on something like this. I found nothing that has the functionality of f2f...attendance might be more what you're looking for...but I think it tracks more of a day to day thing and, again, requires marking. At my prior job, we customized f2f to add an attendance by id option. We all had magnetic strip ID badges that had our id numbers coded in, so we could connect a usb swiper (or use a keyboard with a swiper) and as people walked in, they could swipe for attendance. Or the teacher could type in their ID's manually. Or could copy the list of swipes and paste it in for additional sessions (we frequently had back to back classes and people were required to attend several on the same day). It was pretty slick. The guy who wrote the code said it wasn't too hard. But that was a code hack and I can't share it...I don't work there any longer and they a) stopped using moodle and b) were resistant to sharing (I don't know why, the director was like that. Didn't like Moodle or open source, liked secret squirrel, now he's paying over $50,000 a year for something that doesn't have the flexibility Moodle has).",

          "Text": "Hi All, I am running into a problem with calendar notification reminders being sent to users who are enrolled in a Face-to-Face course but have not signed up for any of the included sessions. I want to know if this is default behavior. First, my course configurations are: \"Calendar display settings\" are set to \"Course\" Reminder messages are set to be sent two days prior to an event 10 sessions are available for signup Issue: Multiple users enrolled in the course, who have not signed up for a session, are receiving notifications for all of the sessions take place globally. Looking at the site local reminders settings (settings.php?section=local_reminders) I have reminders enabled for Course, User, and Site events. Does this mean that all users will receive event reminders for sessions they are not signed up for? If so, how are others managing these reminders? Are calendar event notifications disabled or is this not a concern?",

Have set it so no password is required to enroll. There are no restrictions in place at the course, topic or session level. Guest access has never had a password requirement, so it seems unlikely that it has a corrupted password.

We will be offering computer training classes on this platform. Most of the students will have access via LDAP or OAuth, but there will be times when we have some warehouse folks taking courses as well, and most of them do not have either of those login options. (We were, of course, not informed of this until way into the process of setting up the server and the software, go figure). We were also told late in the game that some warehouse managers might want to bulk enroll their employees. The biggest issue is that (as near as I can tell), Moodle requires each student to have an email address. While I completely understand the need for that, it really limits our options for solving the problem. HR won't let them use personal emails. I'd just have them all register under their manager's email address, but I'm pretty sure Moodle doesn't allow that, either. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

There is no native way to take attendance for everyone--at a previous job one of my techy coworkers wrote a script to add a link to the options which opened a page where you could enter an id number for each attendee and then submit in bulk.  It would also manually enroll people who showed up without signing up.  It was pretty slick.  But it did require an ID number. Our staff had a badge with an embedded code for their ID so they could swipe into the job sites...his code added something that with a USB swiper would read the id and made it super fast.

We are switching over to Moodle and have data from or old system which has the structure of multiple Classes within a course, the equivalent to multiple Sessions in a Topic in Moodle. Moving forward in Moodle, the structure we have set is: 1. within a course there are multiple topics (doing different things), 2. in one of the Topics of a Course there are multiple Face to Face activities (1 for each state  the course is presented in 3. In each fact to Face activity there are multiple sessions which are run in each State We want to be able to import all the historical classes into the session within each state activity of face to face. We have tried it, and each imported class becomes its own course with blank topics in them. this then makes it hard as there becomes so many courses, and a mess. some of these courses prerequisites for future course, and instead of just making the prerequisite for 1 course, we will have to create it for every course (Too many) Please Help, I am a novice at this and the person which was assisting (which was more experienced) is no longer working for our company.",

If an existing Face to Face session is duplicated (to save time typing out all again), the text in the introduction field is not copied across. If you then try to copy and paste them from the original, it does not display the new text (although it does show it in the editor). 2. Once a Face to Face session is created and saved, if further edits are required they do not display the new edits (although they do show in the editor). Thank you Ruthine Burton",

Am I correct to expect that if a face to face activity setting is 'student must receive a grade' then when a student attendance is marked as 'fully attended' the activity will be marked as complete? In some of our face to face activities students are manually added to a session.  They are, therefore, never 'active' on the course, would this effect them being marked as complete, even if they have been marked 'fully attended'?

          "Text": "Generally, that should be correct.  Did you ensure you did not check the 'student must view the activity' box--that would prevent completion.  Are students able to look, even if they don't have to? I tend to also add a grade to pass in the gradebook (too bad the newer versions don't include this in activity settings the way Quiz and Lesson do)--because it considers a 0 a grade and will give completion for a 0--but if you do all of it manually, maybe that never happens for you. Another issue I've seen is sometimes an activity will get locked in the gradebook somehow (no one ever knows how it happens) and then it won't actually register the grade or the completion.  If you go to the grade book and go to Gradebook setup, edit settings for the activity in question, there is a locked box and, if you open the More option, a timed lock.  I'd guess that isn't the problem, but it does happen (at my previous job it happened at least once a year to someone and we had about 1500+ facetoface activities going).",

I am running a heavily hacked version of Face to Face and am having a problem with the module not retrieving the 'details' from a session when it is edited. I mean, when a user (teacher or admin) clicks on the edit button to edit a session, the details for that session are not retrieved and the html editor is thus blank. If the user changes the time, for example, and then saves the edit, the details are effectively erased. We have had this problem for a long time and have put up with it but now that I've managed to update everything for 3.2 (including the date issue discussed here) I was hoping to fix this issue but am stuck. I've poked around in sessions.php and view.php for so long now that I'm starting to get bug eyed. I wonder if anyone might have any ideas about where I should look? For reference, we are using a version of the Face to face module that: 1. Allows for multiple reservations within one instance of face to face (multiplession version) 2. Allows for a maximum number of reservations per one month period (adjustable via in module setting) 3. Allows for reservation lock if students miss more than a set number of sessions (without canceling) 4. Removes the ability to cancel from one hour prior to the start of the session with a direct contact (via phone) message displayed. 5. Prevents users from making more that a set number of reservations per day (adjustable via in module setting) 6. Has customized attendance settings to enable #3 above to function Due to all these customizations, I basically have to keep this version but would love to get this little bug fixed. Regards Jason",

Meaning I have a blended format of a course on Moodle and my users are already in cohort. I have a face to face session integrated in this course.  I created groups because I have a few face to face sessions in the morning and in the afternoon. I put conditional access to the morning or the afternoon sessions depending on group affiliation (group A or group B). It would be so practical if one can add a cohort or a group directly to a face to face. So far this is done manually. which is a pain because i have to upload users, enrol them in their cohort, add them to their groups. But I have also to add them to the face to face manually.

          "Text": "I posted this message at the bottom of a different thread which wasn't the most appropriate location so I'm creating a new discussion topic here. Maybe someone can help...? I am running a heavily hacked version of Face to Face and am having a problem with the module not retrieving the 'details' from a session when it is edited. I mean, when a user (teacher or admin) clicks on the edit button to edit a session, the details for that session are not retrieved from the database and the html editor is thus blank. If the user changes the time, for example, and then saves the edit, the details are effectively erased. We have had this problem for a long time and have put up with it but now that I've managed to update everything for 3.2 (including the date issue discussed in other threads) I was hoping to fix this issue but am stuck. I've poked around in sessions.php and view.php for so long now that I'm starting to get bug eyed. I wonder if anyone might have any ideas about where I should look? On the screen where the sessions can be viewed (view.php) I have the details displayed but when clicking on the edit icon on that screen those details don't populate the html editor. I wonder if this is because I've tweaked view.php and assigned the details variable to a new variable in order to display it from view.php? For reference, we are using a version of the Face to face module that: 1. Allows for multiple reservations within one instance of face to face (multiplession version) 2. Allows for a maximum number of reservations per one month period (adjustable via in module setting) 3. Allows for reservation lock if students miss more than a set number of sessions (without canceling) 4. Removes the ability to cancel from one hour prior to the start of the session with a direct contact (via phone) message displayed. 5. Prevents users from making more that a set number of reservations per day (adjustable via in module setting) 6. Has customized attendance settings to enable #3 above to function Due to all these customizations, I basically have to keep this version but would love to get this little bug fixed. Regards Jason P.S. Attached is a screen shot of the view I have from view.php (notice the details displayed here...different from the standard F2F version)",

I have one request that may be a big one but I wanted to propose it here to see if others would be interested as well as to see if I could get some feedback on how difficult it would be to include. What we would really like (benefit from) is the ability to format sessions in a csv file (via Excel etc.) and then upload those sessions in bulk. This would make it very easy for us to generate many sessions at once. As it is now, it does require quite a bit of time to set up the sessions if you are, for example, attempting to set up ten sessions a week (40+ sessions a month). It isn't impossible for us to use the plugin (mod) as it is but this capability would be the icing on the cake for us. Sincerely Jason",

I'm going to continue to document my ignorant adventure here I added a foreach statement and thought I'd figured it out as both of the bookings that I'd made as a student appeared (when logged in as that student) as booked. Yeah!, I thought but the problem however, is that when I cancel one of the bookings, it doesn't show up as being cancelled to the student. Additionally, when the student is only booked to one session, the session that appears as being booked (from the capacity count) is the last one in the set (last meaning the one that is furthest in the future) even though a different session is the one that was booked (and it does show up that way in the database - the correct way I mean)...? Why did my adjustment throw off the capacity counter...?

We have an initial solution for this, by calculating an average score based on this attendance for the entire activity if a user is signed up to more than one session.

That would incorporate quite a bit of flexibility in terms of grading options for various users. Just an idea. Jason P.S. Oh, wait, I see. There is only one value per face-to-face activity but now with multiple sessions per activity this poses a problem. Sorry, I didn't quite get it when I posted the message above.

It also requires that an agreed solution is reached and that it fits most of the users, and also that the module maintainer sees it fit to implement the chosen approach. In any case, being open code, others can always make their own variations on the module regarding grades management and any other aspects. For now, we've opted to go for a quicker solution that fit the current structure. We have done other modifications for clients in the past, for instrance the ability to mark attendance for each date in a session, and along with that the ability to choose that grade be set automatically according to percentage of participation in multiple dates, or manually by the teacher.

For example: Server time is set to \"America/Chicago\" User time is set to \"America/Los_Angeles\" Session scheduled time is 11:00AM to 2:00PM America/Chicago which is the same as 9:00AM to 12:00PM America/Los_Angeles Reminder email for user says \"11:00AM to 2:00PM America/Los_Angeles\" but is should say \"9:00AM to 12:00PM America/Los_Angeles\".

Example: I have as many as 5000 users at any given time (far more accounts at this point) and a few hundred classroom events (topics) going on each year.  Those users are eligible (mandated!) to attend specific topics in specific locations.  Each topic has a F2F section with all the available sessions people can sign up for...If we teach Sexual Harassment (don't do it) 10 times, and there are 250 staff who can sign up for the class, I create one activity with 10 sessions, each, in theory, accommodating 25 people.

          "Text": "Hi all, As you may be aware this plugin is sometimes supported and sometimes not. There are a few reasons for this and I am trying to rectify some of those as I go through things and sorry for the delays. One problem that the community of users can help me with is the way in which issues are being reported. At the moment there are many different threads being opened - here, in the plugin directory feedback, github, private messages to me etc - sometimes reporting the same issue or something that might be resolved within a different version. This means that it is difficult to track the exact issues and clearly identify where and when things should be corrected and to let the community know of updated code. I have switched off bug reporting on the github directory itself in the hopes that the Moodle tracker itself becomes the only place for issues to be reported. I'd like to also build a roadmap for coming versions and feature improvements so having all the issues in one place will really help this plan moving forward. There have been, since I took over maintenance, a few things I'd like to add and alter but first I need to get the current code into a consistent state. If you experience a issue please first check the tracker to see if there is an item already reporting this which you can add to and/or vote on and if not then please create a new one. The forums and plugin comments should ideally be used only for questions regarding general support such as configuration questions, suggestions for features and their related discussions and general use or feedback of the module. I will not be able to support bugs reported in these locations. In the meantime, thank you for your patience, Stacey",

As I understand it, the problem has to do with the upgrade to Moodle 2.8 and that the F2F plugin has not been updated. It appears that it is not a priority of the developers. What a shame, as this plugin has worked very well in the past and is important to my operation. Does anyone knows another plugin that could be used instead? Should I revert to an older Moodle? Or is there anyone out there that has the ability to update the F2F plugin?",

I think this is a bug because it it not presenting the correct information to the student. I understand what you are saying regarding the Face-to-Face being an activity module, but within the context of being a manager this is problematic because it means I need to either be enrolled or enroll in every course that my employees could \"potentially\" take.  This causes additional problems for me as a manager who also needs to maintain a certain number of courses/trainings through the year because now I am enrolled in courses that I have no desire or intention to complete.

We use the Face-to-face activity to allow learners to sign up for in person sessions and we also use prerequisites to track learner progress, etc. If we have multiple sessions available for one Face-to-face activity and the requirement for the course completion is a grade (attendance) in the face-to-face activity does it effect the course completion if they only sign up for one session? Or for the course completion to work properly with the prerequisities would they have to sign up for each session? Sorry if that is really confusing... Thank you in advance for your time and/or ideas!!",

You can test this by setting up more than one session for a face to face and see if the same student can sign up to multiple sessions. To accomplish this in our setting we have to set up separate face to face activities , each with its own sessions. Your bigger problem might be that F2F counts any attendance status (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) as being a valid completion. This is also a problem for us but I have not had time to look into the solution that the followup message to this thread offers: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=225026",

My other answer to the above is - I have remmed out the lines that have partially attended or no show - if someone doesn't show, the facilitator actually removes them from the session. This way, they have to get a \"Attended\" to get a course completion. Obviously this may not work for everyone. Incidently, I have a cancellation report, which picks out students that have cancelled sessions and why, and when the person cancelling the session is not the student, puts it as a \"No Show\" Cheers Peter",

Thanks for the info about the partially attended or no show -- we want to record no shows, though. We are working on a custom addition to Face to Face that adds another layer of approval after the manager approval so that an account number can be entered by a fund manager. In addition, the approval links that take the approvers to their approvals filter the approvals on the page so that only their own approvals show, AND the approver does not need the permission to the entire Attendees page if they use the link to access the approvals page. I hope that we can eventually get this code and some other code we are customizing in F2F incorporated into the main F2F module. Will tell more as it develops in case others are interested.",

By default, Moodle sets the default grade to pass as 0 (who knows why...) Once you change this default to 100, then any F2F activity created will have the no show, partial attendence etc marked as failed, rather than passed. I then also did a cheeky back end database to all F2F sessions to have the gradetopass setting set to 100. I hope this helps someone else. Cheers Peter",

I did set the sessions and the roles (teacher and students, I couldn't find a manager role to assign), but if someone tries to enroll (even myself), get the message \" You are currently not assigned to a manager in the system. Please contact the site administrator. ! Of course I am the administrator, but I couldn't find the answer in the documentation. The FAQ says \"Starting with the Moodle 1.9 version of the Face-to-face module, a custom field called \"Manager's email\" is added to the user profile page\". But I don't see it in the user profile (I mean the one under site administration). Furthermore, adding the address to each student manually seems very cumbersome! So I guess there should be another way: is there a step-by-step guide? The only place to insert an email seems to be in the module settings \"sender address\", (as the sender should be the manger, I guess), but it doesn't work. There is a section \"Manager emails\" on the same page, but I couldn't understand those settings, particularly \"Ask users for their manager's email address.\" confused me. Should the student set their own manager's address? Could I be driven to some documentation that explain these issues, maybe starting from what a manager is and why should be different from the teacher? Thanks in advance for your patience",

          "Text": "Hi Piersante Once you setup Face2face every user will need to go into their individual user profile and enter an email address of their manager or a person who will approve their enrolment.  This is a must. The Face2face add-on uses a two-tier approval process. The first tier is the manager. Once the user sets their managers email address, they can go to a course and enrol. Upon their enrolment an email will be sent to their manager. The email will contacin a link for the manager to login and approve the enrolment. Once the manager has approved the enrolment, an email will be sent to the course coordinator /s. The course cordinator is anyone who has been given teacher or manager role within the course. You need to set these roles for every course. To approve the enrolment as a course coordinator, the person who has been allocated teacher or manager role for the course will log in and go to Site pages (left had side under home) and select Course coordinator approval. This is where the lis of students who have been approved to attend will show up for the course coordintor to approve to attend the course. Once the course coordinator approves the student, this completes the process. Please remember to set your course to use the Face2face add-on. Go to the course and under Users > Enrollment methods select Enrol Approval and move that to the top of the list (select the blue arrow). I normall delete the \"Self enrolment (student)\" if that is on the list. If it is grey out you dont need to worry. Manaul enrolments is normally at the bottom when using the Face2face add-on. You now need to set up your Face2face add-on by adding an activity. Go into the course, make sure editing is on and on the first topic you need to add a activity. Find the Face-to-face activity and select Add. You must add a name. I suggest you type in the name of the course as this will show up on the 2 emails as part of the enrolment process. You must check the following boxes: Approval required. Send notice to manager (confirmation message) Send notice to manager (Reminder message) Send notice to manager (Cancellation message) Click on Save and return to course Get a normal user with only student role to find the course and see is it asks you to enrol and put a justification in. Hope this helps Peter",

The only information that was missing is that you must create an user field in the user profile and populate it with the manager email for each student, This is very different from what the FAQ say, as they suggest that the field is already there. Not only this was not clear from the documentation, but it is cumbersome, as the default manager address is only inherited by new (or updated) users. I had to open and save all the students profiles one by one, to let them to get it (I suspect that I could have added the email address to the data user field table directly in the database , but I didn't dare to try). I find it also illogical, as the manager would usually belong to the activity rather than to the students (students might have different facetoface activities , each with a different manager), so one would expect it to be defined in the session properties, rather than globally. Nevertheless, thanks to your note I was qickly able to put the module at work and I find it wonderful and very flexible. I now have one more question: the confirmation email has fields for venue, room and location, which in my case are empty. Where do you set them? thanks, piersante",

The previous message (which referred to https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200970 ) called out a location in course/lib.php. The code has changed, however, and I believe in Moodle 2.5 the place is in course/renderer.php , in the course_session_cm_text() function, at about line 775. However, just adding this code at that spot still leaves the link to the face-to-face activity in place, so you see both the list of sessions and the link to the activity.  I didn't like that, so I made another change, as follows. In the same course/renderer.php file, but in the course_section_cm_name() function, near line 670, there is code like this: \n```text\n   $url = $mod->get_url();\n\n\n    if (!$url) {\n\n\n         return $output;\n\n\n    }\n```\n Following that code, I added a clause like this: \n```text\n  if ($mod->modname == 'facetoface') {\n\n\n       return $output;\n\n\n  }\n```\n Between these two changes it seems to do what I want.

I hard coded it into the module instead of making the feature selectable because I was in a hurry and am not a pro at PHP. Nevertheless, as a result of poking around in the code, I do know where the lines are that simply need to be commented out if you only want to remove the ability to cancel. But, you said you don't have access to the php files right...? I don't think it would be that hard to simply add a toggle/tick box that allows for canceling or no canceling. If I get some time I'll work with it a little and if I actually managed to get something working I will offer it to Alastair who I think is the current maintainer. Regards Jason",

The issue is within the backup_facetoface_stepslib.php - line 128 $session_data_element->set_source_table('facetoface_session_data', array('sessionid' => backup::VAR_PARENTID)); which does the back up of the data only if user data is selected. I would recommend it be removed out of the user backup section and place it in the data backup section. (I moved it to line 121 before the line if ($userinfo) { This allows things like location to be backed up without user data. Cheers Peter",

Our Environment Moodle v.1.94+ MS Exchange server 2003 (don't know which patch level). Disclaimer The changes below are what got my problem fixed at work. I don't guarantee that it will work for you. Use this information at your own risk. I also won't pretend this is the best solution out there. I am positive it can be improve in many ways. If you have problems with this solution and if I have the time to revisit this in the future I may look into it. A Tentative Solution Change the /moodle/moodlelib.php and the /moodle/mod/facetoface/lib.php files on the following fashion: moodle/mod/facetoface/lib.php Around line 1374, change this code: \n```text\nif\n \n(\n!\nemail_to_user\n(\n$user\n,\n \n$fromaddress\n,\n \n$attachment\n[\n'subject'\n]\n,\n \n$attachment\n[\n'body'\n]\n,\n\n\n$attachment\n[\n'htmlbody'\n]\n,\n \n$attachment\n[\n'filename'\n]\n,\n \n$attachmentfilename\n)\n)\n \n{\n```\n into this: \n```text\nif\n \n(\n!\nemail_to_user\n(\n$user\n,\n \n$fromaddress\n,\n \n$attachment\n[\n'subject'\n]\n,\n \nfile_get_contents\n(\n$CFG\n->\ndataroot\n \n.\n \n'/'\n \n.\n\n \n$attachment\n[\n'filename'\n]\n)\n,\n'ical'\n)\n)\n \n{\n```\n The change above will use the file attachment as the body if the user opted to send out an iCal invite and add a special marker (\"ical\") as the parameter for the changes we will make on the moodlelib.php moodle/moodlelib.php Around line 4117, after the global and static declarations, add the following code: \n```text\nif\n \n(\n$messagehtml\n \n==\n \n'ical'\n)\n \n{\n\n \n$messagehtml\n \n=\n \n''\n;\n\n \n$is_this_an_ical_request\n \n=\n \nTRUE\n;\n\n\n}\n```\n This will set a control variable if the user chose to send an iCal. Then, around the new line 4283, right before the if ($mail->Send()) { , add the following code: \n```text\nif\n \n(\n$is_this_an_ical_request\n)\n \n{\n\n \n$mail\n->\nContentType\n \n=\n \n'text/calendar; method=REQUEST; charset=\"UTF-8\"'\n;\n\n \n$mail\n->\nEncoding\n \n=\n \n'quoted-printable'\n;\n\n\n}\n```",

In my case, I am using it just to provide registration services for course sessions at a \"training day\" event. I have about 70 classes, each with one to six face-to-face sessions. So far it's going great. Participants have been creating logins and registering for sessions with few problems. I am in general very pleased. My problem is that I don't see how to easily generate a list of signups for all the course sessions. I see how to go to the course, view all sessions, and export attendance to an Excel file (i.e. site->course->Face-to-face->f2f_instance), but I haven't figured out a way to do that for all courses without visiting each of the 70 courses one at a time.

I might point out that the new version of the Face-to-Face block is apparently not available on the Moodle website, but is available at github - https://github.com/totara/facetoface-block-2.0 - and seems to work fine for me with Moodle v2.5",

When this piece of code is NOT commented out (as shown) it returns TRUE even when the session is at or above capacity - short circuiting its ability to indicate a session that is full.\n\nDoes this function get used by some other piece of f2f that needs those commented out lines? If this logic is required somewhere it will need to be moved out of the facetoface_session_has_capacity() function.\n\nFeedback? Does this function work \"as-is\" for others?\n\nThanks!\n-Rob",

To resolve these I had to make changes to mod/facetoface/db/upgrade.php, I've attached the patch to this post. To summarise the issues: $dbman->add_field(), create_table() and drop_field() appears to return void so don't assign this to $result. (This appears to be already known: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=217299 ). $OUTPUT->notification() is an empty object, add $OUTPUT to the list of globals at the start of xmldb_facetoface_upgrade(). Property $DB->debug isn't accessible (protected) so remove these. The second parameter for $DB->get_records() should be either null or an array. The field list for $DB->get_records() should be in the fourth parameter. Unless of course there's something very wrong with my installation. All the best, Leon",

          "Text": "OK - combining F2F with Activity Tracker, and we came across a curious instance where if a student was marked as a No Show in the Face to Face session, they were showing as successully completed the module. Of course, as I have customised both, I went back to basics to find it, and here is what I found. Regardless of the result of the Face to Face session, (Fully attended, partially attended, no show) Face to Face still injects a completion status of 1 into the table mdl_course_modules_completion . (Note - if course completion is set to require 100% to pass, this is not an issue - just reporting through Activity Tracker, which utilises the completionstatus flag in mdl_course_modules_completion ) Now one could argue either way for this - that they technically have completed the module, however got a pass mark of 0%, or they have not completed the module because they didn't turn up. Myself - I argue the second option - but interesting to see other thoughts out there. Any one with thoughts? Cheers Peter",

If you then go into grades, Grade Administration->Categories and items->Full View , then set the \"Grade to Pass\" to be higher than 0.(probably 100)  This then injects a 2 for a pass, or a 3 for a fail into the mdl_course_modules_completion module, and then need to modify the Activity Tracking to look for just a 1 or a 2, not anything that is inserted into the field.

If we were to use \"No show\" on our system, I would want it to allow users to re-book another session. As it is now, students can only book one session of a Face-to-face activity.  If they're not able to attend the session for whatever reason, how do I let them book another time instead.  I'm still not so sure how to handle this properly.",

An email is sent to the manager, and the student - all is good. However, the student is not given an indication on the screen that they are waitlisted, so they can sign in again. The big gotcha, is once they sign in a second time, even once they are approved and the status as an admin says booked, the end user still has the status as being able to sign up. They will NEVER see on their screen that they are booked in - they will always get the option to sign up. Of course, if they sign up again AFTER they are approved, then they get un-booked and put as waiting for approval, and the whole cycle starts again. Any thoughts?

          "Text": "We would like to accomplish the following: In the profile field \"Manager's email\", the user should be able to enter the name or the email address of his manager. The system can then make auto complete suggestions. Another option would also be to allow the user to select his manager out of a list of other moodle users with a specific role (= manager). Does anybody have an idea how to accomplish this easily? My first idea goes into the direction of JQuery's auto complete ( http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ ). But I believe this would require several changes to Face-to-Face. Thanks!",

I have been happily using a 1.9 version of moodle with face-to-face for about 4 years, and decided to attempt an upgrade to v2.3.   As per the upgrade documentation, that required going to v2.2 first.

          "Text": "Hello everybody, We are using F2F on moodle 2.3 and have the following problem: we crated one f2f session and added multiple dates/times. For example session 1 has the follwing dates/times: start date 01.Jan 13, 13:00 - end date 01.Jan 13, 14:00 start date 10.Feb 13, 14:00 - end date 10. Feb.13, 15:00 and so on.. Our problem is now, that when the first date/time is over, the whole session turnes to \"session is over\". Are we overlooking something or could somebody tell me, how we manage that the session is not turning to be over, when just the first date/time is over? Thanks in advance for any help.",

For better understanding i try to better explain what we try to build up within the f2f module: We have one session with multiple days/times. A student can attend at the day/time he/she wants. Let's say an english-course will find place ones a week, but on differend days. The studend should now be able to sign there prefered days/times (for the same session). As the session is always the same i do not see the reason to open  a new f2f-session every week, so we tryed to build this up with the \"add new date/time\" functionality within the session. The problem is now, when the first date/time is over, the student can't sign-up anymore for the other events in this session as the whole session is turning to be over. Any idees would be very nice.",

          "Text": "Hi Alper, When you have a session, that consists of multiple consecutive days or that occurs at 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM every Monday morning for 4 weeks for example, the student signs up for all the days and times you have included in that session. In your first example, if the students in one section meet every Monday, then build a session for them and a separate session for those who will meet every Tuesday.   In your example \" Let's say an english-course will find place ones a week, but on differend days.  The studend should now be able to sign there prefered days/times (for the same session).\" you need a separate session, not the same session, for the Monday class vs the Tuesday class.  Same activity but different sessions. Once a session starts it is too late to sign up unless the instructor chooses to forgive them for missing the first class and adds them manually. Remember, same Class/Activity but different times, means multiple F2F sessions for the Activity.  The student picks the session they want from those offered and attends all the dates and times listed for that session.

How can I use the attendee, or issue a certificate, etc., if students are nor registered in the class (except they have signed-up for a session, among many)? 2). Is there a way to automate the registration with face-to-face activity? (that is not to manually register students. Obviously, I do not want to register students automatically, unless they have signed-up for a session) 3). Is it possible to use face-to-face for registration purposes? It is designed very well to handle sign-up, waiting list, notification, manager approval, cancellation, etc. But, it is designed for activity within the course). I am not sure I am using it correctly? 4). Is it possible to create a single course and add multiple sign-up sessions (which I have done it without any problem), but be able to generate a report based on number of people signed-up for a session only?

Here is what is happening: When I leave \"Approval Required\" and all the \"Send notice to manger\" boxes on the activity unticked and then tick \"Ask users for their manager's email address\" in Home ► Site administration ► Plugins ► Activity modules ► Face-to-face ,  The 'Manager's Email' field on the session registration page appears, however, as expected no notifications get copied to the mananger becasue these are not ticked. When I change this so that I tick either \"Approval Required\" or any of the \"Send notice to manger\" boxes and keep the \"Ask users for their manager's email address\" ticked, then the \"Manger's email\" field disappears and it says \" You are currently not assigned to a manager in the system. Please contact the site administrator.\" Has anyone else expereinced this problem? Thanks Melissa (I am on Moodle 2.2.2)",

It's a great feature, but does take some setup to get working. Just to make it clear, to create a custom profile field in Moodle 2.0+ go to Settings > Site administration > Users > Accounts > User profile fields . Use the dropdown box to create a new profile field and choose the text input option. Then set the short name to managersemail. The other options can be set to pretty much whatever you want. We set the full name to \"Supervisor's Email\" because that's the langauge our users would understand, we made the field appear on the signup page and did not lock the field (those are the major setting options).

When I created the user profile field, I populated it with a default value (our Admin email address) and hid the field from users completely. I was hoping that since the field had a default value when the user self registers, that this would be all that was necessary to make it work. For some reason that does not turn on the functionality.  Using our approach, to get it to work after the user registers, our admin must then enter and resave the user profile. Jenna",

I created a custom profile field  \"managersemail\" like you have done.  As you discovered once you click \"approval required\" or switch on any of the manager email notifications, then when you try to book a place you get the \"Y ou are currently not assigned to a manager in the system\" message. However, when I did one of the following the funtionality worked: Manually entered an email into the \"mangersemail\" address field in the users profile field - OR - Edited the custom \"mangersemail\" field by switching the \"Display on signup page?\" to Yes.  Then when users self-register onto the site they have to complete this field. When you do one of the above.  You then get this: The manger's email address that was manually entered by an adminstrator or entered by the user during the self-registration process then appears to have pre-populated the 'Manger's email' on the page above.  What does puzzle me about how this works though is that this field appears to be editable.  Yet, if you edit it the notifcaations are not redirected to the new email address.  So what it looks like is that you have to have the \"managersemail\" populated before you can use the manager approval of turn on the manager notifications.  What still doesn't not make sense to me though is why the 'Manager's email' field appears when you do not have any form of manager approval of manager notification switched on.  We are currnetly using self-registration on our site so this should mean that this funtionality will work if we have a custom \"managersemail\" field on our resigtation page.  What this doesn't easily solve is for all our users already in the system without manager's email in the profile.  In the near future we will be stepping away from self-registration though, so this will likely make it more difficult to capture the manager's email in the registation process.

The first difference is that our users are external to our organization and their registration requests need to be approved by our admin staff and not their manager/supervisor.  Because of this I populated the \"managersemail\" field with a default value, hid it from the user and left it off the registration page. When I test this with a new user I've found that I stiil get the same error re \"missing managers email address ... consult your admin\" until I go into the users profile as admin and \"update profile\".  I find this strange as the default value is there in the \"managersemail\" field when I look at the new profile.  So the users Moodle profile has the value but F2F is not recognizing it. My work around may be to look at modifying the email-based self registration process to have the email sent to our admin who can then go into the profile, and click on \"update profile\" before notifying the user that their registration is now active. I'd appreciate any feedback on this, specifically why the manager's email address show's in the users profile but is not recognized by Face to Face until the users profile is updated. Jenna",

Please correct me if I'm wrong on that. Where did you add the custom field to? The face to face session? The user profile?

I also am not sure why the Manger's email field on the registration page appears as an editable field for the user.  When you edit the email that by default appears (which is the one that is in the user's profile) it then does not send the message to the default email or the one you edited it to.  Does anyone know if there is a way of not making this field editable?

Create the custom user profile field \"managersemail\" with the default email address of our Admin 2. Hide the new \"managersemail\" custom field completely from the user 3. Change the email-based self registration process, so that the user email with the link that takes the user back to moodle to confirm the registration, goes to our Admin and not the user registering. 4. Admin receives the email and then manually confirms the registration: Home / ► Site administration / ► Users / ► Accounts / ► Browse list of users 5. Admin then edits the profile and without changing anything in the user profile clicks on \"update profile\".  This apparently commits the default value entered in the \"managersemail\" field to the database. 6. Admin sends welcome email to the user and were done. If you leave the email based self reg process as is, you will have to monitor your user account creation carefully and update the new user profiles in as timely a manner as possible. Jenna",

          "Text": "Hi Alastair, My feeling is that session location is probably injtegral to the use of F2F in most applications, so I don't see how this would be a negative having the fields already created. There would be another advantage to doing this.  In our case we deliver the same course/F2F activity in different locations and for our end users the location needs to show in the calendar.  It can't just say \"Course 101\" when one session is in New York and the other in Dallas.  That's a lot of added clicks to find the next one near you. if you are browsing in the calendar. For others using F2F, maybe they would like to show a different building or campus location in the calendar along with the short name. Since as far as I can determine only the activity shortname displays in the calendar, in order for us to show the location for the F2F session, we have to create a separate activity for each location and then include the location name in the short name for the activity. If you knew that the location field was there you might be able code the module to include the activity name and the session location in the calendar entry. In our example this would mean we could have one F2F activity for the same session delivered in 10 city/locations instead of 10 activities , one for each city/location.  This would also be awsome when we had to output reports for each course. My thoughts All the best, Jenna",

Was not aware they were removable on a per session basis.   Once they were added as a custom session field, they are included in any new session created. Also, are you open to doing custom mods to F2F on a contract basis? Besides having the location info show on the calendar, we also need an Admin approval process that works in a scenario where  customers are approved by a training admin, once course payment has been processed. Right now, my work around is to use \"managersemail\" with the same default email address for all users.  The big drawback is that the default value is not committed to the database on account creation.  Either the user or admin has to \"edit\" the profile and update it to get F2F to recognize the default email address.   As we are using email-based self registration, this invloves monitoring new user registrations on a daily basis in order to \"activate their account\".  If this is not done you get the \"you have not been assigned to a manager\" error. Solution would be to add an alternate checkbox under \"approval required\" for an \"admin approval required\" plus a custom F2F field for the admin email address under this. When admin approval was checked the admin email field would be available to be filled in and all session approval emails would go to this address, instead of the user's manager's email address entered in the custom field in user's profile.

My idea was to: 1- Enable the Completion tracking \"Show activity as complete when conditions are met \" for facetoface to unlock the conditions \"Require view\" and \"Require grade\". 2- Create a third condition call \"Session is over\" which, if enable, will consider the course module for the current user as complete IF the current user is still signup for a session with the status \"session over\" 3- implement the condition \"session is over\" in the module facetoface and in moodle. For now it is working, I based the condition \"session is over\" on the condition \"require view\" and now every time the course page is view the condition check if the current user is still signup for a session over. I had to modify many things, I explain all the modifications I had to make in the .txt document. I am still working on to try a maximum to not modify the moodle code but the facetoface code instead, I would be very happy to have your opinion or your ideas to improve what I have done so far.

Of note is that the module still doesn't support the new course completion or backup/restore features of Moodle 2.0. They are on our roadmap, but probably won't be implemented in the immediate future (in an ideal world they'd be implemented by the end of September, but at this point I can't make any promises). To Mark Adams - if I'm understanding your second issue correctly that's not a bug, but correct functionality. The sessions are what are displayed on the Calendar, the Activity names are for the course page and aren't shown on the calendar.

This feature seems strange to me (i.e. why would a session have multiple dates - surely it would be a new session?). I guess the advantage of it is that you can keep the same attendees across multiple sessions, without having to re-add them. Anyway, look around line 1315 in lib.php, you'll see the following: $ sql = \"SELECT s.id, s.datetimeknown, s.capacity, s.duration, d.timestart, d.timefinish FROM {facetoface_sessions} s JOIN {facetoface_sessions_dates} d ON s.id = d.sessionid WHERE s.facetoface=$facetofaceid AND d.sessionid = s.id $locationcondition ORDER BY s.datetimeknown, d.timestart\"; and change it to this: $sql = \"SELECT s.id, s.datetimeknown, s.capacity, s.duration, d.timestart, d.timefinish FROM {facetoface_sessions} s JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT sessionid,id,timestart,timefinish FROM {facetoface_sessions_dates} GROUP BY sessionid) d ON s.id = d.sessionid WHERE s.facetoface=$facetofaceid AND d.sessionid = s.id $locationcondition ORDER BY s.datetimeknown, d.timestart\"; previous code resulted in multiple s.id's if there was more than 1 date. This now returns only the first date for a session. Cheers.",

For example, on a Debian system running Apache , that's /var/log/apache2/error_log Also, another thing to check would be your version of PHP. Are you running PHP4 or PHP5?

This is why the name is not changing in the event when you update the name of the Face-to-face activity. Cheers, Alastair",

For more transparency and eventauly a solution, I suggest the following process: 1. Identification if someone is currently working on porting the f2f module to Moodle 2.x and related circumstances. 2. If noone is working on porting the module, finding out who would be able and willing to do it and, in case, if funding is required 3. In case funding is required, identifying would join funding porting the f2f module to 2.x I will try to guide through this process and start with the first point: Is thre currently somoeone working on porting to moodle 2.x? If yes, could you please share some background information? Hope this initiative is appreciated - Thorsten",

I've started making progress on fixing calls to depricated functions and other problems but having limited time availiable will limit my ability to finish this in a reasonable timeframe and also there are a number of outstanding bugs in the 1.9 version that I am trying also trying to fix. I suggest for anyone wanting to help out, fork the repository and help by fixing some of the problems. I will keep an eye on the repo so I can quickly accept pull requests and help out with questions that may arrise. Let me know what you think. Cheers, Alastair",

According the process sugested by myself, we should now move on to the next step and see, who could help Alastair (and what would be the cost, in case). But please allow one small step in between: Yesterday I found a module very similar to the face to face module which is called \"booking\". It is already available for moodle 2. I have installed and tested it and it works ok. From my experience, it differs only in details from the f2f module. I Would it maybe be better to enhance this module instead of porting f2f? The booking module can be found here: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=4635&filter=1 It's a bit a pity that the author did not enable discussion about his module. Also there is no good documentation so far. Thorsten",

We're in the process of hiring (unless new budget cuts intervene) a developer so that we can assist with/accelerate 2.0 plugin development.

Tu peux utiliser un enrollment key pour chacun des groupes et Moodle va les placer dans le bon groupe. au plaisir, Pierre English I imagine you speak french. I recommend using groups in Moodle.  We have different stores but want them to use the same content. You can create a group and assign them an enrollment key, when the user click on the course they can enter their enrollment key and it will put them in that group. Regards, Pierre",

It all depends how much work you want to make for yourself really The 1.9.4 version is fine but it is always better to upgrade to the latest version so if you are happy upgrading to 1.9.12 then that would be useful.

We saw a lot of posts about the problems trying to load 1.x courses into 2.x, so we didn't want to create a lot of courses in 1.9 and then have to go through the hassle of converting and testing them all again. We also really like the new activity/course completion features in 2.x, and these were important for our particular situation. It is true that we have had to wait on some desired add-ons to be updated for the 2.x platform.  We're anxious for the Certificate and Face-to-Face modules to get updated and be stable, but we can live without them for now. Overall our experience with the 2.x system has been positive.  The Moodle community is really good as open source stuff goes, and we have an excellent IT support team, so we haven't been too worried about launching with 2.x.",

The default setting is to show on calendar, and if you're co-ordinating training sessions that sounds like the right thing to do. The tick box option can't be disabled by the administrator without hacking the code. If the calendar populated was the course one instead of the site calendar it wouldn't be an issue. After testing this I've also found that if someone saves the event with those default settings then edits to uncheck the calendar box the events remain visible in the global calendar (I'd call that a bug too).",

I'd also say that the other two complaints are best served by feature requests as neither are technically a bug. A bug is when something doesn't function the way it was intended, in this case each function behaves exactly the way it was designed and are perfectly usable for many scenarios. However, I would agree that adding a way to set the global default for whether an event appears on the calendar or not and an easy way to remove events from the calendar would be useful new features.",

So far I have been able to get the field to appear by changing many of the php files, but I haven't been able to get the php script to get the value from the session page. Is there a way that I can add a new field without having to add the scripting on the different php and html pages? This would be a great addition to the module if possible. Everything works great with the module as I have it, but I would like the additional functionality if possible. Thanks and have a great day. Chris Howard",

Any fields you create here will appear in the add and edit session form. They were probably removed so you don't need to see them if you don't want to. As for the block, we'll need to provide new code to match the changes made to the module. We've written the new version, but it's not currently online. I'll try and update it and add a link here.

Therefore all logged in users - also teachers - are able to sign-up for a session. Each session itself (outsite Moodle) has his own (and well known) teacher. By the way, I have modified my 'face-to-face' module (e.g. by changing ‘room’ to another description) so that it also allows booking for internal Moodle courses (i.e. private sessions via webconference). Or is the question more like how a non-admin teacher can edit this module? If so,  you will find the answer here . hth Joachim",

I can add them to tracker but wanted to make sure these are bugs and not features that have not yet been implemented: Things that do work: When a session is deleted - signed-up attendees get a cancellation message. When a session is changed from wait-listed to a session with a date - a message is sent to signed up students with the new set date/s. When a session is changed from set date to wait-listed (may happen if the date has been \"frozen\" or new date is still unknown and you don't want to \"delete\" the session). Attendees get a message that confirms that they are now registered to the wait-list. Suggestions - moving from set date to wait-lisetd - there should be a special notice saying that session has been changed from set date to wait-listed + there should be a cancellation for the outlook meetings of the dates that are now not set. In all these cases + also in the case described below that have other notification problems  the calendar events are updated/added/moved/deleted perfectly. Things that do not work: When there is a session, and it is changed in any of the following ways, participants do not get an email message and/or meeting cancellations or updates: One or more of the session dates is changed and updated session is saved. One or more of the session dates is deleted and updated session is saved. One or more of the session dates is added and updated session is saved.

At the moment the workaround to get the functionality of updating session dates I use is: Export the signed-up list to excel. Remove users from being signed up - using \"Add/Remove attendees\" (this sends them the cancellation of dates). Change the dates with no one registered. Add the users again to the updated session (using the excel list to manually search for user 1 by 1) - this sends them the updated session dates and calender invitations.

This also appears in the language phrases of the module. Could you please explain what site notices mean? One other thing - regarding custom fields. Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations of the field. In non-custom fields this was handled easily via the language editing. I don't know if this is a major change, but it may be worth noting for future versions.",

          "Text": "> Could you please explain what site notices mean? I haven't used them before, but it seems like they provide a way to post notices for particular sessions, dependent on the custom field values for that session. So if you have some special instructions that apply to a particular session or group of sessions you can use it to inform the attendees. Apparently the notice appears in the new version of the face-to-face block (not yet on moodle.org but available here: http://git.catalyst.net.nz/gw?p=blocks-facetoface.git;a=summary ). > Currently they can only be defined as one phrase. In a multi-lingual site this may be > problematic as different users using different languages may need to see different translations >of the field. This is a difficult issue, because at the moment there is no way to add new language strings using the language string editor, so if you create a new custom field there's no way to create a language string for it. The session custom fields is based off the User profile fields code, so presumably this is also a problem for user custom fields too? Simon",

However, his Wednesday session shows up as being at 2:30 PM (which happens to be the time of another available session, but he isn't signed up for that). I've verified that Joe is enrolled in the right sessions, and Joe can see the correct time if he enters the activity through the weekly outline rather than the calendar.

I think it's a perfectly reasonable modification. When I investigated I found two ways to resolve the issue. Method 1a) Modify the mod/facetoface/signup.html file by removing the select box option with MDL_F2F_BOTH as the value. 1b) Edit the mod/facetoface/lang/en_utf8/facetoface.php file so that 'notificationemail' reads 'Email Notification' and 'notificationical' reads 'Email Notification with iCalendar Attachment' Method 2)a) Modify the mod/facetoface/lib.php file. Line 1616 has an \"if\" statement that sends an email if the student wanted the ical attachment. Line 1628 has an \"if\" statement that sends an email if the student wanted an email. These statements are not associated with one another, therefore they run independently. The student would only receive one email if the second \"if\" statement was an \"else if\" statement. In that case it would only send out the email without the attachment if the email with the attachment wasn't sent. I think the first method is the best (which is Mary's method). The default \"iCalendar Appointment only\" is misleading since it sends the ical file as an email anyway, so having the three options doesn't make sense to me (unless someone changes the ical option to prompt the student to download it instead of sending via email).",

The second is for the online learning content where we have uploaded scorm content. The course is sequential meaning that the online content does not become available until the user completes the live instruction course. I tried using Activity Locking (I'm don't fully understand all of its features yet) but the problems I have are two fold: 1 - We run the same live instruction course in dozens of cities. Each instance/session is its own face-to-face and a user need only attend one face to face session to be eligible for the online content. It seems as if the activity lock is an all or nothing proposition, I can't set it to say that any face-to-face attendance would qualify to unlock the online learning content. 2 - The online learning content is accessible for 60 days from the face-to-face/live session attendance. Any ideas on how to control this? Right now we do this manually. Thank you",

          "Text": "Hi Jon. As for issue one if you open just one face-to-face activity but then open different sessions for that activity (these can be on different times and in different locations) this should solve your problem. Actually, I think this should be the correct use of this activity. The only times we open more than one face-to-face activity, is when there is a significant difference between the two - e.g. begineer vs. advanced intructor-led training. I have an idea concerning issue 2. If you use groups and groupings, you can then put the online content (SCORM) to be visible only to a specific grouping , and then define the availability of this resource/activity according to when the group had the training. So, if you put copies of the SCORM activity in the course, only the group members would see it according to the availability setting set within the actvity. Using groups/groupings would also prove valuable to track the grades and completion of activities per group. You can distribute the people in the groups or perhaps better yet - avoiding manual work - give each group a unique key for course enrolment and they are then automatically put into their group. One more thing - is there a specific reason you put the online and face-to-face activities in different courses? Wouldn't it be easier for learners if you put it in the same course - say in topic 1 and topic 2? Best of luck. Ask more if I was not clear.",

The more sessions we have the harder it gets to find which session someone attended, it would be great if I could type in a part of someones name and have it list all the names in each session that match. This would work ok as a block but I would like to have it built into the face-to-face module. Any ideas? Finding which sessions a person signed up for is an issue because the way the Face-to-Face module works now a student can only sign up for one session per activity. If they sign up for a session and don't attend, they can't sign up for another session until they are removed form the roster of the first session. It would be much quicker to search for their name then it is to go though the attendee list of all the past sessions to find and remove them. Thanks,",

On my sandbox environment, the email is sent immediately after I assign an attendee to the session, which can cause problem if I select the wrong person in the list for example. I would like to explore different ways: - either having a confirmation button before sending the confirmation email (kind of approving the attendee's list, that would send the email to the whole list at one time) - or be able to setup a number of days before the session date to send the email for ex. 7 days before (my session events are often de-scheduled ans re-scheduled so I do not want to pollute users mailbox for nothing). This feature could also be used for reminder emails some days before the session. I have seen we can disable the email confirmation. If I do so and enable it while having already a list of attendees, what happens ? can we then send the confirmation mail to the list ?? Did anyone already developped something on this subject ? Feedbacks appreciated. Thanks for your help Sandrine",

          "Text": "All We have recently gone live with our Moodle using the FacetoFace module to handle instructor led in-person training classes. We currently have 120 courses with over 350 sessions (this number grows daily as we are required to keep at least 3 months of sessions in place). As my instructors are using the tool they have made suggestions about features they would like to see. I would like to petition the group and 1. See is anyone is currently doing these things, 2. see if you would share your code, and 3. find out how difficult some of these things would be to do. I will do the best I can to explain each of the features. Change cancellations per cancellation policy - We have a cancellation policy that states \"if you cancel your attendance within 24 hours of class you will be charged our standard no-show rate.\" Instructors would like to restrict a users ability to cancel their attendance within 24 hours of the class start time. I see this being done in a couple of different ways: 1. deny cancellations within 24 hours and show a message telling the user to contact our administrative offices. 2. allow the cancellations to proceed but send a message to the user, manager, and admin staff informing them of the cancellation and no-show fee. Thoughts? Being able to track no shows - This is already logged as Contrib-1108 No show emails - Related to the above function, if a person is marked as a no-show send message to user and manager informing them of the no-show. Waitlist - Already logged as Contrib-408 html editor for facetoface emails - Some instructors would like to have the ability to send HTML formatted confirmation, reminder, and cancellation messages. capability to allow a person to add participants but not remove participants - We have some people that will register/book attendees for their department and we want them to be able to add the attendees but not remove the existing ones. Daily view of sessions - we currently have an HTML page that is manually maintained that show all sessions that are happening today. Session information includes, location, venue, room, start and finish times, and if the session has been cancelled. Adding default locations, venues, and rooms - already logged as Contrib-251 Searching for users in sessions - Occasionally we have a user or manager that calls up and does not remember what session they have signed up for. We would like to build a way to search through the sessions to find a specific user and the session they are signed up for. Sign up for multiple sessions - already logged as Contrib-1271 Store deleted sessions in the database for reporting - Already logged as Contrib-1107. I welcome any and all suggestions or thoughts concerning these features. If no one is doing anything like this then I will log tracker issues for each of the ones not already logged.

I would certainly echo your view and recognise these suggestions as improvement to an already excellent add-on. For information we use a Face to Face block to review daily sessions I have this link to it if it helps with item 7? My only other suggestion would be a 'print attendance list' button to provide to facilitators prior to the session. Currently we copy and paste into a document for printing or emailing but it would be useful to be able to draw in additonal information beyond firstname, surname. Will complete a quick poll of users here and add if they have any creative suggestions. Ditto your comment to Francois, a brilliant tool. Jeff Burge",

If a user cancels within that time, then a message is shown saying that a no-show fee may apply. In the cancellation log, highlight the people who cancelled late HTML editor for facetoface emails Yes, other people have asked for this as well. Please feel free to create a tracker issue for it. Ability to allow a person to add participants but not remove participants Good idea, not hard to do. Please add it to the tracker. Daily view of sessions Ideally that should go in the calendar.

We use Moodle to train technicians around the world but one state requires us to provide face-to-face classes for the technician's first training. After they have taken the face-to-face class they are able to renew their training by taking a course online. (Our training certificates expire every 2 years) The problem is setting up a course just for that particular state that has enrollment limited to those technicians that have already taken a face-to-face class. Some changes would probably need to be made to the core Moodle files as well as the face-to-face code but I would love to have the face-to-face attendence be linked to the online course enrolment somehow. I don't want to have them automatically enrolled in the online course after they attend the face-to-face so the current external enrollment modules won't work for me. When a students attempts to enroll in the online course I would like to have moodle check to verify they have already taken the related face-to-face class, if they have they are enrolled, if they haven't they are told they need to take the face-to-face class first.",

The user received a message that \"(Username) is already signed up for this face-to-face activity.\" The user had attended a previous session of this activity, but cannot sign up for a second identical session (different date and time). If I remove his attendance history from the previous session, then he can successfully be added into the current session. Although that is a short-term workaround, I would prefer not to use it in order to keep the integrity of our attendance records. I also verified that there is no record written to the 'mdl_facet0face_submissions' table until the user was removed from the previous session. Anyone else have this issue or find a fix? Thanks,",

          "Text": "All I needed a way to make an individual session unavailable for booking.  Basically the instructor wanted to add students to specific sessions manually without the student signing up themselves.  To do this I changed the code in face-to-face/lib.php as shown below: // Only numbers allowed here $session->capacity = preg_replace('/[^\\d]/', '', $session->capacity); $MAX_CAPACITY = 100000; if ($session->capacity < 0) { //changed from a 1 to a 0 to allow session capacity to be set to 0 so sessions can be closed. $session->capacity = 1; } elseif ($session->capacity > $MAX_CAPACITY) { $session->capacity = $MAX_CAPACITY; } The scenario is this:  The instructor has a session that has 25 seats, but 15 of those seats need to be held for a specific department.  Once those 15 seats are filled then the instructor opens the session for anyone else that wants to register.  Setting the capacity to 0 effectively allows the session to be created but makes the session unavailable for students to book.  The instructor(s) adds the 15 students from the department and then two weeks before class starts they change the capacity to the actual capacity of the class opening up the remaining seats to whoever wants to book it. I hope I have explained this well.  In my testing it seems to be working beautifully, I just wonder if I am breaking something else by doing this.  ANy thoughts of comments? Scott Karren",

I found that the mdl_facetoface_submissions table had a \"Grade\" field. It showed 0 for all my users, even though the actual grade book shows 100% and the Face to Face shows yes for attendance. When I changed the 0 to 100 in the table as a test, I was then able to get a certificate for my test student.

Some mail readers (e.g. GroupWise) turn iCal attachments into a calendar item and make the email disappear completely. These people will need to enable the dual-email option if they want their staff to be able to read the confirmation email.

User-level activity reports (\"Outline\" and \"Complete\" reports) are also populated. Other noteworthy improvements: The module now uses a custom field on the user profile page for the manager's email address instead of the MSN field. The attendance data is now stored in the gradebook. Important bug fixes: The session key is now checked in all user forms. The take attendance page now displays the actual attendance and allows teachers to untick checkboxes. iCalendar appointments are no longer sent for wait-listed sessions.

When students sign-up to a session they are now presented with a window into which they can enter their managers email address; this was not happening before. The third party email seems to be working now too so all is good. May I be so bold as to suggest an enhancement for future releases? We often have students turn up to sessions unnexpectedly, i.e. they have not 'signed-up' and teachers do not always have an opportunity to record attendance on the day of the activity. As a result we have no way of recording this ad-hoc attendance as we are unable to retrospectively add students to a face to face. It would be great if the teacher or administrator were able to have access to sign-up students after the event and then record their attendance. Otherwise, great development Francois, thankyou.

My first attempt is to just be able to do a screen print, but I have run into two problems that I am hoping someone here can help with. The first, I needed several pieces of information from the user profile which I was able to successfully add. I also needed to be able to see a managers name and phone number on the roster. I created two extra user profile fields named Manager Name and Manager Phone. I can see in the db that they were created in the tables mdl_user_info_fields and mdl_user_info_data, but I am having trouble figuring out the sql query to add them correctly to the attendees screen. Second, I added table headings for each of the new fields and then added those strings to the lang file. For the life of me I cannot get them to appear in Moodle correctly. I have attached the files that were modified. Just for reference, in the attendees.php file lines 125 through 132 and lines 153 through 159 were added, in the lib.php lines 823 through 826 were modified, and in the facetoface.php lang file the new strings are at the bottom. Can someone give me some help with this. I would really like to do the work myself but could use some mentoring. After I get this done I plan on changing it a bit more to have a separate print screen that can be accessed from the attendees screen, I think that would be a cleaner way of doing things.

Yes, my original thought was to be able to display the information as part of the course summary so that students would be able to sign up for a f2f session from the available courses page. Thinking about it further it seems that it would make more sense as an enrollment plug-in. Something that would allow the students to sign up for the session they want without having to first enroll in the course and then sign up. One of the things that is a bit inconvenient is the fact that students need to enroll in the course, then sign up for a session. I now have two course rosters that I need to manage, if the student wanted to un-enroll from the course they would first have to cancel the f2f session and then un-enroll. Does this make sense? I am not a developer by any means but I would be willing to invest sometime to take a stab at it if you can point me to the correct files and provide some advice. Scott Karren",

Once class is completed they will go back online to complete the class assessment and evaluation. I could put the f2f activities in the first topic of a course and then all subsequent materials in other topics, but students still face the inconvenience of signing up twice for the course. What I kinda envision is that a student will select the course they want from the available courses list, the sessions sign-up screen will appear, the student will select the session they want to attend and then be taken to the course screen itself showing what session they are signed up for and have access to all materials.
