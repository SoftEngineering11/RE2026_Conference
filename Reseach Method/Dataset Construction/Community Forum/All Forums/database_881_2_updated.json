Trying to put a form together that has the following layout: Title of activity Category 1 Criterion 1 date1, (date2, date3) comment Criterion 2 date1, (date2, date3) comment Category 2 Criterion 1 date1 (date2, date3) comment Criterion 2... The issue is that the date field is auto-populated with current date each time the Database is opened. As only one date field is necessary for the evidence, if a learner completes it with one date, the rest of the dates will be automatically be put in my Moodle regardless, which is not correct for the purposes of evidencing. Is there a way to make the date fields be all blank to start with or to have placeholders? Also, is it possible to export as pdf? That would be more suitable for exam bodies as evidence.",

One other way you might consider doing it is to have each entry contain just ONE Date, and then make a Radio Button or a Menu Field for the Category. Each user would just add a new record when they complete the step which would contain the date they completed that step. If you get clever with Groups (one user per group and separate groups), you can display each user's entries in the \"List view\" to see how many steps they have completed. Or you use the \"Approval required\" setting, and don't approve any entries to keep them \"private\" for students. You would need to filter by Student in order to see only one student's entries. You can use JavaScript in your template to \"print\" list views which would download as a PDF depending on your browser settings. There is a webinar and Moodle Academy course coming up in September on Moodle Database which may give you more ideas.",

          "Text": "Hi, to be flexible, I wouldn't use the date field type but rather a number field (for timestamps) or a short text field, that i used here. In the \"Add entry template\" I changed the input html into this: \n```text\n<div class=\"mb-3 pt-3\">\n  <div class=\"fw-bold\">Date</div>\n  <div class=\"date-field\">\ndate\n</div>\n</div>\n\n[...]\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flatpickr\"></script>\n<script>\nwindow.document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) => {\n  // Add the flatpickr stylesheet if it is not already there.\n  if(!document.getElementById('flatpickr_css')) {\n    var link = document.createElement('link');\n    link.id = 'flatpickr_css';\n    link.rel = 'stylesheet';\n    link.href = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.\ncss\n';\n    document.head.appendChild(link);\n  }\n  flatpickr('.date-field input');\n});\n</script>\n```\n so basically adding a div with a class around my date field placeholder. At the end of the existing code in the template, the javascript is added. The input field can be easily set via a datepicker provided by the flatpickr.js library now. I am not sure whether the link element can be in the body at any place, therefore I add the css stylesheet via javascript in the header. The stored values are in the form of YYYY-MM-DD. These dates can actually be sorted. If in the output you want a custom formatted date, you can do something like this e.g. in the Single View template: \n```text\n<div class=\"mt-4\">\n  <span class=\"fw-bold\">date</span>\n  <p class=\"mt-2 date-field-out\">\ndate\n</p>\n</div>\n\n[...]\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dayjs@1/dayjs.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\nwindow.document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n  const nodes = document.querySelectorAll('.date-field-out');\n  for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n    const value = nodes[i].innerHTML;\n    if (value.trim().length > 0) {\n      dayjs(value).format('MMMM D, YYYY');\n    }\n  }\n});\n</script>\n```\n Again, in the existing html, the p element is extended by the class \"date-field-out\". The javascript loads the day.js library, reads the YYYY-MM-DD date contents and reformats them to the given format. One thing to watch out when using dates, is the timezone and daylight savings time. For this PoC I didn't check any of these issues, but you should be aware of it and may change the code a bit. The mentioned libraries support this, while the plain Date object within javascript treats everything as UTC. HTH , Stephan PS. the square brackets in the code are lost, so whenever the date appears as a link, it's the placeholder with the square brackets. PPS. to have the output of a list view or single view printed as a PDF, you could do something similar that I have done in https://github.com/srobotta/moodle-database-presets/tree/master/personel-list",

In the template the file is inserted dynamically with the placeholer pdf . That creates a link and an icon in front of it (to illustrate the filetype). This javascript snippet checks for the link, actually checks that there is a pdf linked (only by looking at the suffix of the file). In that case the anchor element is replaced by: \n```text\n<embed src=\"https://url.to.your.moodle/the.pdf\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"  type=\"application/pdf\">\n```\n Unfortunately you cannot limit the file upload to a pdf ( AFAIK ) and (just checked) you can fool Moodle by renaming an image to pdf which then brings you a blank embed window.

          "Text": "Hi, In your template you have the Javascript included twice, remove one block. Also, remove the p element around the script tags. I always recommend to disable the code editor (uncheck the box) to have a plain text area for the template editing. Then you get the plain HTML and avoid errors when the editor does things (e.g. enclosing each paragraph into a p element) that are not preferred. What I also spot in your code is the missing id that is there by default and used in the javascript snippet. I guess your double square \"How to pdf\" is the variable placeholder that produces the link. In this case in your div element with the font-size or any other element, that contains the link to the pdf, add the id=\"defaulttemplate-single\" attribute. The other solution would be going without the id attribute. In this case change the selector in the code from \n```text\n \n\n\n  \"#defaulttemplate-single a.data-field-link\"\n```\n to `\"a.data-field-link\"` I used the id selector to replace only links inside that template and avoid unwanted replacements of any other links that might be on the page (although unlikely). If that still doesn't help then open the javascript console to see if there are any other errors that keep the Javascript from working correctly. Best regards, Stephan",

In general, when a new dataset is entered by the user, the format is set automatically to HTML when the user has the Atto or TinyMCE as the default editor. When the user has the plain textarea displayed, the format selection appears and the user can choose what he might enter as content in that field. If your plugin never shows the \"hidden\" field to the user, then you also should be able to automatically set the format to plain text and fill the content.",

What exactly do you have and where do you upload it? An mbz file would be uploaded via the course restore menu. 3. Depending on what you have, I suggest the following: - If you have a backup of your Postgres / Mysql : restore it in some other instance, export the entries (e.g. as CSV) and reimport them into your current installation. - If you have an mbz file, try to figure out what it contains (the mbz is a zip file, rename it, unzip it and have a look). You might have the entries as an csv or xml or whatever there as well. Then you could us that file to reimport it into the db activity. HTH , Stephan",

At the single view the fields should be in the same order below each other like you add a new entry. Attached you find my current database template. Thank you in advance. Meret",

If I do this I add some CSS to the database to hide the warning message that comes up. You can set the entries so they have to be approved before being visible, but you then never approve any of them - this means the students will see their own, but won't see others. I expect it is possible to do this by tweaking the permissions of the activity, but I have never mastered this, so usually go for one of the above.",

          "Text": "Kia ora team, I've created a Database that can be used for collecting CPD points/hours. Video demonstration (3 min; no sound; apologies for the amateur production!) Scenario A given number [n] of CPD hours/points are awarded per year; with [n] being the maximum\nnumber of hours/points that can be awarded for the year/course. For\nthe purpose of the example courses, I have set that number at 20 CPD\nhours/points per year. I am not sure if this is a realistic number but\nit was (somewhat!) easier for me to do the maths in my head when I was\nworking things out. 😅 Students upload evidence of their CPD to [a database activity in] the course. The course teacher views the CPD evidence and decides how many hours/points the CPD evidence is worth. The student can be awarded a badge/badges in 1 of 2 ways: One-off: The student receives a badge after completing 20 CPD hours/points. Iterative: The student receives a badge for every multiple of 5 CPD hours/points. (N.B. \"Points\" can be replaced with \"hours\" and \"CPD\" can be replaced with \"RPL\".) Here are the 2x ways, depending on how often you want to award people for their CPD points. One-off : i.e. 1x badge/permanent record for 20 points Iterative : (e.g.) 4x badges/permanent records, each for 5 points and accumulating to 20. Workflow: One-off How does it work? Student uploads evidence of their CPD to a database activity in the course. Each item is a separate entry into the database. The course teacher (or equivalent role) views the CPD evidence. They\nmark it as approved and then give it a rating. The rating indicates how\nmany points CPD each evidence item (i.e. each database entry) is worth. Once 20 points is reached, the student is able to view and open a page\nresource; opening the page resource triggers the badge being awarded.\n(Done this way because badge criteria does not include grade.) OR Once 20 points is reached, the activity is considered complete and the badge is awarded automatically on activity completion. The student receives a badge. The badge reflects 20 CPD points. The\nbadge stays attached to the student profile regardless of any future\ncourse enrolment or unenrolment. Reporting The teacher can view the gradebook to see how many points the student has accumulated. The student can view their gradebook to see how many points they have accumulated. Cons The maximum number of points is 20. If a student is awarded 10 + 5 + 8,\nthen they will only receive a maximum of 20 points. The additional 3\npoints beyond 20 will not be 'counted'. Workflow: Iterative How does it work? Student uploads evidence of their CPD to a database activity in the course. Each item is a separate entry into the database. The course teacher (or equivalent role) views the CPD evidence. They\nmark it as approved and then give it a rating. The rating indicates how\nmany points CPD each evidence item (i.e. each database entry) is worth. Once 5 points are collected, the student is able to view and open a\npage resource; opening the page resource triggers the badge being\nawarded. (Done this way because badge criteria does not include grade.) The student receives a badge. The badge reflects 5 CPD points. The\nbadge stays attached to the student profile regardless of any future\ncourse enrolment or unenrolment. Then, After 10 points are reached, the student is able to view and open\nanother page resource; opening the page resource triggers the badge\nbeing awarded. The student receives another badge. The badge reflects (another) 5 CPD\npoints. The badge stays attached to the student profile regardless of\nany future course enrolment or unenrolment. Then, the same kind of set-up for 15 points and 20 points. Reporting The teacher can view the gradebook to see how many points the student has received. The student can view their gradebook to see how many points they have accumulated. Pros Students can receive rewards more frequently. Cons Students have to click on the Page resource to receive their badge. Settings Both  \"one-off\" and \"iterative\" courses: Groups The course will have groups, in order for students to be able to only see their own database entries. You can auto create groups. Use the option Group # and the limit of 1 member per group. There\nis a 3rd party plugin available for auto creation of groups on\nenrolment, but I have not used it myself. Course settings Course name: CPD points 2024 Enable completion tracking: Yes Group mode: Separate groups Course Activities and Resources Database (and Pages for the \"iterative\" course) Database settings Name: My CPD points Entries Approval required: Yes Allow editing of approved entries: No Entries required before viewing: None Maximum number of entries: None Ratings Aggregate type: Sum of ratings Scale Type: Point Maximum grade: 20 Grade category: Uncategorised One-off: Grade to pass: 20.00 Iterative: Grade to pass: 0.00 Group mode Separate groups Add grouping restriction: Group: (Any group) Activity completion One-off: Completion tracking: Activity completion with pass grade Iterative: Completion tracking: Do not indicate activity completion Example fields Date completed (date) Upload evidence (file) Details (textarea field) Link to course or site ( URL field) *CPD can be replaced with RPL if necessary. Permission change Permission changes to Database activity \"My CPD points\": View the total rating you received (mod/data:viewrating): +Student Then, differences as follows: Settings: One-off Badge Name: \"20 CPD points\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 20 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Database activity Settings continued: Iterative Page x 4 (Page 1) Name:\"Click here to be awarded your 5-point CPD badge\" Page content: \"Congratulations!\" [Add further info if needed.] Page 1 Settings Restrict access Student must match the following Grade: My CPD points must be greater than and equal to 25% Hidden entirely Activity completion Show activity as complete when conditions are met: Student must view this activity to complete it. (Page 2, 3, 4) As for Page 1 BUT Restrict access Student must match the following Grade: My CPD points must be greater than and equal to 50% (Page 2) 75% (Page 3) 100% (Page 4) Hidden entirely Badges Badge 1 Name: \"5 CPD points (1)\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 5 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Page 1 \"Click here to be awarded your 5-point CPD badge\" Badge 2 Name: \"5 CPD points (2)\" Description: \"The recipient has completed 5 CPD points.\" [Add anything that suits your course and users.] Criteria: Completion of Page 2 \"Click here to be awarded your next 5-point CPD badge\" Same for Badges 3, 4 - make sure they are connected to the correct Page. FAQ Why the additional step of the Page? Because a badge criterion can be activity completion but not grade. Why add Student to mod/data:viewrating? So that they can see the ratings they were given. Why groups? So that database entries can be only viewed by the student who made the entries. In order for the database entries to be rated, they must be approved. Why not display pages one by one? i.e. restrict access In case the student doesn't access the first badge before they are able to access the second badge. Could Teachers or Managers award the badges? If you want them to, yes, add them to the badge criteria. Why not have badges that are 5, 10, 15, 20 (rather than the proposed 5, 5, 5, 5)? Because Badge \"5-point\" and Badge \"10-point \"might look like a total of 15 points, when it is really a total of 10 points. A \"20-point\" badge could be a nice additional badge to round off the calendar year. Perhaps make the 20-point badge with no expiry date and the \"5-point\" badges could have expiry after a year. That way, badges don't become overwhelming or cluttered. Please add any comments or suggestions you have for improving this further. Ngā mihi",

          "Text": "Hi Databasers, I'm blue sky thinking here and was thinking a way to super power the community of engagement stuff on our presets would be to actually implement an easy to use rating system for 'likes'. Currently the work-around is to add new ratings that include a heart symbol, thumbs up emoji (looks a bit garish) and a star symbol. Then we turn on the permissions for students to grade one another. In practice, this rating system looks quite bulky and wouldn't be as nice and slick as a simple heart rating on the likes of Instagram, X, etc. It also means that the activity has to become summative if we allow only student grading, whereas a separate system allows formative and summative. I mocked up what this might look like below and added it to the tracker . I'd be delighted if people could add their thoughts and up vote it.",

I'd like the database to be more interactive (peer to peer), for that, learners are asked to create an entry that others could comment. For that to work, they would need to get a notification each time someone reacts on their entry. I hope I make myelf clear enough. Looking forward to your answers,",

However I'm struggling to adapt the code as it's in German and cards currently only load in the first column for me. I know my way around Bootstrap, but Database is pretty new to me. I did manage to code something start to finish that I'm happy with the other day using Layoutit and ChatGPT, the latter of which seems to work well if you say here's my Database language now go write it in the style of this html. 😅 What I'm think of is a masonry format like the Wall image below. Using Bootstrap 5 Masonry Cards Layout . Nice to haves: A way to colour code cards Card would be able to show video and images neatly in list view.",

We're a teacher training course so there's a lot of stuff around the community of practice, and keeping discussions going so the forced anonymity of Mod Board wouldn't suit us. We're going from 40 to 80 students in the next two years so we're hoping to try and retain the nice holistic side of things while also trying to make the programme coordinator's job a little easier as they're the person who marks the activities.",

In your template you are able to include css and js from external sources and use them in your template code. I haven't tried with masonry. Note to consider: Moodle still uses Bootstap 4 (IIRC), if you include Bootstrap 5 this may have some weird sideeffects because there are two versions of Bootstrap available at your page. To get an image wall (like in your screenshot) you may look at my image gallery improved that uses styling from the existing Bootstrap in Moodle. This is not as flexible as masonry but might be a starting point for you (together with other examples in the repo). Best regards, Stephan",

I have created a preset that uses a proposed solution for Bootstrap 4. What I noticed is that the JS library of BS5 uses the space a bit more efficient than the BS4 solution. The JS solution should work in th database activity as well, you may have to tweak it a litte. I have used other libraries like to display a OSM map or plot a chart with d3.js work like a charme. The problem what I see here is that BS4 and BS5 use the same class names etc. There might be interferences between the two. That's also why the code piece from your link doen't work out of the box.

          "Text": "This can be achieved creating a new tab with an iframe and put the binary data into the url ifself. The following code sample demonstrates this for PDF files only in the single view: document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) => { document.querySelector('#defaulttemplate-single a.data-field-link').addEventListener('click', (ev) => { const url = ev.target.getAttribute('href'); if (url.match(/.*pdf$/i)) { ev.preventDefault(); With small modifications this can be adjusted to other file types as well and also in the list view. Basically after loading the DOMContentLoaded event attaches an event to the first Anchor element with the class \"data-field-link\" when the link is clicked. This attached function checks the suffix of the url and by this guessing what content type might be expected. For a pdf it fetches the content of the file, creates an iframe in a new window and adds the content via the src attribute. Here you have the chance instead of providing a url, use a base64 encoded string. That works also for other elemens such as images or anchor links when you want to force a download that otherwise would just be displayed in the browser. To make this work in the list view, two things need to be changed: * The query selector for fetching the Anchor links must not include #defaulttemplate-single * Fetch all Anchors with querySelectorAll() Best regards, Stephan",

Building such a database in Moodle using the Database Activity ought to be relatively straightforward, but they also want to be able to pull the data from that database activity into an external, public website (possibly built on Wordpress).  I can see how this could be done, theoretically, using API's running in Moodle and maybe some javascript on the external website.

While I don't have specific information on whether this has been done in the exact context you're describing, similar data integration and sharing between platforms are relatively common in web development. Here's a general approach to achieve this: 1. **Expose Data via API in Moodle:** - Set up an API within your Moodle instance to expose the data from the database activity. Moodle supports web services, including REST and SOAP protocols, which can be used to retrieve data programmatically. 2. **Access Moodle API from WordPress:** - In your WordPress website, you can use server -side programming languages like PHP or JavaScript to make HTTP requests to the Moodle API. Libraries like cURL (in PHP) or the Fetch API (in JavaScript) can be used to fetch data from Moodle's API endpoints. 3. **Parse and Display Data in WordPress:** - Once you retrieve the data from Moodle, you can parse it and display it on your WordPress site. You can format the data as needed and use HTML, CSS , and JavaScript to render it in a user-friendly manner. 4. **Scheduled Updates:**",

Some of the features: Geolocate events with Point of Interest/Address lookup OR by clicking on an interactive map (both for entering data and browsing the data) When creating a shareable-instance, select which frames to show/hide Shared via an iFrame with map, simple and advanced search fields and more\\ One of the nice things about our approach is that a given database can be shared with different levels of access on different websites. Right now all of these external interfaces are read-only, but that could probably be changed if necessary. Although our prototype is built on an \"Event\" database where events have titles and locations and dates and so forth, this plugin was designed to work other data types as well. We aren't sure whether we want to release this in the wild as OpenSource, at the moment, but if anyone wants to use, please contact me and I'll share the share the code with you.",

          "Text": "I've encountered a challenge with the Moodle Database Activity module, and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on the issue. Here's the scenario: I created a Database Activity and successfully imported records from a CSV file. I took care to match the imported data with the correct dropdown menus and other fields in the activity. However, when I attempt to modify data for one of the records using the \"update records\" template, it appears that the changes are applied. Still, when I check the database, the data reverts to its original state as imported from the CSV file. Has anyone else faced a similar issue or have insights into why this might be happening? I've reviewed the settings, templates, and permissions, but I'm unable to pinpoint the problem. Your expertise would be greatly appreciated in resolving this issue.

I want\nthat when entering the data of the table, the id field of the table\nis automatically calculated and entered. And on\nthe other hand, I want to concatenate 3 fields into a fourth field. I have\nseveral problems: 1.\nCreate the id generation field. I've\ngotten that field to auto-populate using the list view and single\nview templates, and javascript. The\nproblem that when changing the page, it calls the javascript again\nand initializes the counter. I have\ntried to put it in a localStorage, but it should not work in moodle. I don't\nquite understand the architecture of this plugin. Because in the HTML\nit doesn't let you write javascript or call a function from it. It\nwould also help a lot to know how I can get other elements of the\nview, like the page number where we are right now... Yours\nwould be to enter this value, when entering each record and thus it\nwould not have to be calculated every time you generate the view. 2.\nCreate a field, with the concatenation of several fields of the\ntable. According\nto the code I show below, it should work, but it doesn't. But\nyours would be to enter the value when entering the record, instead\nof the views. Therefore,\nthis field should be hidden, so that it is not seen by the user and\nautomatically. Can PHP\nbe entered in the \"add entry\" template to create a form and\nthat when clicking on save the record, the id and appointment fields\nare modified? This would be the code, but it doesn't work in moodle: /* Inicio del código de la plantilla javascript */ if (localStorage.getItem(\"cnt\") === null) { localStorage.setItem(\"cnt\", \"1\"); } function init() { var cnt = parseInt(localStorage.getItem(\"cnt\"), 10); var id_documentos = document.getElementsByName(\"id_documento\"); var citas = document.getElementsByName(\"citas\"); var autores = document.getElementsByName(\"autor\"); var titulos_articulo = document.getElementsByName(\"titulo_articulo\"); var anios_publicacion = document.getElementsByName(\"anio_publicacion\"); var organizaciones = document.getElementsByName(\"organizacion\"); for (var i = 0; i < id_documentos.length; i++) { id_documentos[i].innerHTML = cnt++; var autorValue = autores[i].textContent; var tituloValue = titulos_articulo[i].textContent; var anioValue = anios_publicacion[i].textContent; var organizacionValue = organizaciones[i].textContent; citas[i].innerHTML = autorValue + '.' + tituloValue + '.' + anioValue + '.' + organizacionValue; } localStorage.setItem(\"cnt\", cnt.toString()); } window.onload = init; /* Fin del código de la plantilla javascript */ I have many doubts, and really, I don't know how this plugin\n(database) behaves. If\nanyone has any more information on how the different template calls\nto javascript and how I can get data from the URL ... I would\nappreciate it.",

I can build a one photo database activity and it works fine. Are there administration settings I should look into, or do I need to break this down into many database activities ?

I put the tag both in the \"Header\" and the \"Repeated Entry\" field, but it is always displayed as plain text for both the student and the teacher.

A possible approach to solve your problem is to hide the entry students shouldn't see with CSS and then make it visible for teacher with JavaScript . To do so, write something like this: \n```text\n<script>\n\n\nwindow.onload = function makeComment()\n\n\n  {\n\n\nif(document.querySelector(\"#usernavigation .editmode-switch-form\").innerHTML.length>0) document.querySelector(\"#hiddenItem\").style.display=\"block\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n</script>\n```\n The example works for one item in the single page view. If you want it to work in the list view, you need to query for all the selectors (classes) and then best use the forEach() approach in Javascript to change either all the classes or you go a different way and inject a new definition for the class which hides the element in question.",

The button link should filter as: <a href=\"Shared LINK\" class=\"btn mb2-pb-button btn-primary btn-lg btn-icon-before rounded0 btnborder0 isicon0 upper0 fwmedium\" style=\"margin-bottom:15px;\"><span class=\"btn-intext\">Read More..</span></a> What is seen in the list view? Short codes are not translated I also tried to test mathJax filter from database template, but it did not work see below. MathJax filter is not working It works perfect when I use any of these in the content I think the database template recognizes and translates all Field Name and ##tags## and ignore other filters. \n```text\n\n```",

The onchange event DOES trigger when used with a text field (input element). But when I apply the same code to a textarea field, nothing happens when I click away from the textarea field after changing the value of that field. The onchange event appears not to trigger with a textarea field. (Javascript is not my strong suit.) Why? What am I doing wrong? I appreciate any help or feedback. I have created a very simple database activity for testing (see attached preset file).

My site is running a Moodle 3.9.9+ installation where the js ONCHANGE event keyword does work as expected for text input elements (DB \"text field\") but produces no visible behavior for textarea elements (DB \"Textarea field\").

I don't require approval of the entries, but if you are nervous about what might be posted, you can turn on \"require approval.\" Also, the students must submit one entry before seeing what other students have posted. If you have a problem with the videos not showing correctly, double-check your filter settings. I had a problem when the \"Multimedia plugins\"  and \"HTML5 audio/video to MP4 filter\" were both on.

I found this topic https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=316820 Somehow they managed to remove this line. But I cannot figure out how. I disabled the editor etc. However I could not retrace how it worked. The only solution I have found so far, is to handle it using javascript .

I have a course with multiple groups and the group mode for this course is 'Separate Groups' (& Forced). In this course, there is a database activity. When the users (modified nonediting teachers) use 'Add entry' to enter data it works as expected (i.e. they can view only the entries they submitted and the users cannot view the entries of the users in the other groups). However, if a user uses 'import entries' to enter data, these entries are visible (in the list view and the single view) to all the users in the course. Similarly, export entries does not work for the imported entries. It seems like the system cannot link the group with the entries when entries are imported. Is there a quick fix for this issue? We use Moodle 3.9.1. P.S. I have the same problem as discussed here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=388543 Thanks!",

I've been playing around and can remove the Advanced Search bar from the list view via CSS in the List View Template, but it seems that any student can go in and change these parameters and save them on a global level... This would basically undermine all my links directed at a specific order and number of entries. Is there any way to set it up so that the student only has access to List View and with no search or maybe no possibility to save any changes to these parameters globally???? Thanks in advance!!!!!",

I have not managed to find an appropriate response in the forum discussions (I might not be looking for the correct terms) My aim is to set up a database for students to submit specific academic requests to academic management - such as extensions on submission deadlines, or access to a supplementary exam if the student failed the first one. (The purpose is to have all these requests collated in one place). Privacy of the requests was a concern - but if I understand correctly, I am able to set \"require approval for new records\" (and then just never approve them) - and this will allow entries to remain private, and for me to comment on the entry, for the student to see my comments and respond (and still only see their requests), whilst I can still see all requests? Firstly, is there a maximum number of records that can be added to the database - and then once that limit is reached, the database becomes visible to all students? And secondly, do I receive notifications when students submit new entries and do the students receive a notification when their entry is commented on? Thank you for any guidance to set me in the right direction!",

Now let's say that you have 4 pages total and page three is unapproved... As a teacher with the right to see unapproved entries your &page=X would run from 0 (page 1) to 3 (page 4)... If I then grab the URL for page 4 (https:///mod/data/view.php?d=10&mode=single&page=3) and email that to someone without the right to see unapproved entries; they are going to get an error... For them there are only three pages in the database ( id 0 to 2)... When you add more entries to the database and have unapproved entries scattered throughout the database; things get even worse... If you send someone a link to the entry using the &page=X scheme you may well link them to a completely different page!

It is evident that the filter logic includes all users who are 'approved', irrespective of the group they are in (despite the group mode selected being 'Separate Groups'). This issue may require deeper analysis of the code and we request your support for this. I would like to request the following - a. Take the issue offline; can I interact with you one-to-one and also engage a tech person at our end to assist in analysing this. b. One the resolution is found, the outcome can be updated in this thread and we can close this issue. Do let me know if that is fine? Do excuse the delay in providing updates on this. best regards,",

Actually, my tests show that really, the moodle APP doesn't load whatever is in the javascript template part of the database plugin. The other tabs are loaded (single template, list template, css template) but not the javascript template. Therefore none the preset using javascript can be used by the moodle app. It is a bit disapointing because most of my students use the mobile app on their mobile. I hope that the tracker I have set up will get some votes and that the mobile team will repair this soon (for now, it is low in the priority schedule).",

We just upgraded to 3.6, so I'm not sure if this is normal behavior that I can control or if it's a buggy thing. I created 5 fields for this database: one text input field and four textarea fields. For purposes of this screenshot, I reduced the input area for each textbox, but they vary from 60 X 50 to 60 X15. When I click on the Add entry link, all five fields display correctly, but in addition to those fields, there are four unlabeled textboxes that seem to mirror the sizes of the textarea fields and they are all required as the actual fields are. Is this related to the \"maximum embedded file size\" option? I changed it from 0 (unlimited) to 10 but it didn't seem to make a difference. The settings from one of the textarea fields is included below. What are these extra fields and how do I make them go away??? Thanks for any suggestions.",

Data has been entered for all of these fields by a tutor/administrator, the student can then go in and be presented with the \"list\" and \"single\" views, when in the \"single\" view, there could be a button to press that would then populate a new field in the database \"requestname\" that would record the name of the student who clicked the button. I cannot think of nor see a way of doing this, without the student having the edit view and putting their name in the \"requestname\" field, which would give them access to edit all the other fields. Any ideas? is it possible? Thanks.",

I noticed that when putting in several keywords, Moodle only searches for the exact phrase and not the individual keywords. E.g. When I search for \"Journal of Interprofessional Care\", I get the correct result. However, let's say I put in \"Journal Interprofessional Care\". I get no results. We're using databases to transfer over our link collections. We're dealing with quite long and detailed content in the titles and descriptions. Ideally, we were hoping that people would be able to search using keywords -- people usually do not remember exact titles or descriptions. But it appears that they would have to use exact keyword phrases for the results to appear. Is it possible to amend the databases, so that searching for \"Journal Interprofessional Care\" searches for \"Journal\" + \"Interprofessional\" + \"Care\" and not the exact phrase?",

If you don't, and you use the editors, you will break the layout as it will save table info in the header that has to be in the footer for this to look right, when you are looking at the list view. In other words, it will turn the normally attached list view header , into a separate, un-attached row, above the rest of the list. Basically, what template is doing is putting the table start info in the Header area, and the table end info in the Footer area. You then add one table row in the header that contains table headers  with the column names and any formatting info you want, such as your use of strong. In the Repeated entry area, you define and format one table row with a definition of what goes in each cell or column. You should also add a More link in one cell. In this case I added it to the Noun cell. It makes it possible to go directly to a single record in, Single view. To make each row more compact, I have left off the examples and images. That's what the more link is for, to take you to the single view so you can see the whole entry. NOTE: You need to edit this preset as you do NOT make use of you CEFR checklist field. You have A1 hardcoded in so all entries are A1.",

Though I want my View List to do something similar. See enclosed Screenshot. In the first row (Praktijkopleiding Assurance) you can see that there is no button below \"uitnodiging\". And that is exactly what I want. Though I cannnot seem the script to work for the following rows The button should only show when the text is \"Open\" in the same column. In the list template I have the following code. Which seems to work with the first row, but not with the next rows. What I also want to try is that when the text is \"open\" that it not show the text field but only shows the button. But I think that everything I tried failed due to the same reason that the script does not seem to repeat on entry. if (' inschrijving ' ==\"Open\") { document.getElementById('Inschrijving').style.display='none'; } Hope that someone can help me along.

To work around this, you can try to only enter one unique entry for on teacher's name. In this entry, list all links to their courses. Each link can be one Database entry in the same Database (or any other Web page). Like this: 1. Teacher John Add Entry 0, in the text field, he enters \"John\", in the Textarea field, he will enter a list of links. 2. Teacher John Add Entry 1, in the text field, he enters \"John's course101 intro\", in the Textarea field, he will enter a long intro about course101. 3. Teacher John Add Entry 2, in the text field, he enters \"John's course202 intro\", in the Textarea field, he will enter a long intro about course202. 4. John repeats step 2 and 3 for all of his courses 5. Enable auto-linking to Database entry and all text 'John' will link to his Entry 0 which can be the \"Index page\" or a \"TOC(Table of Content) page\".

          "Title": "Database Availability",
          "Text": "The database module provides 2 settings Available From and Available Until, which basically hide the activity from users if the date conditions aren't satisfied. This seems to duplicate the functionality of the (site-optional) Availability-Date conditions. Is there much objection to merging these 2 features so that the From - Until database setting is migrated to the core availability feature? It has been pointed out that availability is a feature that can be turned off at the site level. So I propose  to treat is as new feature on master, and to drop these 2 settings in favour of the Core Availability API. As part of the upgrade we could migrate the settings to the availability settings but it would require site admins to enable availability, but we should be able to highlight this requirement as part of the upgrade. My main reason for this is that it allows 2 ways for end-users to set up exactly the same behaviour, and for the sake of simplicity /reducing cognitive load, it seems that we should only offer one way of doing things. It was suggested some end-user feedback should be sought. Full details posted in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-60927 M",

If 'sort by' is set to a user-created field, then search will only search that field. This means you miss out on sorting by one field (such as a due date), and filtering all the results by the search string. I didn't expect it to work this way. Seems like it might be a bug. Anyone want to chime in?",

I have to try a lot of times to get a selector that works, because I don't understand the high level CSS syntax that's used. For instance, I've never seen > or [ ] used in CSS before, and don't have a clue what that means. I think a lot of syntax has been added to CSS since I last used it about eight years ago! The CSS I'm using is definitely theme and language dependent (because it uses the exact outputted string in the label), so that's probably why it's not working for you. I guess it might even be dependent on which branch of Moodle you're using because different versions of the database plugin may generate different source. It's worth persisting a little more, because I think displaying both the advanced search checkbox and a tab at the same time is confusing and redundant. At first I hid the checkbox, but that broke the functionality. Hiding the search tab works for me though. Good luck.",

Good News - I have just gotten the new total field in list view version to work as expected and even added the missing 00, 05, and 55 minutes. Debating about adding the missing hours as I spend a lot of time working outside normal 8 to 5 hours. Bad News - Discovered that in list view any project name with a number in it can cause problems. Say that I have entries for Project 2. If I search for \"Project 2\" and there is one or more with the time anywhere from 02:00 to 02:55, the total will be shown as NaN:NaN. Same result when searching for any project name with any number x. Any entry from x:00 to x:55, the total will be shown as NaN:NaN. As long as the task names do NOT use a number, there doesn't seem to be a problem. However, using my new preset, to overwrite the fields in a db activity made with your preset, the total always shows as NaN:NaN. Using my preset to create a time tracker activity seems to work fine as long as project names don't include numbers. I want to troubleshoot some more before I put a copy of the preset here for public use.

I set the start hours to run from 0 to 23 hours and the end hours to run from 0100 to 2400. Everything was looking good until I tried to make and entry for the whole day, 24 hours. Even thought the duration correctly shows 0:00 - 24:00, the spent time spent time is showing as 00:00. If I use start 00:00 and end of 23:55, it works as expected. Obviously something to do with my changes to the Add template. Gotta go do a couple of errands for my wife before I can do any more checking. You're welcome to go look at it. I'm currently using the db activity named \"Time Tracker.\"",

          "Text": "Hi William, Unfortunately, I have worked at places where I did sometimes put in 24 hours straight. While in the US Army, one place we worked 12 hour shifts, 3 days on and 3 days off, alternating between days and nights. On more than one occasion i would work a double shift (24 hours) on the last of the three days for someone so they could go on a trip or something. When I was a medivac pilot in South Korea, we worked a four day schedule. Day one we were \"first up\" and were on duty for 24 hours at the hanger. Day two were \"second up\" and had to be at the hanger during the day, could go home at night, but were on 30 minute recall. Day three was a training day at the hanger, could go home at night, but if both first and second launched, we had to return to the hanger and assume the position of first up. Day four we were off. We were allowed to sleep on first up, but there were many times we would be awake all day an then have to go on a mission for hours at a time after dark. After retirement from the Army, even as a teacher, due to extra duties for things like ball games,\nfestivals, etc., it was not unusual to put in up to 18 hour days. So, in regard to 24 hours, I think it is important to be able to enter 24 hours for an individual entry. And, here is where I know I had not considered it before, the View list Total HAS to be able to show more than 24 hours, as if you just log 8 hours a day, after your third entry it should show 1 day 00:00 instead of 24:00. After the fourth day, it should show 1 day 08:00, and so on. Hope to have a working version soon.",

I finally have Time Tracker DB Activity working the way I want it to with regards to \"24\" hours. ANY end time greater than 24 gets flagged as an Error! If the user changes to 24:00, the flag is cleared. Having a time flagged as Error! does NOT stop the user from going ahead and saving the entry, but in the View list and View single the Spent time for that record has the time and the flag message, Error!, right next to it. I also thought about flagging times where someone tries to use an end time that is before the start time. It will calculate to be a negative time, which then causes Nan days NaN:NaN in the View list. However,the reason I think I need to add code to detect that condition tomorrow, is that it just shows as a \"green\" negative time in the View single. From past experience, I KNOW that if it can be done wrong, some users will do that.",

You can also find heaps plugins which can group users automatically after they have enrolled into your course. https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=group ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You can also enable 'Completion tracking' Edit course setting > Completion tracking > Enable completion tracking = Yes. In each folder or File resource, tick \"Require view' Then, you can see Who has done and Who has not from; Course administration > Reports > Activity completion. This is the easiest way, you don't need to create the 'Choice' module at all. HTH",

          "Text": "Hi everybody, 2 questions about Moodle database activity (I'm on Moodle 3.2). 1. In the database setting, I've created 2 groups of users (students and teachers). Both groups are allowed to post comments and to grade entries. I get one single grade (average grade) for each entry (no matter who gives the grade), and all comments posted appear one after the order (by date). Impossible to distinguish (comments and average grade) between the 2 groups (students and teachers). I'd like to get 2 different average grades (one for each group) and a way to separate comments (students comments in on side, teacher comments on the other side). 2. Is there a way to apply a css to format comments? To change comments policy, background-color, float, and so on (as it's possible to do it with list and entry templates). Thanks a lot!",

Does anyone know how or where to turn this off.\" Hi Peter, the first thing you should always do when entering one of the templates pages is to press the \"Disable editor\" button (unless the HTML WYSIWYG editor - which is really a bad thing there - is already disabled). Best practice is to have a development instance of the same Moodle version, where you maintain a copy of the life database activity. Do all modifications of HTML templates always within a real good HTML editor app - and never directly in Moodle's interface. When you are finished, just select the entire text in your external editor app, copy & paste it into the corresponding field of Moodle's template pages. Finally, press the \"Save template\" button to make the changes effective. Everytime you have changed something of the templates or fields, I would advise to go to the \" Presets\" tab and export as zip. In your life Moodle, import the preset zip you have exported from the development instance. Note that this process only works well as of the current 1.9.1+ weekly snapshot. Best regards, Robert",

In the header you define a string variable to which you then add the relevant table parts from each section of the template and finally document.write it in the template footer. Something like: Header script: var strHtml=\"\"; strHtml+='..'; // open table and header row Body script: strHtml+='..'; // data row; the template generator do the loop on this script command and you get all rows. Footer script: strHtml+='..'; // close table document.write(strHtml);",

Since you are the one keeping track of your colleagues may I suggest you use a Book resource. Make one page per colleague with notes and pictures. The text editor on each page does allow you to upload multiple pictures and of course any text you want. You could even do like I have and install Justin Hunt's new Snippet plugin and create templates to give a consistent look/layout to each photo on a page. I have been using Snippet to make HTML templates that give me the typical layouts that are premade for creating slides in presentation programs such as LO Impress and MS Power Point.",

If you want to stay with Database activity, as AL suggested, use one files/image field per data entry. In the search template, make sure you have 'User first name' and 'Last name' fields, then make a search for your colleague's name, copy the search result and make a list of collection at the database description area. By this way, you can get a personal gallery similar to \"Glossary- full with author\"",

The modification is to have the database in your course with the filtered links for Books and Infographs listed right below the database and add the code to the template that I gave you for hiding empty rows. You would need to set up your template so it has the fields for both categories, then use the same code I gave you for hiding empty table rows so that when viewing a book entry the empty infograph rows are hidden, and when viewing an infograph entry, the empty book rows are hidden. There is another possibility, but I would need a preset of the database to test if it could be adapted to work.",

Work around: 1. Create an addition student account for those ' Managers/Teachers/Non-editing teachers'. When they need to add an entry which has to be approved, use the student account. 2. Are you going to hide those teacher's entry? Then simply duplicate your Database and 'Hide' it from student view. Label it as 'Teacher use Only' (Hidden) 3. Do you want Teacher and Students to use same Database but to have some fields which should be hidden forever? Then don't list them in either 'List view' nor 'Single view', ask your teachers to click 'Edit' to view other 'unpublished' info.",

The problem is that the restore process ends properly, but when entering one of those modules database, appears completely empty. Why not restore data me during which I made the backup? I'm working with Moodle 3.0. As you can see from the two screenshots, one of the screenshots shows the contents of the database activity course that will perform the backup. The other screenshot belongs to the restoration of the previous course in which you can see that there is no data in the same database activity Thank you very much in advance.",

If you don't want to involved to that kind of job, you can override the permission for that teacher or in a course level: Moodle warns security risks! I think it is mainly about your users' profile privacy. The export/import feature is for text only, because it only generates .csv file, neither image nor file can be included.

I have checked all the boxes in the settings of the backup to export me the entire content, including user data. When restoring to a new empty course, I exported all course content except modules records database I have. 2- If you use the tool import / export module database, makes me properly export the content of the activity, but does not make me export the files that are attached to each of the records, and that's I precisely what matters most, to export the attachments to each record in the database module too. Any explanation why is not successful? Can it be due to the version of Moodle? As discussed users of the platform that I manage, two years ago, when they made copies and restorations of course, the entire contents of the module database files with attachments also exported. Anyway, thank you very much in advance.",

As in my previous reply, the import/export is .csv file only, won't include files. This is a feature, not a bug. It doesn't include much user info, hence it is much safer, and smaller in file size, easy to be shared. If you want to include attachments, don't use this feature. 3. I don't think the version is matter, you can restore a database backup to a lower or higher version. 4. Have you checked the permission settings? Have you tried to restore/backup a forum with user data? Have you tried to backup/restore an entire course with user data? If you can't get any user data resorted, means your permission settings need to be reset. 5. I attached a Database backup which has file attachments. Please let me know if it works on your Moodle or not. If you see a version warning, just ignore it, I have tested it. It works in any version of Moodle. Good luck.",

I also had problems like you mention with the editor messing things up. I've learned when I edit the List view of these types of databases, to IMMEDIATELY click the Disable Editor button and just work with plain text. For editing I've also had pretty good success using the Atto editor with the HTMLPlus plugin installed. It sure makes it easier to figure out when you have half of a tag pair missing due to the color coding. I also start with <table> and <tbody> in the heading section and </tbody> and </table> in the footer. It is those two in the footer you have to watch out for when using editors instead of using the Disable editor button. The editors will try to sneak them up into the header section.",

If the latter then you just have to understand how the search url is constructred and create your own html form to denerate that url. For example, if you run the following search in demo features the generated url is http://demo.moodle.net/mod/data/view.php?d=2&mode=list&perpage=10&search=&sort=0&order=ASC&advanced=0&filter=1&advanced=1&f_4=& ; f_5 =hello& u_fn =john& u_ln =doh You can see that the search sends the fields from the form with their content to mod/data/view.php?d=2&mode=list. If you prefer php you should probably look into writing a designated block. You should also look into the data lib function that prints the search form to see how it can serve your purpose. hth",

I've created a link that you can click, and you are redirected to a \"list view\" of your search results within the database activity. Cool. What I would like more, is to redirect to a \"single page view\". And the only real way to do THAT is to have the $rid of the entry. Right now I believe the only way this is possible, is to grab all the entries within my database activity through a sql call. Do my OWN search for an entry and THEN grab it's $rid. And finally, make my link to the \"single view\" of the entry I want. Honestly I'm not too sure how to do that correctly....and it seems like lot of extra work. Am I overthinking this?

I am trying to use Moodle to collect student applications and the Database activity seems to be most suitable for the purpose  but there are a few functions that are not immediately obvious how to achieve. Can anyone advise if the following behaviors are possible, and if so how? Students will need to be able to review their entry and amend it any time up to the closing date. Some fields need to be populated from the user profile The student should only see the add entry tab within the activity Tutors will need to be able to add data to the students submission which will be included in the eventual export. The application form will be running on a separate site so messing with the core code is a possibility if needed. I have added a tutor comments section in the Add Template and hidden this using CSS , can this be revealed depending on a users role? This site seems to suggest that I could pull values from one database into another but I'm not having much luck with that approach. Any advice gratefully received.",

I assume that the \n```text\ninput[type=\"checkbox\"]+label\n```\n and \n```text\nclass=\"template-token\n```\n are key points to make the magic works. Am I right?",

Regarding the \"due date,\" I will concentrate on the behavior, not on semantics and compare the settings of the Quiz module with the settings of the Database module. The \"due date\" in a Quiz activity can be set in the timing section by enabling \"close the quiz.\" The \"due date\" in a Database activity can be set in the availability section by enabling \"available to.\" Both activities restrict the input of user data with a date, but only the Quiz activity indicates this restriction to the user. If a user opens a Database activity with a date restriction in \"Available to,\" the user cannot see the date restriction. It is not automatically communicated in the Database activity nor in the Course Overview Block. So when \"Available to\" is enabled in a Database activity, this should be communicated to the user the same way like \"Close the quiz\" in a Quiz activity.

Don't approve any student's entry, so, they won't see their classmates' answer. 4. Create a Forum or QUIZ with only one question: What is the passcode? 5.

After a teacher uploads a feedback file, student will get notification and the grade will go to Gradebook. In database, teacher can use ##Comment## to give student feedback. Teacher can also give \"Rate\" to each entry and the Rate can be listed in Grade book. Students can use Event monitor to get email notifications.",

          "Text": "BUZZ- the most beautiful database template, how it works? I got the BUZZ database preset from Moodle.org, imported it into my course and it displays the ‘List view’ beautifully and magically: Each new row has an alternative colour When mouse over a row, colour changed Table border got shade All cell has a border I tried to understand how Martin did it, found that in ‘List template’, there is a table in ‘Header’, but no any table in ‘Repeated entry’, nor in ‘Footer’. There are some codes in CSS template, if you clean the CSS template, make no much different to list view. This frustrated me: whenever I want to add or remove or modify a field, the Beauty disappeared, the rows muddled together, not inside a table anymore, only leave header in table. My questions are: How did Martin layouts the ‘Repeated entry’ without put them into table? How the header and rows got shade without any code in CSS template? Is it from current theme’s CSS? How did Martin define the row’s alternative colour? I’ve been wondering this BUZZ preset for years; need help to the know-how. It is so beautiful; I love it and want to get it. Thanks",

You have to do it every time you look at the list template page and never enable it, otherwise when you save the template it ends up broken. With the editor disabled you'll notice that that the repeated entry field contains table rows, and there is actually something in the footer!

My biggest problem now seems to be that in list view all of my rows are green; the CSS included in the pre-set should make the rows white (and alternately gray according to William's comments) and I even tried setting the HTML color to white. I assume this is all over-ridden by some code in my theme since it's the same green color as my blocks. Any advice?

If so, how do I disable the editor and how do I actually make edits to the List View??] Thank you! But I found a very strange problem now. The template you sent looked great but I wanted to add a new field. Changing the Add template was fine, the View Single was fine, but when I changed View List I ended up with the repeated entries being just a string of text (the header was fine - see screenshot). I checked and checked, used code compare, compared the repeated code against the original listtemplate.html in the zip preset file you sent and everything looked fine, just like I'd added 1 more row with a field that was correctly added. I tried this on my own site and on the Moodle test site with the same result. Then I experimented: on the Moodle test site I created a new DB activity, used your preset, added 2 entries and viewed the list. Everything looked fine. Then I went into the templates, opened the list view template, made no changes but clicked Save Template, went back to list view: everything looked fine. THEN I went back into templates, opened the list view template, clicked the \"See more buttons\" option in the WYSIWYG bar, made NO changes, didn't even click inside the editor, clicked save, went back to list view and now the entry was a string of text! Again, this happened on my site AND in the moodle test site. So all I can conclude is that there must be some bug within the DB activity itself? Perhaps new for Moodle 3.0? The exported template attached is the result of the last step of my experiment - I made no changes to your template at all so it should look identical and I suspect, if you open it once and test it will look fine but if you open the View List editor and make any changes (or just pretend to make changes by expanding the WYSIWYG bar or viewing the HTML) then the List view gets wonky inexplicably (though I'm hoping you can explain it)! A work around for now might be to just edit the preset html files directly, then zip & upload and never edit them within Moodle but this is obviously a pain, especially since I'm still in development, might need to make multiple changes and will ultimately be using 3-4 copies of the same DB in my course. But if you can solve the problem that would be spectacular! THANKS!",

To work around this, the Database creator should input a dummy text first, before someone keen to search, even they can't see anything in the list view, knowing nothing to search. Submitted to Tracke, please vote: MDL-53538 Thanks. To reproduce: Create a new Database, with a text input field, or a text area field. Don't Add any entry Search the text or text area Got the error message: Coding error detected, it must be fixed by a programmer: moodle_database::get_in_or_equal() does not accept empty arrays Suggested error message: \"Hi, no result found because no input yet, wanna to be the first one here?

In particular, the button you are looking for is the 'Save and Start New'.

In the actual database activity, I do see several similar empty entries, not identifiable by student. The three students reporting this issue to me have been hard working, and their perspectives are plausible. There are other known issues that may be involved, but I think these students have accounted for these, especially in subsequent attempts: Our college computing is under the umbrella of a hospital and health care system, with time outs and blocking, if there are no keystrokes per a certain period of time. Therefore, stepping away to wash clothes, multitask, or even to read related work while at the computer Some students may be attempting school work from a hospital workplace computer. They may be able to get to the Moodle course, but there may be security blocks and additional time outs or bump outs, on their end.

In Moodle 2.9 I was very quickly able to code something up because all I had to do was enter new js code into the template and save. Then, with the caching turned off (Chrome dev tools open and appropriate setting in place) I could just reload and could see the changes reflected. With Moodle 3.0 though I am no longer able to do this. Changes I make to the code take several hours before they become live. I was able to reproduce this problem on a development local machine as well as a production server . Any ideas on how to help with this?",

When I set the database up initially I go select a group, enter the lesson information for that group, which includes an uploaded PDF file and some other stuff. I do this for 10 lessons for that group. Then I select the next group and repeat exactly the same process for the next group, with exactly the same information. For 34 classes I do this 34 times!!!

You can design the entry form such that it would identify the lesson automatically depending on the view in which the entry is added. With the activity in group mode, the entry will be automatically associated with the tutor group, or with the current group, if the tutor can access all groups. So you only need to create 10 views.

We are building courses for learners with very limited computer skills, and at certain points in the course we want them to answer questions for evaluation by teachers. For various reasons, we've concluded a database is the best vehicle for capturing their answers. In order to minimize the need for student navigation and typing, we'd like to provide them a URL link to a database \"Add entry\" form and pre-populate some of the fields of the entry they are adding. For example, a couple of fields we wish to capture are the Lesson # and Question # they are answering, and at the point in the course where they are linking to the database, we know what those are. Linking to the database Add Entry form is easy - something like\n../moodle/mod/data/edit.php?d=3 will get us there. But how do we\npre-populate fields with data? Is there any way to add that data to the URL link to the Add Entry form so as to pre-populate those fields? We would consider alternate means of linking-and-populating, if they exist (would prefer not to use more plugins or JS code, but can if necessary). Thanks in advance for your ideas!",

With the first I've already done some tests and worked out well but it seems to be limited because I can't do personal \" sql selects\" to the tables where the information is kept.

From my point of view, many form fields are\nnot suitable for ‘Horizontal’ layout. For example, the ‘File’, ‘Image’,\n‘Textarea’ and ‘url’, need wider column size, better displayed in a separate\nrow. If you can make sure you have same number\nof choice in ‘Radio button’, ‘Checkbox’, you can put them in to same row. ‘Multi-select Menu’ can share a row with\nother ‘Multi-select Menu’s. Below are the fields which are suitable to\nshare a row: ‘Number’ ‘Text’ ‘Date’ ‘Menu’ Of course, we need a piece of JavaScript to\nreduce the width of text field. I created an example Database for you, as attached preset. You\ncan find the extra code in the Add template. Feel free to modify it and please\nshare your achievement here if you could find a better way to do this. Make\nsure you keep the HTML edit disabled when you are editing the template.

Build header with the text editor the first table and the cells with the help of the graphic support (in this case you should use the text editor TiniMCE rather than the ACT default html, has better management of the tables), then button activates the decoding key (<>) and change the html code in order to configure each cell of a static value.

Each sample has a common fields like name, id, color etc. but there are 4 different kinds of samples and each of these 4 kinds has 2 or 3 category specific fields, which are only in this category. Since all samples belong to one set, I'd like to avoid creating 4 different database modules. How can I achieve this in one database activity? Thanks for suggestions Martin",

I'll try to be more specific: I need to create a database(database activity module) of materials in moodle. Since those are only materials it makes sense to keep them in a single module to make searches easier etc. Every material has 2 common fields - name and price per kg. I'll start with two material wood and steel. No problem so far But there are some properties of each material that the other does not have. For example steel has a conductivity index and wood has combustion heat. My question is how to deal with this when creating a template. I'd like only those fields, which are relevant to each material to be displayed to students: material wood price per kg 20 combustion heat 5 material steel price per kg 35 conductivity 0,8 In fact there's going to be more 'different' fields (4 or 5), so \"not applicable\" approach is not a good solution I believe. I hope it's clearer now Thank you Martin",

I have created the fields and built the template, there are only a couple of issues that I am having problems with. The two main problems I am having is that I cannot delete db entries. I used the teacher role and the admin role, but there is no delete option in either of the list views as described in the FAQ. Could the reason be that we are using an older version of the db? Our Moodle version is 2.5.1 and I will be upgrading to 2.8.1 in a couple weeks. I'm hoping that the delete option appears after the upgrade. Have others had a similar issue in this regard?

          "Text": "When searching a database using the simple search form, the default search functionality with the \"sort-by\" parameter seems to be broken. When the \"sort-by\" parameter is set to one of the \"Other\" values, eg. \"Time added\", the search functions as expected. Ie., The search term is used to query the database over all fields and then the results are sorted by \"time added\". However, if the \"sort-by\" parameter is set to one of the \"Fields\", the search query breaks down. Only the \"sort-by\" field is queried for the search term and the results are then sorted by the \"sort-by\" field. In the example below, you would expect that searching for \"Swedish\" and sorting by recipe type would display all recipes matching \"Swedish\", including \"Swedish delight\", and sorting the results by type (\"vegetarian\", \"meat\", etc.). However, because \"Swedish\" isn't a type, no results are returned. Demo : http://school.demo.moodle.net/mod/data/view.php?d=21 Is there a way to change this search behaviour to a more intuitive one?",

Question: is it possible in the 'add template' to create a button or link so that, if the student wants to add another piece of information via the drop down list (basically create another version of the same field), they could do it? I'm not sure this is possible as Moodle doesn't let you use the tag more than once in the template. I'm not sure creating lots of fields with the same information would help - or would it? The screen shot below is part of the 'add entry' screen. The academic would like a button or link beneath the text area field that asks the student  ' Would you like to add another core element from the drop down list? '. If the student clicks on the link, it creates another drop down list containing the same information as the drop down shown below - the same field. We've tried doing this using the check box fields but the academic is keen to find out if there is a more user-friendly way of doing it. He also doesn't like the way in which the check box fields get exported to Excel. Any help or advice would be gratefully received. Catherine",

Alternatives you can try: you can also set Entries required before viewing to 50, and as long as no one reaches that number of entries, they cannot see any entries. You can guarantee they won't reach that number by setting the Maximum number of entries to a lower number than the Entries required before viewing. I prefer the first method as it does allow the option of letting an entry be seen whereas the others do not.",

I'd be happy to stand corrected, but in the meantime I continue to make my humble contribution to the Moodle project in the form of the Dataform. The Dataform allows you to populate any of the views with any of the filters, to the course page, either in a block or in label-like resource. You can add multiple such Dataform views on the course page. You can even allow the students to interact with the entries without leaving the course page. For instance they can rate or comment on entries (ajaxed). They can add/update entries if you set the dataform view to be embedded (it will be rendered in an iframe) on the course page. hth",

The input is person's height (in metric, cm) and weight (in metric, kg). The function is BMI=weight[kg]/(height[m])^2. Let's assume the name of the JavaScipt function is \"BodyMassIndex()\".

Notice that in the 'available tags' list in the add entry template you have a list of field ids which you can use for accessing the field and setting there the value. Suppose the designated field is a number field called Bmi. In the 'available tags' list you should see Bmi id - ||Bmi#id|| In the entry template you can add a button and set its onclick event to something like \"setBmi();\" Then if you define the setBmi function in the add entry template it can be something like: function setBmi(){ document.getElementById(\"||Bmi#id||\").value= BodyMassIndex(); } Of course the user will have to click the button to update the field. If you want it to be calculated and updated automatically you will have to add an event listener to the field and that is a bit more complicated especially if you need to support different browsers.

I imagine it is easiest to display this when the page is displayed (also means that the value is always updated).

I tried the two examples I found on moodle without luck.  They were zip files that did not even load until I changed them to .mbz and then they failed with these errors: Debug info: Error code: cannot_precheck_wrong_status $a contents: 200 Stack trace: line 336 of \\backup\\controller\\restore_controller.class.php: restore_controller_exception thrown line 403 of \\mod\\dataform\\preset\\preset_manager.php: call to restore_controller->execute_precheck() line 249 of \\mod\\dataform\\preset\\preset_manager.php: call to dataform_preset_manager->apply_preset() line 54 of \\mod\\dataform\\preset\\index.php: call to dataform_preset_manager->process_presets() Here are the one's I tried: BMI_-_JS_to_calculate_field_and_lists_horizontally Calculated_field-preset-20110131_0107 Then I downloaded my own example by making a preset of the dataform. Upon opening it and comparing to those above they have very different contents. 2nd I tried for another week learning Java and programming it in.  I found 19 websites with examples and a bunch frrom Itamar - pasted them all in with many variations without joy. I assume the javascript or html goes into the repeated entry section by going to manage tab then click view then in my case edit the tabular view.  I changed them to Plain text view in the drop down as well as on my profile because it kept deleting my code.  I got some java scripts to work but I can't seem to get any values corresponding to the items in my table. I set up a table with the same values as in the BMI example but in my dropdown I don't see choices like Weight#id instead I see weight so where do I find the correct id name so I can use it? I tried various scripts from these links without success so I'm missing the concept of identifying the objects and cells in my code.  For example why are these two suggestions so different: %%F1:=||Lecture 1:value||+||Lecture 2:value||+||Lecture 3:value||+||Lecture 4:value||%% and a snippet of this code both used as solutions for dataforms \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('\nWeight#id\n').Xonkeypress=function(){setBmi();};\n\n\ndocument.getElementById('\nHeight#id\n').Xonkeypress=function(){setBmi();};\n\n\nfunction setBmi(){\n\n\nvar weight=document.getElementById('\nWeight#id\n').value;\n\n\nvar height=document.getElementById('\nHeight#id\n').value;\n\n\n\n\nWhy does one use ( ) and # signs before the value and the other uses [] and .value is \n\n\ninside: ex (\"Weighted#id).value vs [Lecture 1 .value]\n\n\nI figured out that F1 meant all the data cells for col F and F2 is for the header but I\n\n\ntried using C1 for my 3rd column for BMI and I could not get anything to show up.\n\n\n\n\nI realize I am so behind the curve that I'm a project needing much more than just \n\n\ntweaking but if I could only get an example to load I could figure it out easier.  I did \n\n\nthe same thing 10 years ago with VBA and now I can use it to solve a lot of things.\n\n\n I'm hoping this does not take me 10 years though.  \n\n\n\n\nThanks in advance :) JT\n```",

The aggregation is a formula that aggregates formulas. There are a few open issues with this feature especially in editing mode and I'm hoping address them soon. Template View",

At some point I will add logical operators. A few tips for Dataform formulas: - The F index of an aggregation should be lower than the F index of the aggregated (e.g. F1 can aggregate F3 but not vice versa). - The aggregation works on subsequent formulas where ever they are and is neither limited to a particular column nor to a particular sub formula. So an aggregation such as %%F:=SUM(_F1_,AVERAGE(_F2_))%% should also work. - The '!' prefix of the field name inside the formula disables editing mode for the field tag in the formula. - You can aggregate in the table row level by using the entry id as the F index of the aggregated formulas (which will make the F indices unique per row). See illustration. hth",

I don't think that I will be able to fix that in the near future, unless someone commissions the work. But, it may be possible to simply add an option to send dataform view content directly into an html file. I'll look into that and if not too time consuming I'll add it to one of the upcoming releases. A working option which got some attention and should work reasonably well is the pdf view. It's a view type which allows the user to export the view content into a pdf file.

No. The DB support for the Database module consists of several tables in the Moodle DB. A php script is obviously extracting that data out in the export function and writing it as an Excel and ODS format. So why is it hard amplify that so that it exports in some other format besides Excel or ODS? Excel and ODS formats and even CSV format are not that simple and require specialized php libraries. CSV is considered simplest but it is only an apparent simplicity. The content exported by CSV is simple text but the content that is stored in DB isn't always meaningful when presented as is in simple text. For example, the content of the time field is stored in DB as unix timestamp, and what you get in the export file if you don't convert that timestamp to a date/time string is not very useful. You can find plenty of disucssions about that down this forum. Another example is exporting the textarea content. You get all the html there which in a spreadsheet is not very useful, and you don't get the content of images, so you don't get everything which is also not very useful. And converting rich content to something that could work in a spreadsheet is not simple. Other formats are less simple than spreadsheets. The simplest of those is probably html as it could be \"what you see is what you export\". But there is still the question of what exactly to export. For you the content of the export should include only entries. Others may want to export also blocks if included. It is possible to write a script that would do that, but the development costs and further maintenance costs more. Someone needs to comission the work and the ongoing maintenance. In some cases, workarounds are actually preferrable to features because they are cheaper and more flexible. You can be the master of your workaround. The CSS approach in the Database activity is one such workaround.",

It increases the page size in the background so might reach some limit if the page displays a large amount of content to begin with. The solution requires css and javascript but both are fairly simple. The javascript adds a new element under body and copy into it the content of the main region. The css makes sure that only this element will be sent to the printer to the effect that only the activity title and list of entries will be printed. In the header section of the list template we can add a print a button as a shortcut to the browser window printing. In the footer section of the list template we add an inline script that calls the javascript function we added in the javascript tab. That's it. If you use Windows 8 you can print to Microsoft XPS Ducoment Writer which sends the content to oxps file which you can then open for viewing with the integral xps viewer. If you use chrome browser the PRINT button will open the Chrome Print Preview and the content can be viewed there before printing. hth Javascript tab \n```text\nfunction preparePrint() {\n\n\n    var mainregion = document.getElementById('region-main');\n\n\n    var printarea = document.createElement(\"DIV\");\n\n\n    printarea.className = 'printme';\n\n\n    printarea.innerHTML = mainregion.innerHTML;\n\n\n    document.body.insertBefore(printarea, document.body.childNodes[0]);\n\n\n}\n```\n CSS tab \n```text\nbody .printme {\n\n\n    display: none;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n@media print {\n\n\n     body > * {\n\n\n          display: none;\n\n\n     }\n\n\n     \n\n\n     body .printme {\n\n\n          display: block;\n\n\n     }\n\n\n}\n```\n List template Header \n```text\n<button id=\"printbutton\" onclick=\"window.print()\">PRINT</button>\n```\n List template Footer \n```text\n<script>\n\n\npreparePrint();\n\n\n</script>\n```",

The region-main element may still be theme dependent, so you need to inspect the page to make sure you refer to the correct element. Alternately, you can wrap the content of the list view with an identified element and use that element instead of region-main. To do that you can open a div element in the list template header \n```text\n<div id=\"myListContent\">\n```\n and close it in the list template footer. \n```text\n</div>\n```\n and of course change the respective line in the javascript to \n```text\n    var mainregion = document.getElementById('myListContent');\n```\n Note that since the html in the header and footer parts of the template is effectively broken, you will have to turn off the editor when editing the template so that it is preserved. hth",

Moodle language packs have to strings to tell you which characters to use, and there are functions format_float to output a PHP float formatted the way the user expects, and unformat_float to reverse that on input. That comes close to getting it right. But, in reality, even that is not perfect, because of places like Québec, which is English-French bi-lingual.

When I started working on Dataform rules (the incomplete feature pre-2.6) one of the rules I envisioned was 'content update' which would change entry content on event. This could meet your requirement as it would allow you to specify certain content that would be added to a new entry not via the entry form where the user might change it, but in the background on submission. You can open a feature request in the Set: Dataform tracker. I will definitely want to add that at some point, time and funding permitting.

So for instance, if you have in your activity a text field called Text and the field id happens to be 367, then the pattern [ [Text#id] ] will be rendered as field_356. If you inspect the html of the entry form you will see somewhere there something like \n```text\n<input class=\"basefieldinput\" name=\"field_367\" id=\"field_367\" value=\"\" type=\"text\"></input>\n```\n which is the html input element if this text field. The tag may be useful for accessing the input elements in the entry form with javascript . For instance, you can add javascript that changes the background color of the input box when it has content. Of course, for this to work the javascript should reside in the template rather than the js tab because the the tag can be rendered only in the template. But if your javascript is complex you can put it in js tab and add to the template only minimal javascript the calls the required function and passes to it the tag, something like \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">// <![CDATA[\n\n\ndo_something_really_complex_to_input_element(\"\nText#id\n\");\n\n\n// ]]></script>\n```\n hth",

I'm looking for a tool that enables the teacher to make comments and add files about the booking after it's over, another teacher to easily look for and view this comment, while that comment is hidden to the student. I couldn't find anything in the Booking module that does that.",

What happened was that the first view I chose was \"Editon\" (first on the list) and for some reason that view doesn't display anything. Actually, even when there are entries the default \"Editon\" view doesn't display them, not sure why (that's Moodle 2.5) Now that I've spent quite some time working it out, I'm still stuck with one problem. Here it is. I want 2 views, namely: 1- a list of all entries: a table with each entry on each row 2- a single entry view: one page showing all the fields for one entry only What I'd like to do have is a link on each row of the view 1. When clicked, that link would point to view 2, showing only the corresponding entry. Any idea how to do this ? Thanks again for this great tool. Sébastien",

Alternately, you put the javascript in the Javascript tab of the Database activity. More convenient for editing, but it will apply to all 3 templates (list, single, edit) unless you condition its execution in some way. One way is to put it in a question and then add to the target template a call to the question. For example, In the javascript tab: \n```text\nfunction myCalculator() {\n\n\n   var data = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n   ...\n\n\n}\n```\n In the header or footer part of the template: \n```text\n<script>\n\n\n   myCalculator();\n\n\n</script>\n```\n Or, you can use an element that you know to exist only in the target template to condition the execution of the script (you can add that element to the template). For exmple: In the header or footer part of the target template add something like: \n```text\n<div id=\"my-calculator-div\"></div>\n```\n In the javascript tab: \n```text\nif (document.getElementById(\"my-calculator-div\")) {   \n\n\n   var data = [1, 2, 3];\n\n\n   ...\n\n\n}\n```\n hth",

Basically, you need something like: \n```text\n<input id=\"my-calculator-input\" type=\"text\" />\n\n\n<div id=\"my-calculator-result\" style=\"width:240px;background:#CCFF99;border:1px solid #DDD;margin:10px 0;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n\n<div><input type=\"button\" onclick=\"myCalculator();\" value=\"Show result\" /></div>\n\n\n<script>\n\n\n   function myCalculator() {\n\n\n      var data = [];\n\n\n      data[30] = 89;\n\n\n      data[33] = 95;\n\n\n      var inputval = document.getElementById(\"my-calculator-input\").value;\n\n\n      // Check that data for inputval is defined.\n\n\n      if (typeof data[inputval] == 'undefined') {\n\n\n          var result = 'No results for specified input';\n\n\n      } else {\n\n\n          var result = data[inputval];\n\n\n      }\n\n\n      document.getElementById(\"my-calculator-result\").innerHTML = result;\n\n\n   }\n\n\n</script>\n```\n hth",

Here's my wish list.... A User enrols into the course. Before undertaking the scorm activity I want them to enter useful data  within the database activity such as their full name, email, and particularly relevant safety certificate details (eg their working at height cert as well as the expiry dates etc.) To really help, can a rule be used within a database to control (for example) if you tick a certain box you are forced to fill in specific fields.? For example I ask \"are you working at height?\" If you tick yes you need to add the cert details. However, If you tick no you can skip these fields and carry on filling in the other fields? Once all this has been done I'm hoping to set up the course to allow the user  to undertake the other training activities but to only allow the student access the certificate once the admin has viewed the users data entered into the database activity, and marked this activity complete  - say if they are happy all information given is in order such as the certificate dates etc. I've been looking through the forum to try and find a similar thread so apologies if I missed this or if I'm asking the question in the wrong place! Any thoughts or advice gratefully received and by all means point me in the right direction if my idea of using the database maybe making things more difficult. Kind regards Darren",

For a date range you can specify a criterion such as BETWEEN  2014-09-01 .. 2014-10-01 or a relative criterion for current month >=  first day of this month etc. Then if you don't want to make this filter available to students you can hide it.

Goal: CSS width 300 for column 1 of Add Entry (I have guidance and models in that column, requiring the width). Problem: Text areas push the CSS column 1 to about 100 px, resulting in very ugly UI. Attempted solutions: Set all text area field widths to 45 columns. No success. When Add Entry loads, it looks good (screenshot 1), but quickly resets to look bad (screenshot 2). I have to manually drag all text area editors to expand width of column 1. CSS template included (screenshot 3) if the fix is simple there. Many thanks in advance. It's my first attempt at using Database , and I'm crazy excited for the research possibilities. Don't want to unveil it until it looks good to my students.

The Dataform has a add-on field type which allows for displaying in dataform A the content of a view from dataform B with filtering criteria based on the entry (in dataform A) in which it is displayed. So you can create a dashboard Dataform activity with an entry for each pupil, and fields of this type to display in the entry content from the other Dataforms. Another possible approach which I have used in another custom-made field type (for the Dataform) is to filter the content of the view by user id from the url. Then you can create the dashboard effect by adding Dataform view blocks in the user profile page for displaying the pupil's data from Dataform activities anywhere (and you may have to set permissions on the blocks or the profile page to allow only designated roles to see this data). hth",

          "Title": "Expand Database/Dataform to replace other activities and resources",
          "Text": "Yes, I really mean that. I posted details here: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/unify_all_activities_and_resources Currently there are many different kinds of activities and resources, with varying features, some of which would be desirable in other activities. For example, ratings could be used by students to give feedback on faculty-posted resources. Rubrics could be used in grading Forum discussions. The Allocation features of Workshop could be helpful in the Assignment activity. Some of these activities, like the Quiz activity, implement plugins for question types and behaviors, but these can't be used in other, similar activities. Yet, all of the activities and resources are just different variations on databases. It is easier for most instructors to use pre-constructed activities like the current Quizzes or Assignments, but these could be implemented as templated presets of a new, super-database activity. This is what is proposed in the linked page. Here is an example of what I would use it for: At the beginning of a course, we want to ask students what their objectives are for taking a course, and when they hope to achieve that objective. For example, someone might be taking a course to be able to get a better job, or to go to graduate school, or to solve a particular problem they have at work or in a hobby. With this super-activity, we would create a question: \"What goal do you hope to reach by taking this course?\" We would also ask \"when do you hope to reach that goal?\" The student could enter one or more goals and dates. When the date is reached, the student would receive a notification from Moodle: \"On date xxxx, you said that you hoped you would reach goal xxxxx by this date. Have you reached this goal?\" The student would then be able to click a link, return to the course in Moodle, and indicate whether they had reached the goal, or wanted to set a new date. We would use the resulting data to determine what goals our students have and whether or not they are reaching them. We would be able to work with our students identify additional steps they might take to reach their goals. We would be able to evaluate our course designs to see if they are applicable to help our students reach their goals. Here's another example. We include an Announcements forum in the \"zero\" topic of each course. We would like to be able to display the most recent post(s) within the course page, just below the Announcements forum link itself. Here's a third example. We ask students to post resources within courses to share with other students. We would like to enable ratings for these resources and automatically show the highest rated links within the course, as well as allowing students or the instructor to see the most recent unrated links. Here is a fourth example. An instructor asks each student to post a project using a spreadsheet. The instructor asks each student to self-evaluate the project using a rubric before submitting it. The \"submission\" criteria are set so that the attached file cannot be considered \"submitted\" until this self-evaluation rubric is completed. A fifth example: the college decides to standardize links out to video streaming sites as a new \"type\" of resource. An activity template is created that includes a custom video icon and accepts a URL to a video. The video will be displayed on a page within the course, with a forum below it that appears after the video has been watched. The activity is defined to be \"completed\" when the student clicks the link to view the video AND submits a comment in the embedded forum. The idea is to create a flexible Activity that would allow an instructor or course developer to adjust the parameters and create new kinds of activities without needing to code in PHP. Groups of related interactions could be easily combined into a single activity for convenience of student viewing and instructor grading. It would also allow plugins like the Advanced Grading plugins to be developed once and used with multiple Activities, since they would all really be the same activity with different settings. Ideally, a migration tool would allow existing Activities and Resources to be converted to this format. Is there any interest in having such a structure? We would be interested in helping to fund it if we can get enough interest from other institutions and from Moodle HQ to get the feature into Core.",

The username generated by ##user## and the link generated by ##more## do not always point to the same record.

When on a single entry page and clicking on the comment link this will take the commenter to a different record. See the image \"comment.jpg\" :  the comment link points to rid=36956 whereas the record on the screen is rid=36954 We cannot see a pattern to the rid substitutions though they are within +/- 2 or 3 record numbers.

There are examples of more interactive slideshows with the Dataform but at this point they require adding a bit of javascript to the activity. This part is not too difficult and the code examples offered by providers of js galleries are usually sufficient for anyone to be able to create the effect in the Dataform. The Dataform docs already provide an example and more examples are underway. The main issue when using these js galleries is licensing. Not all galleries are free and usually those with the interactive features are not. The galleires on wowslider.com are not free if you use them for commercial purposes. I cannot include in the Dataform galleries that are not completely free. But if you have a gallery you want to use, I can help with instructions how to apply it to a Dataform activity. hth",

Am I doing something wrong or is not possible to use the Multi-Language Content filter for the database templates, and if not, is there any other ways to change the language inside the template based on the user language. PS! I am using Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090923) Kind regards, Tobias",

          "Title": "Entry workflow",
          "Text": "Entry workflow is undoubtedly one of the most desired features for Database module users. An enhancement is currently developed by Wiktor Wandachowicz and some discussion about it can be found down the Workflow support thread. More recent discussion was lost after the cluster crash in Nov, but it suggested that the enhancement should be completed fairly soon. Workflow functionality is also developed for the Dataform module. Here is an illustration of current functionality. Comments and suggestions are welcome. Entry workflow can be applied to a Dataform by adding an Entry States field and some Entry Access Rules as needed. The States field allows for defining a list of states and a list of transitions with permissions and notifications. Undefined transitions are allowed by default to users with manageentries capability. There is no limit on the number of states. Entry access rules allows for setting access control for entries with a certain content, e.g. entry state. So for instance if we want to prevent students from updating or deleting submitted entries in this workflow, we can add a rule such as the following: In the definition of the rule, the subset of applicable entries can be determined by selecting an existing filter and/or by adding search criteria. In this illustration the rule uses a filter that is set to find all entries in state Submitted or higher. Access is set in the rule's context permissions: Then in entries list the entry states can be displayed and set according to permissions. In this illustration the current state is green, permitted transitions are orange and other states are grey. Tea Cher who is the teacher and has manageentries capability can set all states for all entries: Joh Doh has 2 entries, one submitted and John can no longer update or delete it and the other is still a draft and John can update, delete or submit it. Jane Duh has 1 entry that has been submitted and reviewed and so she can no longer update or delete it. Hope all this makes sense. Comments and suggestions are welcome.",

The additional javascript may be part of the Database preset in which case it will be in the Javascript tab of the activity and you can try removing it to see if the problem disappears. Or, it may come with the theme you are using and you can try changing to a standard theme to see if the problem disappears. Or, it may come from somewhere else and you can have someone use the browser developer tools to debug. Or, the file manager problem is caused by something else. Hard to tell without inspecting the environment so try first the above. hth",

They must add an entry to the database by a specific time on a set day - after which the database is to switch to view-only mode and the students use it as reference for their next task. Unfortunately the \"available from\" and \"read only from\" admin settings only allow you to input a date, which differs from most Moodle restriction fields there are no settings for a time within that date. Can anyone confirm when the restriction comes into place? I'm anticipating that it happens at Midnight as the date switches onto the specified date (unfortunately not the time I wanted). Can anyone suggest a way around this without the manual intervention of me pressing the button at the correct time on the correct day? Think I'll need to submit a tracker request to have timestamp added to the view-only field (if it hasn't already been requested). Thanks, Gordon.",

You can add javascript to the instance to prevent editing but javascript can be turned off on the client side. Submit a tracker request for future versions. Afaict it is not likely to be changed in released versions as it is not necessarily a bug. At any rate, it seems like a fairly easy fix which you can try to apply to your installation. Basically, change the date_selector in the module settings form to date_time_selector. So, in mod/data/mod_form.php around line 29, change $mform->addElement('date_selector', 'timeavailablefrom', get_string('availablefromdate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); $mform->addElement('date_selector', 'timeavailableto', get_string('availabletodate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); $mform->addElement('date_selector', 'timeviewfrom', get_string('viewfromdate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); $mform->addElement('date_selector', 'timeviewto', get_string('viewtodate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); to $mform->addElement('date_ time_ selector', 'timeavailablefrom', get_string('availablefromdate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); $mform->addElement('date_ time_ selector', 'timeavailableto', get_string('availabletodate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); $mform->addElement('date_ time_ selector', 'timeviewfrom', get_string('viewfromdate', 'data'), array('optional'=>true)); hth",

Currently the id and name attributes for database field controls (e.g. input , textarea ) are created with the field database id number, e.g. { 'id=\"field_'.$this->field->id.'\"' }. This is problematic for template javascript, as different instances of the same database preset will have different ids (as each instance has it's own copies of the fields in the database). This can be worked around by adding ids or classes in the Add template, but a better solution would be to use a sanitised version of the field name as a class on its control element. I've a patch (on the issue) that adds these classes for Checkbox, Number, Text, and URL field types. Any thoughts?",

What have we missed as this seems to be a pretty basic database function that must be possible? longer version: One of our teachers has a card that pupils fill in each time they make something. Putting the card into database is relatively straightforward and seems to work well, but we need the ability to pre-populate the cards for a particular class with targets that the students can then evaluate themselves against, which may or may not be individual to the student or the class. we are happy that we can do that with a CSV import, but the pupils then need to be able to \"edit\" their record to add their bit and we can't see how to make the editing possible.

In the Dataform I've enhanced the textare field type to allow turning off the editor in the field settings. I've just drafted a possible similar enhancement to the Database Textarea field and time permitting will propose it for integration. If you do html and javascript you can create textarea directly in the template html, use 1 or more Database Text fields to store the content in and hide them in the template (e.g. by style=display:none), then use javascript in the edit tab to copy the content from the textareas to the designated text field(s) and in the view tab to parse the content from the text field for the display. hth",

It is basically a questionnaire, but the difference is that, once students have submitted, the supervisor may be able to edit some fields as well as add comments. Every student can only see their own entries. I thought of trying the Database activity of Moodle, as well as the enhanced version, Dataform, https://moodle.org/plugins/search.php?s=dataform The dataform is a release candidate and I have spotted a couple of problems in the testing, so I prefer not to use it. My problem with the database activity in Moodle 2.2 is that it is a complete nigthmare to update or modify fields within the different templates (Add a new entry/View List/View Single, etc). The templates section in Moodle 2.2.4 is absolutely rubbish: nothing works as it should and it takes me ages to go through all the different templates when I add or modify a field. Because I am desperate, I thought of creating my online form in Moodle: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Form_API but I don't understand this bit: Then instantiate form (in this case simplehtml_form) on your page. What does it mean: 'on your page'? Do I need to create a blank html page in the moodle core code? Any advise is very welcome. Thank you very much.",

The purpose is to allow students to make weekly entries in a structured journal template. I have already ruled out the online text assignment activity as a viable way to do this, but I could perhaps be convinced otherwise. I have identified two possible ways to do this: 1. Create groups and put each student in a group of his or her own. 2. Set the posts to moderation and direct the teacher not to approve any posts. That will keep the posts invisible to other students. #1 is harder to set up because I need to create groups named after each student. I know how to auto generate groups of 1, but the groups will still have to be manually renamed. The advantage of this approach is that it's easy to sort the entries by student. #2 is easier to set up because all students use the same database. However, I don't see a simple way to sort the entries by student. I was also curious about grading database assignments. I see you have to activate ratings to do that. I assume this means that the teacher will rate each entry in the database interface and the gradebook will average out the entries for each student into a final grade if I choose the option to average the ratings. Finally, is it possible to use the Joulegrader to grade DB assignments?",

I have stumbled across the database tool and it seems to work well for my intended purpose BUT I want to simplify the way that searches are done. I would like the staff members to be able to type in one search term and see a list of results. I would like the search term to work across all fields in the database (there are only 5, two of which are text field, and two of which are drop downs). At the moment, the Advanced Search seems to be the default. It prompts staff to insert search criteria against each field, rather than them searching for one search term across all fields. The simplest way to do this seems to be 'hiding' or at least not make the 'Advanced' search the default option. However, I can't seem to turn it off! Any suggestions? Thanks, Peta",

Otherwise, course managers may start having undesired autolinks in their course content because other course managers made their databases/glossaries global.

          "Text": "> If you think you need GROUP_CONCAT then it is probably a sign that you don't understand relational databases. I started to address that in my original post, and perhaps I should have.  Certainly that's true when you WANT a relational data structure, such as in the business logic, so maybe 80% of the time that it's used, it shouldn't be.  Then there's the other 20%, when it's not being used wrong. The other 20% of the time, when it's actually proper / okay to use in my opinion, fall into two categories, one when it's \"acceptable\", and one when it truly is the best way available. Sometimes, it may be acceptable when both a) you're in the presentation layer and that's what you're going to end up with anyway, and also b) doing it in the query is ten times faster than calling a PHP function in a loop.  A example of that would be as above, a list of users, one column of which is the groups they are in.  If you're writing the UI page to show that (not a library for user info), I think that's acceptable.  In that case, you WANT something easily human readable, you don't WANT a proper data structure any longer. Where it may be the best choice available would be if there were a class called user_list, which does not show the groups.  You want to add a plugin to show the groups. Thankfully, class user_list does offer a method user_list->add_column() to add a cell to each row in the table.  So easy enough to add the \"user's groups\" column, right?  Except add_column() gets you one cell, for one value.  The list of groups isn't a single value, so you can either a) have your plugin return the group list as one value or b) rewrite the exist user_list class to allow each cell to contain an array of values, which it will then concatenate in PHP, accomplishing precisely the same result with far more work. A particular instance of the above type of example that you are familiar with is question_bank_column->get_required_fields() - it expects one field, so GROUP_CONCAT(tags) might be the best way to do it.  The other option would be to get Tim involved in significant changes to how question_bank works, just so you could have a column for \"Used by these quizzes\", or \"has these tags\". Wow I was long-winded in this post, but I don't feel like editing it to be shorter.",

So I would not recommend directly adding things to the database. That being said, you may want to take a look at the mdl_course_modules table and see if adding records there for your newly created quiz will help. You will need to know the quiz module id (from mdl_modules) and the instance id from mdl_quiz and the section id from mdl_course_sections. As you see, it gets a little complex and then you may also end up dealing with mdl_role_assignments and perhaps other things that I may have overlooked. I hope this is helpful. Peace - Anthony",

In order to make things \"just work\" a bit better, I'm just wondering if anyone can think of a slick way of forcing a script on the server to be run (would have to be in admin/cli, probably) whenever someone adds or edits something in a particular database activity. I realize I could just poll the database every five minutes with a cron job (or modifying Moodle's existing cron task) but I was hoping there was something a bit more subtle that might work.",

          "Text": "Hello, I work at the Medical School of the University of Dundee and I am exploring the possibility of using either the Database standard activity or the improved Dataform to create like an online record system to monitor students progress throughtout our Msc Dissertation Module. The idea is that, for every meeting that a student and a supervisor has, the student and/or the supervisor can complete an online form (that online form would be a database entry) filling the following information: -Student name -Supervisor name -Msc proposal title -Sumary of progress. -Actions agreed -Key concerns -Date and time of next supervision, etc. It is easy to create an entry using the different types of fields of the database activity. However, the challenge is that student X (with user id XXX) can only read his/her only entries when clicking on the database activity. Since Moodle does not pass the student user id in the url, I don't have an easy way of alterning the code view.php restricting the entries only for the entries that user id or the supervisor of user id has written. Is there an eassy way to change the database code to do that? I know that what I am looking for is something similar to a Personal Learning Plan, but the only one I know is this one: http://moodle.ulcc.ac.uk/mod/wiki/view.php?id=2674 and the two latest versions available in GIthub are quite unstable at the moment, so it is worthless using it in a production site. Thank you very much for your advice.",

I just don't have that many database activities in use and I just never seem to find the time to experiment with it.

I have imported passwords and user IDs into a database, and the ONLY thing I want students to see is their OWN password when they enter their own lunch number. So far, I have gotten it to work, however, because the student view of database is able to see multiple pages (see graphic below), all a student would have to do to see other passwords is to enter their own lunch number, and then browse other pages. this isn't acceptable, so I want to restrict access to ONLY viewing the page they have looked up, and nothing else. I modified the graphic to show how I don't want to see the other tabs (Add Entry and View List) Also, I would like it so that in \"View Single\" it isn't possible to click on the breadcrumbs to other records. I tried permissions, but there isn't anything in there to restrict access. How then is Moodle presenting this? If I am an administrator, I see many more tabs than a student would, so there has to be a way. I am using version 2.4. Here are the graphics... Thank yo u.",

I will take a look later tonight at seeing if I can make something work on my local 2.4.  You did answer my question, though, about whether all 200 students would be accessing the same course and same activities ; it sounds as if they all see the same course?  I'll be testing based on that scenario.  Please don't bang your head on this one too much more.  I sometimes have a gift for making things more complicated than they need to be, so when I go back and review your requirements (and it actually sounds as if what you were originally looking for was more of a notification system than a database) it might be that something else would work better.  I'll let you know once I have the ability to somewhat create what I had in mind and see if it works.  Best, Lesli",

          "Text": "If you try the Dataform please download the most recent build from git at https://github.com/itamart/moodle-mod_dataform . You need to first create a Dataform activity, then export your data from the Database activity and import it into the Dataform activity. For import into the Dataform create CSV view (to distinguish from the deprecated Import view). The view allows you to specify the field patterns to import and the csv settings. Then you prepare the csv content and either upload it from file or paste into a textarea in the import form (especially convenient for testing the import content before importing many entries). After import you are redirected to the browse view to see the imported entries. If there are no entries the import failed for some reason which at this point is not displayed (hopefully this would be added soon). Now, you can import almost anything that can be displayed, including entry info such as userid, timecreated, timemodified etc. You just need to include the right pattern in the view template. The csv column name is by default the pattern name unless you define in the template a different name. The import form also allows you to set a specific name for each column in case your csv content is predefined and you don't want to change its column headers. The pattern for the entry owner is ##author:id##. In the Dataform settings you can select group mode 'Separate participants' so that each student can see only his/her entries. Also, set max entries to 0 and entry editing time limit to 0, so that students would not be able to add any entries by themselves or edit the entries that were added on their behalf. If you want to be able to edit entry owner when editing an entry, use the tag ##author:edit##. This tag behaves like the ##author:name## tag in browse mode but in entry editing it displays for managers a dropdown of all the course participants. All this is undocumented so if you need futher assitance just let me know and feel free to add to the module documentation at http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Dataform_module .",

          "Text": "The database activity has a great potential for more learner centric learning. In lots of discussions teachers told us that the idea is great and they would like to used it but usability is really a mess. Specially the list view editing process is not usable for a normal teacher. To create acceptable results some understanding of HTML is needed that most teacher don't want to use. The text editor often breaks the process. I've thought for a long time how to simplify this process and I think there is a way we can do it. Lets implement a new simple form for standard view definition. If the user opens the form he sees a table with all data fileds created earlier plus the system fields #'user## et al. He can mark the fields that should be used for the table, a second column shows the order of the fields and the last one is the title as defined when fields are edited. If fields are selected and ordered they can save the changes and the view will be created. Most teacher accept to use a standard design for the tables and are not interested to change them. Advanced users can click at the link 'advanced' modus to use the traditional way to define the views. This process could be implemented for all four views: new entry, search, list, and single. Top priority has the list view, because it creates most of the problems. Please comment aloso at MDL-36152",

If a database has 15 or 30 fields the table is to wide to be usable. For typical teachers the handling of tables in the editor is complex and here we can try to replace it by an other process. The idea of simple text area entries is interestig but teachers have to learn the codes for the fields. I don't know how much effort the different solutions create to implement. Martin told during our German Moot this year that he like the database very much because lots of scenarios activating students are possible.  So it should make sense to design the processes carefully.",

The more flexibile the platform the more complex the ui. Just like Moodle 2 by comparison to Moodle 1(.9). It shold be fairly easy to create a form layer as in your sketch above.

A real solution would require a module enhancment. It would require not only storing the order of each newly added entry but also reordering when an entry is deleted.

As an example, \"database 1\" will consist of student names, contact info etc. Whereas \"database 2\" will consist of teachers interactions with students, i.e. meetings, telephone calls, email etc. What I am trying to achieve is to allow teachers to add a new “interaction activity” in database 2 from the single view page of the database 1 record by clicking on a link on the single view page. When clicking on the link the teacher should be taken to the “Add entry” page in database 2. Additionally, the student name from the database 1 record should automatically be pre-populated into the new record. The purpose of this is to establish a link between the two records in database 1 and 2. What I have done so far is to create one link in the html template for the single view in in database 1 that will take them to the “add entry” page in database 2. However I am not able to pass the student name over, thus the teacher has to manually enter it every time, and if they make a spelling mistake the “link” between the two databases are broken. I have tried to pass the student name to the database 2 using url parameters. i.e. ( http://ims.jsc.no/moodle/mod/data/edit.php?d=99&FirstName=Thomas&LastName=Brown ) But this does not workL Any advice on how to pass field data from one database to another (using url parameters or by other means) would be very much appreciated.

I updated the database template manually, so that the new field would display in the right place. When I visit the database, the new field appears and I can edit it, but when I put a telephone number in, no field information appears when one displays the database record. I've got a horrible feeling I'm going to have to build the whole database again from scratch. Suggestions : 1. Could this bug be fixed? 2. Please could 'move up' and 'move down' arrows be added to database fields, so that they can be re-ordered for editing and convenience? - I appreciate that database templates might have to update themselves automatically.",

For this idea, I would basically like to modify the roles so that 'students' (i.e. staff who aren't admins of this set of information) can only submit a new entry, no repeat entries, and then edit certain fields in the database activity (if this can't be done, then no editing allowed at all). They should be able to see their own entry, but no-one elses. The 'teachers' (i.e. admin staff) would then approve their request, and get an ID number for the entry (for a permit to be produced). They would then store notes about this person (i.e. tickets), and have an ability to revoke the permit (either delete the entry, or check a tickbox saying they have revoked it). Does this sound plausible? I've not seen a 'show only own added entries' type option in the roles override / Permissions page, only the ability to prevent them approving entries and managing entries.",

This of course will prevent you from using the approve tag for approving entries for 'office use only'. In the Dataform you can achieve the 'view own entry only' effect by a designated 'group mode' called 'separate participant'. You are then free to use the approve tag for internal purposes. Notes With the entry comments as the natural candidate feature for this behavior. Afaict, not possible in the Database module if you don't want participants to see the comment, because if you enable comments they will be accesible to the participant. Possible in the Dataform by adding the comments only in the managers' view(s). Alternately, you could use the Moodle Notes engine. You don't have actitvity context there, so the notes are not specific to this Database/Dataform activity. But depending on your detailed requirement it could still work for you with the notes in the course or site (or manager) context. Revoking By unapproving and approved entry. hth",

I've had a further play with dataform (just the odd warning message on 2.3) and having got it just to show a student (staff member) their own entry, I'm down to specific questions for this use case: Can I remove the edit and delete entry right from a student? Whether they're approved or unapproved. Or at least get it to send a notification email that an entry has been edited/deleted and which one? Can I remove the Current view dropdown for students?

          "Text": "Can I remove the edit and delete entry right from a student? For starters do not add the ##edit## and ##delete## tags to the student view. But that in itself does not prevent editing and deleting by direct url. So you need to set the editing time limit in the dataform settings form to some number of minutes. For instance if you set it to 1, editing/deleting will be prevented after 1 minute from adding the entry. The default is currently 0 for no time limit but we should probably change that to distinguish 0 editing time from unlimited editing time. send a notification email that an entry has been edited/deleted and which one? This is possible by a specialized field but this filed is not included in the standard distro and not yet released separately. Can I remove the Current view dropdown for students Yes, simply remove the ##viewsmenu## tag from the students' view template. But sometimes it is useful to leave the tag there. The menu appears only if there is more than one visible view (for managers 'visible' includes hidden and disabled views). So if you have one view for students they won't see the menu. But if the menu is in the template managers will see it and would be able to navigate easily out of the view should they need to. And how do you prevent a student editing a particular field, so only admin staff can? Currently the only way is to not include the field in the designated view for adding an entry (assuming the entry is locked for editing soon after it is added). There is a special view type - editon - that may be useful for this as it is designed for adding one entry. Other ways are underway. hth",

My question is around how to inform the Drupal database of a successful or otherwise completion of a quiz. We will use Moodle to offer exams. There will be one exam (quiz) to be paid for, and two that are free. We will create the payment process in Drupal, and inform the Moodle database about course registration when the exam is paid for in Drupal. My question is around setting up the courses and quizzes in Moodle. Since the two free exams are optional, am I better to do them as separate courses, with only a single quiz in them? If I put all three quizzes in the one course, can Moodle notify upon succesful completion of a single quiz? My next question is around creating a module to inform the Drupal database of quiz results. Is there an existing module I can use? If not, would someone point me at a good guide to writing Moodle modules (I'm VERY new to Moodle). Thanks for any help.",

I got the idea to use the database module to set it up so that users can go into the database activity, add new announcement items which then gets sent to one specific email address, where a human would then collate, modify, and send to everyone else. Two ways I could do this: Use mailto . I got this working simply enough by using the Single Item template and coding a mailto. The problem though is that I want to code a textarea into the mailto syntax, and since textarea can have HTML the mailto syntax breaks since there is no way to escape the html. Or maybe I could use Javascript to do that? Use a cron job . This would actually be best, but I have no idea how the database module stores its data on the backend, nor any idea on where to find documentation on that. Any help greatly appreciated.",

          "Text": "Hi Itamar, Can you confirm  that there is no such problem in version 2.1.1+ (20110921)? Here is my problem: Create 8 fields (4 text and 4 DATE) and fill them as describe: time 1 (text) =  3 november 1998 (date) time 2 (text) = 13 june 2011 (date) time 3 (text) = 14 december 2011 (date) time 4 (text) = 7 may 2011 (date) There is no problem when you save your work and look at the cards... every thing is fine. But when you decide to modify you will see appear: time 1  =  1 november 1998 .... you lose the 3 of the day time 2  = 13 january 2011 ... you lose the 6 of the month time 3  = 14 december 2011 ... every thing is fine time 4 = 1 january 2011 ...the worst, you lose the day and month If the day is between 1 and 10 it is back off to 1 and if the month is between january(1) and october(10) it is back off to january (1). The year remains always correct. I made a large database for the course \"Physical education\" in my school and several computations are made against the date of birth.  There was no problem with the javaScript command document.getElementById(field_391_day).value (391 is the value of the field) in moodle 1.9 until I use moodle 2.?.? (I don't know where to find the exact version number in moodle, I have to look at the download file, which is in the school's servers... please dont laugh). In moodle 2.1 the javaScript command is more complex but still work perfecly at least for the year. First you have to find the id of the field using a = document.getElementsByName(field_391_year).item[0].id and then using document.getElementById(a) to get the number of the year. Tank you so much for your help",

This does not seem to be a database activity issue but rather a lib issue and in particular html_writer::select_time (outputcomponents). This happens january-sepetember because select_time uses two digits string representation 01-09 for the selected month value but one digit representation 1-9 for the selector option values. So the test for a selected value 01-09 against the options would fail and the selector would default to the first option - january. In my test environment the two digits represtation is for some reason converted to one digit representation before the test and the test for the selected succeeds. Probably in your server it doesn't and the test fails. If my suspicion is correct then this is a bug so you should probably check the tracker and add an issue if needed.",

The 'Activities' block on the front page appears to be empty and I can't figure out how to add anything to it. The 'Add a block' drop-down menu does not list a database module.

Then, when you turn editing on on the frontpage you should get a topic section where you can add activities just like in a course. Alternately you can add the 'Main menu' block on the front page. The block allows you to add activities and resources without the topic section. You can also hide the block so that the activities won't be visible on the front page but they would continue to be accessible and you can post direct links to them in other places. The Dataform is indeed an enhancement of the database activity module. To use it you need to install it. But it offers many more options than the database module and there is not much of docs for it yet, and so it may be a bit confusing without some prior experience. Start playing with the database module and hopefully by the time you get the hang of it there should be more Dataform docs to allow for an easy transition.",

If you trying to create a better search/filter functionality for the module you should probably consider using the dataform in which it is already implemented in a highly flexible way. Alternately you need to construct the sql with the FROM clause something like: {data_content} c JOIN {data_records} r ON r.id = c.recordid and of WHERE clause with conditions like r.dataid = ? AND c.content = ? and if this is just a yes no question you can just count the result to make it more efficient. hth",

Afterwards, that record must be deleted (the date is not available any more because it's been assigned to the conference). I hope i was clear. Do you think i can resolve this problem easly?

The dataform's equivalent field to the database's menu field allows you on edit to add a new value. This value will be recorded in the entry but also added to the options list of the menu field and become available in the dropdown for subsequent entries. So, if the Date field in your application is such a menu field you could just add dates to the options list of the field either from new entries or from existing entries and you wouldn't need extra entries which would need to be deleted after use. By a simple enhancement (planned for the dataform field) you could also limit the number of times a certain value from the list may be selected. A possible drawback with this approach is that without some cleanup the options list holding the dates will continue to grow and become difficult to work with. If you need to keep history you need to somehow archive the current entries, because removing past dates from the options list would reset the Dates in the entries. But archiving shouldn't be too difficult with export/import. In editing mode it would look something like the Chapter field in the following illustration: hth",

          "Text": "Dear Piergiuseppe I see. Ok, with - http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Data_manipulation_API - you should be able to make your own queries. Using MySQL Administrator I observed how the database works.  So, given two databases, one for the bookings (title and date) and another for the available dates (just dates) and no other databases in my moodle installation, I observe... Two entries in 'data' table in the real database with the 'id' being the identifier - in my case the available dates database in Moodle was '2' and the Booking '1'. In 'data_fields' in the real database the 'dataid' field is the foreign key to the 'id' field in the 'data' table to associate fields with databases - in my case, my 'available dates' had it's own 'id' of '3' in the 'data_fields' table. Then adding / removing some data reveals that in the 'data_content' real table the 'fieldid' attribute is a foreign key to 'id' in the 'data_fields' table and has another attribute 'recordid' which is a foreign key to the 'id' field in the 'data_records' table - which is a timestamping log sort of table.  And the 'content' attribute of the 'data_content' table is the date as a string which appears to be the number of seconds since 1st Jan 1970. So...  What you need to do is for one database lookup all of the 'content' for the 'id' of the database containing the available dates but by using the 'id' of the field in that database, in my example, '2' and '3' respectively.  Once you have '3' you can convert all of the 'content' to dates and display.  Then when the user selects and you want to remove the date from the 'data_content' table, first remove it's record in the 'data_records' table with the 'recordid' foreign key, then you can remove its entry in the 'data_content' using the 'id' you previously got. I realise that this is complex!  The best way to see what is going on is to have a clean Moodle installation and observe the data in the tables I have stated with a GUI etc. as you perform your scenario. I hope this helps, Gareth",

Our goal is to allow teachers and students to be able to search, reserve, check overdue status etc. Also, ideally our librarians would be able to check in, and check out resources through moodle (or have it sync with moodle). Is this possible to do directly in Moodle? I've searched through the forums and could only come up with the Virtual Library module (still in BETA), and the \"Library Resources\" block. We are also willing to use a 3rd party library catalogue management system, but we would want it to integrate into our school's moodle sites. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

This includes some date fields such as course start and end dates etc. However when using advanced search, and you would like to bracket a date range, it is not possible. More to this, it is not possible to use the date field as an option in the search. If the date field is present in the database advanced search template, it will be automatically populated with todays date when doing an advanced search. There is no functionality to remove the date. This means that if we are not able to search between two different dates e.g. for all courses completed between January and November.  It also means we must know the date a particular course was completed on. This is extremely limiting and dissapointing as it means we would have to develop an external database search facility. Does anyone know if there is a fix or workaround for this? Thanks.",

I now need to query this database for complex queries such as how many activities of a certain type between certain dates did the user attend. It appears that the Database Activity does NOT have this capability, is that correct? I'm aware I can connect to the backend of Moodle and run SQL queries on the database tables but as I want the user to be able to run queries the only option I can see is to embed some custom php in the page which will run external SQL queries and dump the results back into the users page. This seems complex and time consuming and a bit annoying! . Surely other people have wanted to do the same thing and found a solution? Any help much appreciated, Thanks, Alex",

          "Text": "Hello Amir You have an interesting idea. I'm not sure whether the Moodle database module is the best tool to achieve this. It is a very primitive database. The Moodle database module is very usable in its current format - but with limitations. I don't know whether there are plans to change it into a fully fledged database design tool in the near future. It would be fantastic if that would be the case. Some people would use Moodle just for that! Ideally you want to be able to link to other information in the Moodle database (not the database activity). E.g. The learners' information. I don't think one can do that - but I stand to be corrected. You also want to be able to create more than one table and a many-to-many relationship. You would want a table for the 'books', a table for the 'loaners'(this could be the Moodle User table) and a table containing 'loans', just very simplistically. You want a one to many relationship between the books and loans and a many-to-one relationship between the loans and 'loaners', thereby creating a many-to-many relationship between 'books' and 'loaners'. AFAIK one cannot create any relationships between tables with the current database module. Again I stand to be corrected. Having said that, I think that you could possibly use it to implement a library management tool. In one way it can work similar to filterable spreadsheet. You would make the books' information central to the database. You can have a field for date loaned and date returned. You can have check box or radio button field to indicate that the book has been reserved. The problem comes where you have to indicate who has borrowed the book. You will have to use text fields here - you will not be able to select the name of a user already on the system. This creates the possibility of incorrect spelling, inconsistency and so on. The same applies to the name of the person that has reserved the book. If a student wants to see which books they had borrowed in the past they can simply do a search on their name.",

Set up a database activity with the details of each book (Title, Author, Subject, Cover image, etc.). These basic field content is included in the list and single template. I also added other fields for managing the library, only some of which are shown on the templates and other used for book management by librarian which gets teacher permmissions for this activity. The fields include book loan status (on loan, available, etc.), date taken, date due, user (this is not shown on template). Librarian updates these fileds. User field is updated with the username on the moodle system (this is important for later and you have to see the field number in the database activity by looking at the fields list - see below why). I then added a couple of things to let users be able to see the books they have listed on their names and to help the library management. I added a link resource on the course page to the databse activity, with a partial search query url of this format: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&mode=list&perpage=10&search= In this link I also included a parameter variable of the Username and named it f_## where ## represents the number of the filed used for username in the database activity. When a user clicks this link they thus get a list of books which is listed in their name. This resource link was called \"My books on loan\" and was set to open in same window. To make things even nicer, I added an HTML block on the side of the database activity, and added a text \"See My Books\" link to the resource link described above (the link cannot be defined directly in this HTML block because you need the username parameter to be added to the search query. Note: there is a privacy/security issue here - if a user edits the username to someone else's username on the url they are able to see the book that user has. This is not critical in our case but should be noted. In a similar fashion I added an HTML block to help the librarian with quick database search query links: see all books on loan, order books by date due, etc. Things I was unable to solve thus far are book loans history and book reservation. I have an idea for solving the first one. I think you can set up a seperate DB activity for \"Book loans\". This would include history of loans with username, book code, status (loaned, returned...), time taken, time due, time returned. I am unsure if and how the book code field could then be linked to the seperate book details databse. If this could be done it would be an interesting option for creating simple limited \"relationships\" between databse activities within moodle. Comments and ideas welcome.",

The catalog consists of Title, Author, Subject, Cover image, etc. (as suggested above) and managed by the librarians. Users can view the catalogue and request items. An item may be requested either from the list view or from the single view by clicking a certain link which opens a popup window (or just another tab depending on your preferences) with the user's add entry form in the reservations database and paste the item's id (and other details if necessary) into the relevant fields. The user then can add to the form other relevant info such as date after which the item is not needed or comments and submit. Now the reservations database can be set to separate groups and each user should have his/her own group. This way each user can see only his/her own reservations in the database while the librarians can see all users. The database may be set to require approval and librarians can approve checked out items and the list view may be set to display for the user which items are checked out (\"approved\") and which are still pending by means of different colors or other formatting. A more flexible approach would be to use rating but currently this value is displayed only in the single view and displaying it in the list view so as to make tracking more user friendly requires hacking the code. The reservations database can be used also for history of loans and statistics. That's just off the top of my head and some of the suggestion may require further exploration. Hope this helps in any way.",

Basically, for some silly reason, the teachers of this particular course are not happy with implementing a normal interactive forum and want something that is more one-way. Though a solution to this problem is really easy to do with 2 simple forms on a PHP page writing to a database, I am really struggling to figure out how best to do this in Moodle. I think I'm right in NOT trying to do so with the forum module? (especially not with the rather inappropriately named \"Q&A forum\"). My thoughts were to do so with the Moodle Database module, though I have never used it before today. Basically I created a simple database with just 2 text-area type fields: Question and Answer. However, from what I can make out, there is only one type of template that can be created for adding data to the database. How do I setup the database module with two separate template forms, one that allows the student to ask the question (with just the question text input area available) and another for the teacher which has both? Should I even be doing this with database, or is there some other Moodle module or something completely obvious that I am missing?",

The only problem I have with using Glossary is that just like in the database activity, it still shows the two text areas for Question and Answer to the student. This may be confusing to the student, and the student has to be instructed to only fill out the first box. Though the glossary is a quick way of setting something like this up, I think I might as well use the database activity module, so that I have a bit more control over the views and page layout. I have just set it all in the Database activity, and I have also followed your good suggestion of having the teachers needing to manually approve the student questions, which gives them a need to go back to the page and answer. However, if it is setup how you have mentioned so that the \"Add\" form only shows the question, and then with the single and list views showing both fields then the problem is that when a teacher wants to answer the question (by clicking on edit) it will open the one and only \"add question\" form. So I presume that the teacher will not even be able to answer the question there... well at least not without doing some \"behind the scenes\" technical wizardry?",

I've tried putting fields within table cells and formatting the cell size, but I can't alter the cell width either.  Every time I save, it reverts back to default. (I've also tried alternately setting this activity up as a forum or an assignment, but the students would have to cut & paste the form into their text entry area & the formatting almost always gets lost.  It seems there should be a simple way to have students manually enter answers in a formatted document, but I can't figure it out. Database seems like the answer, if I could only change the field size.)",

          "Text": "Assuming your starting point is the default template, one fairly simple way is to add to the css template the following: div.defaulttemplate input{width: 100%;} This definition will make all input field elements inside the template stretch to the size of their container element. So, if the fields are organized in a table, you can set the width of the table cell to determine the width of the input field it contains. This method is, however, column sensitive, that is, the actual width of a table cell is the width of the widest cell in the column, unless you merge cells. A more fine-grained method is to enclose each designated input field in its own container, that is, a div element with some className, and add a css definition as the above for that particular class. Example: Given the following part of the add template <tr class=\"r0 lastrow\"> <td class=\"template-field cell c0\">hello:</td> <td class=\"template-token cell c1 lastcol\">[ [hello] ]</td> </tr> Enclose the hello field with the highlighted code <tr class=\"r0 lastrow\"> <td class=\"template-field cell c0\">hello:</td> <td class=\"template-token cell c1 lastcol\"> <div class=\"myHello\"> [ [hello] ] </div> </td> </tr> Then add to the css template the following (change the size as needed): div.defaulttemplate .myHello input{width: 20px ;} hth",

I opened CSS template (which was blank) and pasted div.defaulttemplate input{width: 100%;} I saved the template and opened Add Template.  I create a two column table with 20px width & a text input field call $ . $Price $ But when I view the add template, the width is still the default for all text. I tried the other method as well (changing myHello & Hello to my$/$) but it doesn't make any difference.  All text fields are really wide.  Am I doing something wrong? Sorry to be so dense!  I'm using Firefox & Moodle 2.2 -On another note.  When I merge columns in a table, I'm not able to set the width for ANY of the cells in the table.  I can open cell properties, type a width, & save, but nothing changes & when I re-open cell properties, the width box is empty.",

Is this the \"moodle form\" that you spoke of? \"...add a template_form.php and define there a class which extends moodleform for each of the list, single, and add templates and for the other templates as needed.\" so I need to create an extra php file, that will create ONE class that extends ALL template types....? \" ...templates.php to handle calling the form classes for displaying or processing submitted data.\" This I have no idea where to change the call...would it be in this code? if ($mode == 'listtemplate'){ // Print the list template header. echo '<tr>'; echo '<td>&nbsp;</td>'; echo '<td>'; echo '<div style=\"text-align:center\"><label for=\"edit-listtemplateheader\">'.get_string('header','data').'</label></div>'; $field = 'listtemplateheader'; $editor->use_editor($field, $options); echo '<div><textarea id=\"'.$field.'\" name=\"'.$field.'\" rows=\"15\" cols=\"80\">'.s($data->listtemplateheader).'</textarea></div>'; echo '</td>'; echo '</tr>'; } ===================== Lastly, by extending the single view template.......will this allow the student to upload/embed a video in their database entry?

I've done that for the dataform. It should be easier than fixing the templates (although the templates should be fixed one way or another). If you still want to fix the templates you could take as an example the preset.php and preset_form.php files. It's a bit different there because preset.php displays several forms at the same time, and you need to display only one at at time.

I looked for any documentation for a Javascript template to accomplish this, but only found this WIki that didn't have many details: http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Database_templates . Is there any documentation out there, with some examples, that would be helpful? My Javascript is pretty rudimentary, so some pointers, especially in regards to templates for the Database activity, would be greatly appreciated. Also, I need to customize the Excel output to order the fields in the way my client would like them, as he needs to drop the resulting output into a purchase order for our textbook supplier. The fewer steps he needs to do this, the fewer headaches for me. Could someone point me in the direction of the script that handles export to Excel format so I can see if this is a simple enough task for me? Eventually, I'd like to write a script to just render and email a purchase order to the supplier, and save our account manager some work, but first things first.",

          "Text": "Adding simple javascript to the Add template should be fairly simple. You can define functions in the js template and call them from the desired template. For example. Type in the js template something like: \n```text\nfunction helloAddTemplate(){ alert('Hello add template');}\n```\n Then, in the Add template, in html mode, add something like: \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n\n//<![CDATA[\n\n\nhelloAddTemplate();\n\n\n//]]>\n\n\n</script>\n```\n Now, if you want to access html elements on the page you can either pass their id to the javascript function in the template or traverse the DOM from within the function (provided you organize the template such that you know how to get the element). For the first approach you have field id tags which look something like ||fieldname#id||. A function call with a field id in the args may look something like: \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n\n//<![CDATA[\n\n\nhelloAddTemplate(\n'||fieldname#id||'\n);\n\n\n//]]>\n\n\n</script>\n```\n Or you can get the element in the template script and pass it to the function: \n```text\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n\n//<![CDATA[\n\n\nvar myField = document.getElementById(\n'||fieldname#id||');\n\n\nhelloAddTemplate(myField);\n\n\n//]]>\n```\n Etc. The list of fields for the export is generated in export.php. So if you want to reorder it you should probably be able to do that by modifying the code there. hth",

If the view already exists, you need to \"refresh\" it. If it's a default view you can simply reset it from the views list by clicking the icon. If it's a customized view you need to edit it and save. Could you confirm that you do the setup in this order? As for the package related warnings, could you confirm that the dataform/package dir exists and has proper permissions? Btw , the package dir is meant for including samples with dataform distributions. You don't need it if you only want to store packages in the course or publish packages across the site. For the latter you just package the dataform which creates a course level package in the file system, and then you can share the package across the site which creates a copy of the package in the file system as a site level package.",

Here's what I'd like to do.  Each group is responsible for covering one chapter of a supplementary textbook.  Within each group, there are different roles: the summarizer, the terminology expert, the idea connector, etc.  Each role would be responsible for a section of the group's one database entry. The wiki or even forum provides the bare bones functionality that I want but both modules are completely lacking in terms of presentation (organization of information).  I was hoping to create a nice database template for students.",

If you want to use the database activity you can set the entries to require approval so only you and the student placing the entry would see their contributions.  It wouldn't mean the other student would see the points awarded to them so you'd have to transfer them to the gradebook for that.  Remember that students can only see their own grades in the gradebook and cannot add marks to other students with their default role.  I would not provide students with the ability to mark other students via the gradebook!

The link to the import form is a \"template tag\" and may or may not be included in a view depending on preferences. Clicking the link opens the form on the same page (this may be ajaxed): The form is meant for import but it also allows for adding multiple new entries. That's like adding a new entry but plural. So you enter the number of new entries you want to edit, say 3, and submit (\"import\"). This opens 3 new entries for editing: But back to import. There is the CSV settings and import input which may be either a file or text. The text option basically allows you to enter the csv in the textarea and may be useful for quick adding a few simple entries. The importer may select to edit existing entries, in which case the csv should contain a designated column for entry id and each record should have its entry id. The importer may also select to open the imported entries for editing after import. This may be useful for small imports where the imported data is partial for this or that reason and should be amended manually. I suppose the important questions are with respect to importing (and exporting) rich content such as files or formatted content such as dates. Binary data (such as image files) may be imported/exported in csv as base64. This however, is likely to make the csv file unintelligible to the naked eye. So perhaps identifying files by name in the csv and uploading next to the csv file a zip of the imported files. Let me know what you think.",

The import functionality serves first and foremost the course manager (in the standard database module it is hardcodedly restricted that way). It's effectiveness and efficiency become crucial mainly where the activity is used as a resource such that the content is entered only or mainly by the activity manager, or when it is used as a management or administrative application. I've done both. As an example of the first instance I've used the database activity in courses as a repository of examples of solutions to exercises of the types students where required to submit weekly. When building the repository, but also during the term, I occasionally have to update all or many entries. By many I mean dozens or even hundreds of entries. I have all the examples in excel where I apply the changes efficiently and then generate csv and upload to Moodle. In the standard module I have to delete existing entries and upload new ones. This may break internal links (from forums and other areas). In the implementation proposed above I can update existing entries from the csv. Some other times I just want to quickly add a few entries without having to create a csv file to upload. Again the proposed implementation allows that. I guess you haven't used the database activity in a way which would require this functionaliy. But you may have some other related requirement which I could add.",

What you want requires that teacher and admin may add entries on behalf of the students ( IMO a reasonable requirement which is therefore implemented in the dataform plugin). If you want to hack the code, probably the best way to let teacher and admin add entries on behalf would be via import from csv. You would have to add the student userid to the respective entry in the csv file. For this strategy to work you need to modify import.php around line 114 such that it accepts the userid column from the csv record (currently it accepts only the database fields). In addition you have to modify lib.php around line 594 such that it assigns the imported userid to the entry record right before it is sent to the DB (the current code assigns new entries from import to the importer). Finally you should set max entries so that students won't be able to add entries, and omit the date field from the edit template so that students won't edit the date. hth",

You place the activities on the front page . Then you create a new role, say, myReviewingStudents, and in each activity you override write entry permissions to allow it only to that role; then you assign to the role the students of the respective course. Then you add in each course a link to the respective activity. So when students want to post a review, or instructors want to approve reviews, they need only follow the link from the course into the activity .

If the latter, then you could use the database rss for populating entries from the four courses and a bit of fairly simple javascript for displaying the entries in that global container (you'll also have to tweak the core code to allow more than 50 entries in the rss).",

Maybe this is of some use to you http://www.abceducation.ch/mod/data/view.php?id=247 It is specifically designed for our IB Middle Years Programme documentation and as a non logged in user you can see it and search it .If you log in as username  testteacher   password testteacher    you can edit and upload files to the resource tab at http://www.abceducation.ch/mod/data/view.php?d=2&mode=single#page=page-7 Go to the test entry and you will see a file to download Specif and fine grained permissions can be set so some groups can view, others edit and upload. Others design and add templates and field etc. The templates can be edited to what you want. It has a java script and tab. css to give it its form. I am not a web developer but just adjusted this script to my needs. If you want to download the database go here http://www.abceducation.ch/#page=page-6 You can download it adapt it and then put it into your moodle site as a preset. This preset can be made available site wide and makes the database available in different instances in each course. It is an  empty vesssel that can be used for different departments If you or anyone else can use it, adapt it donate to our partner school atthe same adress. Cheers Alex",

I've noticed that youtube uses <object> and <embed> tags, while vimeo uses <iframe> to embed videos. I've also tested to check whether other (non-vomeo) iframes work in the textarea - and they don't So it seems that the reason of the problem is that (for some reason) iframes are cleaned out of textareas in the database activity module. It's strange, because in other places in  Moodle, iframes work with no problem. Does anyone know how I can make iframes work in textareas in the database activity module?",

          "Text": "Yes, it's possible in various ways. One important consideration is that the javascript doesn't have to go into the add template. It can be in the javascript template and if it is too long for that template too it can reside in an external js file which you can call either in the add template or in the javascript template. Judging by your example above, it seems that you can reduce the size of the template considerably by not repeating the 'document.write' clause even if you break down the html writing to separate lines for better readability of the code. Something like: document.write('<table><tr> <td>1. Demonstrates very superior intellectual ability</td> <td>||sid1'+i+'||</td> </tr></table>'); As for the entry fields, one way to go about it is to dump all the field tags inside the template, each one enclosed in an identified div tag which is set to display:none. This way you will have all the fields hidden in the template and available for further manipulation by javascript. Then, your document.write loop could look something like: document.write('<table><tr> <td>1. Demonstrates very superior intellectual ability</td> <td>'+document.getElementById('sa1'+i).innerHTML+'</td> </tr></table>'); The document.getElementById('sa1'+i) retreives the eclosing div of the desired field and the innerHTML retreives its content which is the field itself. And there could be other more or less efficient ways to do all that depending on what your actual template requires. hth",

If you're comfortable with dom you should probably grab the div container of the field and append it to the table you create, rather than copy its content. If you want better control over where your javascript output goes you should probably get used to not using document.write (unless you have performance issues). Instead, construct strings and assign them to the innerHTML of a specific container element. Consider that the js template is applied to all views (edit, single, list). So you shouldn't simply write to the document in the js template, but rather wrap the code in functions and call designated functions from the views. If your code should be ran only in the edit view, wrap it in a function and call that function from that view by adding to the template a script tag with a call to that function. hth",

Basically all users (with the exception of the admin) can only view the database entries, and are not allowed to approve, edit, delete or create entries. However, I do want all users to be able to post comments and rate the entries (in the single list view entry). In setting up the database I allowed for comments to be made, and also allow for posts to be rated. But nothing appears in either the single or list views which would let us work with this, and I can't find anything in the tabs which point me in the direction to adding this to the single view. So my questions are: 1. What do I have to do to have a small box appear below the database entry (single view) which would allow for users to comment on the database entries? 2. How can I make a ratings scale (of 1 to 5) appear on the single view? Thanks!!",

That, in itself does not yet prevent editing because the editing view may still be opened by direct url. So you need to remove the content of the add template and put a message such as 'Entries can no longer be edited'. Then, even if students figure out the direct url to the edit view all they will see is that message and will not be able to change their entries. Even you won't be able to edit entries without an actual editing form. Whatever you do, remember that what you see as an instructor is not what the student get.

Does anyone know of a way to hide a single field when the database is viewed by a student but to show it when it is viewed by a teacher? Currently we are using a Glossary to house the support FAQ and we put the public entry into the glossary entry body and put the private instructions in a comment and then hide the comments from students.

The idea is that teachers can turn block editing on, in which case, the body of the page is assigned the css class 'editing'. So if you set the designated fields to show only under the 'editing' class, teachers will be able to reveal them by turning block editing on. Of course these fields are still accessible to students in the page source, but if the information is not confidential, this is not a problem. I'm working on a plugin which will allow you to design more than one view (among other things) such that you could have one view for students without the instruction fields and another for teachers with these fields.",

We used separate groups so the teacher could comment on the entries including the grade then alter the view template and remove group mode so students could review other's entries without seeing the comments (grade). When students add entries and they are NOT approved they are only able to see their (separate group) entries - this is as expected. However, when the teacher approves entries for a group (say Group 1) all students see these regardless of their group membership (Group 2,3,4 etc) - this is not what I would expect for separate groups (only visible groups) Also regardless of separate or visible groups, the groups dropdown doesn't seem to filter the entries for students or teachers... Is anyone else experiencing this problem with Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090630) ?

May I ask: why do we need groupid in the database content table? This records, if I understand it correctly, is the group membership AT THE TIME when the entry was made, which has nothing to do with the time the entry is LOOKED AT. Now why would this make sense? Can we not just pull in the group membership from the group_members table when the records are requested? Sorry, but groupid in the database content table looks like a non-normalized design to me. I'll set groupid manually to fix the problem for now and hope that by not changing group memberships all will work from now on. If that is wrong, please let me know. Michael",

One more considertation. Get the designated text field ('date1x' in the example) by getElementById and not by document.forms[0]. The Add template may have more than one form and since the order of forms in document.forms may differ from browser to browser, using document.forms will put the 'date1x' field in superposition, to the effect that its actual place-holder form may be known only from a browser's perspective.",

          "Text": "Why is the select link showing up under the [[Date] ] input field/box and not to the right of it? because the field is hardcodedly enclosed in a div tag. If you want the select to the right of the field either put these items in a 2-column 1-row table or work out the required css (which may be quite tricky). What is the JavaScript template for? It is for javascript code, BUT, in your case you use [[Date#id] ] tag which is not javascript code and as is can be known and properly converted to code only in the Add template. You can pass this tag as string into a function which is defined in the js template but that requires some more coding. You also include a js file which you can do in the js template if you use the proper dom methods. Is there a difference between going into HTML mode and disabling the editor? If the editor in database 2.0 works like in 1.9, it doesn't appreciate white spaces in the code so unless you remove all white spaces from the code you need to disable it if you want to edit the template. As a workaround, keep and modify this bit of code in an external file and copy paste into the template as needed. hth",

          "Text": "David - I always enjoy new and creative ideas. Your idea sounds interesting but I am wondering how it might actually be used. In terms of implementation, it would just be a matter of adding a field to the data_fields table. I started looking at what would be needed to require a field and this would seem to be take off on that in so far as it is a type of field that is to be completed by the teacher. Essentially we could use the data manage activity capability (or create a new one) such that if the user has that capability then they can complete it otherwise they just see the value of it. To a limited degree, this might also be accomplished by adding a field but not showing it on the add record template. The disadvantage would be that the teacher would not have an easy way of editing or adding their data since editing a record also uses the add template. I personally do not envision this being something useful in core but it could be a nice little patch. Some possible scenarios explaining how this feature could be actually beneficial may be helpful in changing that personal opinion. Peace - Anthony",

          "Text": "Hi Anthony, yes I think you are right, that this would not be useful for many. I was just thinking, that this could be nice for example for administration purposes. The teacher could upload a certificate to a record created by a student. Or that some information entered in a record is only visible to the teacher (confidential) but all other fields are visible for all the students, ... But there is another point perhaps more important : I develop courses for teachers like \"Learn how to use moodle in your class\". I personally like the database module and use it often instead of a wiki, because it is easier to use for the students. Nevertheless teachers do not use the database tool for one specific reason: It is too complicated to create. The solution would be a database creation wizard (Create your database in 5 guided steps) 1) Choose the fields you need 2) Now the fields chosen appear and you are asked to choose the ones appearing in list or single view, including checkboxes for the ##user##, ##...## Example (instead of yes/no use checkboxes) List view Single view Show username yes/no yes/no Show the date the record was made yes/no yes/no Show the field \"Uploaded File\" yes/no yes/no Show the field \"title\" yes/no yes/no 3) Choose display mode for list view (For 99% of the use of database 5 different display modes are enough) First display mode : Fieldname as title of columns, records below. The teacher can choose to alter the name of the columns TITLE Uploaded file Username Date uploaded Content of the field \"title\" Uploaded file example name date1 Content of the field \"title\" Uploaded file another name date2 Second display mode : Just group the records and display one below the other Third display mode : Drag and drop the possible fields in a given matrix Fourth display mode : manual template: Create your view with the editor (as it is now for html experts) Fifth display mode : display records horizontally. 4) Choose the default display order of list view (sort by date, title, username, etc) 5) Choose style template (three styles available) But perhaps this wizard takes too much time to program? Another idea for the database: possibility to define certain fields as \"required\". Now you can submit a record with empty fields, this should not be possible if a field is required Yours, David",

          "Text": "David - For your first use scenario of a teacher needing to give a certificate, I first thought of using the advanced upload assignment type. A student submits something and then the teacher responds by uploading a certificate. But I could see from that example how allowing certain fields to be completed by a teacher only could be helpful. I see your ideas on templating as expanding the options for default templates. It would be nice to have that be a plugin where the wizards could just be dropped in. That would allow folks to develop options beyond some of the simple possibilities. As for the required field, check out MDL-5583 and feel free to watch/vote for it. I started work on it but dealing with how to actually require the form became a mess and I have not had a chance to get back to it. I have a patch in MDL-11400 which creates the tick box and if I recall will highlight it so that it says it is required but it does not actually require it. Keep the ideas flowing. Peace - Anthony",

The current templates approach makes this practically impossible for the average user. Suggested improvement: A generic templates structure which will allow the user to determine and design the activity's available views according to one's own preferences. So, for instance, one may want to offer students to select from 3 different list views and omit the single and search views. The template placeholders may be defaulted to the list, single, search etc. but the single and search could be override and redefined as lists. Views could be switch to by a dropdown list in the main view tab. In addition views could be set to allow edit mode so that even list views would be editable (like quick editing in the gradebook or assignments). More details in MDL-26983 . Vote if interested.

And to determine that, I can write js function that insets there the appropriate audio. And so the identification is the course and the topic or week and the number of the entry. Do you have any Idea how I can do that? Or any other way? I do not want to add the audio directly to database because it is too time consuming. Also the other way is to import the audio to the database automatically, but then the problem is quite similar (determine what to put where). Thank you for any help. Regards Jiri",

So here are some thoughts and let me know if I'm in your right direction. Suppose the audio creator has a list of words/sentences to record. The file name for each item can be predetermined as a certain fixed manipulation of the word/sentence. So when the audio creator records the item he/she saves the file with the predetermined file name. Now, all these files will go to a specific location on the site which you already know. Therefore if the entry contains the file name, you can set the view template to concat the name with the folder path and you have a link to the audio file which moodle will convert to a player. All this means that you can create the entries independently of the audio files and as soon as the files will be uploaded to there designated location the player will be able to play them. Does that make sense?",

We have one load balancer running squid, and then 3 application servers behind it. So this https is important to us for squid server. Our solution is actually pretty simple - adding a site setting under the \"Site policies\" for \"Force https\" as a checkbox, and it would be up to system administrators to check (or uncheck) this checkbox for the Moodle instance. This has been working fine for us. Here is what you need to do: (1) In /admin/settings/security.php At around line 63 (above // \"httpsecurity\" settingpage Add the following line: $temp->add(new admin_setting_configcheckbox('forcehttps', 'Force https', 'Force the application to always use https:// . If not enabled, the default will be http:// . This is commonly used with Squid server or SSL accelerator', 0)); (2) In /lib/weblib.php At around line 297 at the bottom of the function qualified_me(), add: //squid hack to make it work if (isset($CFG->forcehttps) && $CFG->forcehttps == true) { $protocol = 'https://'; } else { $protocol = 'http://'; } $url_prefix = $protocol.$hostname; return $url_prefix . me(); } This added code works on our server moodle 1.9.7+ very well and error before with an ssl https installation.

As you can imagine, the entries pile up after a while, and some students are late in submitting their entries, so it becomes hard to keep track of which ones have already been rated without opening each one in \"View single\" view. Is there a way to add the ratings to List view, so that I can see quickly which ones still need to be rated?

I am, however, one small step short of getting your solution to work: the variable aBulkAction does not get filled with the correct URL strings, even though the number of strings is correct (\"33 entries will be deleted. Proceed?\"). The result is that the iframe only displays \"404 Object not found\", and debugging tells me the strings in the variable are all \"undefined&confirm=1\" Somehow the part in the Javascript that identifies the cell containing ##delete## seems not to be doing what it should (even though I have adjusted cells[13]): function bulkDelete(){ aBulkAction=['delete']; var myList=document.getElementById('itemList').firstChild.rows; for (var j=1;j<myList.length;j++){ aBulkAction.push(myList[j].cells[13].firstChild.href+'&confirm=1'); } if(aBulkAction.length>1){ if(confirm((aBulkAction.length-1)+\" entries will be deleted. Would you like to proceed?\")){ window.frames.bulkaction.location.reload(); } }else{ aBulkAction=[]; alert('No entries were found'); } } If it's not asking too much, could you comment the single steps of filling the variable with strings, or point out other assumptions that I might not be aware of, so I can get an idea of where the error lies?",

Also, the delete tag should be the only thing in that cell. Even a preceding blank space will prevent it from working.

Alternatively, you can hide the Moodle text field, add your own html filed for which you already know how to limit the number of characters and add to its event a bit of code that sends the input text to the hidden Moodle text field. You also need a bit of code that loads your html field with the text from the Moodle field when the edit entry page opens but that shouldn't be difficult. You can access the Moodle text field either directly by getElementById('||yourfield#id||') or indirectly by DOM navigation.

If you can get an Excel or CSV file from your provider/website, any Administrator on your Moodle site can upload your students into the new Moodle. You may have to fill in information that is not there in your initial list but it is easier than entering individually.  There are Docs on how to do this http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upload_users which will give you the info on what columns you will need.

Then you add the fields of the second self-assessment and modify the entry form to display it but not the first one. In the single view you can display both. Then you add the third and modify the entry form to display it, and the single view to display all three. And so on. With a bit of css and simple javascript you can make the self-assessments in the single view collapsible and so easier to browse. Since all the assessments will be displayed in the single view, that view could be printed out into a single booklet of self-assessments.

Now, I'm a bit puzzled by how students can view separate self-assessments. Are you saying I should build section #1, have all students complete it, then build section #2, and so on? The problem is that this is a self-paced program, where students can enroll at any time. Someone might be working on section #10, while someone else is on section #1. Is there any other way to view sections separately as students move through the course? For instance, is it possible to build a template with separate pages, and direct the student to each appropriate page as they move through the course? I'm just guessing here. Meanwhile, are there are any other tutorials on Database Activities, like the document by Elana Ivanova? That was a great start, but I'd really like to learn more. Thank you-- Andra",

Then you add at the top a dropdown box with the names of the self-assessments such that when the user selects one the corresponding section will appear on the page. This will require some simple javascript and I can help you with that if you want. This way every assessment can be added as a separate entry (rather than all assessments in one entry) and all assessments may be printed out into one booklet from the list view. This method cannot prevent students from adding more than one entry for the same self-assessment. Also, javascript must be enabled in the student's browser. This whole thing is non-standard and quite complex. Just consider the number of fields you have to add for 20 self-assessments (there are shortcuts if you are willing to manipulate preset XML directly). Then you have to work out the templates and you can't rely on the default templates. For that you need to do some HTML, CSS and javascript. I don't think you will find relevant tutorials for something like that. But, that's exactly what we are here for. So if you want to give it a try we can address any issue as it arises.",

Then enclose the whole thing with <tr><td> </td></tr> In the header section of the template you should enter <table cellpadding=5\"><tbody> and in the footer section </tbody></table> Since the assessments sections are hidden by default, the list view would show nothing.

In order to display this id on the screen I made a very simple hack that adds a tag to the template editor. Basically the hack makes ##mdlid## be replaced by the record id as stored in the moodle database (much like ##timemodified## works). This is a quick and dirty hack, I know, but it might prove useful to some of you. Here she goes: In mod/data/templates.php around line 236 add: echo '<optgroup label=\"'.get_string('other', 'data').'\">'; echo '<option value=\"##mdlid##\">'.'record id'. ' - ##mdlid##</option>'; echo '<option value=\"##timeadded##\">'.get_string('timeadded', 'data'). ' - ##timeadded##</option>'; In mod/data/lib.php around line 953 add: $patterns[] = '##timemodified##'; $replacement [] = userdate($record->timemodified); $patterns[] = '##mdlid##';",

The database I have built is designed to hold employee training records. There are categories which indicate the training they are supposed to take part in, and their scores on any tests. I need to be able to restrict access to the database such that: Individual employees can view their own record, but not that of other employees. First-level managers, on the other hand, need to be able to view records of all employees under their responsibility. Senior managers need to be able to view all records. Both I and my instructors need to be able to view and edit all records. I have done a test run with a test student account and a test guest account, and both are able to see all records - I can't have that. If I \"hide\" the database, then only I as an admin have access. It's like it's one extreme or the other. Would appreciate any insight on how to do what I am trying to do. If I can't do this, then I have to restrict viewing to only managers and make them admins (which I REALLY don't want to do). Thanks.",

Have you considered/tried using a combination of groups (maybe separate groups - one for each person) and role overrides to accomplish what you want to do? I think \"separate groups\" will allow you to do what you want to for \"individual employees\" and you can probably set up an override for \"senior managers\" so they can see all records but can't edit them. I think the best thing to do would be to create a new role...you could call it senior managers and then tweak the permissions so those assigned to that role are allowed what you want them to be able to do but no more. I'm not sure how to make the \"first-level managers\" work though..... If you create groups of employees that they (the first-level managers) are in charge of then all of those employees will be able to see each other's records... Anybody have any creative ideas for the \"first-level managers\"?? Jason",

          "Text": "Hi Stewart, the solution provided by Jason seems already to be the key for the problem. If you combine the group technique and use two different databases, link the databases and entries with an appropriate link field. Create for each field of responsibility (department) a database, then assign the roles \"individual\", that the person can only view his record in the database of his department. Create (overwrite) a role for the department responsible and the respective database, so he has the right to see the database and edit it. Create a role for the senior who can edit and see all databases. Perhaps this is complicated, but perhaps it could work. I don't know if this response could be understood, but perhaps it could lead to some mor reflections.... Perhaps combining groups and roles could lead to the same result? Good luck, David",

The first focus group are the engineers, of which there are about 100. I'm musing over breaking it down by department. That may be a good approach.

In my view it would be far more straightforward to have a capability defined at individual level for activities which can currently be set by group - any activity could then be private to teachers and individual students. There are two issues in trying to use the **approve** function. **approve** does not appear in all of the templates (eg 'add' template) and I found putting it into templates idiosynchratic - perhaps I needed to reload pages to get the code to function, or maybe a tecchie could identify if it is to do with another setting. It actually doesn't matter because the **approve** requirement, if selected, appears to operate even without being visible on a template and (as noted on a thread) its safer to leave it off. The approve function does not seem to apply to admin and teacher roles (this was quietly noted earlier in this thread?). If you are testing using teacher logons, the contributions will immediately be public, and you won't see the approve function taking effect. You need student test accounts to see it work. I have a preset which I am happy to load up which is set up for student research logs/diaries - can anyone advise how I get a .zip file into this area of moodle discussion?? Thanks, Paul",

As a side point, it would be useful to have a link into the database presets function which did not involve going through a course? Paul",

The list view allows you to modify the sort settings and these settings override the default you set in the fields tab but only for that session. If you log out and in the default sort settings should be restored. Note that during the same session changing the default sorting (in the fields tab) won't have any effect on the list view. You have to log out and log in or simply change the sorting in the list view accordingly (once for that session). This is how it works in my environments. If it works differently for you then there may be some related site settings with which I'm not familiar yet.",

If you are using the Afterburner theme and have the Database Activity working incorrectly it's an issue with a conflicting .php file. If you locate your Afterburner folder under wwwroot /moodle/themes/afterburner there should be a js.php file. Rename this menujs.php and edit the line of code in your header.html to reflect the name change. This will fix the problem Just the issue with uploading files privately to go!",

The school tech guys haven't finished building the moodle server yet, and so I've set one up on my own private commercial account at home. I am building a really neat moodle but am getting scared that all the links won't work when it is sitting in its new home on the school server. This is particularly troublesome as I'm setting up a repository of resources using a database activity. Does anyone know whether moving a moodle to a new server kills all the internal links? When I view in HTML mode all the files and graphics are referencing my home server in the URL . What is the process for transferring a moodle from one location to another? Does it automatically reformat and reference the new server? Does the database activity come along too? Thanks!",

The second suggestion worked beautifully also. Now the only thing is if it can somehow be done in multiselect that would make it a perfect world. I will look into it but I think it is above my scope. Any suggestions appreciated. Thank you very much for your help in this. I hope this will help others too. Deon",

The beauty of the \"normal\" forum is that the message displays immediately, whereas a combo RSS block, with all forum RSS feeds, is reliant upon Cron happening. A message added at 0800 may not display in the summary until 0830 or whatever...So unless Cron updates all the time, or is manually triggered all the time... 2. I need to also figure out the formatting of the RSS and have posted to that forum. Is it dependant on the theme? Using Flexpage I was able to get the RSS block into the centre.

I don’t have any way to have the older notices “drop-off” – but by using the date field and having users fill it in according to the “day it applies to”, the most recent announcements will stay on top. The year level is filters by a basic checkbox field. The good: -No need to repost reminders about an announcement – it will stay near the top until more recent news overtake it The bad: -Need to set some limit to how “in advance” an announcement can be posted – if people post a bunch of news for the next month, it will obviously overcrowd the top of the newsfeed. For the sorting -The user just has to open up the database and under advanced search you can order the entries by date – and just check the box next to the grade level you want to see. I included fields for a small picture and two file attachments – which will be perfect for when we have permission slips or whatever else that needs to be easily distributed. The picture will go a long way for imaging/logos – hopefully each club/team can grab a simple image to post with every update – so users can easily find what their looking for in the list. I attached a copy of the present to this post – let me know what you think. I’ll try to get some of my summer school teachers to use it for few weeks to tweak a bit more. Thanks! Chris (oh - I only formatted the list, single, and add templates - need to tweak the rss)",

Of course, you can select another name and put the end date in another cell, in which case simply change the corresponding parts of the code. The table should also be set to display:none so that it will be displayed only after the filtering. The code does traverses the rows in the display and checks whether endDate of a record is bigger than today, and if so it assigns the css class 'iamexpired' to that row. Now add to the css template the following class definition: .iamexpired{display:none;} Clear cache and try. With a bit of luck it will work.

Given the table, cell 8 is the ninth td tag in the repeated entry section which is also the ninth column (the first td tag is cell 0). Of course it can be any column you want. Also you don't have to display it, in which case the td tag may look like: <td style=\"display:none;\">||EndDate||</td> Yes.

I only found it because a new theme we're running (Aardvark) included it in header.html, resulting in all the database pages being rendered as plain CSS script instead of HTML. Removing the js.php script from the database module seems to have solved the problem without any ill-effects. -Peter",

In single-view should be a image-width of at least 300px (better 450), therefor we don't limited the with in the image-field. But (as often as possible) the solution was easier, than to think so: The field-limitation (width for single-view) does not influence the real image-size. So we limited it for 200px (get a fine rss-view) and delimited the width in single-view with the help of css (see image below). 2) To get a list of \"best graded images\" we a) override the local permissions for students (update database -> override permissions -> students -> rate entries \"allow\") and b) implemented the database-patch ( http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-15569 ) Unfortunately the patch don't allow to sort the list directly for grades. As a \"quick and dirthy workaround\" we once a week change the list-view-template to a list of names, image-url and grades, export it and after that go back to original state. It's not fine, but works. Maybe Anthony will give us a better patch to sort single-grades...? 3) We published the whole database in the database for database ( http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=57&rid=3759 )",

I have several questions that I have not been able to find answers to. 1. Is there a way when creating a picture field to have the picture shown with its original dimensions? It appears you have to set your own dimensions but with some pictures being \"landscape\" and others being \"profile\" it makes it tough for them all to look nice. 2. How do I add HTML formating to the \"view\" pages? 3. Has anyone already created one that is used in this manner? And if so, would you be willing to share it? Thanks Profe",

I simple exported the table from the old installation and imported them to the new installation. My problem is that none of my course catalogs actually populate through the Moodle GUI. I checked to make sure the table formatting was fine as compared to the default category setting. The GUI sees the default \"Miscellaneous\" table and even sees tables/categories I create through the GUI... but it does NOT populate any of the 40 categories I imported.

And then the other point you bring up - course not being accessible to student means they can't access the videos. Grrrr. Wish there was a way to make a course invisible (except to teachers) but still have it accessible. Is it possible to do that? I might just have to forget the whole idea and install 4Imges or some other image repository and then just have the teachers upload to that and link to it from Moodle. That creates an extra couple of steps for the teachers, but I guess it can't be avoided. 4Images is ok, but seems kinda clunky to me. Does anyone have a better recommendation for organizing, viewing, sorting, rating, and linking of videos? I'm also open to other ideas... Rob",

If i click any course I'm 100% positive it has had database activity entries I get none listed. The database activity overview shows a correct number of entries in a course but when I want to view them I get an empty list. I am not sure how long it has been like this, I got notice from one of our teachers just today. If I try to add any entry, nothing happens (no entry is stored). If I try to create a brand new database activity in a course and add a new entry, nothing happens. I've read some tips on how to get rid of this (including saving search settings or restoring database activity template), none of them helped. I even thought there might be an issue with physical Moodle database so I did a dump and ran a search on it and I've found that all the entries are stored in. Thus I think the problem lies within the Moodle guts. Tried to look at user permissions, database activity module settings but have found nothing that would be of help.

In my naivety I assumed that 1 'row' meant 1 line of text input inside the box. Apparently not. Take a look at this account for what happens in most common browsers when you use 2 or 4 rows for the Teaxtarea field definition. By trial and error I found that 7 rows are the minimum needed for the textarea field definition for 2 rows of text to be input before scrolling. Caveat !

You will always find that innovative teachers find novel applications for Moodle activities - the glossary activity is a point in case. However, the 'standard' application - if I may dare say that for a database activity would be where you want your learners to collect information collectively (as a team). Everyone contributes and they can all look at their combined effort. It could be something as simple as a reading report. The type of information that you want to collect should have distinct fields that you can give a name and allocate a data type. Be ready for a small learning curve to create the table with fields and also to set up the various templates that you need for accessing/displaying the data.",

I already checked the 'trusted content' item and also made sure the administrator role has the ability to add trusted html content. Why does it still get stripped, and is their another way to get a table-like list-template for the database?",

          "Text": "Hello Mark What a good idea to have a homework database! I like it. You can try the following work around. Create a dummy user for each of your groups. This could be the name of your group, but you could give it any name really. Set your database groups property to 'separate groups'. Enter the homework activities being logged in as this 'user'. Now if anyone from that group accesses the database they will see those activies/records whereas they will be hidden from any other group. If you are logged in as yourself and enter an activity that will be seen by all the groups - use that method for activities assigned to all the groups. When you, as the teacher, look at the list of activities you can 'filter' it to show only the activities of one of the groups - or all the activities. You can use the Url field to have links to your Hot Potatoes. When you go to the list of Hot Potato quizzes and right click on the link of the Hot Potato you want to be linked, you can copy the link. Copy that into the Url field. Now you can access the Activity from the database record. Regards Marius",

When using Firefox , the \"View list\" page displays the thumbnails in a series of rows, depending on how many entries there are in the database. However, IE displays the thumbnails in one big, ugly column. Also, the \"View single\" page looks fine when using Firefox , but when you view it using IE the image is no longer centred relative to the viewport. These errors make the preset unusable in my opinion, as most people use IE , not Firefox . I know this is a CSS issue and have tried to fix it by altering the CSS template, but have had no luck in doing so. I'm not sure whether this is due to an error in the CSS code or IE miss-interpreting CSS rules. Has anyone else noticed this? Can anyone out there help me with this issue? Thanks, Marty",

          "Text": "Hello! I am a relative newbie to Moodle, but I have always been impressed by the collegial community and willingness to help. I'm seeking wisdom from those more experienced. I'm trying to decide if the DATABASE or QUESTIONNAIRE module is more appropriate for my needs. So far, I've used neither, and as a disclaimer, I actually haven't downloaded the questionnaire module yet, since I only recently learned of its existence while trolling for information through these forums. I need to collect data on an ongoing basis from a group of graduate students. Here are the particulars: I need the students to record simple data each time they visit a K-12 classroom (e.g. number of pupils, grade level, time spent, activities offered, etc.). Over the semester they may visit several classes a week, so they need to be able to access the module multiple times. It may be helpful for them to be able to search the module, if only to check back for their previous entries (to be sure they have logged in the information, tho that may not be necessary) - which I believe would suggest the DATABASE module. However, the big issue for me is ease of exporting data to EXCEL so that I can produce monthly tallies and summaries for reporting. Thus, what module is recommended? Does one or the other have a \"better\" selection of question options? Greater ease of exporting? FYI - I am using Moodle 1.9.5 Any insight would be gratefully appreciated. Thank you so much.

Ideally, on a site the size of ours (250ish users) first name and last initial would work but I don't see that in the reference. We are in a pretty conservative area and it freaks people out to have student names out there on the web, even if they are hidden by password protection. The reason it really becomes and issue in the case of this database is that we are using it to make their work public and accessible to parents, patrons, ....

To get it to be the last initial, would require a little modification to the patch where we could set forcelastname to true and then do an if statement telling it to then use the first initial of the user's lastname. I attached one quick fix and one proposed fix. The proposed fix is more in depth and I would like to have it reviewed by another developer because it modifies a commonly used function and I want to make sure it will not mess things up elsewhere. Simply download the patch and then follow the instructions at How to apply a patch . Let me know if you have a specific question in applying the patch or run into troubles. If you are going to try one on a test server, then I would just go with the proposed fix, otherwise, I would go with the quickfix which would be a bit safer for a production server but both should be tested before being used on a production server.

I am wondering if this may be a carry over from pre-Moodle 1.7. I think it was around that time that we did away with separate tables for students and teachers. It would actually help if you could test the behavior, just temporarily and report back on how the $CFG->forcefirstname and forcelastname options actually function. I suspect we will need to change the wording in the config file so that it is more accurate. Peace - Anthony",

As Stuart notes, it is not clear whether you are talking about a table in your database (which is an actual table) or database activity module (which makes use of data_records). One comment I had was that the name of the person creating the entry is automatically stored with each record added so you do not necessarily have to ask their name unless you want them to put in a nickname or you were just using that by way of example. All that data_records stores is that someone added an entry. It does not actually store the data in that table. You may want to take a look at the data_content which is related by a join between the recordid field and the data_records' id field. I think if you use something like phpmyadmin to poke around with a sample database that you create you will be able to figure things out pretty quickly. Let me know if this helps or if you have additional questions. Peace - Anthony",

I will simplify the notations here to give you an idea data.id->>data_fields.dataid (an instance of a database activity module can have one or more fields joined by the respective id and dataid fields), data.id->>data_records.dataid (an instance of a database activity module can have one or more records added to it), data_fields.id,data_records.id->data_content.fieldid,data_content.recordid (the content is stored combining the record and field ids - in other words the content for a particular entry's particular field. So, I would start by creating something like: $data = get_record('data','id',$dataid); // where $dataid is the id of database activity module you are working on $datarecord = get_record('data_records','dataid',$data->id,'userid',$USER->id); //get this user's entry $fieldidname = get_record('data_fields','dataid',$data->id,'name','Name'); //get the field record for the Name field in this database $fieldidage = get_record('data_fields','dataid',$data->id,'name','Age'); //get the field record for the Age field in this database $datamyname = get_record('data_content','fieldid',$fieldidname->id,'recordid',$datarecord->id); // get the content record for the Name field by the current user $datamyage = get_record('data_content','fieldid',$fieldidage->id,'recordid',$datarecord->id); // get the content record for the Name field by the current user $myname = $datamyname->content; //get the actual data from the content record $myage = $datamyage->content; //get the actual data from the content record This is obviously not the prettiest way of getting at the data but I hope that it helps to illustrate how the data is stored. Please note that I have not tested this code as it was written solely for illustrative purposes so there may be mistakes in it. In summary, you need to have the recordid and the fieldid in order to get to the content. Let me know if this is helpful to you. Peace - Anthony",

We also have a field that appears on the template editor and on the student's sort list drop-down. This is described in MDL-5613 \"I can hide these numbers from the view of the students by deleting this field from the template for the database. However, this field still appears as one that students can sort by. The fact that a teacher can hide a field simply by removing it from the template but it still shows up on the dropdown list is a potential problem.\" .",

I am a very 'green' Moodle user and have been fighting my whole way through.  Having to pretty much teach myself everything because nobody else on our staff is using it they way I would like to.  Needless to say, I've been doing a LOT of trial and error.  More of tha latter!

If so, provide a screen shot of where you would like those fields to be and then I can give you a better idea of how to customize your site for those fields. That said, what I would really recommend is creating custom user profile fields which Moodle already provides. This may meet your needs better without having to customize anything.

It has never worked, and I have usually asked a few questions and then ended up giving up on it. I have tried every conveivable combination of CSV including enclosed, unenclosed, simple comma separation, and even copied the example in the help file but nothing has worked. I therefore have the following questions. 1) Has anybody on here ever successfully imported a text file into a database using moodle? 2) If so, what was the file encoding (Unicode?, UTF-8, . . . ) and exact format of the file (comma separation? enclosed?). 3) Did the successfully imported file simply contain English? If so, has anybody imported a file other than English (my files contain Japanese and English). 4) Have most people, as I suspect, ended up bypassing this function and ended up inserting the entries directly into the database via php admin or some similar approach?

The following code is based on Moodle 1.9.3+ (Build: 20081119) —I know we should upgrade, but it has been low priority because it is an internal server . \n```text\n function generate_sql($tablealias, $value) {\n\n\n /*\n\n\n * Original code\n\n\n */\n\n\n // return \" ({$tablealias}.fieldid = {$this->field->id} AND {$tablealias}.content LIKE '%{$value}%') \"; \n\n\n /*\n\n\n * Modified code\n\n\n */\n\n\n $sql = \" ({$tablealias}.fieldid = {$this->field->id}\"; \n\n\n foreach (explode(\" \", $value) as $val) {\n\n\n $sql .= \" AND {$tablealias}.content LIKE '%{$val}%'\";\n\n\n }\n\n\n $sql .= \") \";\n```\n Glancing at the latest code from CVS , it appears that those methods have been modified since our server was installed, so my modifications will need changing.

When they import (moodle states the file's been successfully imported) I see the text all the way to the character right before the first spanish character (all of the other ones are cut off). Does anyone have any idea how I can correct this? Perhaps opening the file first in another program and saving (this worked for me when I was importing glossary entries and had the same issue) FYI I'm using windows vista ultimate and saving to a csv file through excel 2007. I'm using the pipe character as the csv separator. Thanks!",

The check-boxes and radio buttons work fine for 'Add Entry', but when you come to the advanced search in search mode the multi-select check-boxes and radio buttons are not displayed - just a pull-down menu dialog box with 'choose ...', but on clicking the pull-down menu arrow no multi-select items are provided to choose from!! I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Moodle data-base module or just a particular version - build! I gave up on check-boxes and radio-buttons in frustration and just used the multi-select menu field type. NOT my preferred option, but it works - just a matter of your data-base users knowing how to do multiple items in the field select. <Shift> click for a whole group between items clicked on or <Ctrl> click for choosing different items within the field list.

However, I didn't have any problems once I changed over to the multi-select menu field. Of course, you need to have your Database populated with entries that use the different choices you have entered in the multi-select menu field. Also when you enter the different choices, each choice needs to be on a new line. I am not Moodle developer, but I haven't noted any solution or fix to the radio button and checkbox field type problem. I've put the problem up to our Moodle host to see if one of their analysts or engineers can sort the problem. All the best! Tony",

It is working fine. Just wondering if you need to change the name of the field slightly - use capitals instead of lowercase, change word order, slightly change the name. Not sure why but Moodle often seems to have this issue of reverting to old code even on reediting. Just checking, you do have several different items or records in your database using different choices in the multi-select fields? If the Database is empty then nothing shows up when you a search.

          "Text": "Hi Daniel, I'm quite interested in the scenario on your screencast, but I'm not sure if I got the whole picture. Am I right in saying that you have a database entry in four parts? A text entry (in your case a question constructed/selected by the student) A set of tick box fields (in your case a set of state standards), which means that the full list only appears in the add/update mode, and 'view entry' shows only those items which have been ticked. (I didn't know that - thanks) A set or radio buttons for the student to indicate difficulty A second text entry - in this case the answer So you're viewing the student submission consisting of their question, their identification of the relevant standard, degree of difficulty, and their answer in order to judge their understanding? Sounds very reasonable. This would seem to link well with a forum contribution elsewhere, which suggested that students create questions which are added to the question bank for online quizzes for later cohorts. So the output from these students could become the input for the next students. (I guess 'export database' and a quick bit of manipulation before importing questions to the question bank). The other development would be to enter a bank of questions as 'teacher' or 'admin' which would then be visible to all database users (equally this would work in header), and require the students to select a question by copy/paste. I think that there are some good opportunities for lateral thinking to apply your database in other ways. I'm thinking, for example, of grading moderation, where teachers need to compare grading practices, or where a course design team needs to figure out the alignment of curriculum with the relevant standards. In both cases the database could be a good platform for collaboration. Though provoking - thanks Paul",

However, seeing the table you're requesting more information about and the fields you mentioned, I'm guessing you might try to get the grades of all courses in which a user has enrolled. To do this, here's the SQL statement I used earlier to get this data. (It took me a while to figure out!)

You can also select course grades for multiple users.

It's used to remember the display state for the course, for example user 123 on course 2345 may have topic 2 visible and all the rest collapsed. An entry is only written to this table when a user visits a course on which they are enrolled. When they are unenroled the record still remains as it's nothing to do with enrolments and used purely for the display. I think what you are trying to do is determine course enrolments. The table you need to be looking at (I think) is mdl_role_assignments. Regards, Lewis",

Basically it is a database of questions that are grouped in several different ways, and if I were doing it outside moodle I would simply present the records in groups a few at a time for input. i.e. question group one brings up q's 1-5, group 2 brings up q's 6 - 12 etc. For reporting I will be wanting to look at the answers in a different order than the way they were collected. Eg. report one is answers 2,4,7,9-12 and so on. This is simple with a database with fields: question, answer, input group, report group and so on. From looking, neither questionnaire nor quiz have this flexibility. Thanks for your thoughts. Ed",

I've added a database activity and when trying to import entries from a csv file, depending on which of the numerous formats and settings I've tried, I get one of two error messages: either get_records_csv failed to read data from the uploaded file. Please check file for field name typos and formatting errors' or could not update record ID xx . When I get the could not update record ID xx message, according to the number of records the database contains, it appears it added one new entry (regardless of how many I tried to import). All that appears, however, are the text fields; the actual record is blank. I've used excel and notepad to create the csv file. I've exported the table as csv from the server where it resides to my local computer, then directly imported into Moodle. I've used every combination of delimiter, etc. I can think of and entered (and not entered) those in the Moodle import dialog window. I've imported through IE and Mozilla (Windows XP), and I've tried to import lots of records and just two records. I've included the field names on the top line and I've excluded them (not that I expected that to work, but you never know). I have held my breath and held my tongue that certain way that sometimes works, to no avail. I've looked at various patches related to database import/export, but it seems I'm current on those (though they would be easy to miss, as I'm cross-eyed now). I can manually make entries with no problem. Any help would be most appreciated. I need this database, but if have have to manually enter the 600-800 records one by one, I may just change careers. We're using Moodle 1.9.2+ (Build: 20081001) We are on a hosted server running: Debian, My SQL 5.0.45, PHP 5.2.2. Thanks so much!",

I seem to have messed up the front page summary, where I had put in some html code (using the html editor) to give my front page a nice look. This seems to have had a knock on effect, where the 'edit' icon and the 'Turn editing on' button has disappeared, when I logon as an administrator. I think the fix would be to go into the moodle mysql database, find where the content of the Front Page summary is stored and fix or remove the html code there. I couldn't work out any other way of doing this. Thanks in advance.",

Now you prepare a csv file with the list of the file names of the files you uploaded. For example: fileName file1.doc file2.doc file3.xls You import the csv file into the database. Then you add to the single or list view template or both, an a tag with the file path and the file name. For example, suppose your files location in your Moodle files is: http://your.moodle.org/moodle/file.php/3/docs/ You can add to the template the following html: <a href=\"http://your.moodle.org/moodle/file.php/3/docs/||fileName||\">||fileName||</a> (|| stands for square brackets) and the link to the file should be displayed. You can also associate the link with a doc type image. So you add to the database another field (text or menu) for the file type. You add the relevant info to the csv: fileName,fileType file1.doc,doc file2.doc,doc file3.xls,xls Then you lookup the url of your moodle doctype pix and add to the html an img tag such as <img href=\"http://your.moodle.org/moodle/pix/f/||fileType||.gif\" /> and if you used the same names for the file types as used by moodle it should show the proper file type image (e.g. for pdf) Hope this helps",

Even if you do end up writing your own custom PHP code. I would still recommend that you organise your PHP code as a gradebook plugin.

In the database you can have a text field for the image file name, say, imageName. Then you import (csv) the image file names (e.g. image001.jpg) into the imageName field. Then you add to the single or list view template or both, an img tag with the image file path and the image name. For example, suppose your images location in your Moodle files is: http://your.moodle.org/moodle/file.php/3/images/ You can add to the template the following html: <img src=\"http://your.moodle.org/moodle/file.php/3/images/||imageName||\" /> (|| stands for square brackets) and the image should be displayed.

But if what you need is that the field will be assigned the default value only by the form and not by the user then that onclick in the td element should be omitted. Also, the javascript as implemented will assign the default value to the field every time the form is opened, even if it is opened for editing in which case if the user updated the information in that field the user information will be overridden. To prevent that you need to first check in the function that the field is empty: \n```text\nfunction setDefault(fieldID,val){\n```\n \n```text\nif (document.getElementById(fieldID).value==\"\") {\ndocument.getElementById(fieldID).value=val;\n}\n```\n \n```text\n}\n\nGive it a try and let me know if it works.\n\n:-)\n```",

Funnily in the case of both tools all table names were in capitals (is it just the tools?) and not prefixed by anything like mdl_ or the like... The only piece of info I gave myself during the ODBC connection setup process was 'localhost', for all the rest I used defaults/blanks -- is there perhaps a specific Moodle or MySQL admin username and password to use in this context ?? Anyone who could quickly point me in the right direction? I'd appreciate. cheers, m ps. I'm running XAMP on Windows XP, have the latest Moodle as of couple of weeks back. I have by now inserted quite a few Qs and Quizzes and would like to copy paste some of the redundant bits there using a database tool, as I am not completely unfamiliar with RDBMSs... (I've seen some of the ER diagrams and it looks feasbile to edit the related tables.)",

          "Text": "Yes it is RSS so the database's RSS should be enabled and you can copy the single view template to the RSS template so that your desired format will already be stored in the RSS and all that will remain is to display it. And then ... you open for editing a label resource, html block, section description or any other editable html section and in text mode add an identified div element and two script elements. This solution assumes that the load and display functions reside in a js file and referred to from the main page--that's the first script element. The second script element is for calling these functions and writing the content into the div element. Here is how it may look: <div id=\"DataWarmUp\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://--------------/moodle/file.php/---/scripts/xmlutils.js\"></script> In this example the xmlutils.js is stored in the course files in a folder called 'scripts' but you can store it anywhere you want as long as you get the right url and enter it to the code. Here are the javascript functions: function loadXML(file) { if (document.implementation && document.implementation.createDocument) { xmlDoc = document.implementation.createDocument(\"\", \"\", null); } else { if (window.ActiveXObject) { xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLDOM\"); } else { alert('Your browser can\\'t handle this script'); return; } } xmlDoc.async=false; xmlDoc.load(file); return xmlDoc; } function displayDesc (xmlDoc) { var items = xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName('item'); if (items.length>0) { var itemContent=\"\"; for (j=0;j<items[0].childNodes.length;j++) { if (items[0].childNodes[j].nodeType!=1) continue; var itemName=items[0].childNodes[j].nodeName; if (itemName=='description') { itemContent=items[0].childNodes[j].firstChild.nodeValue; } } } return itemContent; } The display function here is simplified so as to be clearer. Thus it will always take the first item in the RSS file which is supposed to be the last added entry. But that also means that you can't add the next warm-up too early because it will immediately show up on the main page. Of course the code may be more flexible and select the item for display according to week or some other method. This can be added later on if you decide to use this approach and you find you need a different display method. So, this is it. If you need more details just let me know.",

          "Text": "I am a relatively new Moodle user who teaches about 200 students in a public school. It turns out that I need to delete many students who have dropped the course. Unfortunately, there is a bug in Moodle that won't allow me to delete users who were automatically added to the database who have duplicate email addresses. According to docs elsewhere on Moodle.org, I was told to import student in bulk by creating fields in a CSV format, one of which is the email field. None of my students had a unique email address because I used (as advised) fake@fakemail.com in the CSV file for email addresses that don't exist. The records imported just fine. But now, when I try to delete users, if they have duplicate email addresses Moodle will not allow deletion. Only if I manually change all the email addresses I want to delete will Moodle allow a deletion. The odd thing is that if I want to add a user manually, Moodle will not allow duplicate email addresses - only if imported in bulk! So, is there a workaround to deleting these users without having to manually change the fake email address in every user I want to delete? This is really killing me...

They want to install Moodle and \"forget\". I argue it: This university have a database with courses, teachers, etc. and the university administration maintain it. I want Moodle use teachers, students, etc. from university DB. For example, university create a new student on university DB (this student can use Moodle without create an account), university drop a student on university DB (this student can't login on Moodle). Same with courses, exam timings, teachers, etc. University DB is admin with software developed by university (I can modify it). I think we can modify university software for accés to Moodle DB and create&drop accounts, courses, etc. but I don't know if it can do data inconsistency (probably, isn't it?). Do Moodle have any API to do this? Thanks to read me (I talk a lot, I don't?) if you could.",

You can try hiding the delete button and displaying it only to the teacher. One way to do that is by displaying the delete buttions only when the page is in edit mode (which only teachers and admins can bring about). This can be done with javascript . And so in this approach the teacher changes to edit mode by clicking the 'Blocks editing on' button which makes the delete buttons appear and then the teacher can delete an entry.",

The database forum post is here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=108495 I also submitted tracker #MDL-16931 The first response to the tracker was that I probably had a messed up installation and I may have complicated things by overwriting the mod/data/import.php file with a newer one (which included fixes for csv import issues). The problem is unrelated to attempting to update import.php, however, as I did not do that until after the problem was discovered. The newer file gave me a different error, but I'm now back to square one. Haven't received any additional info via the tracker. You may want to view to to watch and vote for it to be resolved.",

I actually eliminated all punctuation of any kind from anything having to do with the database (except the delimiter) and it had no effect. I guess you were able to use the pipe as your delimiter successfully after you removed the parenthesis? Two other odd things about my issue: No matter how many records are in my csv file -  2, 10 or 100 - it always gives me the error, but adds one more blank record. The error is the same each time except for the record number, which continues to increase with each attempt. I can delete the old database (tried from Moodle and directly from the server ) and create an entirely new database, and when I try to import I still get the error with the increased record number. In other words, the last attempt on the deleted database reported \"can not update record 37,\" and the first attempt on a new database reports \"can not update record 38.\" Shouldn't the blank records from the deleted database be deleted also, or does Moodle never used a record number? Thanks!!",

I checked everything and the problem was with the non english characters, such as the cé cédille... it was strange because my database is suposed to be utf-8 (although I have always seen a red line across utf-8 in the server info, even when I ran my own server). So I would check for non english craracters and test it with a very small cvs file, like just writing test in every field. Also, to make sure that the header is right, you could do an export database as a csv first, and use that as a template for the upload , and use one line of test / test / test /test as the data Jack",

It was my understanding I needed to use UTF-8 encoding, which seems logical since my Moodle database is UTF-8.

You mentioned that overwriting  was not the way to update a file - since the mod/data/import.php has had several revisions since what was included in my recent stable Moodle version, how would i incorporate that without reinstalling Moodle? Or are they not part of the latest stable version because they're not ready to be included yet? I don't know this would solve my problem, but I need to try and move forward with it.

Thus, before experimenting with a CSV import, you should always create a short test database (with just one or two entry/ies) first and export it as a CSV file. Then you can delete the entire database activity, create a new one and import the data from the exported CSV file. Finally, import your preset.zip and you are done.",

I am very impressed with the database module - I have constructed a working prototype very quickly, in just a few hours. But I would like to put a time limit on the editing of a record after it has been entered. I would to stop post hoc changes to the records. Forums have a time limit on posts so that you cannot edit them after about 30 minutes. I'd like to do the same with database records. I assume that there is no easy way to do this. My hunch is that one could write a JS script that hides the ##edit## field after a specified time delay (perhaps a day or so).",

          "Text": "Should be possible with javascript and should be fairly easy to hide the ##edit## icon in the view templates by checking the ##timeadded## against the current time. However, users will still be able to go to the add/edit page directly with the url. To block such attempts you can add to the Add template javascript that checks the time limit and if it has passed displays a warning message and redirects the page to the previous one. Now, for calculating the time limit you will need the ##timeadded## value which you don't have in the Add template. So you can add to the Add Entry form a hidden field (text field placed in a div with style=display:hidden). When the Add form is opened the javascript checks this field's value. If it is empty this is a new entry and so the javascript just assigns the current time (first open time) to the field and let the add attempt continue. If the value is not empty this is an edit attempt in which case the javascript calculates the time elapsed by comparing the time value in the field with the current time. If the time limit has passed the javascript sends the user back to the previous page (history -1). If not it lets the edit attempt continue. Now, you can either run the javascript after the form is opened in which case you'll have open time which may differ significantly from the timeadded value if the user takes the time to add the entry. This should not be an issue if the time limit is crude enough (e.g. a day or two). A more elegant way to apply the javascript but somewhat more complex is to add a listener to capture the submit event and do the form validation then. In this case the first open time will match the timeadded (or close enough). I hope that helps. Itamar",

          "Text": "Hello, We are two librarians who would like to use the database module as a repository for reviews of poems. The reviews are written by the students, they submit their entry to the teacher, which corrects it if necessary, and then sends it back to the student. If the entry has been approved, it is published and accessible by anyone. We set up a testsystem, to see if this module meets our requirements. Here are our problems: 1. The validation workflow should in fact be endless (correction of the correction etc.). 2. The teacher should be notified when a entry awaits approval (nice to have: message in the news section and/or email notification). We think the db-module is very powerful, and we would like to contribute to it. We both have a specialization in information systems, and are therefore capable of working with php, xml and css and we have help for the javascript . We wanted to ask you what you think of our project, any advice/suggestion is welcome. Thanks and Greetings from Switzerland!",

We have two problems; first the user names( students that need to be named for the acts), currently just names, no relation to the user names in the system and second problem is the ability to send emails to the parents when an entry is made. We are planning to do the email part through database using a trigger. Plan B is implementing a code into the template so a send email link could show up next to the entry. So the teacher who makes the entry could send the email to the parent or, ISS person could approve and send email. Still working on it.",

          "Text": "Here is how I do that. For the list view template I have three js functions (listHeaderTmpl, listBodyTmpl, listFooterTmpl) stored in a js file located in the Files section of the course site. In each function I create and return a string consisting of a part of an HTML code for displaying the list of items in a table. So the header function returns a string containing the open tag of a table and the header row; the body function returns a string containing an item's row; the footer function closes the table. These functions are called in the corresponding template sections and their returned values are collected in a string which is then dumped into the innerHTML of a div element. In the header section of the template: Create an identified (by id) div element. In a script tag include the js file containing the functions. In a script block define a literal and assign to it the string returned by the header function (e.g. var strHtml=listHeaderTmpl()). In the body section of the template: In a script block add to the same literal from above the string returned from the body function; pass the song value to the function (e.g. strHtml+=listBodyTmpl(' SONG '). you can check the value of song in the function and decide whether or not to add the item to the list. If you don't want to add the item you simply return an empty string; otherwise you return the html of a table row, e.g. function listBodyTmpl(song){ var str=\"\"; if (song!=\"\"){ str='<tr><td>'+song+'</td></tr>'; } return str; } How you pass the field's value to the function depends on the characteristics of the expected value. Simple string values shouldn't pose any problem. See my previous post. In the footer section of the template: In a script block add to the same literal from above the string returned from the footer function (e.g. strHtml+=listFooterTmpl()). Assign the literal to the innerHTML of the div element you created in the header section (e.g. document.getElementById('itemsList').innerHTML=strHtml;) I hope that helps more than confuses.",

I'm for any method you suggest that will allow one user's multiple entries to be sorted together while in the View list area of the database. When I check the entries now (ID # explanation coming up), all the students' work is on one page that I can scroll down and check (five weeks' work might have about 250-300 entries.) If I have to enter each student's name(s), it will take some time to enter the name and load the search results. As I mentioned before, I have a few students with the same first or last name, and the order will be a b c , often out of order for us working in countries not using roman alphabets. Tom Robb and I communicated several times during the spring break here in Japan. He suggested we add a Student ID number field and have the students enter that for each book. So, no, no patch was applied, but it would be great to snag that data (I have all my students enter their numbers in their profiles) out of the database. Using the Student ID field I created, I select it in the Sort by field and all the students' work is in the same order as our role sheets. Not very elegant, but so far it's doing the job.

I noticed the WYSIWYG editor likes to screw up the code once you save it, so I started copying my trial and error code into Microsoft Word until I figured it out. I'm sure there's an easier way, but here's what worked for me: **Make sure you edit all three sections using the HTML editor ** HEADER SECTION: <table class=\"modulesdata generaltable\" align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"80%\"> <tbody> <tr> <th class=\"header\" align=\"left\">Date </th> <th class=\"header\" align=\"left\">Write Stuff Here </th> <th class=\"header\" align=\"left\">Options </th> </tr> REPEATED ENTRY SECTION: <tr><td> Date </td> <td> Write_stuff_here </td> <td>##Edit## ##More## ##Delete## ##Approve##</td></tr> FOOTER: </tbody></table></div><hr /> **PLEASE NOTE** that if you go back and fix stuff - the editor will add code that you didn't put there orginally.

I have a db that list school projects. Teachers submit enties to this db through set fields. We would like to add a search facility for other teachers to tailor the project they want to run, based on maybe two fields, namely Year Level Group (Early Years, Primary School, Middle Years, Senior School) and by Learning Area (English, Maths, SOSDE, etc.). These projects were on an older searchable (non-moodle) site and we are transferring the db into Moddle 1.8. Nicholas Cutajar",

Some of the multi-select fields didn't have all of the choices any more and others didn't appear at all. Any ideas why this is happening? Also, when in list view or single view, the simple search tool within the records appears at the bottom of the page instead of at the top-right as it was before. Is this something that has to be changed in the underlying HTML code (not my forte)? - Stew",

There is currently no way to change the look of the advanced search page. And, it's not possible to export or import this template via the presets functionality, since there is no corresponding .html file for it, such as \"asearch.html\". And, if you are using multimenu type fields, the selection menu of the corresponding fields in the asearch page treats the *combination* of all options selected from the same multimenu of each record as one options. This results in a messed up search selection field for multimenus - see the attached screenshot to easily understand what I mean. I just found that this is related to bug report MDL-14018 .",

Students could select a \"group\" to view and see all of the art by one student. Also students could comment on each other's work. All was right with the world. Then the hosting computer crashed and I restored the site with course backups. The database entries restored and so did the groups with a student in each one, BUT the database entries only show up under \"all participants\". When you use the drop down menu to select a group, the database reports \"No entries\". Any help on how to fix and/or better ways to create art portfolios with comments.",

In the case , someone choice the multiple connection for his moodle connection, i would like to know where the php scripts are closed? Because i had some problem with my hosting and they say i should close the php scripts for my website. If we have this : $db->Connect($CFG->dbhost,$CFG->dbuser,$CFG->dbpass,$CFG->dbname); It must be closed somewhere. But where is it closed? Thanks for your help.",

Unfortunately I am quite sure that is not Moodle which is the problem, but it is the configuration of the server : there is too much load. Either you ask your host to change things, or you find a different (maybe a Moodle partner in your country). Good luck! Hans P.S. This forum is not for questions about the database that Moodle runs on, but it is forum about the database module. Next time you might want to ask a question like this here or here .",

I have done similar things before using PHP and mySQL but the database module seems to scrub all of the PHP out of any of the templates I create. I have tried Javascript , but that is client side rather than server side and is not giving me any joy (I'm a javascript noob, btw ). I am sure this can be done.

This will put database activities within reach of many more teachers, who otherwise would be scared off by the need to add fields and edit templates. If it works, that is... I have tried to create several times a preset of a very simple database (just a file field and and a text field). It saves OK and when it is chosen in another database, it looks dandy: It imports the fields and templates. But when any user adds an entry to this database made with the preset, the entry is shown directly after adding in the single view, but as soon as you move away from that view (for example if you go to list view), the database will tell you that there are no entries in the database (the number of entries show in the databases overview page and the files are in the course moddata/data folders and the record shows up in the Moodle database) and there is no way to get them to show either in single or in list view. I would very much appreciate anyone who could point me towards a solution to this problem. We are using 1.8.3+ (2007021532), the MDL-11547 bug repair did not resolve this issue. The Image gallery preset that comes with the Moodle install does work normally and the database from which the preset was saved also functions normally. Rgrds, Paul.",

          "Text": "Hi all, Question time for you all. I've recently been investigating a number of tools to try and replicate the processes used in a physical art gallery, i.e. replicating the following process: 1. a Curator creates a gallery (i.e. a teacher sets up an area for assignments), which would be a template of, for example, three pictures (or other file types) and some descriptive text. 2. the Curator allocates Exhibitors (students) to the gallery based on class lists, which also happen to be imported from Blackboard. 3. Exhibitors upload files into their 'blank exhibit' within the gallery and add some descriptive text. 4. the Curator, other Exhibitors and Visitors can view exhibits in the gallery (a critical aspect is that all images/text for an exhibit can be viewed in one browser window for an exhibit wherever possible). 5. Exhibitors can leave peer review comments at other exhibits (reviews can be seen by the submitting and receiving Exhibitors and the Curator but nobody else). 6. one of a number of Critics (assessors) can assess each exhibit and provide marks back to the Exhibitor (numeric and textual), and these marks form part of their assessment. In an ideal world the peer reviews submitted by students could be assessed along with their own gallery exhibitions. The critical parts of this request are not so much around how pretty it looks, but far more around being able to peer review and critique work in a way that restricts others from viewing these critiques, except of course for teachers... After much soul searching it looks like the database module in Moodle is the best fit for doing this, due to setting up templates for sumbission, providing peer reviews and linking back to a grade book. The question is whether this is the best way to do this task within Moodle? I thought about using the Gallery2 integration but this is more about peer reviewing (and is not necessarily restricted to image files either), and I just can't get my head around the Workshop module. Any feedback welcome!",

How an assessor can grade an exhibit, which equates to having ratings for a post get sent to gradebook, which is a known issue ( http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-9970 ). 2. How to restrict the viewing of peer reviews - at the moment it doesn't look like there is any way of restricting how comments show up, which is a shame as that is something that is important in this specific case. Unless of course anyone knows a way that I can restrict how comments are displayed in the database module... Anyone? Anyone at all? Beyond these two sticking points it can do the rest pretty well - the pre-built template is perfect for this sort of thing.",

I want to create a gallery so that middle school-age students from different parts of the United States can share their work and engage in dialog. And also, the teachers in those schools would be able to do some of their own administration (enrolling students, helping with posting images, etc.). For me, the grade book is less of an issue than giving students and teachers the ability to post images to a common location and then comment on them. If possible, I would love to see the gallery that you create when it's ready. Many thanks, Kim",

Although I haven't got a site I can share I can talk about how I had it set up. First - create a database activity. Second - create a template that has (for eample) a title (text field), two images (two blank image files) and a description (free text field). Third - (optional) modify the 'list view' to not show images - keep that as uncluttered as possible - maybe just exhibit name. Fourth - tinker with the 'single view' to show each individual exhibit however looks best in your situation. Fifth - enrol some students, give instructions and away you go! Students can not only post images/text but also leave review comments and if desired ratings for each exhibit. You can also limit the gallery to one exhibit per user if required. A very neat way around an otherwise tricky problem. Hope this helps! Mark.",

I liked your art gallery approach and am trying to duplicate it, but I guess I don't understand how images are handled well enough to get my head around a problem we're having. If students are uploading scanned images, pictures, etc. the size of the images varies, but it looks like the database templates limit me to one size, so it seems like images get squeezed and stretched to fit that size. Am I wrong? It seems also like there are limits to places where students can upload images using the editor and resize them. I can't seem to get it to work on any of the modules, actually. I may end up offering a link to Flickr for the students who care a lot about how their images are presented, and since these are art and design students, this may be end up being most of them. Any help from anyone would be appreciated! One of these days I hope to learn enough that I can help someone else. --Steve",

However, I want them to be able to see a prevue of the games without having to go to every site. You can see my progress at (login as guest) http://www.acuteconsulting.com/dme/mod/data/view.php?d=2&mode=single&page=12 As you can see I tried to add an iframe. But I don't know how to make it work right. I want the box that looks like an iframe to be a window that shows the domain that the url links to. Could someone explain to me what I am doing wrong and how to make this work. I think it would save the teachers tons of time. And, in the meantime while the site is open to guests, teachers are welcome to use this resource. I will have to put a password if it makes my traffic too high. But other than that I don't mind at all if other teachers search this resource for ideas for their lessons. thanks",

It is basically a list of books which are relevant to our courses plus links to a well known online bookseller so course participants can also purchase if they wish. It is has been created and administrators can view the database. Also guests who have not logged in can view the list - which is as intended. However, a student who has logged in cannot view the content but, instead, gets a page not available error from the server (rather than a Moodle error). If I specifically gave the student a student role in the database setup then all works well. But we really don't want to have to remember to give the role to new students when they enroll. This appeared to be a rolls and permissions issue. On investigation I found that Authenticated Users were not given specific access to view databases and this setting over-rides the student roll.

In each module there are permissions (capabilities) that allow you to override some default actions. In this case you might want to override the permission (capability) to mod/data:writeentry. There just don't seam to be enough permissions (capabilties) for all the different roles in the database module. In some modules, the permission (capability) structure has been nicely thought out. So this is a request to the database module developers, please assign permissions (capabilities) to the various actions that exist in the module so that us users can override then if we need to and don't \"hard code\" them in the php.

Reason I am asking is I have compulsory feedback the students have to complete and I do not want them to be able to request certification from their course until they have submitted this feedback. I have successfully got activity locking working but the student only has to view the database activity, not actually submit anything. If there was a grade that switched to 1 once the feedback was submitted, this would make activity locking work perfectly. This was done recently through a small piece of coding and the addition of one field in the table for the feedback module. Any idea if this is achievable? Thanks, Nikki",

          "Text": "Sorry, I was not very clear Teemu. I provide training courses which are all topics based, so students can start and finish at any time. When a student finishes all the requried work, they request a certificate to show they have completed the course. To make sure that they finish all the required work, I have activity locking on the request certificate activity. This means that the activity to request a certificate is locked until everything that is compulsory work is completed and submitted. One of those activities will be a number of evaluation forms and I would like to use the database module for these forms. I know there are other actiivites like questionnaire and feedback modules to complete the forms. However, the feedback module does not send the completed form to the teacher nor does it give the teacher a space to give feedback to the student. The questionnaire module send the teacher an email of the completed form but it does not have grades either and so the student does not actually have to complete it to get their certification request through. What i would like is a module that does all of the above: 1. Sends an email to the teacher when the form has been submitted by the student 2. Lets the teacher send feedback to the student after the form is completed. 3. Prevents the student from finishing their course until the form has been completed. When using the database module, the activity locking feature only has a checkbox, requiring the student to LOOK at the form (data activity) not actually submit. So technically, they could look at all the forms I have and still finish their course. In order for the activity locking feature to require the work to be actually submitted, rather than just looked at, the data activity has to be assigned a grade when it is submitted. Does this make any sense? Nikki",

          "Text": "Hi Nikki, Glad you found this module--(am I getting confused with Helen?) I too like it, and in another thread discussing the development I also mentioned the ability to add a grade. I looked into trying to add it myself, but decided to wait since this module is really very under development. Here's how things stand now. Data module--can have multi types of input, can give feedback, students/teachers get via email--no grade. Assignment module--you can only have one text entry area and the students won't get their answers via email but they can review them online, can give feedback/grade--but teacher has to give grade manually. With an essay question in the Lesson module, students can get via email after teacher gives them their feedback (not automatic like data)--AND the grading is automatic (like quiz, no teacher intervention required for unlocking--but a grade is not automatic for the essay--obviously, but I add a neutral multi-choice question that does get the grade for the lesson--e.g. have you finished this assignment?). What we can't do now--have student enter text or other types of\n\"answers--e.g. radio buttons\", get it automatically via email AND get\nan \"automatic\" grade. I'm sure that Teemu is not familiar with the activity locking code (not Moodle standard), so that might not mean much to him. However, let's hope that the \"powers that be\" (i.e. Martin), will think about adding grading to this--the idea being that this module could be used to create a multi-question-type super duper assignment .",

          "Text": "The other thing that the database module does not do that would be really helpful is to be able to use groups. This would mean that individual teachers can just look at the students of theirs that have submitted work. It would also mean that the admin can see which teachers are reviewing their work and which are not. As I use a distance training program and my teachers are based all around the world, this is an essential component. I looked at all the possible options including lesson, exercise, data, assignment, feedback and questionnaire. They all do part of what i need but not everything. Considering reflective practice is an important component now of many courses and is becoming more so all the time, I feel that having the ability to receive reflection from students and the teachers being able to give feedback on that is essential. I am looking at having a programmer come in and write us something specifically. It would be called EVALUATION and would do the following: 1. In the setup allow groups to be chosen 2. Allow grades to be chosen or no grade 3. Have a variety of question types including essay boxes and multiple choice etc. 4. Send an email to the teacher, the student and admin when it is submitted 5. Allow the teacher to click on the email link and go straight to the students evaluation form 6. Have a drop down list on the teachers and admins viewing page so they can see evaluations submitted for specific groups 7. Have a feedback box for the teacher to provide feedback, and a grade box 8. When the feedback and grading is done, movve the evaluation to a section further down the viewing page so that the completed and fed back submissions are separate from those that have not yet received feedback. 9. Have the feedback emailed back to the student via a link in an email 10. Incorporate activity locking so the teacher can chosoe if the student has to compelte this evaluation before completing their course 11. When the evaluation is first submitted, have it appear in the marking block if it is a gradable item 12. Possibly, have statistics for the non-essay questions so that the teacher and admin can see the pattern of answers. In summary, it would do everything that the assignment module does, but have the ability to tackle different questions and send the form to the student and teacher via email when it is completed. This would, as ar as I can see, meet the need for comprehensive evaluations from students and provide the opportunity to carry out true reflective practice that can then be assessed and fedback on by teachers. It would also mean that admin can monitor teachers work and ensure that a student is being taken care of. My question is, would it be easier for a programmer to use the assignment module or the database module and modify it to incorporate the benefits and functions of the two? Or is it easier to start from scratch? There are no moodle programmers here (in Singapore) and I have to get a freelance programmer to do the work so hoping they can get familiar with the system relatively quickly. Is there a programmers guide with technical specs in it that would help this process? Is there technical information available on the assignment and database modules that they could read? Once this is all finished I can make it available to others but would have no idea how to get it into cvs . Is there information on how to do this? I do not want to reinvent the wheel so if I am missing something completely here and anyone knows of a solution that already exists, i would love to know! Alternatively, would it be a lot easier just to modify the database module? It does most of the stuff above except for the grading, the activity locking - which I think will start to work once the grading is in place - and the groups functionality. Any and all ideas or suggestions are welcomed!! Nikki",

I can understand that the grading may not be necessary for your own purposes.

Basically, students have to enter: student name, book title & publisher, stars rating for the book, a textarea or two of comments/review, and some other information (book level, number of words), etc. First, I'm worried that students can easily edit/delete other students' entries. Do any current database module users have comments about this? (I really don't want to have to 'approve' the entries as it seems needlessly time-consuming). Second: In the future, we'd like to build a BOOK REPORT/BOOK REVIEW system where the database is initially populated with the book information (title, publisher, level, isbn, no. of words), then students add their reports which include a review of the book and a 'stars rating'. Teachers can do lookups on students to see their reviews and ratings; and teachers/students can do lookups on books to see all of the reviews for that particular book. Any comments from experienced moodlers on whether the database module is a good fit for this project? The future hope (beyond the prototype) is to have the database global and accessible to students in many different courses. Thanks!",

Basicly I've been asked if moodle could manage some of our ILP (Indervidual Learnig Plan) information. So thought about creating a database that would have fields that would allow students to enter their targets, how these targets would be achived and then later allowing for them to be signed off and more added. These entries offcourse would need to be private to the student and member of teaching staff. My concern is that if I go down this path I want it to work well so that I don't put off staff who don't currently use moodle for teaching from ever using it. Thanks again for your help. Mark",

That is what we are currently doing for more than 1,500 students for the posting and maintenance of their webfolios. The solution involves the administrators of our institutional Moodle platform but we think it worth the time and delay (less than 8 weeks in our case, including summer vacations...). More than 500 students are already made \"staff\" and the only thing slowing us is the conversion of the already existing webfolios (from an html format in WebCT or a Word format in MS SharePoint). To have an idea of what I am talking about, you can access the auto-formation flash modules available to our students. It is in French but I am sure you will get the main point (you can skip the first two sections which are local to our institution). From the point of view of a student, when admitted (and for the duration of his-her studies) a template of folders (and sub-folders) is created and many Word (or whatever you decide) templates are made available to modify and populate this folders's structure. Everything is private between each student and authorized teachers. Also, the templates are so universal that students can backup locally everything and re-use it when they leave our institution. As you can see, we are adhering to the KISS philosophy (Keep It Sillily Simple). It is not glorious but it works!",

Could you please share how you set your database(s) up for this? I'm intrigued. I hadn't considered doing this, but it would help me immensely. Since I teach elem students, I use an external motivator called Reward Points. Basically, for certain assignments/activities, I have assigned Points. They complete the assignment/activity, they get the points. These points are \"cashed in\" every two weeks for special privileges or prizes. Since completing homework is a major issue with my students, they get points for this. I noticed there was a grading option available on the database module. I had the idea of setting up a Scale called Reward Points and using it. I'm curious, though, where do these \"grades\" show up? If they show up in the gradebook, will they affect the quiz grades there?",

One teacher told me that he isn't able to choose a specific group to see only the entries from members of this group.\nThe database is set up with 'separate groups' option.\nHe told me that viewing specific groups (like in wiki module) was possible in 1.6. (Users from different groups are just able to see entries of their own group.)\nSo my question is if the upgrade failed on some stage (but anything else seem to run fine) or if we like to see something which isn't in the code for database module at all.\n\nThanks for help,\nJan",

I've just followed the upgrading documentation available on http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading in addition with http://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_1.8 . We're running on a Mandriva Linux system but I can't see any reason wy the procedure should fail on a Windows based system. However I had to learn about the roles concept (esp. inheritance) introduced with 1.7 but as you might be familiar with similar operating system concepts it's fairly easy. Yes, we're running wikis and they seem to run fine. The only thing one teacher is missing is the ability to select a group in the database module for just vieweing the entries of this group. Well, I found a workaround for this but it's fairly uncomfortable. 1.) Choose the participants list from the course view and select the desired group there 2.) Go to the database and there only the entries of the selected group show up. As I'm located in Germany I don't have any information about good training resources for your area but I think you'll find some in the Moodle partners list available from moodle.org. Jan",

I don't want any fancy formatting in there, though I do want the RTE to be usable in the rest of the site (or I'd just turn it off). I am also seeing a problem in which the RTE prevents people from typing in a 3 line textarea -- they cannot see the box to type in, just the editor. I had to make it a 6 line textarea to get their typing field to show up. (I wasn't seeing these problems myself, because I was originally using Safari to create the database.) I have seen references to this last issue being a problem with IE -- however, it is occurring for us in Firefox 2.0 on Mac OS X. I tested on my Mac, and the user is also using Firefox on the Mac. The latter problem is temporarily solved for us by making the textarea larger, but this is a kludge. The former problem I haven't been able to solve. Any ideas? Thanks.",

So far so good, however, if the student goes back in to edit the entry after it has been approved then they could potentially add inappropriate content. To prevent this, I think that the approval status should be revoked if the entry is edited by a non-teacher. To address this, I have commented on MDL-5581 and would encourage those interested to vote on it. To prevent entries from getting lost, I think there needs to be another sort option of Approved/Date Entered so that the oldest issues awaiting approval appear at the top of the list. I have also requested the capability to have the database module send an email to the teacher when an entry is add/updated. This would let teachers know when something is needing approval and is similar to the behavior of forums and assignments. It is listed as MDL-8377 in the tracker.",

I'm not sure if my experience is related to your point, but I have set up a research article review database for university students in which they find an article, get permission from a teaching assistant vis a vis the \"appropriateness\" of the article for review, do the review, get graded and then (hopefully), the review is approved and opened up for perusal by other members of class. The problem we seem to be getting is that although the teaching assistant has approved the article as being appropriate for inclusion in the database, she has not approved the actual entry by clicking on the \"Approve\" link. Nevertheless, the article is still released for class perusal even though oftentimes the student has not finished entering data in all the fields. This looks a little like the problem you mention. Being nosy, I might have looked at the record and I am wondering whether simply by opening up the record to look at it, I (or the assistant) have triggered the approval process.

Issuing an approval and then allowing students to change or update it without reseting the need for re-approval seems dangerous to me (especially in a K-12 environment). For university students I would not be as concerned but can still appreciate the desire to review the appropriateness of a submission. There is no need to worry about simply viewing a submitted entry. You can view it and not approve it; however, once approved it will stay approved. There is no button for un-approving and perhaps that should be included as well. It could be the same field but if the article is already approved then it would have a link to Unapprove. Perhaps a third option of Approve Permanently could be used and that would give teachers the freedom if they wanted to have edited submissions unapproved or not. Peace.",

Secondly, how do I \"query\" this database from outside Moodle? For example, we will be setting up external database authentication, and I want to be able to check the database (right away) when someone signs up to see if their username & email is valid. Thirdly, I have MS-Access, but do I need any other programs in order to \"query\" the database? Thanks",

I made a very small sample database to use as a test and saved it as preset which I then imported into my new site. The first time I used it I had to map fields and then it worked well. (I may have this part wrong but esentially there was a step before it was ready for use but it worked fine) Then I saved the 'real' database as a preset, but when I was importing it I did not work properly. I have a checkbox saying 'array' in my first field - which is not what should be there - and the other fields have field names or descriptions in them within square parentheses. The same thing happened when I tried exporting as a zip file too. I am using moodle 1.7. and apart from this problem the original db is working fine on both sites - it's the importing I am stuck on.... If anyone is able to assist me I would be appreciative Best wishes SyrianPrince Australia",

This can readily be done for new records by editing the options list for this field, but existing records are not changed (not surprisingly, as there may not be a 1:1 correspondence in the order of old and new keywords). We're thus thinking of globally changing existing records to match the new options list for this checkbox field, by directly editing mdl_data_contents. For instance, we could change the table entry (363,54,5,'Economy##Energy##Geology##Habitat##History##Land Use##Planning##Politics##Settlement##Vegetation##Water','','','',''), to e.g. (363,54,5,'##Economy##Energy##Geology##Biodiversity##History##Land Use##Planning##Politics##Settlement##Vegetation##Water','','','',''), in which the term \"Habitat\" becomes the term \"Biodiversity.\" Should we anticipate any problems with correctly accessing and displaying the above, esp. if the new options list is arranged alphabetically and \"Biodiversity\" is higher up on the list than \"Habitat\"? My sense is that what's stored is the actual options list text and not the order in which this option occurs, so if the text is present in the entry then the checkbox will be checked in the browser view no matter where the text is found.",

It's in the contrib CVS here: http://moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net/moodle/contrib/datafield_latlong Screenshot of simple example attached - capital cities, and the user can jump to see that city in a number of mapping systems. People often say of new plugins \"That should be a core feature of Moodle\". In this case I think there might be a good argument for making it core since it's very simple yet powerful, and geographic co-ordinates are used for an awful lot of purposes in teaching.

The problem with it is that for the places I would want to include, the only thing that would be relevant would be Google Earth, so all I would really need would be the Go button. However, I would like to see something more than just lat and long. I like being able to make kmz/kml files in GE itself that offer a view from a certain direction, tilt and to be able to add a description, to make a virtual tour of locations etc. You also are going to get better results if you create these things in GE rather than in Moodle because even published coordinates can be off a bit and one needs to see where they are. What I am wondering is if there would be a way to add a field to the database that allows one to attach a kmz or kml created in GE (instead of say, an image), and allow it to be launched.",

The potential utility is tremendous: one executes a search, then maps all returned records (e.g., in Google Earth, as a folder of placemarks). Indeed, without this multi-record capability the lat/long feature would be rather limited, though fun.

I haven't thought yet about what to do when it is set up with visible groups. The \"Course\" field type would provide a drop-down menu with courses. The category from which to show the courses should be configurable. Obviously one could go further and have similar new field types for other Moodle objects, like course modules for example.

What I want to do is replicate a database, with all fields and templates but without the records. Is that possible? (There are many contexts where this would be desirable.) Thanks.",

I am wondering how we can do this with Moodle.  I have posted this in the\ndatabase module because I thought at first, that I could use this module to\ncreate an entry and storage mechanism for assessment data. The data must be tied to the student.  For example, when an education\nstudent teaches a unit in a local elementary school, the cooperating teacher\nfills out a paper assessment of that unit.  The mentoring teacher (at the\nuniversity) goes over the assessment with the student and the paper is filed in\nthe student's record.  The assessment must be a permanent record, available\nfor analysis of the program, but also a learning experience for the student. I ran into trouble with the database module, because I couldn't figure out a\nway to tie the record to the student.  It could be as simple as a\ndrop-down box that is automatically populated with the student’s name. \nSince I do a mass load of students from out campus management system, I have\nthe student ID in the profile as a key back to the student’s academic record. Is there another way to implement this?  I would like to see it done in a\nway that would contribute to the learning of the student.  Students must\nbe able to see the assessment and even comment on it. This would be the process Mentoring teacher observes\nthe teaching activities , and assesses it on Moodle. Student reviews that\nassessment, develops and records a strategy for improvement Data becomes part of all\nassessment data used to track program improvements.",

Have the student type the cooperating teacher's paper assessment and upload it as an assignment.  Also have the student turn in the paper assessment to the mentoring teacher to verify that the electronic and paper assessment are the same The mentoring teacher can then view the assessment online, make comments, and assign a grade. The only difference between my suggestion and Martin's is that there would be an electronic form of the assessment tied to the student within Moodle. Good luck with Moodle! Scott",

          "Text": "I have just discovered Moodle very recently and have finally discovered in Moodle, a modular framework that appears to meet the design characteristics I have envisioned for a modular open source platform for non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations and enterprises, in support of what is evolving as a global call to action on Education, Youth & Technology for Sustainable Common Future through the NGO Committee on Education of CONGO - the Conference Of NGOs in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations and in partnership with UNESCO, NGO networks, schools, colleges, et al - see www.ngo-education.net In the course of my journey to this point, databases have played a central role, beginning in 1966 when I was a Research Assistant on a Quantitative Analysis of the French Revolution, under the excellent and thorough tutelage of Dr. Gilbert Shapiro. In 1985, I had the great fortune to discover an exceptionally brilliant and robust relational database - DataPerfect, a companion to the legendary WordPerfect - that continues to evolve as an ever-more powerul digital engine; most visibly to generate extensive sets of web pages - see. e.g. habitat.igc.org/faces/ - while compiling and cultivating an extensive body of structured curriculum information, documents, web resources, geographic & hydrographic information, civil society networks, etc. with a focus on sustainability- and peace-related issues. Among its many deatures,  DataPerfect has the ability to export sets of data in virtually any reasonable format, including delimited text format. What I would greatly love to be able to learn is how to export data from DataPerfect databases into MySQL tables in Moodle, so that the relationship between elements of a course and with relevant resources, activities , etc. is  maintained when the information is imported into Moodle. The most fully-developed example that I would like to be able to migrate to a Moodle platform is the site for the Gandhi-King Season for Nonviolence - www.gandhi-king-season.net . The site is conceived as an open source curriculum on nonviolence - with Nonviolent Responses to Terror & Injustice as the most recent theme - and that clearly would, I am convinced, offer far greater learning and teaching opportunities if the curriculum were to be transplanted to a Moodle platform. I have many other questions relating to developing interoperability between DataPerfect and Moodle, Perhas what might be most helpful for me if I could be directed to the best conceptual & schematic overview of the relational structure of Moodle's My SQL tables. I look forward with anticipation to learning about Moodle from a databse perspective. In peace",

In fact, adding data directly to the Moodle database is using a backdoor which is not appropriate when you are not completely familiar with the written and unwritten rules of the system. A possible solution might be the use of an intermediate format for your courses. If you manage to convert your database to SCORM modules or IMS CP modules, Moodle 1.6 will be able to import and play them. BTW interesting organisation you were refering to.",

I have not checked the quiz module for changes in 1.6 yet, so my following comment reflects 1.5.4. In 1.5.4 I found entering 300 questions (same type) so boring that I found an easier solution that could be helpful for you as well. Start from scratch in Moodle and enter 2-3 questions manually. Export these questions from Moodle to XML . Open this XML file in Notepad and look for the repetitive part with your 2-3 questions. This repetitive part consists of XML-stuff, your data, other XML-stuff, more data, etc. all together specifying a single question. Now create an Excel sheet with the XML stuff in column A, your data in column B, more XML in column C etc.; one row in Excel will represent a single question from your quiz. Next go to your old database, make lists with all the data you need for specifying your Moodle quiz. Copy/paste the data form your database in the appropriate columns of Excel, thus creating as many rows as you have questions. Copy the XML-stuff to all new rows. Copy the whole spreadsheet to the appropriate location in your Notepad XML-document. Import the extended XML document into Moodle. Maybe it sounds a little bit complex. However, especially when you have a large number of similar questions, it is a big time saver.",

I'm posting their requirements here for reference really just so that if anybody just happens to be looking for ways to improve the module at any point, they've got the information. Also, do let me know if any of this is actually possible already! These are the important issues: (1) Data input needs to be verified by user defined criteria.  For example if a student inputs a date of an observation, I want to check that the date is in the past.  I also need to be able to check that values are in certain ranges. (2) I need to be able to read the data from a program or application.  This could be achieved in different ways.  A live link to the actual table using ODBC.  But perhaps a simpler solution would be an automatic download from the table every 24 hours as a comma separated file, or some variation of this (i.e. just download records that have been added). (3) Moodle needs to be able to display ‘live’ data.  For example I should be able to read my data table, create a graph or a map, copy that graph or map to some disk area which Moodle polls at least once a day and updates its website, so the students see the results of their data collection. (4) A nice touch would be entering data by clicking on images too. (2) and (3) would enable me to provide an autonomous solution.  I would write a program which I would schedule to run once a day, it would read the latest data, update its map or whatever, copy it to the Moodle update area and the students would see the results.  I really don’t think anything less than this cuts it.  Just imagine a long running project that collects data from all over the UK.  Can we really imagine that people are going to be happy to copy and paste data out of Moodle into their application and then go back into Moodle to upload some file.  I don’t think that will work in the long run.",

It would be nice if this were possible for (at least) fields of the \"drop-down select\" type, where the range of options is known in advance and Moodle could automatically generate filter-choice combo boxes, for example by adding them to the area where the sort options are. I can imagine this could be possible, for example by calling each of the database field objects in turn and calling a function called something like $obj->filtering_selector_html() - for example, a \"text\" field could in theory display a text box, a \"file\" field could display the choice of \"all\"/\"has file\"/\"has no file\", a \"date\" could allow for date-range selection.

For a module at University, I need to implement a simple database (Access) and link it into the Moodle database which will store information such as username, module, log in time and log out time. We have the basic idea behind storing the information in the database such as Username, Module, Login, Logout Information stored and seperated by commas in the access database. Does anyone know how to implement a database to the Moodle database to store this information? How would we put that information into a spreadsheet (Access ---> Excel) Anyones help would be much appreciated Stuart Henry",

Do you need to to use access for a specific reason? You can use PHPMYADMIN to export from and manipulate the moodle database. Alternatively you can download MYODBC from the My SQL site and set the moodle database up as an ODBC data source. That way you can connect to the Moodle MYSQL database with the MS Access inferface and save it as a .mdb if you like. There is an option to export tables as CSVs in access.",

I have exported the Data Bases contained within MySQL and would like to keep a running record of students which have uploaded evidence to prove they have done certain work and on what date that was. Currently i see there are individual data bases kept seperately holding the Data Base Module information. I've noticed the field in which the students' ID is kept is useful for keeping track of their comments and files which they have uploaded. My query is this. Is there a way to collate Data Bases into a single data base from the data base module. prefferably showing the students ID and all other relevant fields under their ID. such as their comments, files/names of files they have uploaded, date uploaded/commented, etc etc Is possible to change the DB so they are all kept under the students ID?",

          "Text": "Hi - the database module is very interesting. I have some points of feedback - I haven't been following the dev discussion in detail so please excuse me if these are things which have already been addressed: Keywords (aka \"tags\") - how would these be implemented? They should be in the system from the start in my opinion. I'd like to be able to add a field to the database of the type \"keywords\" which would be just a text box, but which would use a comma- (or return-) -delimited list in practice, so the auto-linking would presumably work slightly differently than the normal text-box field. I know that the field types are pluggable and it should be easy to implement this if necessary - but it seems like something that should be \"core business\" for the module so I'm surprised it's not already there. Any thoughts? Lesser points: By default, the textarea field type creates a text box so tiny that the HTML editor fills up the whole area and no typing can be done! Submitted as bug 4966 I'd really like to see a default template for \"image database\" (or \"photo gallery\") since this will be something that will be used a lot. Perhaps a default set of fields (image, title, description, keywords) and a default template set? I haven't played around with the workings of this module so I don't know how straightforward that would be. For someone just starting with the tool, the \"generate default templates\" link is very useful. It would be helpful to have the ability to \"REgenerate default template\" whenever needed, since for a beginner it's daunting to have to edit the template directly. Submitted as bug 4965 (it's not a bug though! A feature request really.) The \"image\" field type has the useful feature of inclusing a box for the ALT text. However it's marked \"Short description (optional)\" - it shouldn't really be optional, from an accessibility point of view! If you take away the phrase \"(optional)\" (without neccessarily adding any kind of enforcement) that would please me... (PS I'm very happy to see that the \"File\" field type runs the link through the filters, and therefore works perfectly with the Jmol filter! A database of molecule models is something that will definitely be useful!)",

I will of course make some bug fixes. I finally solved that Excel problem (when there were numbers in the fields of the form you couldn't edit number fields in the Excel report). If Martin wants to redesign Database module after 1.6 beta, then I want to contribute. Who knows if Martin is going to redesign Database Module before 1.6 beta but I would be surprised if somebody has time to do it. Teemu",

I just downloaded and installed the most recent version, and am running it with Moodle 1.5 (2005051500). Here are some questions/problems/possible bugs: (1) Some help files are currently missing (e.g., for How Many Blank Rows); most of these aren't too hard to figure out though. (2) Though I'm able to enter multiple field values in the Radio Button and Dropdown Menu field types, I'm not able to do so with the Checkbox type: it just presents a single checkbox next to the fieldname. Is anyone else able to make the Checkbox field work correctly? (3) The Text Area field displays as editable text after the record is submitted (i.e., when a user is browsing the records); is this intentional? One can attempt to edit the text during browsing but it apparently doesn't work. (4) The Feedback field, which appears when browsing records, displays for students as well as teachers, though student input is not stored. Additionally, when the same user enters multiple records, the same feedback information is stored for each record belonging to this user, i.e. is not unique to the record. Is this intentional? (5) It is a little cumbersome for users to browse results, then add a record. They apparently have to exit the database module then re-enter to see the new record button. Maybe an \"Add A New Record\" button to the top right on every browse page would help? (6) It seems that previously entered values are used as defaults when entering a new record; is this intentional? (This may be limited to when the same user enters a new record, which would make sense.) (7) I'm able to get the email field to send me a confirmatory email and customize the subject header. But why would you want each student to enter this information in their record, since the email is just a confirmatory email? It would seem that you would include this in the initial setup form and not as a field option for each record...though I may clearly be missing something here! Again, thanks very much for your hard work on this module; just the ability to enter multiple text/image/document fields alone is useful for Moodle at this point! Thanks, Jim P.",

I hope this helps.",

(2) Perhaps our misunderstanding is due to how we typically configure checkbox-type fields: they are usually not multiple fields, but a single field that stores multiple entries. So you usually have one instruction/question for all possible answers, just like you'd have with radio button or dropdown response types. (3) It's not all text fields that are seemingly editable; it's only the unrestricted-length Text Area field. And, as far as I can tell, it's not actually editable! ( Btw , I used the most public/multiple submission/unrestricted settings I could for the database type.) (4) The main problem I encountered was that feedback was not unique to a record if a user stores multiple records; the way I see it, feedback should be unique to each record. (This is not a serious problem with my current database, as I won't be doing feedback in that manner.) (5) ... (6) My concern was whether a new user sees values entered by the immediately preceding user; if you only see the values you yourself previously entered that sounds good. (7) Thanks, now I get what the email is all about!! Though I don't get the subject option in the email dropdown -- you had that question once I believe -- can you explain it to me? Regards, Jim",

One thing, after filling in a form as a student I got this message: Sorry, but you need to be part of a group to see this activity. Although the form was filled out okay. With the multiple records setting--a strange thing, I tried to change this from No to Yes, but the Yes option is not available anymore.  I guess you can't change this after creating a form?  Anyway, I really like that option! I don't suppose a form could have the option for a student to have the form be sent to their email?  That way they could have a copy of the data that can be printed or saved.

          "Text": "Hi Teemu! Although I have been relatively quiet.  I have been watching this threat with anticipation and interest.  I have just checked out your wonderful form mod. Just a few things, The function and use seem intuitive overall however some things (at least to me) seem to be unclear, Why is the \"Press this if you want to fill this form\" button present? Why not just go directly to the form? What do the selections in the \"Rights\" column do? What do the selections in the \"Email\" column do? The check boxes do not appear to be working. Only one check box appears and and it has no value listed.. Is this function only for one check box ? Is it suppose to be able to accommodate many with each given a value? Field Name area should have some consistent flexibility so a question does not take up so much real-estate. Sometimes it will extend and other times it will not. For example, when I initially used the \"Header\" field the Field Name area did extend, all to the left side. Another time the text took up two lines on the left. Is that how it is support to be? What is the \"Header\" suppose to do? Should there be something like a \"colspan\" there? Document field appears a bit \"unstable\". It does not usually visualize and when it does there is the following error message, \" Your Document Warning : OpenDir: No such file or directory (errno 2) in /var/www/moodle/mod/form/form.php on line 164 \" The icon or thumbnail for the \"pop up\" link for the image is missing/broken. Need for a help button Also wanted to request the ability to move fields up or down, similar to the blocks in order to make adjustments in the layout. the ability to preview form before posting it. BTW , The option of \" Z e b r a \" Lines was a nice touch. So much for now. As always, very very nice work Teemu. This is going to be a really \"neat\" mod and (I hope) eventually allow for the customization of the \"Registration\" page as well as the creation of other forms. WP1",

Some thoughts- 1-I'm not quite sure how you are separating out the data input from the data display. If a bunch of students fill in forms, is there a way for one to view all of the collected data on a single page? The submission/editing of data needs to be clearly separated from the display of it. 2-The \"press this to fill this form\" button along with a form  that appears to be fillable is extremely confusing. Someone might type in all the fields, press that button, and then everything they entered will disappear. The button should appear either with no fields yet visible OR in the case when people have the chance to make more than one attempt and they have already filled it in, the data itself should be displayed on the page as text along with an edit button, which would then lead them to a form view. 3-Add an option to the form creation to choose whether a field is required or not to be filled in.",

I would like to ask you if there can be added some improvementres (and if i can be of any help on this): would be interesting to have a \"repeating entry\" facility, something such as the chat module, so in the calendar would appear the form to fill every time it is needed (monthly, weekly...). would it be possible to let teacher have the option to  \"validate\" form results? In such a way form module could be used to collect data of any kind that could also be published in the course area and/or in the public moodle areas. (it would be quite good a check box coloumn in the form report page. For publishing collected data, probably it would need a special add-on, anyway if you want I can help on this: I'm thinking on something that would present collected data on a consolitadet way with queries based on date, months and so on. Let me know your opinion about and also if I can be of any help. Andrea",
