To unhide each of the cohorts was a complete maddening experience. One at a time and the screen bounced back to the top of the page. No Select All or Unhide All functionality.

Are you hiding sections or activities completely with Availability drop down or adding a group availability condition to restrict them to specific user groups? I think you used to be able to toggle show/hide with one click. The current drop down menu I think was added to make stealth mode also available. However, it adds another click. I maintain the Popup activities course format , and I have been considering adding a feature to editing sections and activities in a modal rather than loading a new page. That may be a easier if you are changing Availability conditions. It also has a new feature that can be enable to push changes to students without them having to reload the page. I would like to better understand your use case to evaluate new features.",

Here’s what I’ve already checked and tried: I inspected the HTML source, and there are no `<s>` , `<strike>` , `<del>` , or `~~` tags. I used the “Clear formatting” option in the editor. I disabled text filters such as Markdown. I even simplified the HTML to plain `<p>` tags, but the strikethrough still appears. Here’s a sample of the HTML I used: \n```text\n<\np\n>📣 INFO BUAT CALON PESERTA!\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>Smart learners!!!\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>Mau akses materinya?\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>Pastikan kamu udah beresin pembayaran dulu yaa 🤙\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>💸 Langsung hubungi WA: 085961416668\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>📲 Jangan nunggu lama, biar nggak ketinggalan vibes belajarnya~\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>See u di kelas! 🚀\n</\np\n>\n\n<\np\n>With Ma Laoshi\n</\np\n>\n```\n But the text still shows with a line-through style. I have also tried purging Moodle caches and doing a hard refresh, but no luck. Could this be caused by: A CSS rule in the theme that applies `text-decoration: line-through;` to certain tags, or Some hidden Unicode characters (like U+0336) from copy–paste? Has anyone experienced this issue before, and what’s the best way to troubleshoot or fix it? Thank you very much for your help!",

However, sometimes you want to fix a mistake or add some information, so you enable editing at the location in the course where you want to make changes. Here, Moodle will move you to the top of the course after enabling edit mode, which add more work as you need to scroll down to find the topic or activity that you want to make changes to. I propose a change to the edit mode button behavior, so it remembers your location in the course, thereby enabling me to make changes faster. FYI , I use Firefox for Moodle work. Best, SL",

We are persisting on 4.1 for this very reason prior to the development of LTS 4.5. It seems like this modification to the edit mode is an actual fix to problem, because this is the behavior that already existed in prior versions of Moodle e.g. 3.11. Since this is a fix and not a new feature, it would seem to make sense that is should be implemented in 4.1. If this is not possible that seems to be an even larger issue in the code management and definition of what truly constitutes an LTS version.",

Would love to have something for users that can then choose to enroll in those courses (after they filter), and then would also love to use this categorization for users that are auto-enrolled by their organization rules (dynamic cohorts and rules), so that they can also browse the course catalog. Ideally, would be able to select which courses are available for self-enrollment by cohort  which I think should already work, but I have not found a course catalog like plugin or feature to use.

Please, I would like to ask for help with the following procedure: I- The teacher corrects the file sent by the student (in a submission activity) and after all the files have been corrected, the teacher enters the activity and chooses \"send feedback files\" to each of his students. Problems: II- The number of clicks and the time spent on this action is enormous! We are using Moodle 4.5.1. What happens today: a) the teacher selects the student b) a group of commands opens at the bottom of the screen and the teacher needs to click on the 3 dots to see the item \"send feedback files\" c) a drop-down menu opens where the teacher needs to click on \"save changes\" d) finally the place where the teacher will put his feedback file for the student appears e) Imagine this bunch of clicks being made for 100 students... Within \"annotate PDF\" we have the item \"grades\", the item \"feedback comments\" and the item \"feedback files\". When we enter the activity - submissions, we also have the place for the teacher to put the \"grades\" and the place for the teacher to write the \"feedback comments\", but we do not have the place for the teacher to upload the \"feedback files\". Why don't we make it possible to upload \"feedback files\" to the activity, under the \"submissions\" item, as is the case with \"grades\" and \"feedback comments\"? It would be much simpler and faster, and teachers would save time. III- the image of how it looks today. IV- the suggestion of how it could look Marcelo.",

For each subcourse I choose the meta-course enrollment as an option and I've added the role students as being able to view the hidden course, in such a way I can by default \"hide\" all the sub-courses to everyone, however once a student gets enrolled in the meta-course he can access all the sub-courses. This works fine except for one small UX annoyance, which is the phrase \"Hidden from students\" displayed below the course description (see attached image). This is annoying because it may somehow mislead students and give the impression that there is something dirty going on. In short, the students enrolled in the subcourse via the meta course should not see this \"Hidden from students\" sentence. Any suggestions? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hello, Moodle community! 😊 Regarding the solution you mentioned, it uses the magic of CSS with `html { filter: invert(100%) hue-rotate(180deg); }` . This approach is interesting because it quickly transforms the appearance of any HTML to its inverse colors. But it has some issues... When using this filter, the colors of images and icons also get inverted, which can result in something a bit... let's say, psychedelic! 🌈😂. Because of this, while it's a quick shortcut, it may not be ideal for a professional or educational environment where a polished visual is needed. I tested this on the Moodle forum and applied the code. Take a look at the result I got in the attached image. It's fun but not very practical for production. Now, take a look at the difference when using the Boost Dark plugin, which you can also download from GitHub , and see the difference: Eduardo Kraus Teacher and Programmer",

I wonder if anyone has been able to successfully integrate third-party tinyMCE plugins with their Moodle sites? I suppose what I mean by that is, besides the plugins that come packaged with tinyMCE (and a standard Moodle install) are there other Moodle admins out there who are successfully extending tinMCE with additional plugins (paid or not)? There are plenty of tinyMCE \"plugins\" that (from my limited point of view) just drop into Moodle and install right from moodle.org. I'm curious if folks are using tinyMCE plugins that aren't specifically packaged for Moodle. 😀 If I'm heading down a road that no one has returned from, I'll turn around now and start looking for other solutions. 😀 Thanks!
