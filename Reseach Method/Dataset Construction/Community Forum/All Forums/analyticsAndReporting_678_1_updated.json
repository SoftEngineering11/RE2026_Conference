While the built-in Moodle reports are functional, most of them are very tabular in format , which makes it challenging to present insights clearly to our stakeholders. We would like to explore ways to generate graphical and visually engaging reports (charts, dashboards, scorecards, etc.) that can include details such as: User lists Quiz scores Course and program completion status Other performance and engagement metrics Since our organization is already working within the Google ecosystem , we are particularly interested in whether there is a way to: Export or connect Moodle Workplace reporting data to Looker Studio Build custom dashboards with visual reports in Looker Studio Possibly integrate these dashboards back into Moodle Workplace (for example, embedding or linking) If anyone has experience implementing this workflow (Moodle → Looker Studio), or if there are recommended approaches, plugins, or integrations to achieve this, your insights would be greatly appreciated.

What does it matter? Your question is asked frequently, so if you do a little more searching, you will find many more discussions about \"time on ...

There is no \"duration\" field in the log table to sum. Consider a Moodle quiz. In the quiz results, Moodle shows when the quiz was started and when it was ended. You might want to calculate that a student spent 32 minutes on a quiz by subtracting start time from end time. But you don't know what the student really did between these two times. Did they take a 10 minute break? Who knows. And you can't even conclude anything about how fast a student finished a quiz. Is the faster student smarter? Or is the student who spent more time on the quiz the smarter student (perhaps because they know not to rush). The quiz results tell you much more than time tells you.

For instance, I'd like to know how these activities are distributed across courses or who created them. Here are a couple of examples to illustrate what I'm looking for: Example 1: We have 2000 quizzes. Are these created by 1000 different teachers, or are a few very active teachers responsible for most of them? Example 2: We have 3000 forums. Are these mostly found in specific courses, such as statistics, or are they spread across various subjects? Is there a way to gather insights into this?

However, I have a suggestion for you: this feature, to track deletions, needs to be in the core of Moodle, but you can submit a request to have it implemented directly in MoodleHQ. To do so, simply access the following link: https://tracker.moodle.org/ , and if you don’t have an account there yet, you’ll need to create one. Once you access it, check if there is already a similar request. If not, you can open a new \"Feature Request,\" explaining that you would like an option to track module deletions, with details of who made the change and when. The clearer your request, the more likely it is to be noticed and possibly implemented in the next version of Moodle. For sure, if everyone contributes suggestions on the tracker, Moodle will become even better! I hope this solution helps you, and if you have any other questions, I’m here to help! 😊 Eduardo Kraus Teacher and programmer",

          "Text": "Hello, all. I've written a local plugin to notify certain users when an admin setting has changed. It triggers off of the \\core\\event\\config_log_created event. The problem I'm trying to solve is I want to add the user who made the change in the notification; the config log doesn't store this data. Rather, you have to take the objectid of the event and correlate it to the objectid in the standard log to find the appropriate row, then use the userid field from that row. When I attempt to get_record_ sql ($query) using the id of the event that just occurred, I always get a boolean back (so assuming its not finding the row). However, if I hardcode the query to the id of a previous event, it always returns the userid for me. So, I'm guessing then that the row has not actually been written yet to the standard log when the event handler is executing. I've tried to retrieve the results with a while loop and a time-out condition just in case - after setting the timeout to 2 minutes, it still can't retrieve a row (unless I direct it to search for an objectid from a previous event). Does anyone understand the order of operations here and can explain it to me, how Moodle is triggering events and then logging results, or of another way I might be able to solve this problem?

          "Text": "Hello Josef! 😊 First, it’s important to highlight that the `\\core\\event\\config_log_created` event is indeed triggered when an administrative setting is changed, but it doesn’t directly carry the user who made the change, as you correctly pointed out. Here’s a simple and efficient tip to solve this: you can capture the user information directly from the global session variable `$USER` when the event is triggered. The `$USER` variable contains all the details of the currently logged-in user. This eliminates the need to query the database or correlate IDs, making your code faster and more reliable. Here’s how you can implement it: \n```text\nglobal $USER;\n\n\n\n\n// Get the logged-in user's ID \n\n\n $id = $USER->id; \n\n\n\n\n // Get the logged-in user's full name \n\n\n $fullname = fullname($USER); \n\n\n \n\n\n// Use these details to compose your notification \n\n\n$notification = \"User {$fullname}, ID: {$id}, changed an administrative setting.\";\n```\n With this method, you will be capturing the information directly from the active session at the moment the event is triggered. This approach works well because the event is fired in the same context as the setting change, where `$USER` is still accessible. Eduardo Kraus Teacher and programmer 💻",

          "Text": "Hey everyone, At our university, we've been analyzing student activity data across several courses. Our Moodle administrator (we’re currently on Moodle 4.x, I believe version 4.2) provided us with a dataset containing monthly aggregates of student activity. This dataset includes the following columns: id : student identifier courseid : course identifier date : month and year statsreads : integer statswrites : integer Each row represents one student’s activity in a course for a given month, with `statsreads` and `statswrites` representing aggregated actions. However, our administrator couldn’t specify which activities contribute to the `statsreads` and `statswrites` metrics. The site Examulator maps Moodle's relational database (if that’s the correct term) and displays the variables we’re referencing. After some research, we found a few sources that give a vague definition of `statsreads` and `statswrites` : Moodle Docs suggest that in the Stats package, \"reads\" and \"writes\" correspond to \"view\" and \"post\" actions ( source ). A similar question was asked in the Moodle forum, but no clear answer was provided ( source ). We checked Moodle’s source code on GitHub, but lines 1299–1305 don’t clarify which activities are counted, for example, as \"view\" ( source ). Penny Leach’s 2005 forum post offers a general definition but lacks specifics ( source ). Are there any official sources that clarify what activities `statsreads` and `statswrites` measure? We don’t need a comprehensive list of every single activity, but a better understanding of what qualifies as, for example, a \"view\" would be incredibly helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I’ll respond as quickly as I can. Thanks for reading, and best wishes, Luis",

          "Text": "Good evening, I hope you are all well. Since I didn’t find much information in Moodle forums and considering the high price or lack of customization options in plugins to track users in Moodle, I’ll share some of my experience creating a report with Google Looker Studio, connected to my Moodle database . The report is divided into three sections . The first part includes various general data about Moodle, such as the number of users, enrollments, active users, courses by category, the number of completions per course, new registrations, logins by date, and users who haven't logged in. In the second part, I focused on courses. When selecting a course name, it displays the number of users enrolled in the course, the data we want to bring in, and their completion status. It also shows the number of completions, percentage of completions, and percentage of completions by gender (if the user data is available). In the third and final part, I focused on individual users. By selecting a user from the list, it brings up their main data, completion percentage across the courses they are enrolled in, detailed information for each course, and at the end, the number of logins per month for the user. To achieve this, I first took a course on Udemy, I believe, on Looker Studio. It explains the use of each type of graph and its applications. But the most important thing it teaches is how to relate different tables in the database to extract the data. Another important aspect is having significant knowledge and access to our Moodle database to know where to extract the data from and how to relate it to other tables. For example, to create the completion tables, I joined five tables: the user table to get their data and user ID, which connects with the `userid` in `mdl_user_enrolments` and `mdl_enrol` , which in turn connects with `mdl_course` through a common field, and is joined with `mdl_completion` to get the completion status. It’s not something you can do in half an hour with ChatGPT, but I believe it’s really worth it, especially for those of us who work with many users and the free plugins don’t cover all the data we need. These reports can be downloaded directly from Looker Studio, but it also allows you to embed them in Moodle, either as a resource or, as I did, within a static page. I’m available for any questions you may have. Best regards and sorry about my gpt english!",

Verify that there’s enough recent activity in your courses to generate meaningful statistics. Since you mentioned months of log entries, there should be enough data, but it’s good to double-check. Since you’ve already run the stats cron job manually, make sure that it’s scheduled to run at an appropriate frequency in your site’s cron settings. Look into the Moodle logs for any errors or warnings related to statistics processing. That might give you more context on what’s going wrong.

Unfortunately, as you've noticed, Moodle typically only logs a user as \"logged out\" when they actively click the \"Log Out\" button. This can be a challenge since many users may not log out manually. One workaround is to adjust the session timeout settings. While Moodle doesn’t automatically log users out due to inactivity in a way that generates a report entry, you can set a shorter session timeout. This way, users will be logged out more frequently, and you might capture more accurate data in your reports.",

If you wanted to keep a daily, one could add a date/time stamp to the name of the 24hours.txt file by adding -$(date +%Y%m%d%-H%M) making the name of the 24hours.txt file 24hours-$(date +%Y%m%d%-H%M).txt You could set up a cron job to do the above every 24 hours. Not logging out is a bad habit.  Have concluded that might be encouraged by the  way resources/files are linked to in courses.   If those links replace the moodle screen users forget they are logged on and simply close that window when they are done ... thus moodles session clean up eventually would force user to login again due to inactivity.

If there is a record in the grade_outcomes table, this means a grade-book was setup? How frequently do faculty members update grades in the Moodle Gradebook? What is the average number of visits to the Moodle Gradebook per student? This helps answer when a student last logged into a course, but we don’t know if there is logging when a user accesses the gradebook to view their grades. At what point in time do professors begin setting up their courses in Moodle? What columns/variables would help answer these questions? Any insights, comments or feedback would be appreciated.

The instructor clicks on the course to see that it is \"alive.\" Is this what you mean by \"setting up?\" If so, you are then more interested in \"first access.\" After the first access, a professor might create a quiz on one day, and another quiz on another day. So there is no \"point\" in time. You might need to define what you mean by \"setting up.\"",

For example, if the enrloment in any course goes above 100 students, I'd like it send me an alert.  Is there an easy way to do that? Or do I need to modify the ad hoc db query tool?",

I created a grouping for each case, and have put the groups in their respective groupings; the default moodle completion parameters on the assignments within each project case are not granular enough for my need, so I use my ons parameters behind the scenes, and mark the assignment as complete myself when these parameters have been met in the activity completion report. Subsequent assignments are dependant on the completion status of previous assignments. But i need a way to filter according to grouping in the activity completion report + I need a way to select multiple students (for example all students of a group, or even better, a grouping) and set the assignment as completed for all of them. At the moment I am running into 2 problems: I cannot filter the activity completion report based on grouping. How can this be achieved? I cannot select multiple students and set their activity completion in 1 go. I need to select every student separately, and click the square representaing the activity completion status 1 by one; And each time I need to confirm. So 2 clicks mer student, and that for hundreds of them ... Not very efficient, and I have better uses of my time Can anyone point me to a solution that will take up less of my time just clicking ....",

I can indeed filter on groups, but it is a real shame that Moodle does not allow to filter based on groupings. Also in other reports or listings (like assignments) that would prove very useful. The lack of that filtering option diminishes the power of the grouping feature severely. Your suggestion would work in my scenario, when I manually add all of the users in the groups that I have added to the grouping, to yet another group. That kind of defeats the purpose of a grouping. I often have had scenario's where I also had to create a group for each individual student (e.g. a group containig only 1 student, I call them \"own-groups\") to get the functionality I want. I am always looking for ways that a tool makes my life easier, not more complicated. I would like to spend less time on administrative tasks, so I have more time left to focus on the students and the teaching. The tabbing suggestion is exactly what I do now",

          "Text": "We're interested in getting an idea of how many shells we created each term actually end up getting used by faculty.  Using database queries and the \"Moodle Usage Statistics\" plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/report_modstats ) I'm able to see, for example, the number of courses by category that have assignment activities .  The idea being courses without Assignments aren't being used.  This is helpful but not an entirely accurate assumption, however, since some faculty might simply use Moodle as a way to share files or links or as a launch point for an external tool. Another idea I had was identifying what a 'default' shell size is to ID courses not being used (aka, not having content uploaded) using the course size plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/report_coursesize ).  This plugin can inflate course sizes and this fails to account for courses that don't have file uploads increasing the disk footprint and instead rely on other activities. Another idea was to find a course last modified date.  Moodle's course table has this, but my understanding is this only records when changes via the course Settings menu have been saved.  This wouldn't track changes to the course like adding a file or modifying an assignment, for example.  There doesn't seem to be a universal last modified value for a course in the database. Has anyone found solutions to gathering usage data either through plugins or database queries that I might be missing?",

          "Text": "Hi Javier, It is a fascinating piece of code. I know that some analytics platforms integrated with Moodle count the time spent by the number of clicks in a period. But this code seemed to calculate the user time spent based on the calculation of the deferences between each action/log time (timecreate) and the previous action time (@prevtime) in two hours. I can see the ambiguity in the code, and I am not sure if this code works fine and do the expected job, but I think we can use it to calculate the time that students spend on a quiz need 2 hours if we add some conditions like 'last two hours do this calculation or specify the module id'. But I am still unsure how this code calculates the time spent in two hours sessions without overriding or recalculating the same log points. I was trying to visualise the code, and I would like to share the screenshot below with you. Suppose we calculate the last two hours from a specific time, and the students left at 30 minutes after creating some logs. In that case, we can get the 'sumtime' as 30 minutes, but if the student did some work and then left and came back at the last minute to create a new log, then the sum time will be 2 hours even though that the user did not spend all the two hours doing work on the page. Hopefully, that adds to the conversation. Regards Mo \n```text\n\n```",

This plugin uses a similar metric on the logs table for calculating how much time a user spent inside a course. One of my colleagues here at Catalyst also wrote some POC code that uses the Page Visibility API instead of the moodle logs to try and estimate the time a user has spent - I'm hoping we might at some point add this to the dedication block as well so we will have 2 possible methods of tracking timespent - one using moodle logs, and the other using the Page visibility API: https://www.w3.org/TR/page-visibility/",

It doesn't include lecture capture, but we get that from Panopto. It doesn't include LTI , and to be honest tracking that with most providers is painful when going down to the user. ps - I had a look at the log report output, and of course it is just course based - doesn't include activities and resources because they are not at course level. For my 2 month gap I guess I will be building up a map piecemeal based on users, courses, modules etc for a period where I do have data, and then compare that to the log version of the map, and then work out a method to estimate time spent during the gap.",

We use the Activity Completion Report, download it in Excel-compatible mode, and then process the data accordingly. We have some users who are just trainees, and some who are tutors *and* trainees. Until fairly recently, this worked well - the data downloaded for both categories of user. I believe we must have updated our moodle version, and this made it change. (We are currently on 3.10.10) All the categories of user appear in the Activity Completion Report page - the tutors just disappear when we download the report. The tutor users need to be able to view trainee results, and need to be able to add trainees. I guess I could ask them each to have a second trainee-only moodle account, but that feels like a faff. Is there something I can change in the role settings that will fix this?",

I've written the below, and it is showing the assignment names, pass, merit and distinction percentages.  However, it's not showing the correct unit IDs and the resubmission percentage is always showing as 0 which isn't correct as some students have needed to resubmit.

However, maybe these plugins can write the SQL for the user. I don't know. In your query, you are using the COUNT function. Does this query abort with a \"COUNT not supported\" error message? I have Configurable Reports installed in my Moodle 4.2. I am using it as a way to collect my SQL queries. It works for this purpose. But I don't thing Configurable Reports is fully compatible with M4.2.

You should think about \"what do I define as a student being in a course.\"  Do you want to consider unenrolled students?  Suspended students?  So another place to start is by seeing if you can create a query of all students in a course, and then see if your query results match your enrollment criteria. I cannot say that my example, below, is perfect or matches your criteria, but it is the query that I use that gives me a list of all students in all courses in my (rather small) Moodle.  It does not provide the last access, however.  If I wanted to do this, I would have to join it, somehow, to the logstore table. Perhaps it will help you. /* LIST ALL ACTIVE STUDENTS IN ALL COURSES --------------------------------------- This query works, and finds all active, enrolled, non-admin, students in a course. 11/19/2020 Filters explained: e.status 0 non-hidden enrolment methods ue.status 0 = not suspended at the course level. ra.roleid 5 = student u.idnumber < 99995 are for non-admin users, as Rick has decided to use these. c.idnumber > 300.

Our Moodle provider company opened a MySQL server which sits in My SQL workbench but we were unable to connect to Power BI. We then tried a third party data warehouse company but have also been unable to connect the data source. I am aware that Moodle does not have a native power bi connector and I shall keep trying to connect our MySQL database to Power BI, but was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for pulling data out of Moodle and into a Business Intelligence or data visualisation software? Preferably something that would update on a regular, automated basis. Thanks all!",

If every quiz question is on its own separate page, meaning that the \"Next\" button is used, they database might keep track of this. I would start exploring this by looking at the logstore table. So, a student is presented a multiple choice question. They click on choice A, then change their mind, and click on choice B. After answering other questions, they return to this one and click choice C. Or, they return to this question, look at it, and do nothing. I think you would want all time on this question, right? And if more than one question is on a page, how would you determine which question the student is reconsidering? Perhaps the desire to get 'time per question\" could only be possible if only one question is shown per page.",

Am also guessing that that sort of access would/could be kinda heavy ... is the moodle instance an all-in-one server where DB resides on same server as code and data?   Might have to make some tweaks to DB config giving it more memory and less from web services accessing the site. Is there potential for issues ... yes, but could be more like 'denial of service' (which is bad enough) rather than messing with the actual data.   That's a guess! 'SoS', Ken",

I see some reports that do this for teachers, but nothing for students.  This has always struck me as strange, since feedback and progress monitoring is such an important part of the learning process.  Not having this severely diminishes the value of rubrics in moodle. Any ideas about how to accomplish this?  Manually downloading data, then uploading for each individual student is not a possibility. Thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Bendedikt, In general, there are a few ways to track completion, but I just finished seeing the following video for Moodle 4.0, we did not upgrade our Moodle yet, but I thought it could help you. Please see the video here . Also, there is a nice block called a completion progress block; it shows all the student's progress in an interactive bar and a variety of different settings. If you want to use the Conifigruble report block for that, I think the code could be like the following (draft and not tested) SELECT mc.shortname, mm.name as modulename, mcm.completion as completiontype, cmc.compleationstate, u.firstname, u.lastname FROM prefix_course as mc JOIN prefix_course_modules as mcm ON mcm.course = mc.id JOIN prefix_modules as mm ON mcm.module = mm.id JOIN prefix_course_module_compleation as cmc ON cmc.coursemoduleid = mcm.id JOIN prefix_user u as u.id = cmc.userid WHERE ------------------------------------------- This is just a draft it could help you to start, apologies as I could not test it before sharing it with you.

As columns I want to have: Forename Surname Module Instance Completiontype Completionstate As \"Module\" I want to show the activitytype (quiz, forum etc). which is very easy because it's in the modules table. The modules table can be associated directly with the course_modules table. As instance I want to show the particular name of say a particular quiz, lesson etc. in a course. That one is somewhat tricky for me. I solved it with a very clumsy SQL statement (see last JOIN): SELECT  u.firstname as Forename ,u.lastname  as Surname,  ls.mname as Module, ls.cmname as Instance,  mcm.completion as Completiontype, cmc.completionstate as Completionstate FROM {course} as mc JOIN {course_modules} as mcm ON mcm.course = mc.id JOIN {modules} as mm ON mcm.module = mm.id JOIN {course_modules_completion} as cmc ON cmc.coursemoduleid = mcm.id JOIN {user} as u on u.id = cmc.userid JOIN (SELECT le.name as cmname, mo.name as mname, le.id as idx  from  {choice}  as le inner join {course_modules} as cmo on cmo.instance = le.id inner join {modules} as mo on mo.id = cmo.module  where le.id in (SELECT instance from  {course_modules} WHERE module = 6 and course = 9) and mo.name = 'choice' UNION  SELECT le.name as cmname, mo.name as mname, le.id as idx  from  {wordcloud}  as le inner join {course_modules} as cmo on cmo.instance = le.id inner join {modules} as mo on mo.id = cmo.module  where le.id in (SELECT instance from  {course_modules} WHERE module = 28 and course = 9) and mo.name = 'wordcloud' ...)  ls on ls.idx = mcm.instance WHERE mc.id = 9 and mm.name = ls.mname ORDER BY u.lastname,u.id In the JOIN I added all activities distinctly with a very complecated UNION construction. The problem is to find the instance names in the database and to link to the course modules. Do you have a better/more elegant solution for me ? Thanks a lot! Best, Bendedikt",

          "Text": "Hello Gareth, Answers on a first try in adaptive mode and answers in deferred feedback mode shouldn't differ much, in principle, since it's a first try and a single try, which is about the same. Obviously, answers on the last try in adaptive mode should normally be better than on the first try or in deferred feedback mode. In general, the adaptive mode would be more appropriate for formative assessments, while the deferred feedback mode would be more appropriate for summative assessments. Personally, I use the adaptive mode even for summative assessments because I consider that it is of little use for students to be blocked without having any clues, and without having one or more attempts to answer questions. Indeed, in my view, the primary purpose of quizzes, both formative and summative, is for students to learn about a topic. The summative aspect is well taken into account in adaptive mode thanks to the penalties for each try. Better students get more points for answering questions correctly on the first try, while weaker students lose points for answering correctly only on the second or more tries, or for not getting the correct answer even after the number of tries allowed. So, unless I want to do a very strict summative evaluation, which I don't necessarily see the benefit for the students, I don't use the deferred feedback mode. There are obviously a multitude of cases other than mine where the deferred feedback mode is useful.",

Recently migrated a moodle site to a new server and restored, all working 100%. Until recently I noticed that the site logging is not being captured (Site Admin > Reports > Logs). So whenever a user log in, completes an activity, views anything on moodle, it's simply not capturing and keeps frozen at the last date this still worked. So, I made another backup and restored the full LMS on local PC, upgraded the moodle version to 3.9.17 (previous was 3.9.5), low and behold... this worked and fixed the logging issue. Back to the live LMS, went through exact same steps (no issues), moodle is running on version 3.9.17... yet, the logging, again, does not work",

All good, I checked Task Logs and all shows \"Success\" with todays date (15/11/2022) 3. Check error logs? I enabled debugging on moodle but could not find any errors or logs being posted. 4. Server Environment I made sure that version 3.9.17+ is selected, clicked on \"Update component\", and the results were all green \"OK's\" 5. DB running is on My SQL , mariaDB , not sure what suggestions you have for the \"tweaks\" as mentioned? When I go to the Site Admin > Reports > Logs, the \"All Days\" drop down does capture all the dates, although the logs itself is not captured. What I found interesting is that the site migration took place on 25 July 2022, although the last log captured (Site Admin > Reports > Logs) was on 7 July 2022. (So it stopped before the migration took place) Thanks again for your valuable information Ken, hope there is something else we can try, I'm honestly at a loss, never had this happened before and now a bit in the dark as to solve this \"phenomenon\" hahahaha.",

I have a server that has been running somewhere near 13 years+ now. query to find largest tables: select table_schema as database_name, table_name, round( (data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) as total_size, round( (data_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) as data_size, round( (index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) as index_size from information_schema.tables where table_schema not in ('information_schema', 'mysql', 'performance_schema' ,'sys') and table_type = 'BASE TABLE' -- and table_schema = 'your database name' order by total_size desc limit 10 Query to find lardatabase_name     table_name     total_size     data_size     index_size moodle     mdl_grade_grades_history     683.24     249.00     434.24 moodle     mdl_files     302.77     118.90     183.87 moodle     mdl_question     277.84     267.30     10.54 moodle     mdl_question_attempts     172.02     141.41     30.60 moodle     mdl_question_attempt_steps     129.30     60.38     68.93 moodle     mdl_qtype_match_subquestions     120.37     120.22     0.15 moodle     mdl_grade_grades     99.88     45.21     54.66 moodle     mdl_assignfeedback_editpdf_annot     76.38     57.83     18.55 moodle     mdl_question_attempt_step_data     69.64     49.84     19.80 moodle     mdl_message     69.14     63.59     5.55 There is no reason to keep all in log_store_standard_log IMHO .   So the events on that server are set for 1 academic year.

          "Text": "Very significant info there ... Initial posting of the problem you stated: \"Recently migrated a moodle site to a new server and restored,\" So you migrated from something ... what was that a locally hosted server? One that was dedicated to just your entity/hostname .... the only one on that server? Significance of server info and can see that hosting might be your problem. Shared Hosting with that single IP address. Means there are other customers on same server and you have limits/caps? ;; ANSWER SECTION: 220.212.76.41.in-addr.arpa. 14401 IN    PTR    boilerroom.dedicated.co.za megs.co.za ? While a dig on the IP shows dedicated.co.za DNS wise ... is it really dedicated? IF so, why wouldn't you have greater access to server? One of those limits is how often one can run cron job.   Recommendation is for server to run cron job once per minute.  All shared hosting systems I have been in don't allow that. running apache as apache_php_fpm up “apache_php_fpm” That means there is more config to apache ... the php_fmp part. sshd up “sshd” is ok. You supposedly have ssh access to server but have never set it up/used it. (Terminal icon would be better/easier!  Maybe you just need to request of provider to install Terminal module in cPanel. Swap 7.51% “Swap” is ok Server has SWAP space and is using it.  Am almost willing to bet that SWAP is mostly DB related.  Running top from the command line would tell. Kernel Version 3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64 Shows your Linux is CentOS Enterprise release 7.  A long term support version whose end of life is coming up June 30, 2024 (that sounds a long way off, but out of sight ... out of mind ... and you. you/provider needs to move from that before crunch time. You said you used 'super user' creds for DB?   If there are other customers on that server (which is also a shared DB server) bet you didn't. In phpmyadmin do you see the following DB's: information_schema mysql performance_schema sys Probably don't ... phpmyadmin is not normally configured to run under super user creds. But, if you had ssh access/ or terminal and could su to root, and logged onto the DB server via client with super user creds you could see those databases. That would also mean you could install MySQL Tuner. Disk Usage shows 168.99 GB / used but how large is the disk slice you can use on shared hosting?   Doesn't show free space. Do see this: Disk / (/) 25% ... IF 169 G is 25% of the total space on disk to which you have access then that's good - you have a lot of space.   And could run a dev clone of your moodle site. At time of you viewing: Memory Used 48.50% About 50% of the memory ... if your moodle runs cron?  if all of your users login to moodle to do a timed test? Ask your provider to install MySQL Tuner and run it with super user creds to see what tweaks to DB might be needed. A moodle runs best if most of the DB can be in memory of server (balancing act on a server that runs all - apache, php-fmp, db server, other services), cron job runs the recommended once per minute, and the admin of the server (both Moodle admin and the OS admin) maintain - keeps things up to date!

Αt first Ι thought they were wrong, but now I am thinking something is going wrong. One student had almost 40hours in \"Other course use time\" and only a few hours in activities.

          "Title": "Marrying Analytics with Chatbot-Based Professional Development",
          "Text": "Problem: Limited Knowledge of Moodle Hamstrings Quality Course Design and Facilitation Quality course design with Moodle is limited by the familiarity of the designer / instructor who  builds / teaches the course. They often do not know what they need to learn next and do not proactively seek out further professional development with Moodle (without incentives). Instead, they typically 'call someone' to find out how to do something in Moodle because they want 'just-in-time-learning'. Solution: Marry Analytics with Chatbot-Based Professional Development Imagine if we were able to combine learning analytics data from Moodle with a smart, Customer Service chatbot? Example: Just take something simple, like the Moodle Assignement type. We can bring a faculty member on a learning path to iterate improvements to their use of this activity. All of their Moodle Assignments reflect their current knowledge level (Lean Prompt + Grade Points + File Submission). We could run analytics on the common settings for all of the Moodle Assignments in their course and detect that they don't have (1) activity completion checked (2) marking guide setup, (3) accepting online submissions, etc. We could expand the list. But here is the important point: We could create a chatbot to popup with suggestions for their 'Next Challenge' on how to 'Moodle Up' their Moodle Assignments, by, say, adding a Marking Guide to make it easier to grade. As you think about this from a pedagogical standpoint, there are iterative sequences we could bring end-users through: Main Course Page = Cluttered, High Use of Descriptions Showing on Main Page > Using Labels to Chunk and Organize > Learning How to Clean up Main Course Page, create Module Overviews, etc. Assignment Prompts =  Long, exhaustive prose and Links > Creating Headers to Organize > HTML Tips to Reduce Cognitive Overload > Use of Accordions to Organize and Show/Hide Content Multimedia = Low detection of Multimedia in Course > How to add External URL Resource / Embed > How to Embed Videos > How to Organize a Multimedia 'Set' File Downloads = Detecting High Number of Documents on Main Course Page > How to use Moodle Files to chunk downloads with files that go together You all probably know quite a few more possibilities . . . !! Just imagine a little chatbot which pops up every once in awhile with a 'Want to Moodle Up?' box and a suggestion to help you 'Moodle Up' your skills in designing with Moodle. This would create *tremendous* leverage for those of us who provide Moodle support to our end-users. We have plenty of tutorials. We can direct them to take webinars. We can point them to Moodle Academy . But this type of 'scaled' professional development—delivered in a 'just-in-time' way (based on analytics of their actual Moodle habits), would be a powerful way to improve Moodle skills at scale . I also think it would keep end-users in that 'flow state', because it is tailored to their current level—giving them just enough new challenge without overwhelming them. I would love to see Moodle HQ think about something like this for future versions of Moodle. It could even be keyed to integrate with resources on Moodle Academy.",

I think Google Analytics is free but it seems a bit complicated to use. It all depends on the information you are looking for. For example, if you have \"Guest access\" on your Moodle site and want to know the number and origin of visitors, and the pages visited, you can use for example Web-Stat (free or US$ 9.50 per month) or LuckyOrange (free or US$ 18 per month) which are easy to use. These services also have options to make data collection GDPR compliant. There are many other companies that offer this kind of service (do a Google search ) but the prices are often high.",

Right now we are using the folling SELECT statement: CONCAT(\"%%WWWROOT%%/mod/assign/view.php%%Q%%id=\",cm.id, \"&action=grading\") AS \"Link\" This states shows: https://path.to.websiteroot/mod/assign/view.php?id=1360&action=grading as a link and we can open it. But what we want is: Link and this should be clickable to open the selected page. I#ve read in the documentation that the folling statement should work: CONCAT('<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%%WWWROOT%%/mod/assign/view.php%%Q%%id=',cm.id, '&action=grading\">Link</a>') AS \"Link\" Unfortunately this is not showing as a link. Instead the report shows it as plain text: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"..... Does anybody have a clue why the html tag is a plain text? By the way: in a sql query this is working.... Thanks",

Otherwise, as you notice, it just spits out the link in full as plain text. Please see this section in the Ad-hoc contributed reports page on how this works including sample code.",

The cron was set up to run every hour (server runs on Microsoft IIS ) now it has been lowered to 5 minutes, if this was the reason it would fix the next sessions but i need to find a way to force a check on the one s that have been already submitted . i do not want to mislead anyone but what I also noticed is that the date format between the two report looks different US format for the activity completion and Italian format for the course completion. My (not so) educated guess is that one reads the server timings and the other one the user PC timings if this is the case how could i solve it?.",

I checked the course logs and course completion or activity completion has not been updated/changed. After the dates were changed I have a mess in the course; Activity completion and Course completion times for activities do not match ( I understand course completion time is created with a cron Job, which in my case runs every min, but I thought the \" Course completion \" would take the activities completion times from \" mdl_course_modules_completion \", but this is not the case). If I update mdl_course_completions.timecompleted , it will update the course completion time, but the activities completion time in the \" Course completion \" report are still showing the old date, which does not even match the \" Activity report \" completion times. I wonder where do the \" Completion report \" takes the completion times for the activities. I am preparing a query to update mdl_course_completions.timecompleted based on the \"first\" completion event shown in the course logs ( mdl_logstore_standard_log ). I will share it when I tested it in case this happens to someone again. If you have any idea where do the \" Completion report \" takes the completion times for the activities, that will be very much appreciated, so I could update these as well to match the \"Activity report\" times.

Actually, the course completion calculates do often try to save the times according to one of the criteria for the course completion, including grabbing the latest activity completion. If you are using only activity completion criteria, it usually does this - from what I have seen. So, sometimes the course completion data is the same as the most recent activity completion date. But there's a lot of other possible criteria too. It saves most of those times in a special table for things that otherwise don't have dates (course_completion_crit_comp). Exactly which dates it grabs for this this and when it uses the cron time, it a bit of a mystery as Adolfo says above. If someone figures it all out, I hope they post it here.",

Therefore, the activities may complete at different times to the course, and if Cron is running every ten minutes or so then it will be later than the activity completion settings by around that time. However, it could be very different if the completion criteria has been adjusted manually - unlocked, and reset, for example. In this case, the course completion will be evaluated once you've saved the new settings, and all the data relating to completions prior to that will be lost (in the course completion, at least). The activity completion data will not change, so you could end up with all activities completing way before the course is complete, if the course completion was later unlocked and changed.

Try it on our demo site: https://labs.bdecent.de/ or learn more about its features here: https://bdecent.de/product/video-time-pro/ Hope this helps! Stefan",

I am not exactly sure where your \"study\" will take you.  However, remember that Moodle uses a relational database to store all kinds of information.  If you know SQL , you have access to (almost) everything you could want.",

I wanna develop and test a new analytics indicator : show the most viewed activities and ressources in a course, to alert each student about activities they did not complete. I do not know if it is possible to make such student report with the default Moodle analytics. But I do not want to make it with an external paying tool. I read the analytics API but it is a bit difficult to enter that documentation without some examples. I have been searching in the Youtube Moodle channel and found the above video that seems to be the first session of a mutisession webinars about that question. This session explicitely proposes participants to work on an example. That is the reason why I ask if it is possible to access the other sessions videos. I did not find other videos about the analytics development. I am not the only one in this forum to ask for help on that question. I also saw that new analytics plugins arise and they do not use the native analytics development approach. I like very much Moodle, but I honestly wonder if the native Moodle analytics is a continued project.",

I am however, getting this error in Boost on 3.9: \"SCSS code is not valid, fails with: parse error: failed at `flex-flow; row;} ` (stdin) on line 2, at column 71.\" I think it's just a typo with semi-colon for a colon. It parses okay and works great with this instead: `#page-report-progress-index table#completion-progress {display: flex; flex-flow: row;}` This also works in 4.0 Boost as well as 3.9 (see screenshot), although it does clip off the icon at the beginning of each row (former column). That seems to be the only difference between the report in 4.0 and earlier. To fix the 4.0 clipping, if I set the margin-left to -42, it leaves out the icon on the row altogether: `#page-report-progress-index .modicon {padding-top: 5px; margin-left: -42px;}` or even betterL `#page-report-progress-index .modicon {display: none;}` I'm sure it can be tweaked to include the whole icon, but hiding it works for me.

I tried looking up the MySQL code for a date range in Moodle Docs, was unsuccessful Searched: dev.mysql.com/doc/ , stackoverflow , and github , but I didn't understand as I'm not a coder The code I found that seems like it would perform the function I am looking for is: BETWEEN DATE_FORMAT(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH, '%Y-%m-01 00:00:00') AND DATE_FORMAT(LAST_DAY(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH), '%Y-%m-%d 23:59:59') But I don' know if that is the right instruction or format or anything. What could I add to the listed code that would just have the totals for the specific date range I mentioned? \n```text\nSELECT u.firstname AS 'First' , u.lastname AS 'Last', u.firstname + ' ' + u.lastname AS 'Display Name',\ncc.name AS 'Category',\nCASE\n  WHEN gi.itemtype = 'course'\n   THEN c.fullname + ' Course Total'\n  ELSE gi.itemname\nEND AS 'Item Name',\n\nROUND(gg.finalgrade,2) AS Grade,\nDATEADD(ss,gg.timemodified,'1970-01-01') AS Time\n\nFROM prefix_course AS c\nJOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid\nJOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id\nJOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid\nJOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id\nJOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid\nJOIN prefix_course_categories as cc ON cc.id = c.category\n\nWHERE  gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'course'\n\nORDER BY lastname\n```\n Thanks!",

However, you don't need any of the formatting to due the date calculation at all because you are not showing them to the user in the report results: just do the straight comparison. One good way to do this is explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11808232/how-do-i-select-between-the-1st-day-of-the-current-month-and-current-day-in-mysq . Remember, all dates and times in Moodle are saved as timestamps.

Our teachers use it to bulk contact students who have not completed a particular activity. When using the participation report for a quiz and selecting 'Post' for actions, We assumed that \"No\" meant students have not completed the quiz and 'Yes' meant that they have completed it. Recently I have noticed our assumptions are incorrect. I ran some tests. \"No\" means they have not yet viewed the quiz. 'Yes (1)' seems to show that they have viewed a quiz, 'Yes (2)' means they have viewed and attempted it, while 'Yes (3)' shows they have completed the quiz. Higher numbers, like 'Yes (5)' and 'Yes (7)' seem to show that students have completed multiple attempts. It seems like a variety of actions count as posts. Can anyone confirm the same experience?",

Each activity in moodle defines it's own indicator classes eg here's the social breadth one for the forum activity: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/mod/forum/classes/analytics/indicator/social_breadth.php Which basically uses the community of inquiry class here: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/analytics/classes/local/indicator/community_of_inquiry_activity.php The values calculated by Moodle for these indicators are stored in the mdl_analytics_indicator_calc table and then collected to be sent to the machine learning mode - to understand the indicator_calc table data you should also understand Moodle's \" context \" concept so that you can match the records in this table to a user.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, can anyone help me figure out how to pivot data in an Ad Hoc report's SQL query? The examples of pivot statements available online seem straightforward enough, but I'm not able to make it fit my current use case. Here's what I'm attempting to do My query so far is: \n```text\nSELECT <fields> \nFROM {user} u INNER JOIN {course_completions} cc ON u.id = cc.userid\nINNER JOIN {course} c ON c.id = cc.course \nWHERE c.id in (330, 442)\n```\n This gives me a list of every user completion on these specific two courses. Now, I'd like to have the Activity/Module completions (mdl_course_modules and mdl_course_modules_completion) but a JOIN would just create like 10+ rows where I want just one. What I want to do is pivot the data from these two tables, and have it appear as columns, so that each module completion has its own column, and one user's course completion is limited to one row.\nDoes anyone have any leads on how to do this, or a simple example of pivoting those tables to match my needs? Thanks!",

What about if you need to have this report for a school, which have many courses and the modules or activities could be change over the time, and each year some updates will be on most of the courses. I found this example online but not sure yet if that will help. I will try it when I get some time and let you know. There is another thing I would suggest, to create a macro to pivot the table in Excel or google sheet. Or automate the pivoting procedure in your data warehouse, I think that possible too.

However I do prefer this to any of the previous solutions I've investigated, but I'm open to hearing if there's any better ones. Secondly, I'm not an sql expert by any means, but I do believe that the PIVOT function is supposed to aggregate items, such as the sum or count of certain values (as opposed to this, which is just listing one value, if that makes sense) And finally, we could definitely pivot using Power BI or Excel, that would work. But this report also has the benefit of being readable if one of our instructors needs to go in and check on anything. Ultimately though I think the question of which approach is better would vary. Maybe exporting a list of module completions separately and manipulating it in your end software would work better for you. Cheers!",

Clearly, this is not ideal. The concept of analytics is a good one. However, there needs to be options and control over how these insights are gathered and distributed. For example, in one circumstance, I may desire site administrators to manually view insights reports periodically. In other circumstances, I may choose that teachers receive email notifications for given models. A blanket \"email every teacher in every circumstance\", with no ability to set this preference against each model is a poorly conceived approach, and has led to us needing to disable the whole thing. This is a shame as we are missing out on useful information. Please consider introducing emails as an *option* for analytics. Kind Regards Lee Cujes",

          "Text": "Hi, We are hosted Moodlecloud users and I'm stuck trying to get the information I need using the reports available. Background Info: We have a number of courses  in which the assessment for each topic within the course is a quiz made up of 30 -60 essay questions (quiz).  Usually 14 - 15 quizzes across the course.  The quizzes are manually graded by the trainers. The students can attempt each quiz as many times as needed.  The quiz settings are set so that when they start a new attempt their previous answers are brought into the new attempt. Each course has up to five trainers with specific students assigned to their group. Reporting Requirement: For each course, I need to do a report that shows something like this but accurately shows the number of quiz attempts graded. What reports I've tried and the issue: - Individual quiz report - can show me this but topic (unit) but it would mean having lookup formulas to group the students under their trainer.  it would also mean running the report for each quiz separately - which would also be very time consuming - Activity Completion - only shows when it was completed (graded as a pass) - Course Logs exported to excel Adjusting the date so it is date format not text and using that to extract monthly data Using the 'Event Name' column to count instances of 'quiz attempt submitted' - this works great for the submissions Using the 'Event Name' column to count instances of 'user graded' - this doesn't work as it overinflates the number (see image above). I've worked out that 'user graded' includes partially graded quizzes (i.e. the trainer graded part of the quiz, left it and then came back and finished grading it) Using the 'Event Name' column to count instances of 'Course activity completion updated' - It only counts when the quiz was graded as a pass - not when it was graded and needed to be done again. What I need help with? I need a report that shows how many quiz attempts have been graded by each trainer and I need to be able to split this into months.  It would be good if it showed the quiz name in the report as in the future we might want to be able to drill further and show this information as well. Does anyone know how I can accurately get this information from a course hosted on Moodlecloud in a user-friendly way (i.e. so I don't have to pull things from various reports' Thanks for any help/suggestions.

(In Site admin > Plugins > Logging > Standard logs :: Keep logs for. ). If so then that makes sense as you would only see the last six months of dates in the pull down menu in Reports > Logs to choose a date. If that is what is happening, then that old data is no longer in the database . If you did a course backup and you checked the \"Include course logs\" option, then when you restore the course it will restore all those log entries as well with their original dates and times. (If the backup did not include those course logs, then there are no old logs to restore.) _However_, the very next time the site runs the task to truncate the logs older than 6 months, it will then delete all those restored entries with those dates older than 6 months. By default his task runs once a day. So, if you need to view those old dates for a while, then you might consider temporarily setting the Logs not to delete, until you can get that old data out and save it, then set it back to truncate at 6 months.",

In this case, I would remove all the category parts and just put in a simple course id to a course that I can manually verify and check the results against. So, just a c.id= will let me check that. Note also that, with more than one course, this query will return only users who have no quizzes in any courses, so they many have done one quiz in one course but not in the others. Also, it returns all enrolled roles, so both teachers and students, since it is just looking at enrolments and not at role assignments. (You can always add that in later.) The following stripped down one works for me and shows the logic of the query more clearly: \n```text\nSELECT DISTINCT\n\n\nc.fullname AS \"Course Name\",\n\n\nu2.username AS \"User\"\n\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_user_enrolments ue\n\n\nJOIN prefix_enrol AS e ON e.id = ue.enrolid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course AS c ON c.id = e.courseid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user AS u2 ON u2.id = ue.userid\n\n\nWHERE c.id = 2\n\n\nAND ue.userid NOT IN \n\n\n (SELECT qa.userid\n\n\n  FROM prefix_quiz_attempts AS qa\n\n\n  JOIN prefix_quiz AS q ON qa.quiz = q.id\n\n\n  JOIN prefix_course c on q.course = c.id\n\n\n  WHERE c.id = 2)\n\n\n  \n\n\nORDER BY c.fullname, u2.username\n```",

From the IT Department accessing LMS usage reporting for upgrades, to the online programs using scheduled, automated reports to learn about at-risk learners based on LMS activity, to her design team using the data and visualizations to develop support and training opportunities for faculty, she found ways to enhance several areas of the institution just from this one plugin inside Moodle. She also talks about the Instructor Dashboard with the IntelliBoard data that was embedded right into their Moodle platform, so the faculty had access to their own course/student data at any time. If you want to learn more, IntelliBoard is having a one-day virtual event in October. This link, IntelliCon 2021 , will take you to the information/registration page. Hope this helps! Jennifer",

The role is based on the manager role and has the ability to edit a course. We have restricted the course administration block menu  and role function so that the administration team user can edit course content, maintain users (e.g. ability to enrol users, use groups etc) and access the reports only. We have upgraded to 3.9.9 from 3.5. Since the upgrade the administration team role now has access to the course administration block > course completion > default activity completion and the bulk edit activity completion settings. Enable completion tracking is enabled on the site and we use the it to enable our learners to manually complete activities . Is there a permission that we can update that will remove the role's access to the course administration > course completion menu item. Look forward to hearing from you. Kind regards. Paul",

In /course/completion.php it checks for both of these: if the user does not have course update but does have the ability to manageactivities, it will redirect them and let them see those two tabs for the bulk and default activities, otherwise they see and can set all three.

          "Text": "Hello! Just brainstorming here: The Moodle Association of Japan moved the reporting about forums forward via the MUA a few release cycles ago. Now, uses have access to a \"Summary Report\" and users can also \"Export\" raw forum data for analysis. These are two positives. However, working with these tools and other forum analysis tools, we have discovered things really bog down when the data grows big. Checking relationships between replies (for example) and calculating the depth of replies (for another example) for each user, each group, each grouping , and even analyzing \"discussion post by discussion post\" gets increasingly complex and taxing on system resources. Would there be any value or benefit in designing (for Moodle) a kind of \"Report Caching\" system that would periodically update selected tables with summarized data for display? What I mean is that a user chooses the report they want to \"cache\" and then that report gets run using the specified criteria once every cron cycle (as a scheduled task -- for example -- hourly). Then the data is slowly populated in the background and made available through a single table read and display when the user accesses the report. If there already exists such a system (I'm not talking about configurable reports which require regular users to have a deeper knowledge of SQL ), I'd be interested in learning more about it. If such a system doesn't exist, I suggest (with LA becoming more and more prominent) that Moodle should begin planning one. What do others think?",

          "Text": "Hello Community, I am working at a private university in Germany that is planning to use moodle as its primary e-learning plattform starting this year. Consequently we do not have had any courses yet and no analytics models could have been trained using our data so far. As I understand those models correctly they apply logistic regression using only internal data from our institution. If this is the case there is no outcome yet observed (e.g. students that have completed any courses) such that analytics models cannot be applied in the first course ever held on a site, right? Maybe there will be options for unsupervised models in the future? Best regards Tim",

          "Text": "Hello! I'm not sure it's relevant to my question, but our Moodle version is presently 3.10 (Build 20201204), although we will be upgrading to 3.11 soon. My question has to do with the possibility of getting detailed statistics related to how many courses contain a given activity type. So, a little background, during the pandemic when everything went online we signed up with a remote proctoring service for online exams that is added to a Moodle page as an external tool. Now that a year has passed, we are re-evaluating our use of this service and its cost, so we would like to know not only how many courses it has been deployed to but also how many students were impacted. I can ascertain the number of courses by going to 'Manage Tools' in the administrative settings and checking the \"This tool is being used X times..\" field, but short of checking each and every course to see which ones use it and which dont, I'm not sure how to get the number of students that used the tool. Is there a way to get a list of courses that contain a given activity type or external tool? As it is, I can only get a numerical value for the number of courses and I have not found a way of getting anything more than that. Thanks!!",

What came to my mind was an admin tool that could be turned on and off for 'show query' for some standard moodle reports .  But that's a feature request which would require votes and concensus to get into core.   (probably will never happen).   So ... sometimes one can do 'monkey see, monkey do' to get there - with some minor additions.  Trick, of course, is to figure out those seemingly 'minor additions'. :| For beginning and maybe future use, if you have control of your mysql server config, consider turning on General Query Log. Shared info (while below shows the slow query log as well, to begin don't do that one ... just the general query log ... and not for very long as logs will build up in a hurry - get large - and slow down your site ... we don't want to have 'un-intended site consequences'. General Query Log, but having it written to a flat file would remove a lot of possibilities for flexibility of displaying, especially in real-time. If you just want a simple, easy-to-implement way to see what's going on though, enabling the GQL and then using running tail -f on the logfile would do the trick. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-log.html one could setup mysql to log, have mysql log queries, then tell mysql to turn off logging.   What ever is done when logging is on is seen in logs. Don't leave it on or those could easily fill up a lot of space on DB server. Settings in my.cnf # for logging general_log_file=/var/log/mysql/mysql-general.log Above multitail would show the logs as well as web server access and error log.   You adjust to your log files locations and names. # to turn off # set global slow_query_log = 0 # set global log_slow_queries = 0 # set global log = 0; Once off, those logs can be copied out of /var/log/mysql/ saved as a text file (they are ascii anyway), download them and inspect with notepad/textedit or any text editor 'SoS', Ken",

I tried todayto create a report with Training Sessions for all the students in a course. Actually I wanted to see how much time had the students spent in the course (it was one session with bigbluebutton and it was about 4.5 hours). Not all students had attended the course, but most of them did it. The problem is that the report was totally wrong. ex student was attending from the beginning (about 4 hours) but Training Sessions show only 1 hour. The same problem with other students that I know they were attending the course., I tried with the other 2 plugins with the same results. (Slightly different time) Even for the teacher, the report (Course dedication) show only 1.5 hours (instead of ~4.5). I must say that I hadn't enabled server statistics. I don't know if this caused the problem. What should I do in order to export right reports? Should students follow some steps? ex. log out before close the browser tab",

I logged into another course under a test profile and see that even viewing going to the course (without engaging in any content) does still generate a view event in the log.  Furthermore, the is extends beyond the one course as John Smith's \"site level\" logs show only events up until 6-23-20. His site last access does show a value of 7-1-20. Anyone else experience a similar issue?",

We have initially hypothesized that\nhis could be accomplished by using the Moodle tag feature. We are\nessentially adding tags to all the questions in quiz activity. We are\nhoping to be to create a report that looks like this: Course-level Reports A course-level report shows all tags (only tags present in the current course?) from the course with roll-up data for all students. This report should also incorporate a user filter which lets the data be filtered to an individual student. Tag Correct Pts Max Pts Correct % Tag 1 Tag 2 Tag 3 From the course-level tag roll-up, each tag name links to a breakout of the selected tag across all Quiz activities in th at course Tag 1 Course Correct Pts Max Pts Correct % Quiz A Quiz B Quiz C So\nfar we have achieved a query that will get us a report that shows all\nthe tags for a particular quiz as a column and the rows are the\nstudents. And that is a good start but where I am getting stuck is we\nobviously need the student data to determine the vales but I don't want\nto actually have them appear in the table .

Unfortunately, it is a mess: it is not properly normalized at all and so you will have to parse out the string to find the group.

I'm very new to moodle and got dragged into this because SQL is my thing.  Can you tell me if it is possible to create views that you can use on custom reports?  With all the Cases and substrings, views would make this easier! Thanks again for all the help! Katie",

Those are both read only basically, though Config Reports will let you use some basic things like UPDATE if you turn off the \"SQL Security\" in its plugin settings. But it can't create things like views or temp tables and so forth. However, if you create views another way, you can certainly use those in your queries, as long as the views are in the same moodle db (because the plugins run as the Moodle user set up for that db and that should be the only one it has access to.). A common and useful view is one for user firstname and lastname. I usually do one for course completions because its a popular request. Also, if your find yourself having to do reports from the logs, a view can dramatically speed things up, for instance if you have to do a query for \"last time a student entered their courses\". If you are new to Moodle then perhaps these things may help: - Do you have Adminer installed? https://moodle.org/plugins/local_adminer . Everyone has their favorite tools, but this one is very handy because it is right there in Moodle. - I assume you are aware of the Ad-hoc contributed queries page: https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports but if not, it's a mismash but I borrow from it all the time. - Finally, most of the questions about queries are posted over in the forum for the Configurable Reports plugin rather than here, mostly because of history I suppose, but most of the SQL people hang out there: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=7979 Randy",

As a result we have a long report with repeating userlogins.

Some just focus on the technical (keep Moodle running) others try te be an adviser for teachers (like myself) on how to set up courses, which activities to use, etc. Now the teachers will receive 'Insight' mails and I would like to see how 'insightful' they really are. I would like to advise them to use this information or ignore it. Can every teacher make the decision themselves to receive or not to receive these mails per course? Can they make a decision to get the mail from course A and not from course B? I'm just puzzled by this... as it is a feature where I as an admin have little control over.",

Please note that as an admin you have full access to all the insights reports generated for the teachers, just that you don't get a notification about all of them.

This model reports on courses with no teachers or no student enrolments that are starting during the next week. The most likely explanation for not getting insights at that context level is that the model is disabled, another reasonable explanation is that there are no courses matching these conditions in your site. If you want to test this model you can create a new courses with start date tomorrow and with no teachers or no students. Go to site admin > analytics > analytics models and execute Get predictions (or Execute scheduled analysis in 3.8dev). You should see the course you just created in /report/insights/insights.php?contextid=1. If you want to get notifications about these insight check your notification preferences page, insights should be \"on\".

We were expecting to see the timestamps the activities were completed. I'm aware we can see them in the Activity Completion report, but confused why they're not shown in the Course Completion. It seems redundant to just show the same timestamp a course was marked completed under all the conditions that were required, rather than when those conditions were met. This feels like a bug and that the timestamp for when the activities were actually completed should be reported in the Course Completion report. But I thought I'd check here to see if I'm missing something before logging this on tracker. Thoughts? Cheers.",

          "Text": "The Learning Object Relation Discovery (LORD) plugin is now available from the plugins directory ( https://moodle.org/plugins/block_lord ). This plugin extracts the text content from the learning activities in a course and uses that content to compare the activities against each other, producing a similarity score between each pair of activities. The comparison uses an online sentence similarity calculator ( https://ws-nlp.vipresearch.ca/ ) to determine the similarity values. The similarity calculator uses WordNet, so is currently limited to the English language, but support for Hindi and French are planned for later in 2021. The comparison process runs as a background task and can take some time to complete. Once all the similarity values are known between all the learning objects, the learning object graph (LOG) can be made. A network graph is created where the nodes are the learning objects from the course and the similarity values between objects is used to position the nodes, grouping learning objects with similar content. This plugin can be used by itself to examine the similarity between learning activities and also integrates with the Behaviour Analytics plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/block_behaviour ). The Behaviour Analytics plugin uses a network graph of learning objects to cluster students according to their behaviour patterns, but the graph nodes are grouped by section and require manual arrangement. The LORD plugin is designed to automatically configure the graph so that it does not have to be manually configured, which should produce better clustering.",

To run the training of the analytics you will need a copy of a moodle database with a number of courses and historical logs - ideally the courses will have start and end dates set in the table already, however you can run some scripts that will set/guess the end-date of some of the courses. The \"prediction\" process currently requires active logs - or a way to generate user activity after the training process has been run (which is not all that easy to do on a testing site.) There is a research data set here which contains a logsstore and user data export, https://research.moodle.org/158/ But - it doesn't contain the course table in that data set which is needed for the analytics processes - you might be able to fake it by generating a bunch of courses that correspond to the courseid in the logstore table - if you're lucky it might even just be one course in that data-set but I haven't looked at using it myself. Depending on what your skillset is and how much time you have to work on this i have a number of \"development\" related ideas that would be good:",

          "Text": "Greetings fellow Moodlers, The Behaviour Analytics block plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/block_behaviour ) has recently been released in the Moodle plugin directory. This plugin provides teachers with a visualization of their students' learning behaviour patterns. Learning modules from a course are used as nodes in a network graph, which can be arbitrarily positioned. Student accesses to the modules create links between the nodes and become the students' behaviour pattern. It is possible to compare the learning patterns of students to see their similarities and differences for various time slices. The plugin also allows students to be clustered according to their behaviour patterns. Each student has a unique pattern that is compressed to a single point, then these student centroid points can be clustered to group students. Clusters of students may have common learning behaviours that can be viewed by hovering over a cluster centroid. It is also possible to annotate the students and clusters during the clustering stage. Currently, the VIP Research Group at Athabasca University ( https://vipresearchgroup.ca/ ) are also developing the LORD (learning Object Relation Discovery) Moodle plugin. The LORD plugin uses WordNet and Natural Language Processing to measure the similarity between two learning objects (activity modules). The similarities are used to automatically position the Learning Object Graph (LOG) nodes, rather than using manual positioning. Presently, only the English language is supported, but there are plans to support French and Hindi next year (2021). The LORD plugin has not yet been released to the Moodle plugin directory, but is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/Behaviour-Analytics/moodle-block_lord ). There is also a new version of Behaviour Analytics plugin available ( https://studyguide.athabascau.ca/networkgraph/download.php ) that is designed to integrate with LORD. Both LORD and the new Behaviour Analytics will get submitted to the Moodle plugin directory later this year.",

Currently status reports need to be requested from us by the client, we use a custom SQL Report to pull a site-wide status report that uses the Institution user profile field as a filter. We are looking to allow the company contact the ability to pull this same (or a similar) report using their login that will also pull the site-wide (multiple course) report, but ONLY if the users Institution field matches there own. Has anyone needed or developed a report to use here?  I have a friend who does similar work, but not moodle, and he said the report would need to associate characteristics of the \"report puller\" to match to user fields, and that is the hurdle we would need to figure out first.  Looking forward to any assist someone may be able to add.

          "Text": "For the first time we've switched on Analytics in Moodle (3.8) but I'm still grappling with understanding what things mean, especially in a way that can be explained to a teacher. When you look at an insights report for a course you get some bulk action buttons: So, I'm wondering what the consequences are for Accept, Not applicable and Incorrectly flagged. There's no messaging on the page to help explain this. I suppose it might depend on the context of the course, so in one example I'm looking at, the course end date was not set, even though it ended a year ago. So what do I do? Accept it. Does this just acknowledge I've seen it, but has no other consequence? Not applicable . How's this different from Accept? Does it affect the prediction model? And how? Incorrectly flagged . Well, maybe, but actually the wrong end date was on the course. Do I correct the end date and mark Incorrectly flagged. Or do I change the end date and do something else. Accept, perhaps? The only documentation I can find on these actions is https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Learning_analytics_quick_guide#Actions but there's not help in understanding the different contexts where you might want to take a particular action. I suppose also, there's a concern about \"doing the wrong thing\": \"What happens if I press a button? Can it be fixed if I do the wrong thing?\". I don't want teachers getting bogged down worrying about these things. So would really appreciate some clear messaging around these actions. thanks Mark",

My first contribution: Unintended Consequences and Goodhart’s Law: The importance of using the right metrics https://towardsdatascience.com/unintended-consequences-and-goodharts-law-68d60a94705c \"Goodhart’s Law is expressed simply as: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” In other words, when we set one specific goal, people will tend to optimize for that objective regardless of the consequences. \" Let's think about how this could affect learning analytics. If we don't choose our targets carefully, participants may optimize their participation too narrowly. Here's a example given in the article: \"In school, we are given one objective: maximize our grade. This focus on one number can be detrimental to actual learning. High school seemed like one long series of memorizing content for a test, then promptly forgetting it all so I could stuff my brain full of info for the next one, without any consideration of whether I really knew the concepts. This strategy worked quite well given how success was measured in school, but I doubt it is the best approach for a great education.\" One of the significant-- and often overlooked-- advantages of learning analytics is their potential to detect hidden or \"latent\" factors in the learning process , not just predict a learning product . What kinds of processes could we detect that would be less prone to \"gaming the system\" than a final grade prediction?",

I noticed in the database if I get all the right pieces I can figure out who and how often a registered user logs in but I want the data from just the site being hit by anyone regardless of log in. To enumerate exactly what we are looking for: Visits per day Peak visit time Low visit time Length of time per visit Unique users Repeat users Geographical broken down by city and state Any recommendations are much appreciated. 3rd party maintained web APIs, anything goes. Moodle version is: 3.6.3+ Build 2019 03 28. If any additional info is needed please let me know If an update is needed to get the functionality I'm looking for let me know and I will plan with my IT team the best approach it update our server .

One part of the paper will be about the new learning analytics functions in Moodle. Unfortunately, I do not have the opportunities to personally test it in practice and Moodle Docs - Analytics unfortunately doesn't provide me with sufficient information. It would be a tremendous help if you could provide me with some information about its possibilities. 1) I found visualisations and explanations about the Analytics dashboard for teachers. But is there also an Analytics dashboard for students, so that they can reflect their own learning activities ? E.g. compared to the class? 2) Besides the prediction \"students at risk of dropping out\" - which other targets are there to define? / Which other insights can be generated? Unfortunately I can barely find information on that. I cannot thank you enough in advance for your support with this. All the best and stay safe, Larissa",

My plan is either to sponsor or co-sponsor the project (or possibly contribute to crowdfunding the project if it turns out to be hugely expensive) with the plugin then becoming available in Moodle plugins directory for free. At this stage I'm interested in two things: People's feedback on the attached draft specification (I'm sure there will be lots of things I haven't considered). Any thoughts on who / how to go about finding a developer to cost and complete this project. Please note that I'm conscious this plugin might require significant resources to run on sites with many courses and many users. I've have taken this into account when designing the attached specification, but if anyone has any additional thoughts/suggestions about this area please let me know. If you have any feedback then you can either do so in the forum thread, or by adding comments or tracked changes to the attached specification and uploading it in your reply.",

My experience tells me these are almost always set the same, but obviously don't have to be. In any case, there's likely some education to do here for  instructors. I think the section that is missing is the specific capabilities your plugin will need. You mention \"roles\" several times but it is much better if you first specify which capabilities your plugin will need to have to be added to those roles (or to be available to any custom roles.) It won't work without some sort of checking and it is much better practice (and the common Moodle code practice) to check for specific capabilities and permissions instead of a standard role. This is especially so as you plan to open it up for others to use, and you have no way of knowing how sites may use or adjust roles, but with a permissions based setup, anyone will easily be able to adapt it to their specific setup. Good luck, Randy",

Whether it works for other activities depends on whether those are well coded to keep the state of each question as they go along. There's a list of all these possible states (with some comments on what they do) in the code in the /question/engine/states.php file.",

However I'm confused about the way to go about this. The attempt_steps table tracks userid and states and time created. I wanted to get only the attempts of questions within a particular course. How can I go about that? I went down the path of getting the context id and all that but it was not straightforward to even figure out which context id was within a given course. The only roundabout way I figured of understanding this would be to do this: Get attempt_id  --> Get usage id from attempts table --> Get contextid from usage table --> Get path from context table --> Get course path to see if the context id belongs to a certain course. I think there might be easier ways to do this. Any pointers?",

I am writing a custom block for course context, so an alternate idea I had was to get the current courseid, pull all the modules from within the course through some method ( I'm yet to look it up).

However, if the module use other methods, such as skipping the question_usages table entirely, then, yes, as you say, you may need to go through the contextid. Modules may do this in ways very different from the way the quiz does it. So, how many ways are there for a module to use the question_usages and question_attempts tables? I can't speak to the API here, since I don't know how it works, but if I were doing such a report in just SQL, I would first write a separate query for each module to get the results.

Using ra.roleid = 1 looks ok but not other roles. Anyone to points me in the right direction ?",

After after running evaluation process and exporting the training-data  file, we always get the same number of lines in the csv file, regardless of the number of courses/students evaluated. in our case this is 9379 lines , of which 9376 are sample records, divided into 4 ranges that is 2344 samples per range. Our data scientist guy is using the training-data externally in Azure ML framework, in order to evaluate the results. However he is confused of that fact. Can someone elaborate more on the representation of each sample  line in the csv file with relation to the data set used for evaluation? How come this is a fixed number with no correlation to the number of students evaluated? My guess is some kind of a multiplication of indicators with other parameters.

The evaluation process does not actually populate the training data -- evaluation and training are two separate steps. Training prepares the model for use. Evaluation checks the accuracy of a model by breaking up past data into \"training data\" and \"test data\" and uses only the \"training data\" to train the model, then tests its predictions on the \"test data\". Because the evaluation process only uses some of the available data to train the model, its results are not what are used to make ongoing predictions. It sounds like your model has looked at 2344 enrolments to train the model. Does this match how many student records you expected for completed enrolments? If not, have you checked the \"invalid samples\" report to see if there is a problem with your data? For example, if your prior courses don't have start and end dates defined, those courses would not be considered \"valid\" for training the model. Probably we need clearer displays of the status of models (trained, evaluated, data used, etc.) Proposals you might want to view and vote for in the tracker: Best regards, Elizabeth",

The last evaluation task I ran was on a single course with less than 1000 students. Before the task was executed I have cleared all courses from the course table (except for this single course), purged all analytics data from the DB (except for the analytics_models table), and deleted model files from moodledata/model folder. I also purged caches. So this was like a fresh installation run on a single course. Yet I got the same figures in the CSV file, as described above. Anyway, I'm guessing this is not an issue that should concern us too much: It's not really a problem, but rather an internal algorithm setup of which we currently do not understand in full.

If the majority of interaction at your institution happens face-to-face, you may not have enough data to generate very strong predictions. Assignments, quizzes, and manual grade entries can all help, however. At this time it is not possible to allow teachers to choose whether to see predictions in a model. Teachers can be assigned to a role which sees predictions by a site administrator or manager. You may want to consider a pilot to see how well this would work at your institution.",

There should be two entries in the logs for each course activity deletion: one for the original deletion, of which the very last entry in your screenshot is an example: user Course Manager deleted a label with id 74328. Unless such an activity is later restored from the bin back to the course, then the Recycle bin will then delete it one week (by default) later, shown in the other lines. So, if those first two users should not be be in roles to delete course activities , then you can find the original deletion of the item earlier in the logs by filtering on Action=delete and investigate which course is involved and which items were deleted and what roles they have, because the logs indicates that they deleted some activity.

          "Text": "Here’s a question I was asked recently: Is there a learning analytics tool for Moodle that visualize the data from two activities ? e.g. one student has watched a video 3 times and in Assignment he has the grade 5. So there is a relationship between a material and an assigment. so\nI can analyze the data and I give him the appropriate learning unit. Is there any tool for the visualization of two activities. This is an interesting idea.  What would a visualization look like? As an overview, a table showing correlation of views/completion/success could be a good start. If looking at an individual activity, a ranked list of other activities that correlate with success might be useful. Would we want the access to be filtered by recency? Tools like this will be limited by the amount of data they draw on. They won’t be able to make generalizations before students have been active in the course. But this could still be a useful feature. What do others think? Elizabeth",

          "Text": "Hello. I'm hoping that someone has done something like this before and can point me in the right direction. For background, we use a course naming scheme that includes a revision level in the course shortname. For example, the \"grape\" course is the original course. \"grape1\" is the first update, \"grape2\" is the second update, and so on. For our reporting, it doesn't matter which \"grape\" course the student completed, but they must have completed at least one. But if they've completed more than one, I have to report just the latest completion date of all the \"grape\" courses they've completed. I thought I could take advantage of the course naming by using \"grape%\", but I get lost quickly from there. Complicating matters (at least for me) is that we have many \"fruit\" classes that comprise a track of courses that require completion reporting. For example, a rough pseudocode for this reporting would be: If (student has completed any \"apple\" course, get its latest completion date) AND (if student has completed any \"grape\" course, get its latest completion date) AND (if student has completed any \" pear \" course, get its latest completion date) Then (print MAX(course completion dates from each of the \"fruit\" courses)) and output \"Fruit track completed\". Only this one date can be shown on any reports. Any and all suggestions are appreciated, Richard",

Do we risk prejudicing teachers about the potential of students, or even activating stereotype threat in students themselves? I hope we can show the value to learners and teachers of learning analytics, and minimize the possible harm. I’ve argued in the past that if we have data and analysis methods that could help learners, we may have an ethical obligation to pursue that potential. But I think we probably shouldn’t assume that any predictive learning analytics system would be “better than nothing.” Thoughts?",

An example of this would be a predictive model where students are classified in very low grade , low grade, average grade, high grade and very high grade . Until now we were only able to classify students in 2 classes (e.g. pass / fail).

If we want to convince educators to use analytics tools, we need good stories - not graphs. At Meital/IUCEL (the Israeli Inter-University Center for E-learning https://meital.iucc.ac.il/en/home-3-2/ ), we’re organising a symposium on “Learning Analytics: From Theory to Practice”. At this event, we intend to share success stories from institutions around the world, and analyse them to identify common challenges and solutions. The event will be webcast live and recorded, and the outputs will be shared under a CC-BY licence. SO if you’re - Involved in teaching Had a problem Adopted a learning analytics solution The problem was addressed (to an extent, at least..) Please share your story with us! To make is easy, we’ve prepared a template for you story, in google doc ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgJS4vYEv0Iq_GzCfiJxfN8SpA8ZaV-_bhU7qv9-kM8/ ) or presentation ( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZnS7Jl8DQwc0Y8Kl7DIxBK5dPELlrhvp2uTpAUvVH4/copy ) form (whichever you prefer).

Since then, we have had some complaints about the emails that we are sending to our users, particularly from teachers. They are worried that it may be either spam or even a phishing attempt. Here's a screenshot of what they look like (from an email that has been forwarded to us, asking for clarification): Note that the complaint is not about the sender - that has been covered in MDL-65085 - but about the structure and format of the email. It consists solely of links that are not really self-explanatory if you don't know what the email is about. There is no text and, apart from the sender, no hint what site this is referring to. Apart from the report in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365850#p1547041 , has anyone else experienced discussions with users about these emails? How can we improve this? I suppose that there is no administrator setting (or at least I haven't found one). So we would probably need to change the email text in core. What additional information should the email contain to make it more \"believable\"? I'd suggest adding the name of the site a short explanation as to why a user is getting this email short descriptions that explain what the buttons are. Anything else? Comments?",

So if your course has 322 students a minimum of 3220 activity logs between the start and the end of the course are required to consider this course valid for training. The purpose of this checking is to ensure that the courses that are used for training have a minimum of activity. We fixed this minimum at 10 activity logs for user. I would check that: The number of activity logs between the start and the end of the course is more than ~3000 The course start and end date are correctly set The start and end of the student enrolments are correctly set You use quarters or quarters accumulative time-splitting methods (the field is renamed to 'analysis interval' in Moodle 3.8) I added this point because the course duration is 3 months and using tenths as the time-splitting method can be a problem. By the way, the other students at risk targets in Moodle 3.7 do not have this \"Not enough course activity between the start and the end of the course\" restriction.",

          "Text": "Nice reference! The advantage of doing this with standardized testing is that all the questions are clearly tagged for topics and the \"performance\" of each question for the testing population is well understood, so it should be possible to connect the test results with specific lessons. One way they might do this is to match records of students who have completed specific modules in KA to their standardized test subscores for each topic. In Moodle terms , this would be like matching tags on questions (or question categories) to tags on learning activities and resources (possibly using ML to match keyword and other linguistic elements of questions and resources, rather than manually tagging). I am one of the people who believe that high-stakes standardized testing takes up too much time that could be spent on learning, but switching to more frequent assessment that is used formatively (as Khan is suggesting) would be both more helpful to students and more accurate as a way to understand how well students are learning. But the danger of organizing a whole learning program based on any kind of testing subscores is that it can only be as accurate as the test. As I've often written, people have many different priorities in learning, e.g. preparation for scholarship or the workplace or citizenship, etc., but I don't know of anyone who thinks the purpose of school is to prepare students to pass standardized tests. (If that were a real world goal, I'd have a Nobel Prize by now.) The evidence linking standardized test results to real-world outcomes has been pretty weak. Many universities are moving away from using them in admissions, for example, because they are poor predictors of success at university. This is why I try to encourage our learning analytics community to think about how real-world goals can be measured and used to drive learning analytics, rather than just assuming that passing grades or regular attendance/participation are goals in themselves.",

          "Text": "Bonjour Séverin, Thanks for reporting this potential issue. A new analytics model is enabled by default in Moodle 3.7.1, it sends reminders about upcoming activities due to students. To do it, it iterates through the list of users in the site, so the first time the model is executed it can take some good time. After this first execution, the analytics API skips all the users who have already been analysed, they won't be analysed until +1 week (this is the default value for this model). The system has been designed keeping performance in mind. The number of database queries required to complete the task the first time depends on the number of users and the number of activities due for each of these users, but after that the number of queries should be really low (around 50 + the number of users in the site). The \\tool_analytics\\task\\predict_models task shouldn't take that long, the equivalent cost of this task should be less than the cost of having each user in the site viewing their dashboard . Some comments: I am puzzled about the 1h15 required by core\\task\\analytics_cleanup_task. It shouldn't be that long as it is just running a few bunch of db queries. A couple of these queries have IN statements with a large number of params, this is the only possible cause I can think of. In any case, we are changing the \"IN\" approach of core_analytics\\manager::cleanup method (the method executed by core\\task\\analytics_cleanup_task) in MDL-66498 . You could try to pull the patch for 37 and try to execute the task again. I am really interested on this specific case because I have no idea of what can be wrong and I feel like I am missing something important, probably related to mysql /mariadb not handling efficiently a large number of params in an IN. What is the value of your \"analytics | modeltimelimit\"? The purpose of this setting is to split large processes like \\tool_analytics\\task\\predict_models in batches. The default value is 20 minutes. It is possible that the system does not have enough time to go through the list of users in the site and it just processes a few of them, so the next time you run the task more users are processed. It would be great if you could paste the output or to summarise what can you see if you can't (the output may contain users' personal info). To know if the patch in the first point right above reduces the time taken by  core\\task\\analytics_cleanup_task can help us narrow the issue to my sql /mariadb with IN. How many users do you have? Have you enabled any new model after the upgrade? These tasks are not new in 3.7, do you remember if they used to take that long? Is the students at risk model enabled? I ask it because I am assuming that the tasks are slower because of the new model, but it could also be that there is a performance regression after the API changes in 3.7.",

In my installation, i have : 73985 users (97187 in mdl_user, with deleted ones) 3019 courses (2205 visible) the \"analytics | modeltimelimit\" is at the default value : 20 minutes (i've just changed it to try with 2 hours) since some days, the predict_models task doesn't take much time (perhaps since i've disabled upcoming_activities_due model?) the student at risk model course_dropout is disabled with the new academic year coming, we've reset most of the courses, deleting related logs I've not made tests with adding the index or applying the patch, will try to do it when i can. But it's nice to see that tracker items evolve, and perhaps a solution will soon come (thanks everybody working on it). I wonder if i will desactivate related tasks, waiting for tracker items being closed with a solution (and making the update), to avoid charging the server... and perhaps i should take time to better read about analytics, how they work and what they provide, before activating it.

          "Text": "My colleague and I have been discussing this topic and it seems time to bring in the big brains. At our university, we run the same courses every semester with new students (like any university). Of course, there might be some small changes each semester but we try to minimize those. We want to use the data we collect to train models, develop interventions, etc. The question is, which is better. Should we reset the course each semester or should be backup and restore it to a new course? More importantly, why exactly should we do that? I understand reset will remove the user data from the course. The logs will remain but all forum posts, grades, etc. will disappear. That said, I believe the grades will still be connected to the user but not to the course. It seems to be that resetting a course is going to lose data and, being the data-hungry person that I am, I would think it would be best to keep all the data and simply run the subsequent courses as new courses. However, my colleague believes that reset would be cleaner (than restore), and would not impact the LA in any way. I can see his point but the technician in me can only see that at least some data is going to be lost in the reset process. Note, the concerns at this point are only about LA. We are not concerned about the student experience of no longer being able to go back and review their old materials online. While that issue might factor into the final decision, here I really want to focus on the LA issues. I would love to know all the details so we can make a decision on this.",

I am guessing the LA engine is working off the log but does if it depends on a single course in the log, that would say we really need to reset rather than restore as a new instance each semester. This brings up another question. If we reset the course each semester, and we need to make some changes (new versions of slides for students to download , new links to visit, etc.) how can the LA engine see, or rather how can it represent to the consumer of the model's output, what were the atifacts at the time each student used them?",

          "Text": "OK I found a similar question asked before but there weren't any responses. I'm trying to troubleshoot after a member of staff setup the activity completion settings for a quiz wrongly. If the student fails the quiz they are supposed to then gain access to a second remedial quiz, but the completion settings trapped them in a catch-22 logic scenario as the first quiz was only set to complete if they passed (rather than if they passed or used all attempts), and the second quiz was only available if the first quiz was complete and also failed. I can fix the issue easily, but need to unlock the completion settings to change them - which removes the completion status of all other students who attempted the quiz. As it is possible to export the completion results, I'm wondering if it is possible in any way to import the same information back to Moodle after I update the settings? I'm reluctant to manually enter the details for ~150 students, and pity anyone who has the same issue with a bigger cohort. Can anyone point me at a possible way of achieving this? Thanks, Gordon.",

I can force the underscores by inserting &lowbar%%S%% into the query which fixes the display but this then comes through as the html code &lowbar; in the csv output.

I have just upgraded my earlier moodle version to 3.7 to be able to see the details of the new machine learning algorithms, mainly the the way of calculating the values of indicators from the moodle raw data and getting the data for other machine learning softwares. I am a professor of Applied Statistics at a university so I am not a real a moodle expert. (However I run my own moodle as an administrator for my courses.) I set the end dates of all the other courses to remain only one course to be evaluated as a trial. This course was finished in July with 20 students. Many of them are not active students any more  but still valid. I set the minimum requirement in the gradebook and used the PHP model \"Minimum grade to pass the course\". I used 24 indicators mainly using learning activities rather than social ones. In the evaluation process the algoritm always stopped indicating the \"invalid users\". My suspect is that this Analytics can handle only the course data originated in the new 3.7 version and not capable handling courses finished in a previous version. Is that possible?  The reason w hy I think is that I tried to start a brand new course in 3.7 and to produce new course data and in this case moodle reaction was \"not valid sample data to analyze\" and not the \"invalid users\".  May be the log data were not enough (I could produce only 3 fake students data in this trial.) Dear Elizabeth, what do you think? Looking forward to any comments. László",

After some diging around, I find MDL-45151 and MDL-45087 , which I'm hoping are the cause of this - otherwise something is very broken. Between them, those issues seem to mean that most student and grading activity on blind-marked assignments is not available in the logs - so how do I (as an admin) view that activity in an assignment?

The part of '%20%' and '%10%' is there to identify students, I understand there are more accurate ways to do that, also, it cuts out a number of courses from the results, which is not helpful as they should have been there. With regards to what this query is trying to do, it is looking at students activity across all courses, and ideally, should return their views and posts. It should then enable a comparison with a particular course's statistics to see that there is a correlation.  At the moment the course's statistics are much higher than the report. Would that have to do with the report counting the logs differently? Hope I have been clear enough. Generally, the more information that can be gathered about the type of activity the students do the better. In this respect, the 'origin' column looks interesting. Not sure what prompts the CLI in the context of students, but I will look into it further. Gal",

We took all 300+ courses and divided them into groups of about 40, and the server started to return results.

We can not compete with them in terms of features but given Moodle's open source nature it may make more sense to continue pushing our efforts towards free and open sourced solutions.

The data set you import consists of pre-calculated features and a pre-calculated target-- it's not a generic data set like Moodle logs. ;) The functionality they are showing is really not much more than we have in Moodle 3.7, where you can define a new model and select a target and indicators (features) from those available. There are some additional algorithms Azure offers that we don't have yet in Moodle, but we're working on those. (See our Google Summer of Code student projects!) One thing I like, however, is the \"data profile\" view, which shows all the features in your data set with some statistics about each (including a histogram).

If I turn on analytics and try to get the student in risk of dropping out model going using either cli or on the web server, it doesn't seem to be creating the models and I end up with no \"at risk\" output. other info: 1. completion tracking is generally turned off or not set (e.g. course completion tracking is not enabled, nor is any activity/resource completion tracking with just a very few exceptions) 2. I presume I have to get the php analytics going before I try to run the tensorflow analytics.  Is that correct? 3. I have only one year (in progress) - can I even start using analytics or do I need previous completed years? 4. How do I flag to Moodle/Analytics actual student results (from a separate student database).  I have the data, but where does it need to go?  course completion / grade?  somewhere else?

          "Text": "Hi Brian, There are different students at risk models in Moodle 3.7. The model to identify students at risk of dropping out relies on the log table to calculate the target. If you use competencies, course completion or you set a grade to pass in your courses you have alternative models in core for you. However, note that most indicators rely on activity logs as well so I am not sure if those models would be very useful if your site do not have activity logs. Replying to other questions: #2.- The PHP machine learning backend just works, no extra setup required. If you want to use the Python machine learning backend (the one that uses tensorflow) you need to install the python package. One does not depend on the other one. #3.- You need previously completed years to use them as training data, otherwise the ML backend can not generate predictions. In Moodle 3.7 we added the possibility to import a trained model from a different site. At Moodle HQ we aim to provide trained models you can import in your site but we did not have time for it yet. If you have a different site with training data you can export the model from there and import it in your site with no logs. #4.- You need to code a new target in PHP to link with external data sources: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Analytics_API#Target_.28core_analytics.5Clocal.5Ctarget.5Cbase.29 .",

In addition to a variety of analytics type projects we also teach LA within some of our courses. To that end I was wondering if there were specific projects within the Moodle LA working group that could be designed in such a way that they could be final year projects or could be postgraduate research projects. Just an idea that you may want to explore. Kind regards Mark",

My idea is divided in two parts: 1. to conduct\nliterature review in order to explore and evaluate how Learning Analytics has\nbeen used in Higher Education institutes. 2. based on the aforementioned literature review and the identification of\nbenefits and drawbacks of Learning Analytics’ implementation in the context of\nHigher Education, to design a Learning Analytics model and implement it in\na Moodle site (using Moodle's plugins). I would also like to find out if any other similar projects are being carried out by students. Thanks & regards, Panos",

National University of Singapore has created an anonymized \"data lake\" that researchers can apply to work with: http://nus.edu.sg/alset/data-lake.html They also have a synthetic data set generated from their data lake that can be used by anyone, including students. This kind of resource could be very helpful as a learning tool at your institutions. I think there is room for a wide variety of student projects in learning analytics, from technical coding (e.g. implementing a new algorithm in Moodle learning analytics) to the humanities (e.g. conducting qualitative research to study the understanding, attitudes and concerns of students, faculty, and others regarding the use of learning analytics).",

Thanks so kindly in advance, I'm quickly losing all my hair! \n```text\nSELECT\n\n\nu.firstname AS 'Firstname',\n\n\nu.lastname AS 'Lastname',\n\n\nu.email AS 'Email',\n\n\nCONCAT(u.firstname, ' ', u.lastname) AS `Name`,\n\n\nc.shortname AS 'Course',\n\n\nm.name AS Activitytype, \n\n\nCASE \n\n\n    WHEN cm.module = 1 THEN (SELECT a1.name FROM prefix_assign a1            WHERE a1.id = cm.instance)\n\n\n    WHEN cm.module = 2 THEN (SELECT a2.name FROM prefix_assignment a2    WHERE a2.id = cm.instance)\n\n\n    WHEN cm.module = 3 THEN (SELECT a3.name FROM prefix_book a3               WHERE a3.id = cm.instance)\n\n\n    WHEN cm.module = 4 THEN (SELECT a4.name FROM prefix_chat a4                WHERE a4.id = cm.instance)\n```",

For what I understand from your message  IAP_CPT_181 is the ongoing course and IAP_CPT_171 the finished course. In Training results , the message No valid samples available means that IAP_CPT_171 is a valid analysable element but none of the samples available on it are valid. There can be multiple reasons for it In Prediction results , you probably got the Analysable IAP_CPT_181 not used: 0: No new predictions yet message because the model has not been successfully trained. IAP_CPT_171 has been discarded for prediction because it is a past course We basically need to find out why none of the IAP_CPT_171 samples are valid for training.

So here is what i am wanting to achieve For Quality Assurance purposes I am looking for a report on all questions and how many have failed on specific questions.  So for example if Someone completed course A and there were say 20 students that failed the course. We want to be able to identify if the questions are not clear enough and if there is a trend on a particular question, that everyone is failing on specific questions. These questions are actually built into the lesson as opposed to a quiz. (while learning this seems to be the easiest way of doing it all at the moment) Next question is, is there another report that we can provide to our students of what questions they did not get right - without providing the correct answer. Again all this information is within a lesson not a quiz.  I do recognise that these reports would be so much easier through doing quizzes, but i kinda felt we should still be able to pull reports from question pages within a lesson Any help guidance and information would be just fantastic.",

Using short time frames like 8 minutes can be a problem because you may have generated all the activity during the first 2 minutes and the last prediction is the displayed one. If the ML backend is not able to match the activity in the last quarter of the course (the last 2 mins) with the target the predictions will not be good. I would suggest you 'quarters accumulative' time-splitting method as it read all the activity logs from the start of the course. PD: Please, use the python backend for any serious test",

The analytics API was designed with unsupervised learning in mind but extra APIs need to be added to moodle core so that we can provide a framework for people to use. If you are interested in contributing a patch for it or helping in the APIs design feel free to comment about it in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-59044 (it is likely that it will end up being a meta issue, its definition is very ambiguous).",

If you have a data set of previously categorized students, I think this is still an option if you extend the current API to access the algorithm you want to use. The question is, what would it do with the results? Perhaps it could add users to a\nspecific group based on classification, or store the classification in a\nuser profile variable. There are still some unanswered questions about how unsupervised models would be supported, as David points out. With supervised learning, we make predictions at specified time intervals about future outcomes to users with a given permission in the context. How often would an unsupervised model run? I could see this process being triggered by some other event, such as the closing date of the survey you are using for data collection. As David says, please comment at MDL-59044 if anyone has any further suggestions about unsupervised models.",

Can we use the Learning Analytics concept to use predictions to give a learner impulses und recommendations for other courses that may be interesting for him?

Usually a recommendation model is \"unsupervised,\" meaning that it looks for cases similar to the current case and tries to offer choices based on what other cases chose next (e.g. Amazon's \"customers who shopped for this item also viewed...\") It takes a lot more data to develop an unsupervised model. Models like this can be very powerful, because they suggest choices to users (learners) that might not seem obvious, but have unexpected high value. On the other hand, if your content is tagged, you can use a much simpler feature to simply recommend other content with similar tags. This would be more like an automatic similarity search, showing the top few results that most closely match the content the learner has already completed. Is this what you have in mind? Elizabeth",

          "Text": "At Moodle we use sophisticated software algorithms to help predict outcomes and reveal hidden aspects of a learner’s process. This information can then be used by Moodle users to improve how they teach and learn. Our Learning Analytics ( available with Moodle 3.4 and above ) uses historical data and current behavior to predict student dropout risk, based on the research-supported Community of Inquiry theoretical framework-- and to change these outcomes for the better. Also, its API allows anyone to build additional models to suit their unique needs. Learning analytics is an effective tool to empower educators, but it can be challenging to understand and implement, which is why we have introduced a new Workshop Series in Moodle’s Learning Analytics Working Group (LAWG). This free workshop series is designed to teach you how to extend the analytics capabilities of Moodle users in two ways: For educators and researchers, learn how to design new models for specific educational purposes, and specify them so they can be developed to match those purposes. Developers, learn how to implement new models by extending the API. In addition to being completely free, LAWG and the Workshop Series are always open, ensuring that anyone can join at their own pace. As well as improving their skills, successful LAWG Workshop participants will have the opportunity to evaluate assignments and award badges using our peer-review process. This online workshop series builds on the very successful Moot workshops we’ve offered in the past. It opens up opportunities for educators, researchers, and developers to participate, no matter where they are. We’re very excited to be able to open these resources up to the whole Moodle Learning Analytics community. What are you waiting for? Join our free working group to improve your Learning Analytics skills. Thanks for your participation! Elizabeth Dalton Research Analyst, Moodle HQ",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I have been curious about the possible visual interface or GUI for Learning Analytics in Moodle. It has led me to make a (very incomplete) \"state of the art\" about data visualization. I am a relatively frequent user of Google Analytics, and while the versatiliy is impressive, time and again I find it clunky and unintuitive. I find myself poking around, often randomly, before I find the visualization I'm looking for (if it's available at all). So other than that, the following is a \"first-look\" list of alternatives. I intend to dive deep into the most interesting ones that let me access for free. I tried to keep them specific to data visualization, but I found quite an overlap with BI (Business Intelligence) products. I guess the problem of analytics originally for business purposes being tricky to translate to learning still applies in GUIs. I also don't know if there are \"wireframing\" tools specifically for data visualization interfaces. Maybe a future task. For now, here's my list: Canva Chart.js Chartio D3.js DataHero Domo Dygraphs Flot FusionCharts Google Charts HighCharts IBM Watson Analytics InfoVis JpGraph jqPlot Microsoft Power BI NodeBox Plot.ly Processing Raw Graphs Salesforce Einstein Analytics SAP Analytics Cloud Sisense Square Crossfilter Tableau Tangle Visual.ly ZingChart Zoho Reports I also have to say that it is interesting how few of these alternatives are open source. FOSS is often superior to commercial products, but it seems that GUI is the constant exception. Best regards, Cristian T. Duque cris tia n@moodlenews.com",

They help in situations where there is not yet enough understanding to build a predictive model, and rely on human interpretation to notice \"unusual\" data elements. But they can also be used to provide context to a prediction or a detection process. R and Shiny depend on Python, which is one reason they haven't been considered for integration with Moodle core-- we don't like to add dependencies to Core features. I wonder if a Shiny visualization plugin for Moodle would be of interest?",

Most sites have one or the other, but it is possible to have data in both, especially if you have upgraded a site from before 2.7. In your query, do you want the name of the activity (e.g. \"Statistical Reasoning Lesson 5\") or the activity type (e.g. \"Lesson\")? Activity names are in the mdl_course_modules table. Activity types are referenced by number in the mdl_course_modules table, and you need to join to mdl_modules to get them. This query that you are using creates a separate column for each week of the course. If you don't care about counting actions per week, and you want a list of activities per user with timestamps, you can use a much simpler query, something like: \n```text\nselect \n\n\nu.fullname AS student,\n\n\nl.component AS activity , \n\n\n\nl.timecreated\n\n\n FROM mdl_user AS u\n\n\n\nJOIN mdl_role_assignments AS ra ON u.id = ra.userid\n \n\n\nJOIN mdl_context AS ctx ON ra.contextid = ctx.id\n\n\n\nJOIN mdl_course AS c ON c.id = ctx.instanceid\n\n\n\nLEFT JOIN mdl_logstore_standard_log AS l ON l.userid = u.id AND l.courseid = c.id  AND l.crud IN ('c','u')\n\n\n\nGROUP BY l.userid, l.component\n\n\n\nORDER BY l.userid\n```\n Do you have multiple courses? This query would get the activities from all courses on your site. You might want to filter by l.courseid. You might also want to filter by role, e.g. to get only students you would limit to ra.roleid = 5.",

          "Text": "It appears that you're still stuck on this notion that you can avoid including the teacher or faculty in the learning process. You've posted the bastardized definition of 'blended' learning and mashed it into a definition of 'hybrid' learning without making any distinction. It seems that you're using the definition popularized by Michael Horn. I'll point you to this blog post of mine that introduces Michael Horn to Blended Learning. The term 'blended' appeared only twice in the first issue of their book and in both instances it was not used in a substantive discussion about blended learning as a model of teaching and learning. Of course, they added a discussion about it in later editions, after the post above. They then went on to drastically damage the very useful construct of Blended Learning that Randy Garrison and Norm Vaughan so thoroughly described in their 2008 seminal book. It's a shame that Horn didn't use more of that work when he went nuts and created his Blended framework, but, as I've said on many occasions, Horn is not a teacher; he's a business guy. For a more nuanced discussion of blended and hybrid take a look at the paper for which we received a Best Paper award at the 2014 HLC Conference.  I'm not suggesting the convolution of the terms, blended and hybrid, is going to go away anytime soon, but either term requires more than you've given in your definition. The general thread of Project Inspire seems to be to avoid having teachers or faculty assess student work against a set of standards, criteria, competencies, or outcomes and then aggregate and report the assessments in very descriptive or even prescriptive ways. It seems that you'd rather use something other than teacher or peer assessment to do the assessing or analyzing of student learning. Analyzing actions or behaviors that are associated with student learning is not the same thing as analyzing actual student learning. Teachers or faculty actively involved in the learning whether it be face to face, online, blended or hybrid (and those can and should be seen as different processes) is necessary. Let's talk about that.",

First, we allow site administrators and teachers of individual courses (if allowed by the site admins) to specify what the definition of \"student success\" in the course is. The models we are supporting first allow choices of course completion (as defined in Moodle), final grade above passing, or completion of all competencies defined in the course. We will be able to easily support other measures of success going forward, but these seem good places to start. \"Course completion\" could potentially be automated, but also could be dependent on instructors manually setting completion criteria. Similarly, I suppose grades could be based entirely on automated assessments (shudder) but hopefully they will be given as a result of thoughtful assessment by teachers (and ideally, in conversation with students). Finally, competencies, like grades, can be tied to automated systems, but ideally would not be. What we are doing with Project Inspire is trying to find and make visible patterns of learner behavior, instructor behavior, and even course design that will lead to these desirable forms of success, and provide advice and encouragement to help learners be successful according to these definitions.

Trying to keep terms like 'blended' and 'hybrid' relatively generic is one of the problems I see with the something entitled 'Project Inspire.' (Isn't that what Jim Jones called his project that led to masses of people drinking poisonous Kool-Aid?) 'Relative' and 'generic' in the same sentence with assessment of learning or analyzing learning suggests crowding out the teacher or peers in assessment of learning. Saying that you've heard those terms in many ways especially in different countries makes your use of those terms even less reassuring. Those terms have been popularized in the U.S., at least, by those who are trying to replace teachers with software and machines. There are also people, like me, using those terms who are not trying to replace teachers with software or machines. Making a point of what exactly is meant by 'blended' or 'hybrid' has become a necessity in any informed discussion of either. You say \"What we are doing with Project Inspire is trying to find and make visible patterns of learner behavior, instructor behavior, and even course design that will lead to these desirable forms of success, and provide advice and encouragement to help learners be successful according to these definitions.\" You're not looking at actual evidence of student learning that has been assessed and commented on by a teacher or a learner's peer. You're doing a lot of stuff to avoid actually do that. In the meantime, the competency frameworks features of Moodle need huge amounts of work to make reporting on student work that is aligned to competencies easily usable by teachers and faculty. It is not yet fully functioning. When that is working and widely implemented, the 'need' for what you're trying to with Project Inspire can be examined in a much more informed way. Another other email I got in my inbox this morning was an invitation from Intelliboard to participate in a focus group about what is needed to make reporting on competencies actually something that teachers can use. Of course, Intelliboard will be requiring a license fee to use the results of their focus groups and development. Also, in the meantime, I'm hearing about more and more K12 districts installing Canvas. I'm not hearing about new installations of Moodle. That makes me sad.

I still need to create docs pages for the machine learning backends included in moodle core as a summary at the moment they only support supervised learning and only binary classification: The PHP backend is quite simple. It is using logistic regression. The Python one is using a feed-forward neural network with 1 single hidden layer.

About the models: I personally like random forests and/or xgboost and/or support vector machines better than neural networks, but of course, they are also capable of doing the job. I see the biggest difficulties in the fact, that modeling is still an art, in my opinion, which means that a person who knows what they are doing has to make all the choices (model, indicators, training samples, prediction samples, maybe training different models for different situations, etc.), otherwise the results will be by far not as good as they could be. Is there anything included around data cleaning? In my experience people do not always use moodle as they should. For example course start and end dates: If people re-use courses by just removing all enrolled students and enrolling new students, they sometimes do not adjust start and end date. And of course, the model training is only possible, if the moodle logs are not being deleted too often.",

          "Text": "Thanks for replying Vera. You nailed it with the challenges we have We selected neural nets over other techniques as the default technique because they scale nicely and do not require all previous training data to be stored to be able to predict (we store the model state after training and we restore it back for both training and prediction). For PHP neural nets were the natural choice as well, but the PHP implementation was too slow to be used in production so we use the logistic regression one; it does not abstract that well (5-10% less accuracy) but it is acceptable as a start. Machine learning in PHP is not very popular ;) The whole system aims to provide a default and simple base that scales properly and works well (not optimally obviously) for most supervised learning models; this base can be extended by advanced users to get optimal solutions; some examples of issues that will push the system towards this objective are https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-61006 and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-60520 . The limitation we have is that we still require people to \"code\". The target (label) needs to be coded in PHP. I have some ideas about how we could offer a list of elements to predict (a really simple format for Moodle components to expose targets from their database structure) but we need to see how practical would it be to create models based on these targets. We need to investigate this further, we have other issues we should fix before moving to this next stage. Regarding data cleaning; it is a challenge and Moodle not having a standard way to rollover courses makes it harder. The best solution we could find for this is that each model defines its own conditions to accept analysable elements (e.g. courses). In 'Students at risk of dropping out' model courses are used for training straight after the end date is reached and we skip student enrolments which enrolment start and end dates do not make sense when comparing them with the course start and end. This affects both training and prediction, so courses with wrong start and end dates will not receive predictions. Sites with deleted logs do not help either, agree; I'm afraid we can't do much about it; those courses are also discarded. We provide a report for admins where we list all potentially analysable elements in the system that can not be used for training or prediction; this report includes the reason why they can not be used so, ideally, a Moodle site admin that notices that their courses do not get predictions because their course start and end dates are not set would fix the situation at some point.",

          "Text": "> We selected neural nets over other techniques as the default\ntechnique because they scale nicely and do not require all previous\ntraining data to be stored to be able to predict (we store the model\nstate after training and we restore it back for both training and\nprediction). For PHP neural nets were the natural choice as well, but\nthe PHP implementation was too slow to be used in production so we use\nthe logistic regression one; it does not abstract that well (5-10% less\naccuracy) but it is acceptable as a start. Machine learning in PHP is\nnot very popular ;) Random forest or xgboost models do also scale and you could create a pre-trained model. About the programming language: For statistical implementations I prefer R, because you can find packages for everything, but maybe it complicates things more to require people to install R. > The whole system aims to provide a default and\nsimple base that scales properly and works well (not optimally\nobviously) for most supervised learning models; this base can be\nextended by advanced users to get optimal solutions; some examples of\nissues that will push the system towards this objective are https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-61006 and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-60520 .\nThe limitation we have is that we still require people to \"code\". The\ntarget (label) needs to be coded in PHP. I have some ideas about how we\ncould offer a list of elements to predict (a really simple format for\nMoodle components to expose targets from their database structure) but we need to see how practical would it be to create\nmodels based on these targets. We need to investigate this further, we\nhave other issues we should fix before moving to this next stage. Do I understand correctly that you aim to create basic models which can be used without further training for users who do not have enough knowledge about modeling? If yes, I have some doubts. In my experience people use moodle in very different ways, and a \"general average\" model would be far less than optimal. But then again, it depends on the individual expectations what is considered to be good enough... > Regarding\ndata cleaning; it is a challenge and Moodle not having a standard way\nto rollover courses makes it harder. The best solution we could find for\nthis is that each model defines its own conditions to accept analysable\nelements (e.g. courses). In 'Students at risk of dropping out' model\ncourses are used for training straight after the end date is reached and\nwe skip student enrolments which enrolment start and end dates do not\nmake sense when comparing them with the course start and end. This\naffects both training and prediction, so courses with wrong start and\nend dates will not receive predictions. Sites with deleted logs do not\nhelp either, agree; I'm afraid we can't do much about it; those courses\nare also discarded. We provide a report for admins where we list all\npotentially analysable elements in the system that can not be used for\ntraining or prediction; this report includes the reason why they can not\nbe used so, ideally, a Moodle site admin that notices that their\ncourses do not get predictions because their course start and end dates\nare not set would fix the situation at some point. I like that idea of telling people \"If you want to get a prediction, bring your data in shape\". Because all attempts to guess what the clean data should/could look like have their limitations.",

          "Text": "Hi Vera, I'm also a big fan of R. I tend to prefer regression modeling myself, because even though the predictions are less precise, they are more interpretable. There is a trade-off between highly specific analysis techniques and interpretability, and we want to be able to offer guidance to teachers and students at some point based on these predictions. (To paraphrase Mark McKay, we are only interested in predicting the future in order to change it.) I also agree on the difficulty of constructing \"generic\" models. We are actually starting with models that have some fairly defined expectations, such as a definition of \"student success,\" and we make those assumptions clear in each model. As we develop more models (or models are contributed by the community), we hope these assumptions will continue to be made clear and will help guide Moodlers in choosing appropriate models for their circumstances. We are working on some ways to evaluate contexts of Moodle systems and courses to help adjust models to different common usages of Moodle, or to help administrators select the most appropriate models. There is no way to automatically clean all the data, as you have noted, but we can look for indicators that data has problems, and we can flag those situations to the site administrators. This will hopefully help make people more aware of how they can improve their data quality. We are also thinking about tools that can help make maintaining good data quality easier, e.g. course rollover tools that would reset course start and end dates appropriately.",

I am not familiar with xgboost; the library description seems interesting. I will read about it, thanks. Regarding Do I understand correctly that you aim to create basic models which can be used without further training for users who do not have enough knowledge about modeling? We aim to yes, but we can not do it yet for the exact reason you mention. Moodle 3.4 requires people to train their sites with their own data and we will not be able to include pre-trained models until we (Moodle HQ): Get enough anonymised datasets from the community (I would encourage everybody to participate https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=17233&section=3 ) The datasets are diverse enough to cover most uses of Moodle e.g. workplace, unis, K-12, 100% online courses, partly-online courses, MOOCs, courses that are compulsory to get a degree, courses containing required activities, courses that are just a support for tradicional in-site courses... I am aware that this statement is very ambiguous, we can refine it once we are done with #1 We restore these datasets (moodle database . sql files), analyse them, evaluate our current models (indicators + target) performance and add extra context indicators when we see that the performance is far from the baseline (the baseline performance could be the performance of a structured site using completion, strict dates...) This is the key for having a single model that can generalise to any site. We are already including extra features with per-course averages to all indicators with linear values; we may need to expand this to percentiles, each sample std deviation from the mean... Setup an ensemble of all sites trained models and expand machine learning backend APIs so they can accept initial weights that will be completed by each site training data This is not carved in stone in any roadmap, it is just what sounds reasonable and what I think can lead to models that can generalise well in any site; I would not vote for releasing Moodle with pre-trained models until we know that they generalise well enough; what well enough means depends on the model.

Random forests are quite \"easy\" in terms of modeling. You can (almost) throw in as many independent variables as you want without having to face serious problems like in linear regression where variables must not have a high correlation. If you do cross-validation in the training (splitting your data in several subsets and use one set for training and the others for validation and then changing the training set, etc.) overfitting should not be an issue. The R xgboost package is just more robust to use, because it has a better handling of missing values, and models are smaller in file size and training is faster. I am very curious about the results of analyzing submitted data sets and creating models for different situations of moodle use. I have to say that I am working for a commercial company selling software for risk prediction in moodle, i.e. exactly the same goals as Project Inspire. My interest is of course to understand how other software works, and my manager is OK with me sharing openly our concepts and insights, etc. I do not think that there needs to be competition between open source software and commercial software (actually I am a big fan of the open source idea), because the crucial point here is the modeling. Our clients pay us to do it for them with their data, evaluate the model after the term has finished, etc. And with open source software they have to pay their own person spending quite some time doing (and first understanding) the modeling. I cannot submit any data (because it is the clients' data). I can only share the experience that we were initially hoping that after some initial clients we would also kind of \"converge\" to a general model, but all the clients used moodle in different ways which made it necessary to make individual adjustments, up to refusing to create a model, if the client did not use the gradebook \"properly\" (if they did not have a minimum number of graded items in moodle), or if in hybrid courses the online part is just too low. But of course, the beauty of open source is, that a lot more people can contribute, and if a much higher number of people submit their data, it may still be possible to create satisfying general models.",

          "Text": "Some months ago I setup a new model to test that the API is able to work at different context levels, it was about detection of late assignment submissions on specific assignment activities; it is nothing serious but allowed me to see how models generalize to different sites. It is easier to play with this model than with prevention of students at risk because in this case the label is clearly defined and easily calculated; the classes are well balanced which also helps. Despite I used 2 datasets and the courses they contain are not very well structured nor very clean, despite some indicators are partly coupled to the label and despite most assignments are submitted the day before the due date (or the same day hehehe) the model is able to predict late assignment submissions 2 and 4 days before the due date with around an 75-80% accuracy using test data from the same site (not used for training obviously) and around a 70-75% using another site as test data. Only 1 site data was used to train the model; the difference between these 2 accuracies should decrease as we train using new sites datasets although unseen sites accuracy will likely be always lower. The student indicators this model uses are: How close to the due date the student submitted other assignments (also considers if he didn't submit at all) Same for quizzes and their time close dates Same for choice activities and their time close dates Weighted number of write actions on the analysed activity Weighted number of read actions on the analysed activity The key to make this model generalise well to other sites seemed to be to use extra indicators to add context to the student indicators: Is activity completion enabled for that activity? How much weight does the activity have in the gradebook? Is grade to pass set for that activity? As I said above this is just an example and adding more context indicators should help this model generalise even further. This is not part of the current HQ priorities. This model is available in https://github.com/dmonllao/moodle-local_testanalytics/tree/late-assign-submissions (late-assign-submissions branch). Again, this is nothing serious so don't expect much documentation but you should be able to install the plugin and evaluate this late assignments submissions model using your site data without any problem. If you are interested in playing with this model and given that you are a data scientist I would recommend you to evaluate the model using a few of your client sites (using --timesplitting='\\local_testanalytics\\analytics\\time_splitting\\close_to_deadline') and, instead of using the predictions processor that is included in moodle, download the resulting .csv files (you can use https://gist.github.com/dmonllao/d1db52b11c9ca00e76ab8ddcb95c6c93 for it) This way you can use your own algorithms to compare how well the model generalises. I got the results presented above using neural nets with adam optimization, dropout regularization, tanh activation and a decaying learning rate from a generous 0.5 to 0.005. You can reproduce them with https://github.com/dmonllao/tensorflow-performance-playground (all options documented in python train.py --help, only a subset of them in README.md) the results will always depend on the datasets you use but given that the datasets I used were significantly different I wouldn't expect much differences between using unseen test data from one of the training datasets vs using test data from a completely different site.",

          "Text": "All, This post is the summary of some conversations arising from other threads ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=366393 ) about administrative configuration abilities we would like to see in Analytics. This is a long post, so sorry in advance because I feel I need to explain why these are needed. Also, typos are free. I have worked with Inspire and Analytics in 3.3 and 3.4 now on three sites with three different clients. This experience leads me to respectfully disagree with the approach that just leaving models off by default is sufficient. I think these tools need to have at the least the configurable controls most other admin tools have. My reasoning is that Analytics should have more safeguards and configurability because it is: a) A tool that can and will be deployed in situations with significant policy, regulatory and/or legal requirements, and those situations are rapidly changing and uncertain in many places. b) A tool that can have a high performance impact on the site and server and should have at least the control level of similar tools like Statistics, Auto backups, Scheduled tasks, etc. The Precedent for Disabling Tools in Moodle Severin’s suggestion that there should be a config setting in the config.php file to enable/disable Analytics is a good one, and brings up an important parallel from a similar issue in Moodle history: the config setting in the config.php to disable installing plugins. That very important tool exists because there are many cases where Moodle administrators are not knowledgeable enough to manage the installation of plugins, especially when something goes wrong. Almost every Moodle Partner I have ever worked with uses this setting to block the carte blanche installation of plugins by local administrators, and instead has a safer, vetted method where only approved plugins can be installed. Installing a plugin without knowing what you are doing can lead to a technical mess, but enabling Analytics without knowing what you are doing can lead to a legal mess: violating terms of service, privacy policies, industry or government regulations, contractual agreements, and/or the law, or bring on severe performance issues unexpectedly. Proposed Features So, I propose / request the following features: 1) Master switch There should be a master switch in Advanced features to enable/disable, set off by default. All menus and tools for it will be invisible until this is turned on by the admin. This is the standard for advanced tools. It should act like Statistics or Blogs or Badges: invisible in the main site admin menus until enabled. 2) Config.php Settings Lock If there were a master switch then there would be a config setting so that it can be disabled and locked in the config.php. This is described in section 8 of the config-dist.php file. This is Séverin's suggestion and I am glad to see someone of his experience think the same thing I do. Locking admin settings this way is the standard method to lock ANY and ALL admin settings. But without a master switch setting, Analytics cannot be turned off (or on) and locked and protected. Its settings can, but not Analytics itself. There is a good reason this has been standard method for years of locking settings. It makes it easy to prevent issues in a standard way by locking key settings from accidental change. Consider the interesting fact that Moodlecloud has no Analytics on its admin menu -- why not?? Because they have a dedicated expert who did some custom coding somewhere to make this happen. Few Moodle sites will have that expertise and even if they do why should they have to maintain custom work to do this. There's already a standard way to do this for admin tools, it just needs to be implemented. So items 1 and 2 go together. If you do the master switch as a proper setting, then the config setting locking will follow. 3) Logging I don’t see anything in my logs when I enabled / disable a model. If a local admin did change such settings, I would not have any evidence they did so. That is crucial when there are multiple models which have very different implications when enabled (see 4 below). If a model that violates policies or the law were enabled, there would be no evidence of it in the logs right now that is had been, who did it, or when they did it. 4) Remove a specific model There should be a way to remove a specific model, not just the predictions data, but the whole model itself. I saw an earlier post from David about how this was considered but not implemented, but I think it should be implemented. It is very important and this is why: Policy or legal compliance will usually depend on what each model does: One model may violate policies, regulations or laws and therefore must never be enabled or used, and it should be removed from the system altogether. But there may be other models that have no such issues and you want it be able to run them. So, I argue that removing a model and disabling a model are not equivalent.  Disabling but allowing it to be enabled will not prevent accidents or mistaken enablements and any possible server performance issues or policies violations. This is a matter of \"defensive driving\": assuming something will go wrong and creating conditions to prevent that is better than assuming people don't make mistakes. If a model is removed, the potential to enable it is removed. Also, if a model is removed, it should not be reinstalled by an upgrade. 5) Confirmation message to enable/disable a model I think there should be a confirmation message for models when enabling or disabling them. This confirmation message string could then be customized in the language pack to give an appropriate warning or reminder to the person changing the setting. I would put this on all my sites, even for myself to remind me what I am about to do. And some admins turn things on because they are curious and leave them on. Without a confirmation message, they may not understand the implications of what they are turning on or off. This is just good \"defensive driving\" once again. 6) Uninstallable In Moodle 3.3 the Inspire plugin could be completely removed. You were able to uninstall the Inspire tool from the 'Manage admin tools' screen and it would remove everything: admin tools, predictors, and the entry in Reports where the models were, menus, everything. In 3.4 this is quite different. I discussed this issue elsewhere in a reply to David ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=366393#p1482719 ) about how the plugins work and won't belabor the issue here. But I will say one real advantage to having this be a additional plugin the way it was in 3.3 is that it conforms to how Moodle Partners let sites install plugins, as I mentioned before. Most Moodle Partners have their own tools to allow clients to install and manage additional plugins. Having this as an additional plugin would allow them the ability to use those tools for this as is, instead of having custom code a workaround to hide Analytics, like Moodlecloud had to. That's a Wrap That's it for now. Sorry this is so long but wanted to get all the items together in a one place. Feedback would be great of course, and I am happy to put in all the Trackers you want on any or part of this after discussion. Randy",

It will make a very good base to create a tracker item, after discussion. I think points 4 and 6 will be difficult (impossible ?) due to Moodle's architecture. If it's files belonging to Moodle distribution, they will be reinstalled next time you update. Hence the need for a global setting (and ability to force it in config.php file), to ensure it won't be usable/enable. Or when you make an update, you have to carefully check you delete specific folders to prevent the reinstallation. Séverin",

I agree with what you say about number 6 and while clearly it can be done because it used to work that way, I doubt it will be reverted now the API is in core. And you are right that having the master switch and config setting basically will solve the problem of disabling that from admins without server access. And really having the API in core is not an issue as long as we can control what tools might use it. As for number 4, the ability to remove specific models, I think this brings up the issue of the architecture of models, which is unclear to me. David, How do the models work? They are very interesting structures because they are not exactly data, not exactly pluggable. They are rather like\nreports but clearly different. From what I argue in #4 that we need to ability to remove them individually. Right now, to prevent even one model from being enabled, I have to uninstall tool_analytics which removes all the models not just some. Clearly one day others than HQ will create models and we would obviously need to install and remove those if we needed. How do you see that working? Thanks Randy",

          "Text": "Here's a possible alternative to item 4, removal of models, and would provide a way to lock out the enabling / disabling of models. Basically, I propose a setting that would work the way the cron remote password setting works in Site policies. 1) Add a setting in the Analytics > Settings > called \"Password to enable or disable models\". As this would be a proper setting, this password can be also set in the config.php and locked. 2) Add logic on the Action menu for models so that choosing the enable / disable option must check for this setting and, if set, asks for and verifies the password before continuing. This would provide three levels of access / protection: - If you don't care about\npreventing people from enabling or disabling models at will, then just\nleave the setting blank, which would be the\ndefault. (Same as the cron remote password.) - A careful admin will set this so all admins must\nprovide the password. Since it can be looked up or changed or removed on the\nsettings screen its purpose is to protect admins from accidentally or casually enabling / disabling. (Same as setting the cron remote password now.) - A site may lock this in the config.php so that any admin must provide the password set there and admins without server access can not see it or change it. This is very safe. (Same as locking the cron remote password in the config.php now.) This seems to me to be a good interim solution until the ability to properly uninstall / install models themselves comes along one day. And maybe even then. Good idea? Randy",

          "Text": "Hi Randy, I've just lost my detailed reply so I will synthesize it. Inspire plugin architecture was wrong, look at this https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-tool_inspire/tree/master/classes/local/indicator we were ok with it as it was just a way to gather feedback before integrating the analytics API in core. I understand that your client does not care about architecture but we do because we build Moodle as a platform so people can reuse stuff and extend it for their needs. We can not do that from a plugin scope. The fact that we initially released the inspire plugin may make this more confusing for early adopters but it is really simple. Think of the analytics API as the task API. Being auth_ldap\\task\\sync_users the same than mod_assign\\task\\late_submissions and models like something moodle components specify in a $models array in db/analytics.php (see MDL-61667 ). We don't have a disable Task API setting because people can disable the tasks they don't want to use. Analytics follow the same approach, you just need to disable the models you don't want to use. For what I understand your client problems are related with a system that notifies teachers about students at risk, the analytics API is just a machine learning based API that executes whatever models other moodle components want, so the real issue are the models, not the API and that is why the controversial models are disabled by default. By the way, note that the 2 reasons you provided to ask for more safeguards are the 2 same reasons I commented about in my first reply https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=366393#p1481650 That is what we did and that is something HQ integration team should guarantee we keep doing. About your proposals: 1 & 2: I haven't gone one by one through the whole list, but for what it seems \"Site admin > Advanced features\" enablexxxx settings allow us to enable / disable subsystems. If you look at analytics subsystem ( https://github.com/moodle/moodle/tree/master/analytics and https://github.com/moodle/moodle/tree/master/analytics/classes analytics) you will see that it is just an API, that is intentional because tool_analytics is the one doing everything so my initial thought is that the global disable setting should target tool_analytics because I am not that sure that we can disable APIs. As I said in a previous message, feel free to open an issue. 3: Feel free to open an issue, code contributions are welcomed 4: Sorry, but IMO we should never add a feature \"just in case there is a bug\". If there is a bug (please, find it) we should focus our efforts in fixing it instead of in adding extra features just in case there is a bug. We should have enough with clear the predictions + disable the model. In any case this is just my opinion, feel always free to open as many issues as you want. 5: Feel free to open an issue, code contributions are welcomed 6: I already commented about this",

The main points I think are worth considering 1 & 2, the ability to disable from the Moodle config.php file and associated control on the Advanced Features page. The nearest analogy I can think of is \"Enable statistics.\" There is a possible load issue the Learning Analytics system could impose on the server, though again this only occurs if models are actually enabled. I don't think the comparison to plugins is accurate, and I think the ability for a partner to disable analytics would be completely different from the ability of a partner to disable the addition of third-party plugins. Adding plugins potentially destabilizes a system because the new code potentially has not been tested with Core and the current plugins in use. The Learning Analytics system is part of Core and is tested along with other Core features. As I understand from your previous posts in other threads, you have encountered a contractual issue possibly related to the commercial value of analytics data to your client and/or a content provider. I don't mean to dismiss the seriousness of your client's concerns, but this seems to be an issue few Moodle users would encounter, as you acknowledged in your earlier post. I think we would need to hear from many more site administrators before proceeding beyond items 1 and 2 of your suggested actions.",

So: The perfect example for this is already right in the Analytics settings: the ability to prevent manual running of a model with the Command line 'onlycli' setting. When enabled, the Get predictions menu option can't be used. But you can go back and simply uncheck the setting and run it. That's\na good setting which is designed to protect admins from the ad-hoc\nrunning of the models which may impact the server. I can lock this in the config.php too. I would like the same setting protection for Enable/disable on the model Action\nmenu. This can be just a standard check box like onlycli is. I had proposed the\npassword system in my earlier post such as cron remote uses but a standard checkbox setting would be sufficient, like \"Allow\ndisable or enabling of models.\" I don't see why this is \"unreasonable\" or \"not feasible\" at all as it is how the Command line onlycli setting works already. If that logic could be extended to cover disable/enable as well then it offers many benefits to many more sites and has no downside. Right now, I can prevent an admin from changing things like what day of the week calendars start on, or whether a theme background repeats, or if forum digests can be used. It's standard for hundreds and hundreds of settings. I would like the same ability with model enable/disable. Randy",

The model enable/disable options don't have a site-wide setting like this to be changed. I'm not saying it can't be done. If an option to disable learning analytics (i.e. the tool, not the API) is created in \"Advanced Features\" and can be locked from the config.php file, I think the whole question is moot, isn't it? No one could then access the page to enable or disable models. This ought to meet the needs of anyone choosing to use a different learning analytics solution (e.g. via an external LRS), as well as anyone who doesn't want to run any models for performance or other reasons.",

          "Text": "Elizabeth, Hm, interesting. I am thinking through that second part.... For the first part, right, onlycli is a great setting. I was comparing onlycli to my proposed setting because: 1) Its purpose is to prevent a problem if you use the web interface. Casually enabling or disabling models is an interface problem too and can have a similar solution; 2) the basic code for this proposed solution exists already in onlycli: if a Setting is set or not, then hide or show the corresponding tool on the model Action menu. So your way to solve this type of settings problem already works well; and 3) because it is a setting, I can also control that using the standard config to lock it to prevent interface level changes if required So, when you say \"model enable/disable options don't have a site-wide setting like this to be changed.\" that is true and that is what I am proposing to be created. The second part --- That's a really interesting idea. I needed to work that one over I think for one situation you are correct: for a site that wants to disable Analytics and keep it disabled - such as for the alternate analytics method. You only need the master switch there. Turn it off and lock it off. (Aside: I had not thought about the possibility of an alternative analytics engine, but that's a good reason for the master switch. I do remember a site I worked on where we did a similar thing with logging: an external custom logging app was built and we locked Moodle logging settings so admins could not change them.) But -- for the case where you want to always have Analytics on, I think the setting to enable/disable model is needed in addition to the master switch because you don't want models to be casually changed. What it really boils down to is managing change control. For example, hypothetically (but I bet it happens) under GDPR a company declares only the DPO can approve models being on or off. So, you would turn models on or off as instructed and then use this new setting to lock them. If the DPO approves new models or a change in model status, you unlock the config, make the change, then relock the config. That's the sort of scenario I am thinking of. Maybe it's the CIO or head of IT or some University student policy committee. Maybe there are auditing rules or accreditation considerations or network security standards or server performance resource policies, etc, and so being able to casually change - and then forget - a model is on or off could have bad consequences. Right now there's no change control mechanism to prevent casual enabling/disabling models and no audit trail. This new proposed model enable/disable setting would help with both those things. -- Btw , I deeply appreciate you and David talking the time to work through this with me. I know you both have a lot of other things on the plate. I've worked on hundreds of sites from a really wide range of users and configurations, schools, businesses and countries. So, I am thinking of how to make the basics of Analytics work for as many of those scenarios as I can so it can widely used safely.",

But that also meant locking the session level themes to prevent admins from getting to the menu in another theme. And that's useful troubleshooting tool. Management did not think that was strong enough. They really wanted uninstall. Now, for sites where the having the menus still there is okay, then locking the scheduled tasks to off which is a lot better than uninstalling the core plugin if your goal is just to stop processing. Absolutely. So that may be a really good solution for some sites. You prevent processing and everyone just needs to know all the menus and models don't work. But that's not very clean. Maybe a better workaround would be to combine both: disable processing in scheduled tasks and lock them, then hide the menus in css and lock that. Still not pretty. There's holes in it, but it would be better than each by itself. I will have to try that combination out.",

Menus will gone until the next update of that file, which will probably not be until the next major release given the file just builds the top level of the admin menu. It will throw some debug messages at you complaining about the parent menu. So, a cleaner solution is not comment it out but to point it at a non-existent config setting which therefore returns nothing and so acts properly: \n```text\n$ADMIN->add('root', new admin_category('analytics', new lang_string('analytics', 'analytics'), empty($CFG->enableanalytics)));\n```\n Where there's no such thing as 'enableanalytics'. It's not a great solution, it might break, but it is better than nothing. Obviously, It would be far better if this were an interface setting so it could be turned off properly like badges are.

Do we need more granularity in permissions and capabilities to make this practical? Thank you for your thoughtful reflection on these issues, as well.

          "Text": "Elizabeth, Right, I was thinking about the permissions too for this and it certainly works for part of what you mentioned. 1) Managers I think the current capabilities work well for the typical Manager role setup. Usually I find sites have two types of Managers, course managers and \"sub-administrators\". So, giving the sub-administrator type managers the managemodel capability and taking it away from course type managers works great because the course managers can still see the Insights reports. It might be a really useful addition if there were distinct capabilities for edit model (edit, enable/disable) versus view model (all other actions). This is a fairly common scenario for lots of capabilities, edit vs. view. It would allow some Managers to more actively work with models and see all the details but not edit or enable/disable them. 2) Admins The permissions idea won't work for admins, of course. Which is why I proposed instead the mechanism that already works for admins: anything that has a configuration setting can be locked in the config.php. If the setting is in the mdl_config or md_config_plugins tables, it can be locked from being changed in the interface. This is a very common way of doing change control. I have 2,572 settings like this in my 3.4 site and I can lock each of those if I needed to. Since I wrote this up before, I thought this time I would make a mock up of exactly how I would see this working. See the attachment with a mockup. That mockup shows how I have my Analytics settings now, with output directory and onlycli both locked so I can't mess them up. In a production site, I will never normally change those. And I propose the new one. In a production environment, you would simply set the various models enabled or disabled as needed, then turn that Prevent setting ON, so that models cannot be accidentally changed. That's one level of safety. In a more controlled environment, I can also lock that setting in the config.php, shown in the mockup too. That to me is the goal level of safety (say for legal or DPO level change control compliance.) That's exactly how admins do change control for key settings already. And it has the benefit that changing settings such as these are logged to the Config changes report already. Randy",

But what is missing is what role you are using to access the course. Student and Guest are lumped together as 'Participating' as opposed to 'Teaching' just as you noted originally. I don't see in the log table in the database that it tracks the exact role. There is a column for \"edulevel\" which reflects the constants in the code to log for Teaching (1) versus Participating (2). It seems to lump in Guest as Participating the same as a Student. (See attachment from base.php constants.) I think the only way around this is to fix it in the code. It should really not lump the Guest user in as Participating but at least use Other (0) or better have its own level.

A) Disable processing There seems to be no master setting to turn this on and off like other tools, such as Badges or Competencies or Messaging. There is no setting in Site admin > Analytics for this either. So, is the only way to do this either to: 1) Disable each Model in its Action menu > Disable, and/or 2) To turn off the various Scheduled tasks related to this, which seems to be three:  Predict models, Train models, and Analytics cleanup. 3) Disable this for any users other than admins to re-enable. Are there any capabilities other than moodle/analytics:managemodels and moodle/analytics:listinsights that are involved? AND B) Remove any existing data How do I remove any and all previous data processing that may have taken place before we turn those off? There are nine database tables with table names starting with _analytics_ so are these the only tables used? Some of these are obviously setting tables and can remain but any related to data collected need to be emptied. And are there any directories used for storage other than the one set in the Models output directory (eg. pathto/moodledata/moodle/models) Anything else? Will there be a master switch to turn this off in Moodle 3.5? If not I would suggest so and that it may be off by default too. Just assuming that it is ok to start such processing on site without regard to what legal or privacy issues may be present would not be good. Thanks Randy",

The client was unhappy because they were no longer able to uninstall Analytics after it changed from plugin to core. So, to give some background, we installed in 3.3 as a plugin, trained and figured out how it works. Very nice. No problem. Then the client, for certain business and legal reasons, required it to be completely uninstalled. Ok. No problem. Then in 3.4 this is no longer an installable plugin; it is not even an internal plugin; it can no longer be uninstalled. Now we have a problem. We suggested and tested many alternatives, but in the end, removing the code from core was the only way to comply and that would have meant managing a custom code based for multiple sites for years. That was not a viable alternative here. \"Moodle is Modular. Until it isn't.\" as one person involved in this said to me. Having it modular, a true plugin, would give people an option of removing it if they need, but having it tightly in core takes that away, or at least makes it very difficult (expensive) to do. Hope that provides some context about this. I will follow up elsewhere on some other thoughts on this subject. Thanks, Randy",

I am sorry if you have external restrictions that block you from uninstalling the plugin, but it may be better to avoid mixing up concepts because this gets confusing for an external reader that has no idea about how things really work. The whole analytics thing was designed keeping in mind that people could not be interested in using it. In that case people just need to uninstall tool_analytics. Feel free to create an issue to add a global disable setting, that would also work. The analytics engine is what it can not be uninstalled and that is perfectly fine, it does nothing by itself, it is a set of APIs called by tool_analytics; summary: if no tool_analytics no analytics This does not go either against \"Moodle is modular\"; the current architecture (as well as the plugin + APIs separation) is exactly what allows us to make Moodle analytics 100% modular (more info in https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Communication_Between_Components ).",

I think we are just using the word \"plugin\" in different ways. So I will try to be more precise here and please correct me if I am mistaken. In 3.3, Inspire is installed as an \"additional plugin\" and if you go to the 'Manage admin plugins' menu to uninstall it, it will remove all the parts: the Inspire plugin in admin tools, the predictors, and the model in the Report menu, and all menu entries and all settings. In 3.4, Analytics was changed to no longer be an additional plugin but is part core and part core plugin. Now tool_analytics is a \"core plugin\" and can be removed from the plugin overview page, but the rest of Analytics is not and therefore as you said can't be uninstalled: the menus and settings are still there. It's as if I awoke one morning to find someone driving around my lawn in a car. I yell at them, \"Hey, quit driving around tearing up my lawn!\" and the guy says, \"Ok\" and drives away. The next morning I wake up to find the car sitting in the middle of my lawn. I yell, \"Hey, didn't you hear what I said?\" And he says, \"Don't worry I removed the engine! It can't tear up your lawn any more\". What the client wants is the car off their lawn, engine or no engine. With the change from 3.3 additional plugin to 3.4 style, you can't remove the car from the lawn anymore. It's no longer an additional type plugin you can fully uninstall. That's what my clients mean when they said, \"Moodle is modular. Until it isn't.\" It's not a statement about architecture, it's a statement of the how features are managed. How the components communicate doesn't mean anything to them, but having things they can't uninstall means a lot. In general, there's a lot of issues with uninstalling core plugins, one of which is they will get reinstalled next upgrade and then you have to uninstall them again. If you need to reinstall them for some reason, that's a complex process of under the hood work to re-add core code from the git repos, a process only for experienced admins. Core plugins bring a lot of complications to managing things if you uninstall them and that should certainly be avoided unless it is the only possible option to solve a problem. Managing them is very different from managing additional plugins. To sum up, If Analytics in 3.4 were still an additional plugin as it was in 3.3, I could simply uninstall and reinstall it easily like any additional plugin. You can not fully uninstall in 3.4 what you could fully uninstall in 3.3. So, I hope this is a more accurate description of how it works and the difference between 3.3 and 3.4 that we went through.

This is probably an edge case for most people in Moodle right now, but consider that there are some really complicated business relations revolving around who owns what rights to what data. User data is bought and sold and so contracts can have constraints on what clients can collect and do with it. Add in GDPR and federal data laws like in Germany and Switzerland and it gets complicated. It's not just raw data, but also analytics rights. You might be interested in the situation where a content provider wanted contractual rights to the analytics for their products and they wanted to prevent a certain competitor from getting those rights too. We even tried to sketch out how to divide things up. It was really unusual. Another interesting thing that came up was consent (in the GDPR sense) for previous training data for users long finished with courses. In order to do the training for the model, we needed to use the old courses - but had consent for that been given? Was it included under the \"compatible\" use clause? Was that data supposed to have been removed as no longer needed? I mean, lots of questions. I have a list of proposed settings for the admin part of this and I will post them in a bit.

          "Text": "Hi Ralf, Where can a teacher find the predictions in the course? I expected a link in course administration area or a block, but didn't found anything Predictions for a course will appear under Course administration > Reports > Insights once the system starts generating predictions Can a teacher define which models he want to use for his course? No, only users with 'moodle/analytics:managemodels' capability at site level can (admins, managers or researchers with that capability) Can a teacher disable predictions for his course? Teachers can disable insights notifications ( Preferences > Notification preferences > Insights generated by prediction models ) so they will not be notified when new predictions are generated Can a teacher add notices to the prediction form? Sorry, I don't understand the question What happens if the teacher changes prediction related data during the course (start/end date, activities , number of weeks, conditional activities, passing grades)? (sorry in advance, long explanations) start/end date and number of weeks: Time-splitting methods are what defines at which point of the course the predictions will be generated and there is a scheduled task looking for courses that reach points in time defined by time-splitting mehotds. Without an example this does not help much: Say you use quarters time-splitting method, the course duration is split in 4 parts from the start date to the end date. When we reach the first quarter of an ongoing course we generate predictions. We identify those predictions with a key (1st quarter) predictions for the first quarter will not be generated again (unless you add new students to the course) If you change the course start date or the end date the scheduled task will not get generate predictions for the first quarter again, it will not generate predictions until the 2nd quarter (according to the new start and end) is reached Activities: If new activities are added and the date when they are supposed to be completed match the time range provided by the time-splitting method these activities will count towards students' cognitive depth and social breadth calculations Conditional activities: Activities that are not accessible by students are not considered Passing grades: Same case than Conditional activities if I understand your point correctly. We don't use passing grades as part of students at risk model. If what you ask is what happens if I change the passing grade after the course is complete? First thing to mention is that teachers will not get predictions for finished courses. Finished courses are used to train the machine learning algorithms that will later be used to generate predictions. Second thing to mention is what this always depend on what is defined by the model; replying what I imagine you could mean (models using the passing grade as a success / fail) It depends on when you change the pass grade There is a scheduled task that will use finished courses data for training, no manual action is required. If you change the course pass grade after the course end date nothing will happen because that course will already be used for training. If you change the passing grade before the end date that is the value that will be considered. Is the learning time of a student included in the calculations? How is learning time defined and calculated? If by learning time you mean the time a student spent in a course no, it is not included. This should be a very good indicator and a whole topic by itself. There are multiple ways of calculating this, none of them really reliable unless we constantly inform the server about whether the user is actively viewing the page or similar solutions. Also a time spent of 45h does not really mean anything; we need models to adapt to all sort of courses so we need to put that value in a context ; if we want a time spent indicator we can: Do it properly by comparing the time spent value we calculate with an \"Expected time spent\" or something like that that the teacher would have to set. We will need to define at what level (whole course, activities, course sections ...) Add a simple one e.g. zero time spent / less than course average time spent / more than average or similar solutions; quite less powerful and reusable than the previous one",

I added the function label_user_complete() using the data stored in table course_modules_completition to detect if completitionstate is true. I added the function at the end of the file \"/mod/label/lib.php\", because this file is loaded by the page \"/report/outline/user.php\" before calling the function of type \"{mod}_user_compelte\".

Is it possible to exclude/include categories of courses for training? What happens if a course that was used for training purpose is reset or deleted with the data? What are the minimal number of courses /users required for training until we will have relevant data for predictions? Are the data from courses where predictions are given added to the basis of data for future predictions? How can we delete data if an institution changes significant the teaching model/didactical scenario and need a new training process? It should be possible to delete or ignore old data and not to mix them with data in a new concept. Can we get different models and predictions for different groups of courses? The results and predictions may be very different for classes 1-4 or 10-12 in the same institution, Same could happen with different target groups or programs (i.e. in German vocational schools). Is there a list of site and course settings that are required? A course scenario may have a weekly quiz. The students results and behaviour in these quizzes inrelation to the progression of complexity between the quizzes is an interesting model for prediction. Some aspects: number of attempts up to passing grade, attempts after passing grade is reached,.. Is it possible to move a model with training data from one system to an other? Scenario: a schoolbook publisher sells a course. Over time ten thousands of students runs through this course. With the next edition of the course the publisher wants to add the option that a school gets predictions from the first use of the course based on the experience of students from other schools. Is it possible to export/import a model between Moodle systems? What is the sense of a prediction befor the course starts? Which user data are used for such a  prediction? (mentioned in https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Analytics_API#How_many_predictions_for_each_sample.3F ) How can we communicate realistic expectations about the information/predictions that models can create. Analytics is not the fortune tellers  glas ball. But some people will think it will do it and have expectations that are not realistic.",

          "Text": "Let me add some more questions for better understanding of indicator process. For creating models its relevant to know what an indicator measures. I.e. A course includes weekly quizzes. The students can make each quiz several times and the quiz access is limited until end of the following week. What does the indicator quiz cognitive measure? There are a lot of options: simple ones like final grade or number of quiz attempts up to passing grade or much more complex like: is the grade better from attempt to attempts, grows the number of attempts from quiz to quiz during course timeline if the first attempts fails, are there additional attempts if the first attempts were successfull. How is the single indicator related to the final grade/success in the course? I don't expect that such complex scenarios are included in the indicator definition. But if an institution uses the model they should know what is in it. The examples above shows that a lot of different scenarios are thinkable, but it will be  a nightmare to configure them all. If there is a one activity course, with a quiz or SCORM package only. What can indicators measure? What is the model for comparison  of training course information and real courses where a tecaher gets notification? What arethe criteria that  a notification is been created? Ralf P.S.. While thinking about it  a lot more questions will come in my mind.",

          "Text": "Hi Ralf, The Inspire system can support many models. The one that is shipped with the plugin for 3.3 is based on the \"Community of Inquiry\" theoretical framework. The social and cognitive indicators measure two different types of engagement. First, each activity type has been defined according to how much social \"breadth\" and cognitive \"depth\" that activity can offer. For example, as you pointed out, a Book activity does not offer any social interaction, because learners read the Book content in isolation. A Book does not offer much cognitive interaction, either, because the learner has no opportunities to submit any content for feedback or to offer feedback of their own. A Forum, on the other hand, offers a wide range of potential social contact and also provides a capability for a learner to both receive and offer feedback, and to revise their own concepts. We then compare the available opportunity for engagement to what each student actually did with the activity. These data points are used to predict the likelihood that a student will complete a course for credit, based on the experiences of other students at the same institution. This particular model is intended to be used in fully or substantially online courses with a variety of activities over a span of time. Some additional models are supported in 3.4, and the API allows anyone to add to the models. More information about the models in the plugin and in the Core functionality to be released in 3.4 are available in the Inspire community area: https://moodle.org/project_inspire -- this is also the best place to ask questions or offer feedback. I hope this has been helpful, Elizabeth",

Can we rely on the start/end date reliably- or enrol start date /end date Can we use activity completion- or is view / submit / graded more dependable the gradebook, is only whats in it - and all we have to go with - how to know some users may be in one assignment, some in others if groups are used some gradebook entries may not actually contribute to a real final grade So what can an analytics engine potentially and reliably use across most types of course? Dates Perhaps ongoing \"periods of time\" can be used, looking at who/what is happening within a period of time Students who are active during a set period (if analysing on a week, then only those active in that week for example) - and comparing only within that window Grading of activities - can only go on whats there or not Activity on activities (or lack of) the details with Rubric responses of assignments the details with Marking guide responses of assignments overall access patterns to non activity items (messaging, gradebook, calendar) in short, what is reliable consistent data withint inconcistent course structures, design and implementation.

          "Text": "Thanks, Gavin. All of these points are valid. We do have a way of estimating course start and end for courses that are used once (based on majority of activity in course), but this gets much harder with courses that are reused without reset. We have also been hoping to develop a bulk grade import tool so we have some valid measures of success (for academic courses) on which to base predictions. We are looking into adding \"expect start\" and \"expect complete\" date fields to enrolment records as one way of improving predictions, but obviously these fields won't help if they aren't filled in. There is an unavoidable tradeoff between data quality for predictions and effort involved in maintaining the data. Much of this effort can be automated if courses and enrolments are generated from SIS data, but changing the automation scripts is an effort in itself. Our question in the analytics team is, what tradeoff are people willing to make? How much data would site admins, teachers, etc. be willing to enter to improve predictions, and conversely, how low an accuracy rate on predictions are people willing to accept if their data is incomplete? We have no assumptions about this in the Learning Analytics team. We need to hear from the Moodle community on this.",

          "Text": "From a K12 point of view, I can definitely relate to much of what Gavin says. In my former establishment, course start dates were indeed meaningless as they were the date the admin made the course . They'd enrol the students then or later (eg at the start of a term) For courses with younger, non-exam students, the courses would simply be reset each year, previous students kicked out and new classes brought in and none of the data saved. For older, exam class students, the students would be retained in an archived group (Class of 2015) and the new students brought in meaning Moodle courses with years of students together. The gradebook was used inconsistently across departments and (as this was a school, much grading was done offline and not synced with any Moodle grades.) The greatest use of Moodle assignments was (and still is) merely to record that work had been submitted. One department made a custom scale - handed in/not handed in, for that purpose. They hardly ever use(d) activity completion and that's a shame because I think such reports are really useful. Course completion, however, is kind of meaningless in such environments. During the time I was there and we had Moodle, final exam results went up. Management was often asked \"what evidence do you have that Moodle helped improve the grades?\" but there wasn't any, really. It would have been/will be excellent to have something easily used by schools and colleges. As a by the way, my old school, and I suspect many others, are in love with SISRA Analytics - but I doubt anything Moodley is taken into account.",

          "Text": "My background is in UK FE (mainly technical education possibly similar to Australian TAFE) and University degree courses. I don't recall if start and end dates were stored in FE, but they would not have been particularly meaningful as a large percentage of students would trickle on to courses up to weeks after the start and a small percentage would hang around for up to a month after the official course end. In both organisations courses were not re-used and a new course was created automatically, typically this was close to the course start date. Final course grade was not stored in Moodle but was hand entered into the School Management System. The SMS was the final arbiter of a students overall grade. Gradebook contained graded activities that were formative, summative and sometimes just a way of getting the students to submit stuff that was never expected to be graded To address Gavins final question about \"what is reliable data within inconsistent course structures\" is that there is none and to get it you need to change organisational policies and individuals attitudes. I rather like activity completion as a measure of progress as it is turned off by default, meaning that where it is turned there has been a deliberate decision to address it and also it is binary, i.e. you have either completed or not completed an activity. This is in contrast to other areas of grading which could vary wildly between two different teachers.",

Do you know what settings are necessary to make the best use of a Moodle dashboard ? What learning outcomes do you want to address within Moodle? How will you know if outcomes have been fulfilled? What elements are consistently designed across a set of courses so that they can be compared? What have your teachers/educators/trainers agreed upon as \"consistent practice\"? What factors make certain elements more or less successful than other elements? Do the various course designs create value for students, or are the different patterns confusing? If you teach hybrid courses, what activities do you want to save for face-to-face meetings? Backward Design ( Wiggins ) can't be ignored in online courses, especially when you intend to compare apples to apples with analytics.  Plus, it is really liberating to find some agreement among peers on what they want to see in online instruction. -Tom",

          "Text": "I agree with your points, Tom. I do think this discussion is in the wrong forum, however. The points you make are best addressed and analyzed (thereby producing learning analytics) with competencies and thorough and detailed reporting on the competencies. IMO , analyzing behaviors and course characteristics that aren't necessarily (a normal and necessary part of the course) related to authentic evidence of student learning is not learning analytics even though the term 'learning analytics' in current parlance usually does mean analyzing behaviors and course characteristics. The problem that Mary points out that faculty don't frequently use Moodle to record assessments, especially of off-line activities, even though doing so is actually quite efficient, illustrates the problem with analyzing learning. it is only partially a software feature development issue. It is more of a professional services / professional development issue which will be made easier as competency reporting gets easier to use. Software developers will need to listen long and frequently to professional services people, anathema for some developers. And one other, somewhat related point, all teaching is either online or hybrid (certainly for our purposes on this forum;)  it's just a matter of how much time is face to face.

          "Text": "Hi, Thanks for reminding us the chaos that reigns rollover processes in Moodle Gavin It is important to consider all these scenarios during the analytics API design. Lack of course structure, missing course start and end dates, and no standard procedures to rollover courses... are problems we face not only when designing analytics models but also when designing the analytics API itself. We are coding the API according to those use cases but there are some limits. I don't think we can have a good solution that works for all courses regardless of their structure or the correctness of their start and end dates. Simply because the information we need to make predictions is not available. About what can an analytics engine reliably use, I agree that user activity seems something we can rely on, I don't think marking guide responses or rubrics are elements that are available on most types of courses and I also agree that we can not rely on Moodle's gradebook either. The prediction model we currently have in 3.4 (master branch) for students at risk of dropping out of courses is based on student's activity and it does not look at student grades, it is aligned with what you think an analytics engine can use across most types of courses. The indicators we calculate and use to get predictions are based on the community of inquiry model, there is info about them in https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=17233 (I don't know much about it) the summary is that they are based on students activity on course activities, posting stuff, reflection, updating submissions.... I am personally not a fan of limiting prediction models' indicators to specific paradigms and I would be keen to test different indicators (e.g. rubrics if available) or whatever the community members propose; in any case I think that this set of indicators is a good start and we can expand the list of indicators in future releases, of course contributions are more than welcomed. To give some more info about the API design and the included students at risk of dropping out model design: Activity (in different shapes, grouped...) is the most reliable indicator across courses; it is important to consider that to deal with activity logs is not cheap in system resources terms. We can not just check each student activity in a site in weekly basis performing complex calculations including other course members averages that we need to set some context for each student, at least not in a mid-size site, we should aim to have a solution for all site sizes. The API allows each model to control what should be analysed and what should be ignored. In the students at risk of dropping out model included in 3.4 we are ignoring all courses that do not have a start date and an end date. We do it because without a proper start and end it is impossible to know which activities a student should have interacted with. There are some cases where we could do something (availability is set, assignments with due dates...) but again, we want a solution that works for as much courses as possible. We considered that in most of the cases people have not cared about setting the proper course start dates because who cares if it is not used, the same with the course end date. Now they have 2 reasons, the dashboard and this. I would even vote to include a message on the top of the main course region if course start and end are not set, if the start date has not yet arrived or if the end date has already passed. We are aware that there are courses what do not really have a start and end like Mary said and I can agree that we should try to have a solution for them, I have been thinking a lot about it since I started reading this chain of messages and I will propose something here during this week; sorry, no guarantee that it will be ready for 3.4 The prediction model for students at risk of dropping out of courses that is included in master is an experimental prediction model that serves as an example of what you can do with this new analytics API. The API is composed by different entities that can be extended separately without changing core code so anyone can overwrite these behaviours with their own. For example, you want to get predictions in weekly basis since the beginning of a course regardless of how much you will stress your servers, just code a new time splitting method for it, all indicators will continue working as they do splitting the course in 4 parts; you want to look for students that will fail the course instead of students that will drop out of it (good luck with it) just extend students at risk target and change the calculation.

If you are making a prediction about student success within a certain point in time, you need to know what that point in time is. There are two cases in which a course has no end date, but we want to make some kind of prediction of student success. In the first case, if the course stays open perpetually, but the students are enrolled for fixed points in time, those times (enrollment start and end) should be used as a basis for the predictions. Moodle supports this by allowing the teacher to exclude students who don't have an active enrollment from course reports, so it would be safe to leave the students enrolled. You can reset a course and leave students enrolled while removing their data from the course, I believe: https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Reset_course The second case is for self-paced courses. In those courses, there really is no end date. We can develop a different sort of predictive model for that case: is the student likely to ever complete the course, based on their activity to date? This kind of model would need very clear completion criteria (preferably using Course Completion).",

I would add some other basic indicators to the model that are already coded to \"try to\" give some insight if there are no activities with action events, which is perfectly possible. This model would work in parallel to the current students at risk of dropping out model based on the community of inquiry.  There shouldn't be any changes required at analytics API level. I have been looking at the action events API and talking with Cameron Ball (who participated in the design) and the action events API supports what I am proposing I just need to check how this use of it will perform (in speed terms) because the API is quite single user focused and iterating through potentially all site student enrolments in weekly basis is not a quick task, we need this to work in all site sizes. In any case this model, if this does not perform well we could restrict its use to self-paced courses.",

Some members of MUA would like the Dashboard display to be guided more by which activities must be completed as part of course completion, but if I understand you correctly, that enhancement would already feed into the Action Events API. So the prediction would be: the student will finish the remaining required Dashboard events (at some undefined point in the future), and probably the number of actions completed will be the best predictor, though we may find that some actions predict completion better than others (I'm betting that submission of an artifact for feedback will still be a stronger predictor than reading a page).

My general assumption after downloading report by changing \"Attempts that are\" options was, what ever the rows displayed in the table below, that will be imported to Excel. But it doesn't seem to be. Here are the files I've tracked so far which is included by using \"require_once\" and \"include\" etc. Starting from /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php. Indentation = Hierarchy attemptsreport.php tablelib.php overview_options.php attemptsreport_options.php formslib.php overview_form.php attemptsreport_form.php formslib.php overview_table.php attemptsreport_table.php tablelib.php And another help mainly I need from you Tim is, I couldn't find the download button's function until now. The submit URL of download button redirects to \"\\moodle\\mod\\quiz\\report.php\" where, there is no condition for checking download button action in about 25 recursively included files. I'm blank on this. Completely. It would be nice if the Excel generating plugin just captures whatever it is displayed inside table. How to achieve this? Thank you.

I didn't design it, but there are less than 20 courses across the site, so the way they set it up works pretty well, especially with course completion set. An issue i face is that when courses are like this, the user reports are virtually useless, showing just one activity. What I would really like is a site wide overview/complete report. Does anyone know of a plugin that provides this? I am fairly certain this is not part of Moodle's core, but I could be wrong; https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Site-wide_reports The logs are great, but do not summarise the data like the complete/overview reports do and i fear it is just too much info for the client anyway.

That is probably due to our Moodle version ( Moodle 2.9.8) ? So it could be too young for MOCLog. My question is wether the table mdl_log  is obsolete  in Moodle 2.9 ? so MOCLog can never function? In case MOCLog is not installable ... do have recommendations with regard to alternatives.Such as https://moodle.org/plugins/report_customsql Our goal is to track user data side wide for all courses.

I need to develop some analytics on discussion forum activity. Specifically, I would like to query the Moodle (3.1 or 3.2) database to get the following data for activity in a specified discussion forum of a specified course. (The data will later be analyzed against in-person interviews with the users, to study effectiveness of the Forum activities .) 1. For every pair of users in the course, say \"user-A\" and \"user-B\", how many times did user-A\nreply to a post by user-B (no matter if it was to a new base note or to a\nreply of user-B), and vice versa. (Researching network connectedness and \"symmetry\" between users\nin Forums. The Forum Graph plugin depicts this but doesn't return downloadable data as far as I know. What SQL would do so?) 2. For every pair of users in the course, user-A and user-B, what was the average \"rating\" user-A and user-B\ngave each other's posts (no matter if it was to a new base note or to a\nreply of user-A). (Researching connectedness and \"symmetry\" between users\nin Forums, correlated with perceived Quality of Forum activity. Don't know of anything that returns this data.) 3. How many times did each user post (whether a new topic or a reply) to anyone else in the course. (Level of activity. Available in core Moodle Reporting but I would like to know what SQL to use to get results for specific users, course, forum.) 4. What was the average rating overall that each user received for postings (for new topic and replies) by all other users in the course, in the aggregate. (Quality of activity as measured by all peers. Don't know of anything that returns this data.) Can anyone point me to the right queries that would do the above, or which I could use as a starting point for development? Thanks, Alan",

Here, you're starting from SCORM data and joining to user data that matches the SCORM data, so you will only see records of users who appear in the SCORM activity set. What you are going to need to do is start from a set of all the users you are interested in, e.g. all those enrolled in a specific Moodle course, and then do an OUTER JOIN to pick up their SCORM status without dropping the users who never attempted the SCORM module.

I have found some\narticles that have used Moodle to do some learning analytics research.  I don't know if I should show this as a\nreplicate study since there are so few of them or what. I am working on my prospectus and simultaneously working\non my proposal.  I have a content expert\nand methodologist but cannot use them until my chair approves the prospectus which\nis very frustrating.  There are so many\nthings I want to ask my methodologist.  I\nam studying at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix AZ.  My doctoral degree is Psychology with\nemphasis on Integrated Technology, Learning and Psychology. It is so funny how our studies seem so similar.  Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting and\ndiscuss where we are and share articles. \nUsing the Community of Inquiry model, I have toyed with adding Cognitive\nPresence but unsure what data I would grab that would represent that in\nMoodle.  I have a university that is\nallowing me to use 5 graduate courses from Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.  Waiting to hear back from their Moodle person\non getting the data on a test server so I can access it. Since you work for Moodle you may be able to answer some\nquestions.  Is there a document that\nshows all the tables and field names so I will know how to gather some\ndata? I need data from the Messaging feature in Moodle.  Also, Moodle for Windows will not\ninstall on my Windows 8 or Windows 10 computer. \nWas going to do some preliminary work but can't get that to work.  I worked at a McMurry University in Abilene\nTexas. Would love to hear what fields you are using to represent\nteaching presence and social presence for your study.  I am looking at using the activity log report\nand then gathering data from the messaging features in Moodle.  I have Zoom if you are interested in\ntalking.  Would be great to talk to\nsomeone who is familiar with what I am doing and share ideas.

The other problem with both learning analytics and analysis of learning outcomes (and, I agree with Marcus that they are different) is that they are both tools which very few people have become proficient at using. If I gave my daughter one of these tools when she asked for a router, we would need to first work through the issue of a the same name for a tool that does very different things. She would be asking how that thing is going to make wifi work all through her house. The other thing, though, is that if someone wanted to make intricate designs on a piece of wood, would they even know to ask for a router? What about the case where a person has never ever seen intricate designs in wood (maybe they've been secluded in some techno facility their entire life) ? I don't care which type of router we use as an analogy for any of the many variations that already exist in analytics or analysis of learning. The big problem is that not very many people know that the tools even exist. Some people may have read about some reference or another, but they don't have any actual experience or understanding of using that tool in a teaching and learning environment. How many Academic Vice presidents are there are on any campus who understand the nuances of either learning analytics of analysis of learning outcomes in a learning management system. For the most part, the people who do know something about learning analytics and/or analysis of learning via work in a learning management system don't have decision making authority when it comes to applying these tools on a scope that would produce results that would validate the efficacy of the tools. The solution is not easy, but it is one worth doing. I propose that Moodle HQ, or somebody, go even further than has been gone before and create various scenarios where the various things that are possible are demonstrated with samples that include enough data to be meaningful to people who are in positions who can authorize the use of the tools on a much more widespread basis. These samples will need to include sample reports based on the large sample sizes. The next step of actually testing the tools in teaching and learning settings will then be more possible. We need a Gene Roddenberry of learning analytics/analysis of learning outcomes.",

I just don't have a way for the Asst Supt to be able to run a report to see how well the 3rd grade students are progressing on each of those standards. This theoretical district has about 3,000 3rd graders in 120 different classrooms that are located in about 40 different buildings. It would be convenient for the Asst. Supt if all of those classes were on the same sequence of lessons, but those pesky union teachers keep asserting their desire to teach according to various other sequences. The classroom I taught in for 16 years until about 5 years ago is a possible example of one of those classrooms. Another example of analyzing student learning, a use case, might be at a liberal arts college that has traditionally strong nursing program that offers BSN degrees, Masters, and PhDs. The Academic V.P. is concerned about how well the students are doing in the various cohorts; one prompt for concern might be that the HLC is scheduled to review the accreditation of the entire institutionin the next couple of years. Additionally, the American Nurses Association will be re-certifying the Masters in Nursing program in the next year. Both the HLC and the ANA have said that they want to see systems in place that measure student achievement on the standards and institutional student learning objectives. Here's a link to ANA nursing standards. Usually, these standards are covered in multiple courses throughout the program. The Nursing department has recently moved from keeping track of achievement on the standards via an elaborate 3-ring binder system to an spreadsheet system. They are also considering using TK20 to connect to the Moodle system via LTI to track student achievement. Another use case might be at anyone of the 112 California Community Colleges (which comprise almost 10-20% of all students in U.S. higher education.) There are various people who have an interest in student achievement at CA CCs including business, taxpayers, and government. It's a big deal for a lot of people. Knowing how 1st year students are doing on Algebra 1, for instance, is an important metric in determining all kinds of funding issues from the individual classes up to and including state higher ed budgets that include the California University system to which many (?) of the CC students matriculate. Here's a description of some of the math issues in this very large system. Getting some way to report analyses of learning in all of the above is important to all of the parties involved in the above. It also should be of great concern to Moodle HQ because Canvas, D2L, Schoology and Its Learning are eating Moodle's lunch voraciously in all of the above markets. One of the big reasons for Moodle's loss of market share  that I've heard reported by admins at various institutions that represent these markets is Moodle and Moodle's partner networks unresponsiveness to the concerns of all of the various people in all of the above institutions.",

          "Text": "I'll add a note to the above: In my work with Augsburg College, which is similar to one of the theoretical uses cases above, we did do some fairly extensive analysis using fields available via configurable reports in Moodle. These items were then added to items obtained via a 3rd party survey system. A Institutional research database specialist was able to generate several reports that examined various aspects of the 400 hybrid courses we were running. We even had Norm Vaughan, one of the authors that helped promote the concepts of teacher presence, cognitive presence, and social presence, review the reports. For a variety of reasons, those reports were created for only one year. One of the reasons was the complexity of generating the reports. For more on that use case, you can look at this paper that we presented at the 2014 HLC Conference. Another thing to keep in mind: In California, any attempt to track student achievement and correlate it to specific faculty will be contrary to existing faculty teaching contracts. It is also something that will be vigorously opposed by most U.S. K12 teacher unions. The teaching unions have very good reason to oppose any efforts to use any kind of data to measure teaching effectiveness until those data gathering and reporting methods have been thoroughly tested over multiple years and in a variety of use cases. When the various analyses of learning become well established and proven, it is likely that the teacher unions themselves might see the analyses as useful tools to improve teaching and learning. I mention the above because many of the efforts at various kinds of learning analytics have looked to me to be a way to as much as possible avoid including the faculty in the process. Routes like that will undoubtedly come to an impasse.",

The main text of the email is here followed by some comments from me. Reduce Your Cost of Learning Hi Daniel, Save your seat for Advanced LMS Reporting with Zoola Analytics! Reporting — it's the #1 most sought-after feature of Learning Management Systems, and the feature users are least happy with in their existing LMS. Why? Limited access to data, limited options to analyze data, and limited options to share results. Zoola Analytics was developed to solve these reporting challenges, allowing LMS administrators and training managers to eliminate hours of effort required to report on learning activities outcomes. This webinar will demonstrate how matching a powerful, easy to use reporting solution with access to all of your learning data can be used to provide more meaningful, interactive, and actionable insights. Attend this free webinar to see how to: Reduce the time spent creating LMS reports Gain deeper insights into individual learners Use insights to improve overall organization learning Showcase the impact of e-learning on the bottom line This Zoola solution is by far the offering that has come closest, from what I know, to getting us to where we need to be. But, it's not nearly enough. First, it's designed for the business market and few in any level of academia are going to give it a second look. Second, it's not free and fully supported by Moodle HQ - a very good reason for lots of Moodle users to give it a pass and look at another LMS. There are more issues regarding specific reporting options, but those are comparatively easily solved once we get #1 and #2 resolved.",

Your comments about faculty sensitivities to attempts to measure \"teaching effectiveness\" are spot on, too. Even in institutions without faculty/teacher unions, this issue has to be addressed openly and with faculty buy-in as to how to develop a process that helps faculty, rather than pointing a finger of blame. Regarding the \"dependent variable\" terminology -- sorry, not trying to throw around obscure phrases! What I mean is, what is your \"known good\" that you want to evaluate everything else based on? At my former institution, course completion for transferable credit was the \"known good,\" and we were willing to assume that grade inflation wasn't enough of a factor to undermine the value of that measure. That institution would like to evaluate based on competencies/outcomes, but isn't prepared to implement that level of course organization yet. I'd like to be able to offer Moodle institutions several options of \"known good\" to choose from, depending on what is of value to the institution. The analytics would then be tuned toward those outcomes.",

I have done this successfully to echo the current userid, so I know it works using require('../config.php'); I am struggling to get a list of all user names. Sounds so easy! What is the correct way to query the database then cycle through the results to print these as rows in a table? I know there is lots of info out there about queries, and also about how to print mysql queries as rows but there is much less about how to construct a single php page that has the query and prints the results. Can anyone please provide a sample php page that simply does this? Thanks so much!",

The scorm table from the sql database shows start time but not completion timestamp. In layman's terms I can know when a learner starts a SCORM activity but not when it is completed. It does tell me how much time is spent - which is a good statistic - but I want to close it off with the completion date and time. On the other hand, Moodle course-level reports - namely Activity Completion, seem to populate this information with ease. They show the timestamp of completion for every applicable activity in the course (be it SCORM or non-scorm). However, I cannot identify which sql table and/or columns it retrieves this data from. Does anyone know where in the database specifically this is stored?",

It does not tell you how active or when they last accessed it or what they are doing. That info is elsewhere. Moodle doesn't know what \"valid\" is in terms of enrollment, if by that you mean something other than just actively enrolled.  You may need to be looking at other data to figure that out (like last access or completion or grades, etc.) *Note: this is true for basic enrollments; external source enrollments like LDAP etc are a bit more complex.

Currently, the activity completion report in my employer's Moodle site (version 3.0.2) only shows whether students have completed the activities that are marked for activity completion. Why doesn't the activity completion report show any dates that are associated with students doing the activities, but its CSV equivalent does? It also appears that the CSV file shows the date that the CSV file was generated for activities that are marked to have specific \"Expect completed on\" (\"Activity completion\" settings) dates. If so, why is that the case? I am guessing that activities that are manually marked as completed by students have dates that the students actually marked the activities as completed. This is perfectly OK, but I believe that for activities that have \"Expect completed on\" dates, there should be the last modified dates of students in the column next to the column that shows whether the students have completed the activity or not, not the date that the CSV file was generated. If there is such a setting that populates the column next to the column showing whether the activity was completed by students or not with the last modified dates instead of the date that the CSV file was generated, you can point that to me. Otherwise, can we add such a setting? Thank you.",

My failing query so far: SELECT CONCAT (u.firstname, u.lastname) Name, d1.data Profile_Field_1, d2.data Profile_Field_2, d3.data Profile_Field_3, d4.data Profile_Field_4, d5.data Profile_Field_5, IF (ROUND(g.finalgrade / g.rawgrademax * 100, 2) > 79, 'Yes', 'No') Complete FROM mdl_user u LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d1 ON d1.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f1 ON f1.id = d1.fieldid AND f1.shortname = \" Profile_Field_1 \" LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d2 ON d2.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f2 ON d2.fieldid = f2.id AND f2.shortname = \" Profile_Field_2 \" LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d3 ON d3.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f3 ON d3.fieldid = f3.id AND f3.shortname = \" Profile_Field_3 \" LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d4 ON d4.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f4 ON d4.fieldid = f4.id AND f4.shortname = \" Profile_Field_4 \" LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d5 ON d5.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f5 ON d5.fieldid = f5.id AND f5.shortname = \" Profile_Field_5 \" LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_data d6 ON d6.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_user_info_field f6 ON d6.fieldid = f6.id AND f6.shortname = \" Profile_Field_6 \" JOIN mdl_grade_grades g ON g.userid = u.id GROUP BY u.id ORDER BY `Name` ASC Any help would be very much appreciated.

Try it yourself and run an Activity report then click a resource or activity. Run the report again and it will have incremented by one. This is true in the latest release 3.0 and the 3.1 prototypes. I can't expect any teacher would care how many times they click on their own resources. What they really want (and expect) to see from this report is how their class of students are engaging in the course content.  So, in this current state, this report is not providing any good data for the teacher role it is created for. If teachers really want to see a report on their own activity, they can do that under My profile settings > Activity reports > Outline report.

As far as I understand some of the events generated with the userid are due to actions done by the system, sometime as a result from the user direct activity, and so,me time due to other user activities . For example as far as I understand, if user sent a message and them another user view the message the event message_viewed will appear under the user how create the message and not under the user how view the message. (at least this what happened in the moodle system I am working on). In addition, I have seen sequence of events that seems to be generated from a single activity. Thus, any information, how can I differentiate between real user activities are activities related to the user will be highly appreciated. Best regards David Movshovitz",

We use Manual, Self-Enrolment, Cohort-enrolment and auto-enrol from BANNER.  However, not all with the same students.  In this case and others that I'm looking at, the students were manually enrolled. The BANNER autoenrol would insert into tables, but not in this students case, or others that I've checked. I've only discovered it, as I was trying to do an SQL JOIN with mdl_logstore_standard_log and mdl_role_assignments, on userid and contextid, and receiving more records than I expected.

I would really appreciate if any of you would share their experiences. For a start, I am particularly interested in finding a way for GA to distinguish teaching staff from students when gathering data (potentially through the use of an Additional Field in Moodle profiles). Furthermore, GA doesn't seem to 'catch' data when file resources (documents, PDFs,  etc) are accessed by users; I understand that this is because such files obviously do not have the GA tracking code embedded in them.

You will notice the headings differ now too(categories are considered \"organizations\" courses are \"series\", etc): SELECT u.lastname AS 'Last Name',u.firstname AS 'First Name' , u.username As 'Username', u.email AS 'Email', cc.name AS 'Organization', u.country AS 'location', c.shortname AS 'Series title', DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(p.timeenrolled ),'%m-%d-%Y at %m:%s%p') AS 'enrolled in series', DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(p.timecompleted ),'Completed %m-%d-%Y at %m:%s%p') AS 'series completed', gi.itemname AS 'Session title', if (ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) > 79,'Yes' , 'No') as 'Session 100% Viewed', DATE_FORMAT( FROM_UNIXTIME( gg.timemodified ) , '%m-%d-%Y at %m:%s%p' ) as 'last view date' FROM prefix_course_completions AS p JOIN prefix_course AS c ON p.course = c.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON p.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc ON cc.id = c.category JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid WHERE  gi.courseid = c.id and gi.itemname != 'Attendance' ORDER BY u.lastname, cc.name, u.country, c.shortname, gi.itemname This script produces queries for: Last Name First Name Username Email Category Location Course Title Course Enrollment Date Course Completion Date Activity Title Activity Viewed 100%? Activity Last Viewed This pretty much gives our LMS what it needs to perform some solid reporting. However it would still be very good to have the total time the user was in the course displayed also. I have seen this reporting done in other systems. I have also seen sql in Moodle reporting where two queries of data were called, and then combined to form a sum value. My issue is extent of SQL programming experience. I have only been a student of this science for about 12 days now. One can easily perform the calculation in their head & get the total time spent in the course by subtracting the completion date from the enrollment date now. However, it certainly would be the tops if people could see the sum value of those queries in the next column, instead. I'm sure you guys here at the Moodle-Q understand the programming syntax required to create this query better than myself. Would it be a simple thing to call the completion and enrollment times, subtract the former, and render the sum in a new column? Thank you again for your response, Stu!",

Or they may leave it open on their screen while they go and make a coffee. You really don't know. So, you end up having to invent some sort of heuristic for how you will count things, that seems to give reasonable numbers. E.g. assume that if the gap between two successive page-views was less than 5 minutes, than all the time for that series of page view counts as 'in the course' time, but if the gap is longer, don't count the time. You can do that with SQL, using the log table, but it is not easy.",

I would be fine exporting the reports for each as long as I had a common field that I could use as a key. What I need and what I get from the Feedback activity: I want a report of student responses to include a field to use as a key. When I export the responses for the Feedback activity, I get a report that includes USERNAME and FULL NAME fields. What I need and what I get from the Quiz activity: I want a report of student responses to include a field to use as a key. When I export the responses for the Quiz activity, I get a report that includes FIRST NAME , LAST NAME , and EMAIL . Why don't the reports both include common identifying fields? Username or Email fields would be fine. UserID would be great. But, as it stands, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between two students with the same name because there is no unique identifier that is common between the reports. I would have to pull up a separate report of Enrolled Users just so that I can cross-reference by USERNAME and EMAIL so I could tell who is who. I would like two things that would help me out tremendously: 1. If anyone knows how to add a common field to either report, please let me know. 2. If the built-in queries and reports could be adjusted to include a common identifying field, I could do much more with the reports.",

When viewing a student's profile, check out the Activity reports under the Administration menu. There's also reports about students participation in Forums, Quizzes and Blogs. As for seeing activity \"for each login to the system\", there is nothing that I know of that will make this distinction. The trouble is distinguishing the time window of such a session in the asynchronous Web. I suppose you could mark times the student has logged in as the start of such a time window, but as that session can persist for days, determining the end of such a time window would be difficult.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodle-Developer Community! Currently studying computer science and working in Moodle Support at the University of Darmstadt, Germany, my colleague and I have been developing a tool to support Moodle-Admin activities : Moodle AnalyST Idea Since Moodle (for good reasons) makes very conservative use of JavaScript which in consequence makes many full page reloads necessary to perform even simple tasks. For this project we dropped the moodle principles of accessibility to get a high speed support/administration tool, realised under heavy JavaScript usage. Our goal was to create a tool that would assist support and admin staff by making frequently used Moodle functions more accessible (like user search, adding a user to a course, change or view the enrolment key or changing the visibility of a course). processing and presenting relevant data in one place to better help identify issues instead of getting the information from different places in Moodle. Features Fast search for courses (optional category filters include Term and Department) and users Overview of the course: General Information Number of Users per role Enrolled Users Activities and Enrolment methods. Overview of users and the courses they are enrolled in Direct Enrolment of a User into a course (a course and user have to be selected) Fast creation of new courses Links to relevant places in Moodle (Course settings, Edit user, Delete course, change the visibility of the selected course) This tool and its predecessor (our prototype so to speak, which was not published) is in use for almost a year now on our productive system and we could not imagine doing our Support and Admin work without it. At this point, we would like to share our tool with and at the same time be happy to get important feedback on functionality, performance, usability , etc. from the community. More information on the project, ticket submitting and the installation guide can be found on our github-page. Kind regards from Germany, Steffen Pegenau and Nils Muzzulini",

If I am looking at the code correctly, as long as a user has the 'report/moodleanalyst:view' capability at the system context , then they can modify any course on the system, correct? We run a different system of support in which we have different people with manager access on different categories. Would love to know if checking for capability access on a per category basis is on a roadmap for this tool. Or are your support/admin needs strictly all or nothing access?",

That works fine (I can see the students, the attempts, etc.). Yet I suppose I should be able to see these results in the gradebook in Moodle (course administration/grade/grader report). The grade report (and all grade sub-tabs) are empty (like not aknowledging the presence of the SCORM package): how can I change that? When I published the SCORM course (Articulate storyline 2) I made sure that the reporting/tracking options selected were correct, and published in SCORM 1.2. Thanks a lot, Aurelie",

          "Text": "I'm delighted to announce today that the Engagement Analytics suite is now available at: http://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=20 Engagement Analytics provides a quick 'traffic light' snapshot view of the ten students in your course you should be concerned about based on a configurable risk calculation. It also links through to a report on all students in your course, as well as a detailed explanation of how risk is calculated for a particular student. Indicators of engagement/risk The risk percentages shown in the block are the result of three indicators: Login activity: how often, how recently, and how long are students logging in? Forum activity: are students reading, posting, replying? Assessment activity: are students submitting their assessed work, and are they submitting on time? These indicators were selected as the most evidence-based following a review of the literature. How important are logins vs forums vs assessments in predicting success in your course? It depends on the course, so Engagement Analytics allows you to configure the weighting of each - eg 60% logins; 30% assessment; 10% forums. Inside each indicator you can modify how it calculates risk: the number of logins before someone is not at risk; how many days before an assessment is too late and therefore risky; the number of forum posts you expect students to write each week; etc. Write your own indicators You can write your own indicators using our documented indicator architecture, and they'll have equal status with our login/forum/assessment indicators. So if you think that completion tracking, diagnostic quiz scores, or downloading files are the real indicators of student engagement, then write an indicator! If you've got an idea feel free to propose here. Pedagogy/Philosophy of analytics Engagement Analytics takes a 'Level 3' approach to learning and teaching ( Biggs, 1999 ), and views learning as \"what the student does\" (as opposed to \"what the student is\" or \"what the teacher does\"). By understanding what students are doing we can better guide them to do the things we know will help them learn. It does not focus on \"what the student is\" (age;IQ;GPA;etc). Of course, that doesn't stop you from writing an indicator that plugs in to your student management system though. As an education researcher I encourage you to have a read of the Biggs article if you haven't yet, as it has some insights that are useful for analytics. To make the most of Engagment Analytics, a teacher needs to specify what they think learning is in their course - ideally they are already communicating this to their students anyway. Engagement Analytics is not an AI/SciFi analytics tool; its usefulness is only in knowing if students are doing what you have specified you want! It also won't follow up students automagically; you know your students best, and a carefully crafted email/phone call/message should work better than a robotic email. Help us make it better Please let us know if you have any issues, ideas or comments - ideally over the next few months while we still have some funds left ;) Many thanks to: The NetSpot Innovation Fund for generous funding NetSpot developers Ashley Holman & Adam Olley for writing the code, and Kim Edgar for project management / documentation support The expanded project team of Jacques van der Meer, Angela Carbone, Emily Spencer, Robert Nelson, Hariz Halilovich, Keryn Pratt, Tom Apperley & Nathan Bailey Cheers Dr Phillip Dawson, Monash University, Melbourne Australia",

I enjoyed your reference to Biggs's book and want to suggest there could be a Theory X vs. Theory Y basis for making a variant of this block visible to students. It ties in with the idea of Social Norming - people like to belong, and behave accordingly, and this can be used to advantage (see HBR Readers Love this Article ). If the class averages were displayed alongside the individual scores, this could be used as a guide by each and every student for how they compare with the rest of the class. They may or may not wish to respond to what they see, of course. Cheers Ric",

I've been using it in a course and have found it useful for keeping tabs on students that are not completing activities that may lead them not becoming disengaged. I work at a major VET provider that uses Moodle a lot. I'm in learning technology and we are currently trying to evaluate the effectiveness of number of learning anlaytics tools and approaches. i would like the organisation to use the block a lot more, but first would like to test how accurate it is in predicting enagement/disengagement and what are the best settings to improve accuracy. I would like to analyse the effectiveness of the engagement block in providing early warning of students that are likely to become disengaged by comparing the indicators from the block (r/o/g) with results of whether students have completed the course. We aim to do this by using the block with historical data from moodle logs and comparing it to the class results. At them moment I'm trying to find a way of manipulating the scores from the block (would be at different times during the course say start, middle and 2nd last week of course) in Excel to conduct analysis. What I'm missing are the algorithims that the block uses. I can't find this information anywhere online. Are you able to tell me: what the ranges are for the Red, Orange and Green lights. how the scores are calucalted for the three variables (forum posts, time online, assignments completed). This will help me to analyse the results from the block with the actual completion results. many thanks Chris",

Is that expected with this latest release? As I had the plugin set installed already, only the Block and Report plugins required updating and the Activity plugin did not. Is there an easy way to add other graded activities to the block without dipping into code? Regards, Yvonne",

There are 3 headings Asssessment Activity, Forum Activity and Login Activity.  I've uploaded a screengrab of one of the pages for your reference. I'll take the first student's activity as an example -Assessment Activity 0% (0%), Forum activity 33 % (100%), Login 0% (0%).  What does the percentage in brackets mean?  If it is risk- is seems that it is the opposite to the first page- 33% activity on the forum gives you 100% risk?  Or is that what it means? Also in this particular course, the lecturer has not started using the forum yet, so how does that come about? Secondly, I am also using the Activity Completion page, which is also useful.  However, for the most part we've set the tickboxes so that students can tick them themselves.  This page is only a measure of students who have  actually ticked the boxes, right?  Is there any other handy report that measures who has completed what at this type of level?

Howbeit, it just occurred to me that MOODLE's data can be extracted as a CSV file which can be converted to .arff that WEKA needs to process and I think the reverse will also be possible. Until a module is designed that will be done manually. I will also give that a try. Let me hear from you if that is useful. Oh!

I'm taking a special care to the new logging system. I enabled the External database log feature (I created the external database before). Everything works well. Although, I have some questions about how it works, I couldn't find an answer yet. I have 2 different logs : - Standard log (Logs, Live logs, Activity report, Course participation, Statistics) - External database log (Logs, Live logs) Is it possible to disable things logged in External database (logs, live logs) from the standard mode ? Now, logs and live logs are both written into external AND standard database, it is useless to me. Furthermore, is it possible to change the retention time for External logs ? I'd like to have 1 month of history in the standard log and 2 years on the external logs.",

          "Text": "It really depends on what information you want.  You can click on a course the person is enrolled in and go to the gradebook.  In the grade book, click Overview Report.  Choose the user's name and you can get a list of all the courses they are enrolled in and their current grade.  It isn't much information but it's something.  I don't know of a way to get to this report outside of a specific course. Back when I still used 1.9, I think the overview might have been available in user profiles.  We actually made a copy of the overview report and hacked it add detail and then linked it to user profiles. Now, in 2.5, we use Configurable Reports and that is less core hacking and, honestly, simpler, if you can get your head around SQL or have someone who can.  We use several third-party plug-ins and I have reports that detail number of activities (though the report I have doesn't view Feedback as an activity, for some reason...I suspect it is because feedback doesn't report to the grade book.  I haven't looked at it and haven't tried to think of another way.) and number completed and whether they are finished or not, based on course completion settings.  The simplest ones I actually got from people on the Configurable Reports forms. I've got more complicated ones that I built with help that look at non-completion or in one case, two reports that work together...the first pulls everyone in a specific institution and how many hours they've earned with a link to a second report pull's that person's transcript (activities completed, course completed, hours earned)...We have one that allows supervisors to view their staffs' transcripts and lots more. The neat thing about configurable reports is you can access the reports and you can set up reports that your users can request for their own tracking (or, as above, tracking employees). For really complicated reports (those that look at specific activities, dates, instructors), I use crystal reports as well.  Once you have a report, it's simpler and requires less brain to remember where to go to get the info.",

          "Text": "I created a report that gets the times of the first access logged for a user in a course and the last grade recorded in that course, and uses the difference to estimate the time spent in the course. However, someone noted that one user isn't showing up in the report, and the more I investigate why, the more confused I get. The user in question has ID 98, and the course has ID 79. If I go to a gradebook page, like .../grade/report/user/index.php?userid=98&id=79 on my site, the user definitely has a grade recorded for the course (a single activity course based on a SCORM object, in case that matters). However, I can't find any evidence of this anywhere in the database . There are no entries in the grade_grades table for that user and course (though there are entries for the user in other courses, and for the course with other users), nor can I even find anything in the logs table for that user in that course, even though I should have records going back for years. The one thing I can think of is that this user has a custom system role assigned, which is derived from the Manager role, and something in the back of my brain is telling me there's some setting somewhere that causes such users' activities to not be logged? Or maybe I'm completely mis-remembering that. If there is such a setting, I can't find it, and anyway it doesn't explain why he has logs for other courses (unless maybe they're from before he was assigned the role?) Anyway, I'm grasping at straws here. It seems that if user X has a grade in course Y's gradebook, then it there *should* be an entry for that user/course combo in the grade_grades table... right? Before I start digging into the source code, I figured I'd ask here in case I'm just missing something obvious. Thanks to anyone who can help! Here are examples of some of the queries I've tried. Both of these return no results as-written, but if you remove the user or course restrictions, then they do. \n```text\nselect itemname, g.rawgrade from mdl_grade_items i join mdl_grade_grades g on i.id = g.itemid and g.userid=98 and courseid=79;\n```\n \n```text\nselect u.username, c.fullname, action, min(time) first from mdl_log l join mdl_user u on l.userid = u.id and u.id = 98 and course=79 join mdl_course c on l.course = c.id group by username,fullname,action\n```",

          "Text": "I don't know if this is the right place for this question-- please direct me elsewhere if not. I encountered this problem while using the Configurable Reports plugin, but I don't think that matters for this question. I'm trying to write a report that shows, for a list of courses, whether they are ready for the start of the new term. At our college we copy existing courses forward into new shells for many instructors; for some courses, the instructor starts from a blank template. So I need to show columns for how many of certain kinds of activities and resources have been created for each course, and I also want to be able to show how many edits the assigned instructor has made to the course. I want to use this report just as a quick overview so I know if I need to contact an instructor and offer help. I can write reports that summarize module contents, and I can write reports that summarize log information, but when I try to combine the two I get very strange results. Not all log entries show up, and module counts are distorted. My code is below (with just one example course in the list). Can anyone offer any suggestions for how to improve it? \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\nSELECT \n\n\n\n\nc.fullname AS Course\n\n\n, CONCAT(u.lastname,', ', u.firstname) AS Teacher\n\n\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module = 9, 1,0)) AS Forums\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module = 16,1,0)) AS Quizzes\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module IN ('1','2'),1,0)) AS Assignments\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module = 15,1,0)) AS Pages\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module = 17,1,0)) AS Files\n\n\n, SUM( IF(cm.module = 20,1,0)) AS Links\n\n\n, COUNT( l.id) AS Edits\n```\n logs only: Modules only: Note that there really is only one quiz, and the instructor really did make 255 edits (all logged actions that don't match 'view%'). Is there any way to show both of these facts accurately in the same report, or do I need to do this with two separate reports or a UNION query or something like that?",

You can see the list of blocks for example in your admin side -> http://yoururl/admin/blocks.php   which has a number beside each instance of the block If you click on that it will list all the courses with the block in it. This url is something like http://yoururl/course/search.php?blocklist=24 However if that plugin just creates the course - it may not be in it, and therefore is not used by the course. IT probably needs to log the creation somewhere (or may already do - I am not familiar with the plugin). Gav.",

Chris is right ... does look like cron.php has been setup to run incorrectly in crontab ... the little app that runs cron jobs. Inside cron.php it has comments and even an example of how it should be called: * This file is best run from cron on the host system (ie outside PHP). * It is strongly recommended to add password protection via admin settings. * * eg   wget -q -O /dev/null 'http: *moodle.somewhere.edu/admin/cron.php?password=SeCreT666' Please see: https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Cron for the official info. On a Linux server , one could use php, wget (if installed), lynx or elinks (if installed), curl (if installed). wget,lynx/elinks/curl *require* the use of a URL in the cron job ... as in the example given in the cron.php file. The only method not requiring a URL is php itself.   In some cases one might have  to use the full paths to php as well as full path to the cron.php script to run. Example: (which may/may NOT work with your server as you've not disclosed that info): /usr/bin/php -f /full/path/to/moodlecode/admin/cron.php?password='SeCreT666' 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

The report, as you can imagine, is getting longer and longer as more completions are added. \n```text\nSELECT u.idnumber, u.firstname, u.lastname, c.fullname as course, FROM_UNIXTIME(com.timecompleted-(0*60*60), '%M %d, %Y') as coursecompleted, FROM_UNIXTIME(max(st.timemodified)-(0*60*60), '%M %d, %Y') as scormcompleted \n\n\nFROM prefix_scorm_scoes_track st\n\n\nJOIN prefix_scorm s ON s.id = st.scormid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course c ON c.id = s.course\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = st.userid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course_completions com ON com.course = c.id AND com.userid = u.id\n\n\nWHERE st.element = 'cmi.core.lesson_status' AND (st.value = 'completed' OR st.value = 'passed') AND com.timecompleted IS NOT NULL\n\n\nGROUP BY u.idnumber, u.firstname, u.lastname, scormid, c.fullname, com.timecompleted\n```\n I'd like to offer my coordinators two report options from here on out: 1) The report with the information from the original query but limited to just the completions for the previous 30 days. We pull the report weekly so having a rolling 30 days would give us enough overlap to catch errors. 2) The full report from the original query but that doesn't display the table in HTML in Moodle; it would just give us the option to download the csv. I don't know SQL at all and someone else wrote the code for us originally. Can anyone help me make the modifications? Thank you so much in advance! Leah Hemeon",

          "Text": "Hi everyone We're launching a ' MySQL Moodle Reporting' course on 1st April as part of the MoodleBites series of courses.  You can read details here: http://www.moodlebites.com/mod/page/view.php?id=9112 As you can see the course start with introductions to Apache , PHP and My SQL and how they fit together within a Moodle context . We then go into some database management (even creating a miniature Moodle CMS!), and then into SQL queries, and look at some of the key plugins and external tools for reporting. The course isn't aimed at database gurus, but is aimed at people who know nothing about MySQL reporting (but would like to), through to people who have maybe tried to create reports and struggled, or Administrators who would like to be able to 'dig a little deeper' into reporting. The course has a launch fee of NZ$399, but I'm going to offer a 50% discount to people here in this Forum only , on the basis that if you enrol in the course (1st April start date only) you get really involved, and give us lots of feedback (this is a strategy we use with all our courses and a key part of our course development methodology).  You can just add a note with the code \"8044\" (the ID of this forum) to get the discount Apologies that this is half information / half advert, if you are not interested please just ignore the post. However, if you have questions I'm happy to respond here of couse Thanks, Stuart (HRDNZ, Moodle Partner, New Zealand)",

Anyway, the course is very much designed to give you the foundation skills and knwoledge needed to then go further with your own Moodle site.

However, this whole 3rd party module is kind of buggy, and I'm trying to trouble shoot a weird problem. It is running on top of a LAPP stack. It added four custom tables and injected some codes into some of the core library files (bad practice, I know): mdl_completion mdl_completion_instances mdl_ges_grade_categories mdl_ges_grade_category_progress Basically it added some lines in the /course/user.php so that it would display each student's current progress: \n```text\n            if ($tmp AND $tmp->timeinstructor > 0)\n\n\n                print_heading(get_string('completed','completion'));\n\n\n            else {\n\n\n                $tmp = get_record_\nsql\n(\"\n\n\n                    SELECT gcp.user_id, gcp.graded, gc.\napplicable_items\n\n\n                    FROM {$CFG->prefix}ges_grade_category_progress gcp\n\n\n                    JOIN {$CFG->prefix}ges_grade_categories gc ON (gc.grade_item_id = gcp.grade_item_id)\n\n\n                    JOIN {$CFG->prefix}grade_items gi ON (gi.id = gc.grade_item_id)\n\n\n                    WHERE gi.courseid = {$course->id} AND gi.itemtype = 'course'\n\n\n                        AND gcp.user_id = {$user->id}\n\n\n                \");\n\n\n                $mh_format_progress = format_float($tmp->graded * 100.0 / $tmp->\napplicable_items\n, 1);\n```\n Somehow, after I look into the applicable_items, it should be 19 but in the database it was only showing 7, so the calculation was wrong (some students are getting over 100% for their progress). Now I want to write a simple query to list out all the courses AND students who are getting >100% Progress errors. I think this would require a for-loop in Postgres SQL or something. Can I achieve this with one single Postgres DB query in pgAdmin III (or use Ad-hoc DB query block)? Or do I really need to write a simple PHP code to go through each course and do the calculation and see if any student are getting >100% percentage for their current progress? Any tips or comments would be highly appreciated. Thanks again! Wen",

          "Title": "Issues with Stats gathering and Cron",
          "Text": "Over the years I have had intermittent issues with running the Moodle cron and populating the statistical tables via it. Across the Moodle forums there are a number of discussions on the subject and suggested fixes. The most recent problems have been with Moodle 2.6 and hopefully what I found can be of use. a) Ignore all advice about fiddling with timestamps, time functions etc in the admin/cron.php file, it's fine. b) In lib/cronlib.php there is a section where it runs stats gathering for  'all other' plugins (about line 440). Unfortunately there are some filter and repository plugins that appear not to have been written correctly and so when the cron reaches this stage it throws an error and dies.  As yet I have not had the time to determine which specific filter(s) or repository is causing the problem, so as a stop gap  I comment out those functions and stop them running.  I think there needs to be some stricter testing imposed on non-standard filters / repositories to prevent this at source. c) When processing the logs and getting them in the desired format for insertion into the stats tables, the data is understandably stored in temp tables  first.  Unfortunately it appears that the field sizes of the temp tables do not match those of the log table and so data can not be inserted and the process stops. This has been a particular issue with the action field for example with the value \"moodle_user_get_course_participants_by_id\".  This may have been fixed in 2.7 but if not it's worth having a look at. Using Moodle is a huge part of our curriculum delivery and the more stats the merrier as far as my senior managers are concerned, so I'm looking forward to looking at the additions for 2.7",

The way I've done the prototype is simply to edit the core quiz code, which isn't ideal. How's best to do this properly? Should I speak to the maintainer of the quiz module about adding Tin Can tracking to a future release or is there a way I can create a plugin that can hook into quiz events (starting an attempt, completing a page/question, completing the quiz) and access relevant data (about the user, the question, the quiz, the answer selected and the score achieved).

I think TinCan throws up a lot of interesting questions, such as How do we add this functionality to the Moodle UI without just confusing most people most of the time with this weird term 'Tin Can'? What actions should be sent from Moodle to the learning record store in order to provide interesting tracking? How can that be made consistent between different Moodle activities (while allowing for the differences in activities)?I Is what is proposed in this regard roughly consistent with the emerging trends in how other systems report learning activities to LRSs? Is there a link between Tin Can statements, and Moodle events? I don't think anyone doubts that it is possible to get Moodle to do the technical business of firing off Tin Can statements over the Internet, so proof of concept code does not prove anything we did not already think was true. I think the work that needs to be done is answering the above questions.",

I'm sorry you didn't find my code helpful; I enjoyed writing it, which I think is the main thing for volunteer work and I'll leave it up in case somebody else finds it helpful. Here's some quick answers to your questions below, although some of them require more thought: 1. There's a lot of weird terms in Moodle already (CBM, SCORM , LTI ) so I think it's good that we're trying to avoid more complexity and the work to hide advanced settings in recent versions of Moodle are much appreciated. Certainly the word 'Tin Can' shouldn't be visible to learners but we do need to mark settings relating to Tin Can as such. I'd ideally like to do all the Tin Can stuff as plugins, which means it'll only appear to organisations using those plugins. 2. This is one that needs more thought on a per module basis. I've outlined my suggestions for the quiz module above, but they need more detail. This detail is likely to be the focus of the next piece of work I do on this. I don't intend to tackle other modules at this stage. 3. I think following the standard should be sufficient here. the key thing is the next question. 4. I'm not aware of other LMS adding Tin Can tracking to their quiz modules. I'll ask around though. This is an opportunity for Moodle to take the lead. 5. Again, this one needs more investigation. I suspect the difference is that there are more Moodle events than we want to track and that we'd like to put more information in the Tin Can statements. it may be that we can trigger statements from events and then get the remaining info. Any input on this question is much appreciated. Andrew",

Am I right to assume that we can easily get all data relating to an attempt (down to which option the user selected for each question) from the quiz database accessed from the local plugin? 4. How easily can we add other events to the quiz module (see list below)? Here's a list of events I'd like to track, based on what's generally tracked in SCORM style e-learning: Start/end of a session Start/end of an attempt Answering a question Ideally I'd like to track questions as they are answered so we can see where students have gone back to questions and changed their answers.

However, questions are a separate component, but treating them as a black box, and firing a very generic 'this question was answered' event is not very helpful. It would probably be more helpful to fire a more contextual event like 'this question was answered as part of this quiz' and so we somehow need to transfer information across the boundary of the black box (in one direction or another) to raise the contextual event. Even more complex, questions can be used with different behaviours (e.g. Deferred feedback or Interactive with multiple tries) so what constitutes an attempt to answer the question (rather than just saving the current value of the input as the student navigates around the quiz) is a question that only the active question behaviour plugin can answer. However, I think it is a question that Jamie Pratt has recently answered in his work on the quiz reports. There is also the issue that students attempting quizzes can be performance critical. Do we want to raise lots of events in real time there. The alternative would be to load the data from the database, and only fire the events then.",

The minimum score for a quiz will always be zero. 2. There's no concept of passing or failing a quiz, however the Moodle completion can be set based on a score. is that right? Andrew",

For consistency with how e-learning tends to be tracked, I think the object is the quiz but that leaves us with the issue of how we distinguish between finishing an attempt and completing the quiz. My thoughts are that this most closely maps to the e-learning tracking if we use the 'completed' verb to indicate a finished attempt and a 'passed' verb when the moodle activity is completed. We would then issue a failed verb if when the user finishes an attempt, and completion tracking is enabled but they have not met the criteria. Does anybody else have a view on this? Andrew",

If so, that poses a challenge for me in terms of reporting a duration. We can't simply subtract start time from end time as there could be any period of time between when the learner was not in the quiz. Any suggestions on this? Andrew",

The OAuth bit of the wiki page is saying that Moodle will authenticate itself with the LRS using OAuth. OAuth is the recommended way for server side applications to authenticate with a Tin Can Learner Record Store. Just to be clear, I don't mean that the user authenticates with the LRS, but that the Moodle application authenticates with the LRS. This is a very different application of OAuth (and version of OAuth) to the Moodle OAuth2 authentication plugin. I'm suggesting that the credentials used by the Moodle to authenticate with the LRS to send tracking data should be a different set of credentials to those used by the launch activity module. This would hopefully make it easier to track down the source in the event of a security breach.",

So what I think the \"Guest\" column is saying is this was the role of the user when they were looking at a particular course. I suppose anyone that isn't enrolled in that course would be considered to have a guest role. If users can view courses they aren't enrolled in easily then I can see how these numbers would be quite high. Or alternatively, perhaps there is a user that is performing actions on courses (e.g. an admin) that isn't enrolled in courses it is performing the actions on? Check an individual unit and look at the logs to see if the user is in fact enrolled in the course.",

Work would require granular access to table-level data, possibly field-level. Many (wise) administrators don't allow outside access to their databases, you either come in through the Moodle interface or through a VPN. Perhaps the plugin here resolves that issue but scares me all the same. Collection of user data would have to stay on-campus. When talk is made of 'having a free version' that suggests to me the plugin doesn't run unhindered by outside influence. If that is the case, exposing user data to outside parties without educational purposes violates every FERPA statute on the books (and I'm a very liberal interpreter of FERPA). The creator of the plugin has made some rather indiscreet sales initiatives towards some schools by emailing directly to their on-campus issue tracking system and surreptitiously having a work order created for a sales pitch.",

I would like to follow up on your message that you left on the form regarding the analytical tool that i developed. 1. We do not store any data on our server . We just give live connection to Moodle and the data that shows up there is a live feed. the plugin was created based on Moodle requirements and was approved by Moodle HQ and also Remote-Learner to be used for one of their customers. 2. All the interaction with Moodle goes through the webservice with I may be out of step with changes made to this plugin but the last I knew credentials needed to be given to Intelliboard in order to get it working. If it was wholly contained in Moodle it would use the moodleuser credentials and there would not be a concern for security. The fact that it was approved as a plugin does not give any guarantees of security. Example: Tim Hunt doesn't believe ad hoc reports is totally secure but ad hoc reports is approved as a plugin. Tim's concern about ad hoc reports is different than mine about Intelliboard but just proving a point. Nor does Remote-Learner's use of the plugin testify to its integrity. We have no way of knowing RL's implementation or the control they have over the server on which it is installed. No comment No comment I have been told by more than one colleague school they have received a \"sales call\" work order in their issue ticket system by way of an email sent directly to the issue tracker from Intelliboard.

          "Text": "This is likely to be an artefact of Moodle 2.x's file system.  It is completely unlike the Moodle 1.x system.  Details are here: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/File_API_internals Files you upload to Moodle are named, on disk, as the SHA1 digest of their contents.  This digest is stored in Moodle's database together with the name you gave the file.  So when you request a Moodle file, you are asking the database to look up the SHA1 digest associated with the name you gave the file, and then to find a file on the disk whose name matches that digest.  (Phew!) However, I cannot reproduce the problem Ivan describes.  I uploaded a file called \" Русский\" to my test installation of Moodle, and can download it fine. What database are you using?  If it is MySQL , you should check the character set and collation of the database as follows: \n```text\nmy\nsql\n> show create database moodle;\n\n\n+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n| \nDatabase\n | Create Database                                                                         |\n\n\n+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n| moodle   | CREATE DATABASE `moodle` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci */ |\n\n\n+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n Note that the character set is utf8 and the collation is utf8_unicode_ci; \n```text\nmysql> SELECT `table_collation` FROM `information_schema`.`tables` WHERE `table_schema` = 'moodle' AND `table_name` = 'mdl_files';\n```\n You should get one row: \n```text\n+-----------------+\n\n\n| table_collation |\n\n\n+-----------------+\n\n\n| utf8_unicode_ci |\n\n\n+-----------------+\n\n\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n Next, check the collation of the columns in the table. \n```text\nmysql> SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `moodle`.`mdl_files`;\n```\n Look at the \"Collation\" column.  You should see NULL for any BIGINT columns, and utf8_unicode_ci for the VARCHAR and LONGTEXT columns. If everything is as expected, you need to check the collation of the connection from your web server to your database.  You can do this by creating a file in your Moodle webserver's root with the following contents: \n```text\n<?php\n\n\necho '<pre>';\n\n\ninclude_once('config.php');\n\n\nprint_r($DB->get_records_sql(\"show local variables like 'character_set_connection'\"));\n\n\nprint_r($DB->get_records_sql(\"show local variables like 'collation_connection'\"));\n```\n This should give you a page that looks like this: \n```text\nArray\n(\n    [character_set_connection] => stdClass Object\n        (\n            [variable_name] => character_set_connection\n            [value] => utf8\n        )\n\n)\nArray\n(\n    [collation_connection] => stdClass Object\n        (\n            [variable_name] => collation_connection\n            [value] => utf8_general_ci\n        )\n\n)\n```\n Although there are a number of utf8-compatible collations you could use, I am not sure Moodle is 100% compatible with them all. I'd be interested to know your results. Chris",

You correctly diagnosed the problem as related to a duplicate record in the database and directed me into the correct area in your responses in Tracker http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31441 I did the search you suggested, but I still did not see duplicates. So, I took a more radical approach, based on what you said. I edited the grade_object.php file that was generating the error message and changed line 161: \" if (count($instances) > 1 { \" to a 2 . Then I went back to my site, tried to enter the quiz again, and it opened! Now I was able to deleted all attempts. Then back to line 161 and changed it back to a 1. Now, all works. But this still doesn't explain why it happened. I am going back into the database to look for whatever I might find. Also will review my questions, their scoring, and so on. Also made a backup of the quiz as a .mbz and may delete the current version and re-import it. Again, thanks for all your guidance on this. I will also follow the bug fix to see where it goes.

          "Title": "What analytics do you want?",
          "Text": "Hi, analytics fans. I recently wrote a blog post about analytics for the LMS. I attempted to create a solid definition of analytics, listed analytics I thought would be useful to students, teachers and institutions, and discussed where we could get analytics information from. You can see the entire blog post here . I don't think we have clear concensus on what analytics people want, so I thought I would copy that list here to create a starting point and promote discussion. Analytics useful to Students Progress With an LMS, it is possible to achieve regular assessment within a course based on a rich set of finely chunked multi-modal activities , and while this can lead to deep learning, it can also be overwhelming for students. It is, therefore, useful for a student to know where they are up to in a course and what they have to do next. Students who use short-term planning tend to be more successful; they just need a quick snapshot of their progress. Relative success Deep learners are more successful and deep learners are characterised by meta-cognition about their learning. Providing analytics about their relative success can allow students to know whether they are on track of if they need further exposure to a topic. Relative success can also be used to introduce a competitive element into a cohort, which some educationalists recommend. Opportunities to interact If students are studying in isolation, it may not always be apparent when there are chances for them to interact with peers or teachers. Determining the level at which a student is interacting could be seen as an analytic that can be used to direct them to opportunities for communication and collaboration. Analytics useful to Teachers Student participation In an online world, it is more difficult for a teacher to know which students are participating and those needing a push. Students can fail to participate for numerous reasons, usually valid ones. Sometimes a student may need to be encouraged to withdraw from a course and re-enrol later. Where analytics can help is in the determination of the timing of when such decisions need to be made. That’s not to say that such information needs to be complex; it could be as simple as “traffic light” coloured icons next to a list of names of students, ordered by risk. Student success Assuming a student is involved, a teacher also wants to know how successful they are. This could be the product of assessment and views of resources. If students are progressing through the course with unsuccessful results, then they may need to be encouraged to re-expose themselves to a topic within the course before progressing further. Student exposures Moving away from a course modality where “one size fits all”, it is useful to know how many times a student was exposed to a topic before they were successful. This is a differentiating factor among students in a cohort. If students are progressing with few exposures, perhaps they are finding the course too easy, perhaps even boring, and may need to be challenged further. If students are requiring numerous exposures before they are successful, then perhaps alternate presentations of a topic need to be created to suit the learning preference of particular learners. Such an analytical tool can assist a teacher to deliver learning at an individual level. Student difficulty in understanding Through an analysis of exposures and assessment results, it may be possible to determine which topics, or areas within a topic, students are finding difficult. This may indicate areas that need to be revisited in the current delivery or enhanced in a future delivery of the course. Student difficulty in technical tasks When students are undertaking learning, the last thing they want is to be stifled by an inability to express their understanding because of by the way a course is set up within the LMS. Students patterns of use within the LMS may indicate they are having such difficulties, and a teacher can be alerted to take action. Feedback attention Teachers take time and spend effort creating feedback for students as a reflection of their understanding. It is useful to know which students have paid attention to such feedback, and which students may need to be encouraged to do so. Going beyond this it may be possible to deliver information to a teacher about the effectiveness of their feedback on students’ understandings as reflected in subsequent assessment. Course quality In several institutions that I know of, part of the measurement of a teacher’s effectiveness is judged by the quality of the courses they are producing within the LMS, based on a set of metrics. Such measurements can be used for promotions and to drive the development of PD activities. If such metrics can be automated, then analytics can be produced for teachers that encourage them to improve their course by increasing the richness of their resources, improving the quality of their activities, including more activities of different kinds, providing more opportunities for students to interact or collaborate. Analytics useful to Institutions Student retention Analytics can provide more information about students than simple pass/fail rates. Analytics can help determine when students may be at risk of failing and in which courses this is more likely to happen. Such analytics can help an institution to send resources to where they are needed most and to plan resources for the future. Teacher involvement There may be ethical implications in monitoring teacher involvement in a course as it is akin to workplace survelance . However there is information in an LMS that can be presented in a useful way in relation to training and promotions. It might also be useful to anonymously tie in a teacher involvement analytic with other analytics to find correlations. Teacher success As well as looking at success in terms of pass and fail, it may also be possible to determine where teacher interventions have encouraged students to achieve beyond their expected outcomes. Relative course quality Clearly not all courses are equal, but how do you determine which is better. There have been a number of attempts to manually measure aspects of a course such as accessibility , organisation, goals and objectives, content, opportunities for practice and transfer, and evaluation mechanisms (Criteria for Evaluating the Quality of Online Courses, Clayton R. Wright). If such metrics can be automated, then analytics can be created with can reflect the quality of courses. Such metrics could also be fed back to teachers as an incentive to improve their courses. What analytics would you add to this list?",

I am a big fan of objectivity over subjectivity, based on a background in assessing students and research. However I'm not sure I agree with your inference that measures like \"student difficulty in understanding\",  \"relative course quality\" and \"teacher success\" cannot be quantified sufficiently to be generalised and useful as a basis for analytics. If student understanding is based on a combination of exposures during learning with assessment results, this can be quantified as a relative measure. Relative course quality can be measured with established, verified rubrics, and I see no reason why these cannot be automated. Teacher success can be measured by a statistical analysis of the teachers interaction with students and the level of success of those students over time. I don't think any of these analytics is beyond our potential to create. The barriers are having appropriate data and then having the time to create, test and share such analytics.",

Analyse the success of the multiple ways of teaching within a course, (i.e. presenting instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments) “ gather and interpret data on the variations of teaching and learning activity” I’d like Moodle to make it as easy as possible for teams of teachers sharing a single course to visually gather data about each other’s approaches.

Michael de Raadt has a great article on the types of Learning Analytics data Moodle HQ is looking at gathering and making available which is quite student focused, see: Analytics: getting helpful information out of an LMS The Institutional analytics data will also be really useful, I look forward to seeing how it will be implemented? However as Michael says there is definitely an issue with teachers being agreeable for others to see data about the impact of their teaching practice. Selling the benefits of sharing resources and discussing each other's approaches rather that surveillance will need to be made communicated as part of project team building exercises. \"lead to (Or not) good learning outcomes, student results and engagement with the content. \" What would “Success” benchmarks be based on? This would vary from team to team BUT they would need to be agreed to by the team of teachers at the start of a project based on the available Moodle Learning Analytics data. I would expect a major part of our learning analytics \"Success\" benchmarks will be based on reporting on how well teachers different teaching approaches have lead to students achieving good learning outcomes.

Item analysis in Moodle 1.x was simple-clean and one click away.  Unless you live and breathe Moodle 2 daily, unlikely a faculty member can find the equivalent feature once or twice a semester.  I don't understand the logic of having to go to each question and then finding the link to click to see results of a question IF all the questions have been graded - otherwise no results are displayed.  If you want to see the item analysis for all questions you must export to XML and then look at the data. Moodle 1 displayed results as questions were graded thereby allowing target grading.  Moodle 2 seems to presume everyone uses only multiple choice so there is no intermediate state of grading.  Since we combine target grading with progressive Bloom case questions, our only way of getting intermediate analytics with Moodle 2 is to constantly export the data and do our own calculations. Moodle should also prominently inform faculty that you can't get useful question level analytics if you randomize the questions in a quiz.  If you don't care how students are meeting learning objectives, then I guess it doesn't matter. Where should Moodle be? We grade at the sub-question level since we ask students put multi-part responses in tables that help them organize their thoughts.  We then add up the sub-question scores and record the grade.  If you want learning analytics, being able to record sub-question scores within a question is necessary. We look at our data across all assessment activities (i.e., longitudinal learning).  The only way to do this in Moodle is to manually export and then align the student records manually.  I would assume you could use an SQL query since Moodle data sits in a database.  Apparently you can't. Questions should be taggable with attributes such as learning objective, Bloom's level, etc.  Then meaningful assessment could be done easily.  Now it has to be done manually outside of Moodle.  If I have to export the data into another package, what is the value of Moodle?",

On the other hand if the stability and accuracy of the platform is in question then we have a student expectation management problem.

          "Text": "Sam, Here's some thoughts. You know the student name, username and id # in the moodle system, right? So, you can do a search through the logs for occasions where that person has logged on and you should also be able to identify the IP address (I think). You can ask the server administrator to send you the combined Apache log that covers the dates of access (should be fairly easy) by email and then you can establish to your satisfaction occasions where moodle is logging access from this person cross linked to the recorded log item in the Apache log file. Having done this you know with certainty that when Apache logs a hit from the IP address it is also getting recorded in the Moodle activity log. Then you can look through the Apache log for access from the IP address through the claimed period of moodle access -- it won't be there. So you can confirm that Moodle is logging all access without exception (since you've cross checked examples with the Apache log) and therefore a missing access from the Moodle log means that it didn't happen. In my 10 years of managing Moodle sites I've found that the access logging is totally reliable and is not subject to error. Perhaps showing the user and Teacher of the course the instances of course access that have been recorded in the log can throw light on where the access did not happen. Hope some of this helps Mark",

          "Text": "Hello, Our students attend approx. 7-8 courses per term.  Within these courses, students are required to pass 4 unit tests. They must pass all unit tests before promotion to the next level.   As mentioned, unit tests appear across multiple moodle courses. Through webservices our SIS currently only retrieves final Moodle course grades for our SIS grade reports.  It is important, however,  for our Coordinators to locate and assist students with unit failures so as to set up retests, etc. Grades are entered as Moodle offline assignments but navigating through 6 + moodle courses across multiple levels to retrieve unit test grades is not a favorable option.   They are forced to input all unit tests scores on a separate and rather large spreadsheet where they can manually highlight failures.  There is a dual grade entry system going on.  Not good. Of course, we would like grades simply to be inputted into Moodle and then be able to run a weekly  report to gather all unit test scores. What would be the best way to approach this and solve our problem? Thank you in advance for any help. Regards, Joe",

At present when people have a long list of outcomes, it is not so easy to add them quickly, so a tree will be easier. So a simple father/child aspect added to outcomes would be good. Of course people don't have to use a hierarchy, but most of the standard outcomes I have seen specifications for are hierarchy based where a number of outcomes achieved, achieve the outcome above them and so on. I love the idea of a rubric being created automatically from a chosen outcome (and its children outcomes)",

          "Text": "From documentation I read from UK Quality Assurance Organization QAA . I got to know that credits of a course is awarded as a result of a student showing evidence of outcome achievement (qualitative judgment) not necessarily by grading an assessment (quantitave judgement). In designing a course, the course objectives/outcomes act as a guide to what the syllabus, assessment plan, the credit level and a whole other factors will be. I am developing (still on going) a course management for A1Academia and here are a few ideas I would like to share. Outcomes can be categorized in these categories: Qualification level(SIS) Program Level(SIS) Course Level(SIS/LMS) Assessment Level(SIS/LMS) Question level (LMS) The brackets beside the categories indicate where they are best defined and managed. Qualification level outcomes(QLO) focus on a student's qualification achievement e.g has minimum credit for the qualification been achieved? Program level outcomes (PLO) , more like a degree audit evaluation, deals with an assessment if the student has met the requisite requirements, has registered min required class attendance, has met the overall academic program outcomes linked to course level outcomes e.g if a PLO is \"a student should employ scientific analysis and problem solving in the field of study\". Course Level Outcomes (CLO) are more subject specific and extend some of the PLOs. CLOs determine if a student gets credit for the course or not. These outcomes dictate on the assessment plan to be employed, on the syllabus etc. Assessment Level Outcomes (ALO) narrow down to specific areas within the course. They extend CLO in a stricter fashion in that achievement of all mandatory assessment outcome leads to an automatic achievement of parent CLOs . A student may excel in an assignment but doesn't convince the instructor interms of outcomes. Assessments have questions. Questions could have outcomes also. An example is an essay kind of question that tests a student on a particular concept can have one or more outcomes that contribute to ALOs. An outcome in my view is a scoring rubric where it defines an attribute to be measured, and a list of possible outcomes, some +ve and others -ve. In a Programmer's language, those with +ve return 1 and the -ve a 0. For moodle(LMS) the cycle revolves around the cycle of the course. For an SIS the cycle is the student's academic career. Which means moodle will be producing a students outcomes profile for each course offered so that an SIS can determine whether to award credit for the course and later the PLOs and so on.",

Regarding Overview item 3 \" Develop reports with graphs for teachers \" I would suggest using the completion tracking options in Moodle 2 as a model as this produces an excellent and very teacher-friendly view of progress in the \"Activity completion\" report. We need something just as clear for outcomes. Building on Gavin's suggestion of hierarchy I think that a similar system to that used by completion tracking and conditional access settings could be used or built on e.g. check if the three child outcomes x.1, x.2, x.3 are complete then indicate that the parent competency x is complete. In other words instead of allowing access to the next activity, satisfactory completion (marked manually or automatically) of any selected outcomes will provide a further group or parent \"tick\" that indicates completion of this group of outcomes. Look forward to following suggestions and developments on this important proposal.",

We have noticed when using outcomes that when you apply them to more than 1 activity in a course, (Which of course is common in this capacity) they present themselves in the gradebook next to each of the activities, but it would be nice for a final collective outcome result when all the activities using the particular outcome are satisfied. This would include something that recognises the number of activities the outcome is aligned to and therefor provides a percentage of completion for that outcome each time another activity is completed. We cannot seem to find where to do this unless it is not possible, and if that is the case, it would be a great feature to improve within the outcomes area.

          "Text": "I like the simple tree-like hierarchy structure initially. In addition to that,  being able to \"tag\" outcomes by grade level would be useful. The grade level isn't always part of the tree. For instance, US career and technical standards are not grade level specific - they are for all high school students, so they could all be tagged with 9, 10, 11, and 12.   Whereas national science standards, even covering similar topics, have separate standards written for each grade level.  One might want to sort by a specific topic, and ignore level - for instance, a teacher teaching many grade levels.  I am an agriculture teacher, and teach students grades 9-12, but I might be interested in viewing lower-level math standards by their topic areas.  Even though measurement conversions may be learned in elementary and middle school, I see value in reinforcing and practicing that at the high school level, so I might want to ignore grade-specific aspects of a tree structure when searching a standard set in Math, for instance.  But some teachers who only teach one grade may want to sort out all standards so that they're seeing other subject areas beyond their own even, but only for that grade, so they have some idea of what their students are learning in other classes. Having the grade level be part of the tree structure would require making a \"duplicate\" of those standards in each of the grade levels it is part of - and that might be 13 duplicates that aren't actually connected, in some subject areas. It would probably be good if institutions could add their own grade level options, too.  For instance, a middle school may only want to include grades 6-8.  Or, the entire school district may have a Moodle and want pre-K through 12.  Or maybe, a school has an articulation agreement with a local college and offers some courses for college credit, and/or high school credit.  So some \"odd\" grade level might be required, such as Grade 13 at any university.  Or Grade 13 - ABC Institution only.  Etc...   So the grade level options should be editable. This would also help teachers to facilitate looking at how \"well\" a particular student reached a particular outcome in a grade-specific course, and they might know that that student may need extra practice in a certain area in their grade level if outcomes are also tied to specific users.   Teachers of different subject areas would benefit too.  For instance, sometimes as an agriculture teacher, I'm not familiar with how much all my students know about graphing - parabolas, sin waves, etc, and I need to talk about those types of graphs in a wildlife ecology class, but it might be useful to know which students have that subject down, and which never elected to enroll in Algebra.  Or, being I have a wide age-range, sometimes geometry concepts are familiar to some of my students, and completely new to others. So also that idea of having outcomes being linked to a user - and somehow even when the same outcome may be used in different subject area by different teachers - would be a neat tool if it could be implement.",

This worked fine in our 1.9 version but is causing issues in the upgraded 2.5 version. There seems to be a conflict when group mode is set in the course settings. There are two closely related issues arising with this role and groups (in 2.5 or because of the upgrade?). 1. When \"Force group mode\" in a course's settings is set to \"yes\", this produces an error when the parent attempts to click on that course in their child's profile page (in order to see their grades for that course). If the \"Force group mode\" is set to \"No\" this error does not occur and the click through works. 2. If the \"Group mode\" is set to either \"Separate groups\" or \"Visible groups\" the option for the parent to view the student's gradebook is not made available (the \"Profile settings for 'student'\" - \"Activity report\" - \"grade\" path is not available). However, if this is changed back to \"No groups\" then the parent is able to see the gradebook for the student. Example. The images below show that the gradebook is available for one subject but not for another, in the same student's profile as accessed by a \"parent\" account. We have to use group mode for courses. Is this a bug? Is there a workaround for this so that we can use group mode and also continue to offer the ability for parents to see their children's gradebook using their own accounts (i.e. not sitting down with their child and consulting the gradebook with them)?",

If I change the group settings on a course to \"Do not force\", but still have group mode set to either visible or separate groups, then the first error shown in my post is resolved. However, the second problem is not resolved - parents cannot see the option to consult the grade of their child for that course. If I then remove group mode \"Group Mode\" \"None\" then everything works fine and it is possible to see the grades for each course that that student is enrolled on. It allows us to see the \"User report gradebook\". Two screenshots below show the process. Go to the student's profile page from the \"Mentees\" block, click on a course that that student is enrolled in, click on Profile settings for \"student x\", select \"Activity reports -grade\". 1. With group mode set to \"None\" the option to see the grade for a mentee is made available (otherwise, if group mode is set to separate or visible groups, this is not made available). 2. Mentors/parents are able to see the \"User report\" from the gradebook (but they will not, of course, be able to see columns that have been \"hidden\" by the grader in the gradebook configuration). The case is that in version 1.9 the group mode setting in courses did not interfere with the possiblity for parents to see childrens' grades. We cannot work in courses without groups so, unfortunately, it is not an option for us to remove group mode from courses (we have over 200 courses). At the moment we are sacrificing the ability for parents to see their childrens' grades using their own account (they can of course sit down with their children and look at their gradebook with them, but this is not always what parents want and the students do not react well to it. It strikes me that this must be a bug, or is there some other config setting that will prevent the error?",

I do not have a tracker account so cannot contribute there. Is there any way of getting the issue \"elevated\" or does it depend on \"votes\"? The ability to see the \"User report\" is certainly good. I attach another screenshot which shows the behaviour when certain categories and items have been hidden by the grader in the gradebook configuration. As you can see, what is returned is half of the gradebook with the sections to the right hidden from view since the grader has hidden them in the gradebook. Would very much like to get the bug fixed. It strikes me that it may not be that difficult to resolve. It must be related to how permissions behave (misbehave) with groups.

          "Text": "Hi guys, I am working on a report plugin for Moodle, the main purpose of which is to allow for the user to 'nail down' further into the log files already provided by Moodle. The input is in the form of 4 dropdown boxes, as follows: Report Type (this is the main part, where the user can select a report such as 'Course Views' / 'Resource Views' / 'Forum Posts') From date To date (this and the above obviously work in conjunction to allow the user to select a date range from the beginning of the course to the current date) User (this selection is either All Users / Selection of one user enrolled within the course) Obviously the SQL query run is dependent on the selection of these - the way I see it, for using 'Course Views' as an example, will be by using something similar to the following: SELECT time, user, course FROM {log} WHERE module = 'course' AND action = 'view' I understand this is very dumbed down SQL, though I've just come to a relative standstill on the two points below: Is there an added benefit in using a moodleform as opposed to html_writer:: ? Is querying the mdl_log table suitable or going to balloon the time it takes to process (the reason I've chosen it is that it already provides a great level of detail) The output when the user clicks a 'Submit' button once selecting from the dropdown boxes, will be a table of data resulting from the query that matches their input. After this, I want to take this data and visualise it, preferably using the D3.js library, however that's quite a way off right now. Sorry it's quite a longwinded question, I've just been shifting through masses of code from core plugins to third-party ones and they have many different ideas and ways of implementation, so I thought I'd try and pick the minds of people here who could give me a push in the right direction. Many thanks, Jordan",

          "Text": "Hi Jordan, Before I answer your queries I invite you to have a look at our new events and logging infrastructure:- http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2 http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_2 Please note that the logging interfaces are not finalised at this point and still under development. These changes are going to make the logs much richer and flexible. Here is response to your queries:- Is querying the mdl_log table suitable or going to balloon the time it takes to process (the reason I've chosen it is that it already provides a great level of detail) Avoid using the log table. Since this table would be supported only for legacy logs 2.7 onwards. Instead you can use the new logging interface to get logs and build your report around it. We would have an api something like get_events() where you can easily filter the logs you want by component/user/type of action/ read or write actions etc. I would suggest you wait a couple of weeks, until we finalise the specs on the new logging interfaces and put up a prototype for public comments. Is there an added benefit in using a moodleform as opposed to html_writer:: ? The biggest advantage in my opinion is custom validations and security. On top of that there are lot of other additional adminstrative advantages, such as setting default values, freezing fields and much more. You can go through our docs ( http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Form_API ) for a detail explanations of what you can do with moodleforms. Hope that helps Cheers",

I've had a good look through and it seems great, however the only worry is about the date that it will be ready for development use. Unfortunately, I have a deadline to complete this project implementation by the end of January (preferably) at the latest. I'll have a further look at the new infrastructure, however if its release is too far away, I may have to do some testing with the existing mdl_log table, with the hope of updating this for the release of the new infrastructure. Am I right in presuming that by 'legacy logs 2.7' you refer to the upcoming 2.7 version of Moodle, with legacy logs being the current ones in use? Thanks for the information of the form usage too, I think I'll go ahead as planned and make use of the moodleform . Best, Jordan",

Outside of Moodle we're able to monitor IOPS, bandwidth, total number of requests, server loads, etc. but I'm interested in Moodle specific errors such as how many times an item can't be created or can't be found. For example, if: \n```text\n$component = $cache->get('component');\n```\n returns a value of false is this recorded anywhere?

But, you can configure the navigation block in the block settings \"Generate navigation for the following\"  ->  I changed this pull down to  just categories and courses.  That will create a much more minimal sized block.  At least thats our preference.  hope that helps.

I have set all activity completion settings on all levels site, course, activity (hopefully) and students can mark/tick their activities as completed ... BUT... On \"Course administration > Reports > Activity completion\" all I get is an error message: \"There are no students on this course or group for whom completion information is displayed. (By default, completion information is displayed only for students, so if there are no students, you will see this error. Administrators can alter this option via the admin screens.)\" However, there is students on the course and I have tried with a new course and a new student accounts with same depressing results. - If I remember right this worked some months ago, but not anymore. Server cron job is ok. That is the latest thing I have checked but now I am out of ideas. Btw , what are the options on the error message which administrator can alter? Statistic report work OK and I can see that students have been active etc. No matter if I make a totally  new course with a new students and turn on all settings and make tests. -Still this error message. -Maybe You can help. -Antti-",

Having selected Activity reports my teacher would click 'Complete report' and view all the contents of graded and ungraded online assignments in the order they appeared in the course. Here's why this was useful for him: \"This enabled me to see at a glance how a student was responding to successive online assignments -- sometimes the quality of writing would decline markedly and I could pick this up\" \"Also I could grade successive assignments by student and note how they were progressing\" Thus this display of Activity afforded an approach which made possible grading by student rather than by assignment. Now we're at moodle 2.5.1 and the Outline report (Administration : Profile settings for [student user]>  Activity reports > Complete report shows only the first week and we're currently at week four. Ditto, the Outline report only show the first week. I think what I'm seeing here is a bug. It seems to me that the display of Activities is rudely truncated. I'll upload some screenshots later today which illustrate the problem better. If the 'Complete report' showed all the Assignment activities (as I would hope it should do) then we'd be home and dry.",

          "Text": "Hi Joseph, Actually I was trying to show both, but to put a significant spin on it. I recall a lecturer once telling me that if a student had not logged into Moodle to access the materials after one week of the course beginning, that they were already behind. This is not necessarily the case for every module, every course everywhere, but for that lecturer, that college, that course, it was. I have seen and heard similar events from different places, however the context is king. Only the teacher could probably know if the person who has not accessed it, is going to be at a disadvantage, or if the person who is accessing it a lot may be struggling. The only thing that a report or analytics can say, is that the behaviour of those two people are not the norm, and that one is statistically quite far from the norm - ie, related to their peers. So if that document is a crucial practical guidance information, or assessment guidelines which need to be read by a certain time, this is another bit of information which needs to be analysed. Now yes, perhaps this should be a completion element, which can then be tracked as complete or not to identify the non-activity, but hyper activity cannot be tracked by that approach. So how does one approach such things? I love statistics, I love the buzz from analysis and the identification of habit and  or abnormalities. I hope to be starting a test project where some analysis of relative analytis can be tested for specific criteria analysis relative to expectations relative to peers relative to overall individual performance So if an expectation (e.g. study logs into Moodle within 1 day of course beginning) is not met, this is identified So if a students (e.g. grade on an assignment) is significantly different to that of his peers on that activity it can be tracked So if a students performance in one module is significantly different to his performance in another module, that this can be identified. What someone does or interprets these as is a different matter, however they are statistically significant albeit, once context is added they may not be important, or they may be very important.",

I'm a self-confessed \"data junkie\", but I believe it's important to start with a realistic scope of what we hope to learn (accurately) from Analytics.  I've taken to paraphrasing George Siemens \"Analytics doesn't provide answers, it just helps us to ask better questions.\" If all teachers would use the gradebook, frequently and often (heck, even consistently while we're aspiring) we would get great predictive indicators of student success.   Until that time, clickstream / usage data seems like the best common data measures that we have.  Maybe we’re trying to solve a teaching/learning issue with technology – but that said, there is a lot that we can ask and advance our learning. Here’s a chart pulled from usage data on a single course (373 students) that shows some of that usefulness, and some of the complexity in the data.  There’s an overall positive correlation between activity (hits and time) and grade (e.g. more time in Moodle, but students who are Pell-Eligible  (e.g. low income) spend much more time than students who are not Pell-eligible. So in this example, the amount of time v. grade is positive in some cases, but possibly problematic for others. What does this mean?  Is this good or bad?  That’s not a question we can answer with this data – just the what, not the “why” or the “so what”. That said, we’re beginning our Moodle analytics effort with more robust usage measures around adoption.  Looks like configurable reports might be a good step in that direction, maybe we could decide on a few to get “adopted” by core?",

So, reports - be they push or pull - appear to be useful for researchers and middle managers, but not so useful for teachers (though there are always exceptions).

We use Moodle for asynchronous distance learning, and one of the most difficult problems our instructors face is knowing how the students are doing before they achieve or fail to achieve an outcome. Outcomes are inherently summative; the learning process also needs to include attention to formative indicators. I'd like to see a way for instructors to rate resources and activities in importance beyond simply marking them to collect completion or not, so students can see which resources are most important and instructors can see if students are paying attention appropriately. I'd also like to see built-in tools to allow students to rate the helpfulness of resources, and possibly ways to automatically sort resources by student ratings. (For that matter, I'd like to see more formalized ways for students to contribute and rate resources, but I'm planning to use Database for that.)",

Well, we have just had Zabbix installed by our IT dept to monitor our Moodle server . Part of this monitors login page loads, LDAP response times etc. So our IT created a monitoring account on Moodle that now creates 22000 records a day..gulp! The actions are 'Course View' and 'user login' every 10 seconds. Does anyone else have that level of monitoring? Is it a problem to have that type of monitoring? And most importantly (from a log viewing perspective) is it possible to exclude that one user activity from showing in the logs? It makes them far too large and difficult to scan for 'real' user behaviour. If its possible what additional code would we need to add to the DB and exactly where would it need to be added?

We use passive monitoring based on the logs and not in real time, and for more active approach like response time and so on we have a separate, smaller server with a copy of the site to find any difference between new versions or local updates. The easiest solution I could think of requires a change in the core, something no one is ever happy to do: In the very beginning of add_to_log function, just add something like: if ($user == [the user id to ignore] ) return; It's the easiest solution because instead of adding exception on every file calling to this function, you can control it from one place. Another approach is to delete the records from the log table. However, I don't know about you but I really prefer not to play with one of the most active records.",

You could export all the data, and then \"prune the records\" out side the time you had.   How many thousands/millions of records do you have? I'm guessing these solutions are probably much more complicated than you'd like.

To get information from old records you'll need to do it the 'old school' way. I'm no SQL expert, but here is my suggestion bor the basic search: SELECT * FROM mdl_log WHERE course=[course id] AND time >= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)) AND (DAYOFWEEK(FROM_UNIXTIME(time)) = 7 OR DAYOFWEEK(FROM_UNIXTIME(time)) = 1) AND (HOUR(FROM_UNIXTIME(time)) < 9 OR HOUR(FROM_UNIXTIME(time)) >= 17) Since the date/time functions work with formatted time there is a lot of convertion from the timestamp in the logs. Furthermore, I didn't include the daylight saving time option because I've only used it in PHP and have no idea how to calculate it with SQL commands. Remember, this query is only the start. You'll need to decide how much of it will be in SQL and how much in PHP. Either way, this will result in a (relatively) long processing time, much longer than the usual server timeout. So, if you're planning to run it throught a browser I'd suggest printing something every now and then to keep the page alive.",

          "Text": "Hi everybody, I hope I'm in the right forum. I have an idea for another log system and would appreciate your opinion. We have a need for periodical reports that will give basic statistics for the activities in a course, showing the number of views, updates etc. As of now, the usual approach is running through mdl_log and selecting all records that match the selected course and time period. Problem is, our site contains over Hundred of courses and thousands of users and the result is a huge amount of data that even after regular backup and cleaning is still very heavy. One of the ideas is to create a new log table that will contain much less data and will be used for basic information. Now for some technical stuff... The table structure is very simple: id, time, course, module, view_counter, add_counter, edit_counter, delete_counter The first four values are similar to those in mdl_log and the rest are simple counters. The idea is that while the usual add_to_log function collects user, time, ip and so on, this table will contain the activities counters for every module. Another difference is the the time field will not contain the current time but the current month . This way one record will hold information for a single course module for a whole month (or a whole week, depends on the need). The advantage is a very fast, very target specific statistical tool that will show the different activities in one or several courses over a period of time, pointing out the less used instances and so on. However, there are some serious disadvantages. The developer will need to go through all the places in the modules that call to add_to_log and add near it a call to the new log [ for example: log_action(courseid, moduletype, actiontype) ] While add_to_log just add a new record, here there is a need to look for a record by specific time, course and module values in order to update it. On one hand, this table will be relatively small to work with, but on the other hand it will be called constantly from every page. And this is the major problem here. I looked for similar issues and didn't find anything close enough so I don't know if a similar idea has been discussed here before. If so, I'll be happy if someone will direct me there.",

Currently all students enrolled in the Moodle site are from one campus and I can see their for example the last time they logged in and talk to the students who are not logging in regularly. When I had students from other campuses, I would like to pull a report of just those students and send it to their contact. Is this possible?  Can it be done with groups??",

Its basic structure comes from rubrics that are enriched with collaboration, student study and past grading performance criteria. You can download the plugin here .

I'm thinking that with the title 'Engagement analytics' you're probably thinking \"this student is 71% engaged\" whereas we are thinking \"this student is 71% dis engaged\".

          "Text": "Yes, I have experience of JasperReports. JasperReports is good and has many options however, there are limits to how you can use it, however it does offer print-perfect reporting, so is very useful for some types of reports. One of the points I would recommend considering is whether one should use a BI tool directly on a live Moodle site or should one have either a slave-clone or even a fully warehoused copied which has been ETL -ed so that heavy queries do not overload a live site. Of course if your server hosting the Moodle has has been specced to handle the live site and the extra reporting too should not be an issue. As they are not PHP, one also needs Java experience and hosting environment. Another issue in using an external reporting tool, is that who permissions, capabilities on who can run what reports, perhaps with hierachy driven from Moodle etc... Personally speaking, If given a choice of using JasperReports for Moodle or just building a reporting interface where you can leverage more complex reports, and contextual (based on user permissions / capabilities) - I would not use Jasper.",

We're working on coming up with common queries that we can use to determine usage at the a) course, b) faculty/instructor, and c) student level - e.g. \"What percentage of course sections offer are using Moodle\".  Simple reporting - like # of course shells in the system, or # of course shells visible, aren't accurate - because we create a course shell for every section, and visible doesn't mean really used. What queries and reports are other institutions using for core usage metrics?  What do you consider and what thresholds do you set? Thanks, John",
