For testing purposes, I’m using the “Hangman” and “Crossword” activities . When I select “Questions” as the “Question source” (since I’ve already created a test question), and choose the course’s “Default” category, the system does not display the question I created, even though it is correctly linked to the category. I’ve attached two screenshots to make the analysis easier: The first shows the activity configuration, where I specify the question source and category. The second shows that there is a question created and linked to the mentioned category. Additional information:: Moodle version: 4.5 (Build: 20241007) Plugin version: 2025-04-22 (2025042200) Could you please assist me? Thank you.",

In the Hangman game I built a glossary with 10 words without spaces and without special characters, and in the Hangman activity settings I indicated to use 10 words from the glossary. Some words, however, appear multiple times, while others do not appear. The same happens with the Millionaire: I set the quiz with 15 questions and in the Millionaire activity I select No in the \"Randomize questions\" field. Some questions appear multiple times and others are never presented. This creates confusion when the solution to the games is proposed in plenary. Is there some setting to use to avoid this problem?

          "Text": "It sounds like you're trying to add questions to a crossword puzzle, but you're getting stuck in the question bank and not being able to add them to the game. Let me guide you through the process: Create or open a crossword puzzle : Make sure you're in the crossword section and have either started a new puzzle or opened an existing one. Access the question bank : In the crossword editor, there’s typically an option to view or manage the question bank. This is where your stored questions live. Select questions from the question bank : Once you're in the question bank, look for a way to either choose or add questions to your current game. Depending on the plugin, this might involve selecting individual questions or importing them into the puzzle. Add questions to the crossword : There should be a button or option to add the selected question to the grid. This might be labeled something like \"Add to Puzzle,\" \"Insert into Grid,\" or simply “Use in Game.” Review the crossword grid : After adding your questions, check that the clues and answers are showing up correctly in the grid, adjusting if necessary. Save and play : Once you’ve added all your questions and clues, save your puzzle and start playing! If you're not seeing an option to add questions to the grid, it might be a specific feature or setting of the plugin you're using. It might help to check the plugin’s documentation or reach out to the support team for more detailed instructions. Regards, ovaroms.com",

If someone knows, I'll be happy to write up some documentation on https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/mod/game/millionaire I've put the questions in the question bank in the correct order using question names starting with 01, 02, 03, ... but that is also not respected. I 've found an old forum post https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=116101#p560270 that talks about the ability to order questions in the question bank, but I can't find that feature, nor documentation about it in the current Moodle version (3.8) I've also noticed that the shuffel answer setting in the question is not respected. Answers are always shuffled. Can that be prevented in any way? Kind regards Koen",

I have been looking at the vast array of excellent available plugins trying to find one that does what I want, but so far have not been able to. The scenario is that I want to display a ladder where Avatar one appears on the left and Avatar two appears on the right. Each Avatar moves up or down their side in response to the answer to a player selected question, selected from pre-existing possibilities. Ideally the player would be able to select which Avatar they wish to play as. An example of how this could be used would Avatar 1 would be Aircraft Passenger, Avatar 2 would be Cabin Crew If the ladder is showing how to maintain calmness in a aircraft Avatar 1 question can I have a drink please. Avatar 2 responses a/ Yes certainly b/ NO! If the player selected b then the Avatar 1 and 2 would move up their sides of the ladder towards disruption at the top. If the player selected a then they would both stay where they were. the next question would again move them up or down the ladder as a result of their response. Does anyone have any suggestions of a plugin that would allow this? Regards Paul",

After installation, I had to change the permissions from the control panel and it works. However, just found a bug. Old glossaries aren't deleted from the plugin \"memory\" despite having been deleted from a course and caches purged. Asa result, this has multiplied the number of available categories (one from each former glossary). Of course, if a glossary no longer exists, this leads to an errror. My solution has neen to change glossary names so I can distinguish the latest glossary from old ones. Has anyone encountered this issue?",

          "Text": "Hi Alex, Do you mean the Activites/Games plugin found here: https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_game ? If so, the questions are drawn from a Book Resource that you create beforehand. So the general steps are: In the course where you want to use the Game-Book activity, Add a Book Resource and create several chapters. Each chapter title will be a question heading in the Game-Book quiz and the chapter content will be the content of the \"question\" After you have saved the Book, go to Add an activity or resource,  then choose Games, Book with questions The page should then look something like that shown below with the select a book drop-down already selecting the Book you just created. Fill in the rest of the options and Save. It should now work If you run into Error 500 - Internal File Server errors you'll have to fix these on your server. I've found that if you follow the steps here , that should fix the error. Apparently this is a Moodle system bug that was re-introduced in version 3.x and is slated for fixing in a new release. Hope this helps cheers, Derek",

          "Text": "I don't use the game module much but I'm trying to provide instructions for how to set it up if the builder wants to use the User Defined Background for the 2.5 version of Snakes and Ladders. I had some reasonably good instructions for the 1.9 module but there are some new things that I don't know how to explain. I generally understand the concept of the snakes/ladders positions and columns/rows...this lets you create larger boards, if you like, I suppose, and define the number of columns and rows...like 10X10, with 5 of each.  But what are the Space at up left and right and Space at bottom left and right? I'm looking at the defaults for the 8X8 and it looks like it's supposed to be 4 for each one, which matches the number of snakes/ladders.  Is it really that simple or is there something more? I'm also looking at the height/width options, which are available whether you are using the user defined option or not.  But with the 8X8 and 6X6 options, they empty out when you save.  Are they supposed to grey out like the cols, rows, space fields do when User defined isn't selected? Many of the modules in Moodle have general settings information available but I don't find anything here on settings and there isn't much in the help options either.  Maybe the settings are really obvious to everyone else and I'm just missing something...But it might be nice to have some documentation how-to for those of us who are special-ed with the games module. That said, I'd be willing to provide my directions for each game (they're all mostly the same now) moodle docs if anyone wants them but I need to be able to finish them. Also, the module has a spelling error in \"Space at bootom left.\"",

Unless I'm mistaken, and hopefully I am, you will need some outside tools to help. For example If you want to present and demonstrate the software to your students in action, you could use recordmydesktop or similar software, upload the video to youtube, then link it to your moodle course.

I created a glossary with the following words (in brackets for you the English word): Erdöl (petroleum), grün (green), März ( March), Straße (street), Übung (exercise) If I create a hangman game basing on this glossary and try it to start, it gives me the error \"There are no words\". The letters ä, Ä, ö, Ö, ü, Ü and ß are the cause, but often used in german words If I add another word to the glossary without one of these letters, everything is fine but the game uses only this word. A possible solution could be (standard solution in the german version of hangman) to replace these letters by two letters: Ü, ü => UE (=> GRUEN, UEBUNG) Ö, ö => OE (=> ERDOEL) Ä, ä => AE (=> MAERZ) ß => SS (=> STRASSE) What do you think, is it possible?

When she tests the game, it pulls up questions which don't exist in the question bank.  As far as I can tell, they don't exist at all.  I've searched the database for the questions or parts of the questions and get nothing.  This shouldn't be possible. As for my version, which I'm sure someone will say to upgrade...yes, I know.  I'm working on that (July!!!).  But it doesnt solve or even explain the immediate problem.",

          "Text": "Today our IT support sat down and dug into this.  The game was set to look at the course question bank but the mystery questions were pulling from a glossary in a different course (in a completely different category!).  When we looked at other games we found the same problem.  We went to the course and there were a couple games.   We deleted the games from the course (it isn't currently in use) and all the games everywhere else started working again. The problem is solved but we still don't know why it happened.  I have a suspicion that the glossary may have been created with cut/paste from word and the creators may not have cleaned the HTML out.  Sometimes the html from word is pretty ugly.  The only thing I can think of is that there is something weird in the glossary html that when it got pulled into a game it freaked out the whole module.  I have no idea what sort of HTML could do that but it's the only idea I have.  I'm thinking of cleaning up their glossary (apparently I'm an on-line maid) but haven't gotten the chance.",

When a student enters a course they are placed in a group.  For the purpose of the games module they will all see the same glossary.   However students in group A would like to work with a specific category of the glossary while other groups have there own categories.  All in the same course.   It would also be very useful if when a student from category A reaches a level of competency they are automatically moved up to a higher level of challenge. The games module is a credit to you and I congratulate you on your exceptional efforts. John",

I thought there is a standard way to implement group support: Almost all the core modules and many contributed modules support groups, so that if a module ( both Content or Activity ) is added to a course that has groups and groupings, you can define access and/or visibility for the module in the interface for editing the module. If your module supported groups (and, by the way, support for Grade category would also be great!), there would be a section under editing the module (the interface where you choose what game to use, where questions are taken from, game specific settings, etc.) called \" Common module settings \" It would have boxes and choices Group mode Grouping Available for group members only Visible ID number Grade category As far as I know (and the title for the section is Common module settings, after all) this is standard interface/parameters for modules. If you look at the Edit/Settings page of any core activity, for example a Quiz, you will see what I mean (you may have to click the \"Show advanced\" button to see all the options I listed above). I hope you will implement this, as it is a standard feature for Moodle modules and one that we rely heavily on, as I mentioned in my original post. We really love these games, so it would be a shame if we can't use them! Best, T",

Por ejemplo, para que salga 'esté', hice click en el boton HTML y en vez de 'e' puse &eacute; - o sea, el codigo de HTML que significa 'é' . Ya que estoy usando TinyMCE podria haver copiado y pegado de cualquier otra fuente (mas sencillo) pero me imagino que con el plugin 'game' no se dispone de esta facilidad. De todas maneras debes poder hacer el truco con HTML - solo que te busques los codigos adecuados para tus necesidades (yo, ahora, los saque de http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/bylanguage/spanish.html ) Saludos",

When selecting a glossary, it then gives you a selection for the category - I get a list of all the categories on the site and have to find mine. Could you populate this with only categories from that glossary? Or do you even need the category? Even when I populated a glossary with categories, it kept giving me an error saying that no words were found. MOST of the terms in our glossaries are not categorized, so could you maybe include an option for 'All entries'? It didn't seem to take changes in the settings very well - I started out with one quiz, then changed to another, and had to lose a game before it would update. Could you do a check for the ability to view user grades and only display the table if they have that capability? Thanks, Matt",

          "Text": "Hey Vasilis, hey community! First of all a big \"thanks\" for the moodle game module, its really cool and i am going to use it for my university course. A question regarding the phone joker: Is it possible to write my own text to be displayed as joker? It would be cool to adjust the joker to the acutal question. Even better: Would it be possible to play a mp3-file as joker to make the \"game experience\" more real? Another question regarding the questions: Is it possible to allow a feedback after an answer? The questions allow a feedback, the millionaire-game doesn't. Can this be enabled? It would be nice, to explain correct or wrong answers to the students. The super feature would be to show a movie-sequence or play a mp3-file as feedback. Is this possible in any way? Thanks a lot for your help!! Thomas",

Also installing it broke my moodle cron job, which took a few days for me to nootice. Forum posts not beiung sent, courses not being backed up, eek.. Turns out it was the some code in the game module preventing the cron. I have looked through the CVS and old downloads on forums and cannot find a version that works.

On other attempts, the game mixes the definitions and words and therefore you have to guess a word based on another word's definition. For example, the glossary/question category has 2 words: House (place where you live) and Dog (man's best friend). When you play for the first time the game asks you to guess HOUSE and the hint is \" place where you live \". When you complete the game and want to try it again, the game asks you to guess HOUSE , but the hint instead would be: \" man's best friend \". You would normally answer DOG, but the game asks for the word HOUSE. I've tried on both Glossary and Short Answer modes and still I have the same problem. Also, I have a suggestion: a button to end the game even if you didn't finish it. Also a restriction of number of attempst would be fine.",

If I close the web browser, before I finish the puzzle, it will come back with characters missing. On some glossaries I close the puzzle and come back, it is just like I left it.

Is it possible this version of game left some garbage which moodle can't handle?

For some reason the Sudoku glossary and Picture Glossary games took two plays before the result showed in the grade book, possibly because the first attempt was identified as continuing a previous uncompleted game.

There are some others online though it seems. I was thinking of using university students but perhaps even giving small cash prizes! The initial impetus for wanting this sort of functionality is because games are used in cultural psychology e.g. in the work of Yoshio Yamagishi http://www.istc.cnr.it/T3/map/cells/env-soc.html He finds that Japanese and Americans play games similarly until the strategies of other players is a secret. Then Japanese play more un-altruistically, due to lower levels of generalised trust, he argues. I thought that the protection vs. promotion mechanism \"nickel\" experiment here http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Psych407/Takeshi_april3.pdf might work well in a game theory paradigm, using instead of nickels, some sort of display of trust, like the points at ebay. It would be predicted that Americans would be motivated to increase (promote) their \"trust points\", but that Japanese would be more motivate not to allow their trust points to decrease (protection). As well as just a game with payoffs, I would really want some way of displaying a players past behaviour. But it sounds like it would cost about 3000 dollars to program. And I already have one experimental psychology module, the TUI to keep up. Tim",

Where would the validate/db update code go? I can see a reference to function 'insert-record' in the 'hangman_add_instance' function in lib.php. Is this function already written or is this for me to write? Would this be where the validate/db insert stuff goes?

Hangman and sudoku works fine.

Here's a couple suggestions that might or might not be helpful (it's more of an opinion, than a real problem) What do you think about changing the name and images of this game so that it's NOT actually about hanging anyone ? I don't think it would take anything away from the game and I think it would be better suited for elementary school students. You could use a pie chart, for example. What do you think about changing the end of game message from \"you lose\" to something like \"game over\" or something that comments on the game rather than the player? Anyway, like I said, these are minor items so feel free to ignore. Just thinking about trying to keep the message positive. Cheers, Fernando",

So if you have 7 jpg images with names hangman_0.jpg to hangman_6.jpg I can add them. The teacher will have the ability to select which image set to use. 2. I agree with this. Because I think it is very important how to say to a child that he won or lose I will give to teacher the ability to select the two messages for each game instance.

I remember a discussion regarding the \"hang man\" game and the suggestion that there may be a better metaphor to use than a hanging, this set me thinking. Rather than revealing something on an incorrect answer how about revealing something as a reward for a correct answer? Imagine being able to upload an image which the software was able to cover with number of tessalating shapes, e.g. squares. On giving a correct answer one square of the picture would be revealed. This could offer a number of challenges e.g. Can you reveal the whole picture from a limited set of questions? In other words you would only be allowed a maximum number of wrong answers before the whole picture could not be revealed as you would not have enough questions left. Reveal the picture in the minimum number of questions - optimum score would be to get no wrong answers, but there would be enough questions for you eventually to reveal the picture. Answer a question related to the picture in the minimum number of questions e.g. put a name to the face of a famous person or place. You don't need to reveal the whole picture, just enough to enable you to answer the identity. This would require a set of questions to control the revealing of the squares and an additional picture related question. Answer a question related to the picture where there is one question for each square of the picture, plus the picture related question. Which square to reveal could be either sequential or random or dependent on the question answered, as appropriate to the game type. I have not had the opportunity to run your module yet, so if this facility already exists then please ignore this posting. Kind regards Johnathan",

Maybe the name of this will be \"hidden picture\" Input: (a) A category of questions or a glossary or a category of a glossary. Each question or glossaryentry will has one picture. (b) A second category of questions or a glossary of a category of a glossary The maximum number of questions for (b) What will do: Will select one question or glossary entry. Will parse the html of that question and will remove the picture Will show the question or glossary entry without the picture Will split the picture to squares and display initially no squares. Will show some question (the maximum numbers selected randomly) For every correct answer will display one square of picture If the user want will have the ability to answer the main question (this about picture) Score: If the user find the answer of main answer 100 % Otherwise (Correct Answers) / (Number of questions) So you get the maximum score if you answer correct the main question or all the other questions. What you think about it ? How will convert your other ideas to include the score? Kind Regards Vasilis",

          "Text": "Hello Vasilis, I'm glad you liked the picture game idea. Your percentage approach sounds good for scoring There are a number of alternative ways the scoring might be handled, that come to mind, to provide variations on the game. 1. Have one question per square, for example have say 25 questions to give a 5 by 5 grid of squares.  If you displayed a 5 by 5 grid the player could then select which question to answer based on its position over the picture, so they had some control over which part of the picture was revealed first. The user scores 1 point for each square answered correctly (an incorrect answer leaves that part of the picture covered over) at any time the player can attempt to answer the question related to the whole picture, at which time they score a bonus of 2 times every question they have not yet attempted to answer. So if someone asked one square question, and got it right and then correctly answered the main picture question they would score 1 for the square question and a further 48 for the remaining 24 questions not attempted. An incorrect guess might be penalised by locking one of the remaining picture squares by removing its related question. Final score would be assigned when all questions had been attempted. In principle the scoring would be x for each correct square question plus 2x for every question that had not been attempted when the picture was correctly guessed. So that would give an absolute score rather than a percentage. 2. Scoring for another game could be for a game where there are more questions than squares. You start with a score of 0 and score x for every right answer and lose y for every wrong answer. You play until you reveal the whole picture, (revealed automatically if you use up all the questions) and then get asked the question for the whole picture for a bonus score. This way you could weight the game by giving more for a correct answer than you take away for a wrong answer, or even set y to 0 so wrong answers are not penalised. If you are keen to provide answers always as percentages then let me know and I will give the matter some more thought. I hope this helps. Kind regards Johnathan",

          "Text": "Hello Vasilis, OK I have been giving the whole picture game some thought. There are a number of possible variables that would define a number of different games all on the same basic principle, these would be How many squares will cover a picture? If you answer a question incorrectly can you attempt to reveal the square again and if so do you answer the same question again or a different question? Will there be a question for the large picture that is being revealed by the correct answering of square questions? If you answer the large picture question wrong can you have another try? There is also the issue of whether the scoring system should in some way take in to account incorrect answers, so that particularly in games where many attempts can be made to reveal a square that someone who gets the correct answer the first time receives a higher score than someone who takes several attempts before they are successful in revealing the square. What then is needed is a scoring system that will return a percentage figure that can accomodate all these variations. I have modelled this on a spread sheet and it seems to me to give acceptable results, so can I suggest the following two formulas for scoring, which I believe could be applied to all variants of the game. Definitions: Number of attempts = count of all questions attempted whether answered incorrectly or correctly to include both questions asked to reveal squares and questions asked to identify the big picture. Number of correct answers = count of all correct answers given to questions asked to reveal squares and correct answers given to question asked to reveal the big picture. Remaining squares = The count of squares that have not been revealed at this point in the game. If there is a Big picture question and it has been guessed correctly the score is given by (number of correct answers + remaining squares not exposed) / (Number of attempts + remaining squares to be exposed) If there is no big picture question or there is a big picture question but it has not yet been answered correctly then the score is given by (number of correct answers) / (Number of attempts + remaining squares to be exposed) See what you think.
