I have tested it and I quite like it; however, I am not an experienced Scheduler user. Can it handle large courses with a lot of students effectively? Is there anything we should be aware of?

I would request the option (when creating time slots) to also ADD the time slots to the calendar of the teacher. This will be very useful because we now see that booked time slots are not always preserved in the calendar of a teacher. So after adding the time slots to the scheduler, it could happen that other activities are being booked in the calendar of the teacher on that same time slot (after all, it shows as 'free' in the calendar) As you might be guessing from the above: we synchronise Moodle calendar with Outlook. A teacher now needs to manually block all time slots in his calendar (because they CAN be booked by students at a later time). I think it would be a great addition to the scheduler to have a checkbox that says 'block time slots in calendar of teacher'.

Can we set up the scheduler activity to send not only a reminder mail one week in advance, but to als show a button in that mail (or in the scheduler activity on Moodle) that students need to click to reconfirm their intent to show up? And if they do not reconfirm by 48 hours in advance, the timeslot of the non-responders tot the confirmation mail need to be released so that others have the chance to attend. How could this be achieved on Moodle (even if with another activity than the scheduler, I would be happy to hear it).\n\nWe now have a very labor-intensive workaround that we have to maintain for quite a lot of schedulers (we have a lot of company visits) and we need to improve this process: 1 - When the scheduler is first published, the completion status of that activity cannot be manipulated by a student 2 - One week i advance, the reminder mail is sent out. We cannot choose the teckt of that mail 3 - On the same day, the teacher sets the completion status so that it must be set manually by a student. 4 - The teacher then also checks who is registered and sends all these students an e-mail asking them to set the completion status of the correct scheduler activity to \"completed\" 5 - 48 hours in advance, the teacher does a cross check between who is registered and who has set the completion status to \"completed\". 6 - All registered students that have not set the completion status are deemed as unconfirmed and their registration is removed so that others have the chance to register and attend 7 - An e-mail to all students who could not register is sent out that new places have opened up.",

I'm using a Scheduler based on this version and I could check that importing slots enables multiple conflicting slots. You simply import slots through a csv file like the one attached.

In the latest version (4.0.0) that's lines 626-642 and 744-760. Here's the code: // Simplify display of dates, start and end times. if ($startdate == $previousdate && $starttime == $previoustime && $endtime == $previousendtime) { // If this row exactly matches previous, there's nothing to display.

These sessions are graded (to the effect that the teacher feels satisfied that the student can go to next phase) The sessions need to be graded (let's not get into the type of grade) for the reason of allowing the student go to the next phase and also for auditing I have setup the 4 courses and I have setup an additional course with just one activity, a scheduler. The enrolments work fine... But I have 3 problems 1) I don't know how to \"link\" the practice phase of the main courses to go to this scheduler? is there \"something\" I can put as activity there to redirect to the scheduler in the common course? 2) Since these practice sessions are common to teachers but unique to the main course students, when a student makes a booking, it needs to show up somehow from which \"main\" course it originated. 3) Since these practice sessions are graded, the grades need to propagate to the \"activity\" at the main course, and show up in the gradebook as part of the main course. Any help would be greatly appreciated",

If you want something more interactive, you can also create a button with bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/ For 2), I think the easiest way would be to ask students to write which course they're enrolled in the \"message\" box in the booking form. There are multiple options when it comes to the grades, I think the simplest one would be to add a grade item in the gradebook. However, teachers will need to add the grades directly in the gradebook/with a .csv file. Do you think that this is feasible for them?",

The problem is that when I want a schedule in groups, and my groups have for example up to 5 students, and a group with only 3 students makes a booking, the scheduler allows to book the same slot with a group of 2 students. Our scenario is that we make an oral exam for group of students and we can handle only one group at a time. The solution would be to restrict the \"maximum number of groups\" and not \"maximum number of students\". I understand from the thread from 2014 (see link above) that this was considered for implementation, but as far as I can tell this never made it into the plugin.",

However, we can't do that anymore, we have to delete the entire time slot, recreate it and put the remaining students back in. If you go to Schedule and view all appointment and click on a gear icon next to a slot, the appointment comes up but none of the students in that appointment are shown.  As a result you cannot remove individual students from a slot. The gear icon should take you to a page that populates all current students assigned to that slot.  Thus allowing you to remove individual students which is the default Moodle behaviour.

The groups I mentioned are student groups, which are created by themselves, and represent a set of students that work together in the course. They submit works together, as a group, and through out the course they interact with each other to accomplish the course’s tasks. I guess this organization (sets of students that work in group) is pretty common in many courses (either supported by a platform like Moodle or without any platform). So, what would be the logic of adding a teacher to a group of students? Or, for that matter, adding a teacher to all groups of students in a course? Please don’t take me wrong. I truly believe that your solution works for the Scheduler plugin. I am just trying to understand its logic, as I have this feeling that I am missing something (maybe the ideia I had about groups is just wrong). Best regards, Miguel",

          "Text": "Groups in a Moodle course can be set up for different purposes, whether course groups or task groups or some other ad-hoc groups, and anyone can be a member of multiple groups etc. Not sure which version of Moodle you're using, too, but group management is becoming an increasingly more important feature (also because of privacy issues). If the mode for an activity is a group mode (separate or visible) and not \"No groups\", and no teacher or non-editing teacher is added to the group, then there is no one of an upper rank in that group directly assigned to book an appointment with (or to be graded by, as in assignments, or to respond to the group's forum discussions etc). Yes, a general course teacher (\"editing teacher\") can do many things, but that is because editing teachers act also like managers or moderators in the entire course (with access to all groups defined in that course). S/he can thus step in anywhere and do whatever. If there are groups in a course, and you're not in them, these are dubbed as \"groups\" simply (or \"Other groups\"), but not \"My groups\". For those groups that do not need a grader, a TA, or other dedicated \"contact\" , you might not have to add a teacher (or non-editing teacher), but for those groups that collaborate and submit things that are supposed to be graded or monitored by a teacher, that teacher should be specified - otherwise communications will often fail - forum subscriptions, assignment notifications, and also scheduler appointments. If you had 5 teachers sharing a course and teaching 5 different groups, you wouldn't want to have each of the teachers tracking all of the students all of the time, just the group they are actually teaching. Ergo - if you have at least one activity in your course that applies a separate groups or visible groups mode, then including the dedicated teacher(s) in each such group is at the very least recommended practice.",

In fact, as you pointed out, the concept of \"groups\" in Moodle goes far beyond simple “task-groups”. And I was missing its greater scope. As you guessed, my case is characterized by: 1) My course groups are \"task-groups\" and I'm the only teacher in the course. 2) These \"task-groups\" are the only groups in the course, and I would prefer not to add myself to each of them. So, I'll try your suggestions, hopping they accomplish want I intend with the Scheduler, which seemed to me pretty trivial: just set up a pool of slots that students could book, in a per group (a \"task-group\") basis, to meet me. Again, many thanks for your help (and for your time!). Best regards, Miguel",

The bookings go live 1 week before the session and book out within a minute.  Generally the scheduler works well for managing this but we only have approximately 60% of students who successfully book a session actually turn up for their session. I believe that this is because they book 1 week in advance but are then busy with other projects, therefore they don't take the time to turn up or to manually login to Moodle and cancel their booking. What I would ideally like to see is rather than just an option to send an email notification x number of days before their slot, an additional option for an email confirmation x number of days before their slot. This confirmation would send the students a link giving the student 1 day to confirm that they still want their booking and if the student doesn't confirm their booking then Moodle automatically cancels the booking, thus opening that slot up to other students. At present I can't find any way to accomplish this, if there is a way I'd love to hear about it, otherwise I'd love to see it added as a feature in the future. Thanks James",

For example, if you (mistakenly) revoke all students, then the slot becomes unused and is purged. We can't prove this, but it could be an explanation in our case.

Thanks to everyone who contributed fixes or reported issues on the Moodle Tracker . Behat tests indicate that Scheduler is now compatible with the latest Moodle 4.2 as well. I am therefore planning to (finally!) release a new 4.x version of Scheduler to the plugins DB in two weeks from now, that is, around mid-May.

I concede that this behavior is consistent within moodle, because teachers can see everything. But the list is supposed to be a list of students that still need to make an appointment and therefore shouldn't include the teachers. Different approach: When choosing \"separate groups\", the list of students that still need to make an appointment is empty unless I am also a member of the group. Well, usually, I'm not a member of my groups of students. But for just this use case, I've added myself to this particular group. Now I see the students from the group and myself in the list of students that still need to make an appointment. This is better than having all teachers from the course in this list, but still not perfect. What am I doing wrong? Shouldn't the list of \"students that still need to make an appointment\" simply only contain students (i.e. enrolled users with role student)?",

In terms of UI, I imagine this taking the form of an additional input field in the 'students' column.

          "Text": "Hello, Use case description - I have a course with a lot of schedulers where students needed to register for webinars provided by external partners. Due to covid restrictions, there was no possibility to go to companies with students to get a feel for what te studies are preparing them. Some external partners did webinars via Zoom, others via Teams, others via Webex. All platforms where we do not have access to participant logs, or where anyone with the link could enter. Attendance in at least 5 of these company-organised webinars was mandatory. We used schedulers on Moodle. Students registered for the webinars of choice, and the registered students received a reminder mail the day of the event with the correct link. So only registered students could participate. We as teachers were also present, and marked the students in the appropriate scheduler as \"showed up / attended\". Now it is time to give out points, and one of the parameters we need to take into account is how many webinars were attended by each student. So I am looking for a way to export the inf from all schedulers at once into one spreadsheet where I can code filtering + marking based upon attendance. But I cannot seem to find how to do this. In the logs, I can only choose one scheduler and it does not how me the attendance. I can open each scheduler separately and do an export, but that would take ages and then I need to consolidate different spreadsheets by hand into one file. Who can enlighten me on bulk exporting the data contained within different schedulers in one go?",

          "Text": "I will try to clarify (in writing it takes longer than explaining by word, so my apologies for the long answer) The external partners giving the webinars for which the students registered in the schedulers do not have access to our Moodle, and we do not ask them to grade attendance. It is not the attendance that needs to be graded. It is what students do with the info they receive during these webinars that is graded at the end of the year, based on what the students documented and reported on in their portfolios. A portfolio is a document reporting on all the company-led activities students participated in. And it also contains own research students did after being triggered by new info they glean from these webinars. We as teachers contact companies and see to it that at least once a week, during the entire year there are activities on the workfloor at companies. Due to Covid, this was all replaced with webinars. The Moodle course contains nothing more than schedulers for all of these events. There is a mandatory minimum of webinars the students must attend, but this varies on the type of student (regular day-time students, evening students with a full time job, students with learning difficulties and a less intensive curriculum spread over more years, ...) We as teachers (one course, 5 teachers, 5 different class groups, mix of regular day-time students and working students taking the evening classes) are usually but not always present in ALL the webinars (sometimes we are teaching another group at the same moment when a company decides to organise a webinar that might be of interest to our students or sometimes at the same time there are two companies having hosting different webinars). Day time regular students need to participate in at least 10 webinars over the course of the entire year, working students need to participate in at least 5 webinars. Which webinars are attended, is entirely up to the students. At the end of the academic year (right about now) we as teachers need to check and confirm that these requirements are met, and we need to know which student registered for which event so that we can check if the portfolio they submitted with their reports on each of these webinars is complete and true. Only students that registered in the schedulers received the webinar info. We need the info on which student registered for which webinar in order to grade their portfolios. I would prefer to have the info of ALL schedulers in the course in 1 Excell sheet so that I can open the portfolio of student X, also filter the spreadsheet so that all webinars for which student X registered on Moodle are filtered out and thus check if his/her portfolio is consistent and check if student X met the minimum attendance requirements (different on whether student X is a regular daytime student, a working evening student, or has some hybrid curstom-made curriculum with exceptions to the rules). This would also make it possible to cross-check the report on webinar Y that student X put in their portfolio with the reports of other students that attended webinar Y. Maybe we should have organised it differently in retrospect, but we needed to make changes fast due to ever-changing Covid restrictions. I cannot change the way it was organised now, nor can I integrate with the gradebook after the facts. I counted on the ability of Moodle export functionality. But alas I have come to the conclusion I need to do an export in each of the schedulers separately and then recombine all these different Excell into one master by hand. Unless I am missing something .... Yesterday evening, I developed a curl script containing all the id's and session keys to automatically extract all the spreadsheets of each scheduler separately. I guess today I will be busy combining all these spreadheets together into one master file ....",

I could just read them from my screen by hovering over the link, and insert them in my script. I had to do 1 manual export and track this using the browser developer tools to obtain the correct session-ID that also needed to go into the curl commands. The plugin you brought to my attention seems extremely usefull. I am quite familiar with SQL statements (especially when I know the table and column names, otherwise al lot of reverse engineering has to be done first). But I am not a Moodle admin. I am a teacher, with only those permissions. I read the documentation, and it seems that I would not only have to convince our admins to install that plugin, but also create new roles with sufficient permissions for teachers to us it within their courses. I don't think I will be able to convince them .... But I'll give it a try anyway Thank you for your time and input!",

As far as I can tell, if a user is in the same group as the tutor, they see the slots, and if they are not in same group, then they don't see the slots - however, if a tutor is in 2 groups (group A and group B) - if they want to add a series of available slots, only for group A, the only way to do this, is to create a separate item specifically for group A, and use restrictions to restrict access. I have a project with hundreds of different groups, with tutors regularly spanning across multiple groups, so I am going to have to create hundreds of these activities .

Not least because we are migrating our own site to Moodle 3.11 soon, i had a look at the plugin now. As far as I'm aware, the latest release (i.e. 3.7.0) of Scheduler works with Moodle 3.10 and 3.11 as well, up to the following caveats: In Moodle 3.11, with debug messages switched on, you will see some warning messages about a deprecated API (user_picture::fields). These are warning messages only, and can be ignored. (They are fixed on the master branch but not on the MOODLE_37_STABLE branch, as this would make it incompatible with versions before 3.11.) Not all of the automated tests will work (this is always a challenge between Moodle releases); but as far as I can see, the underlying features do work. I have therefore marked Scheduler 3.7.0 as compatible with Moodle 3.10 and 3.11 in the plugins DB. If you find issues with Scheduler in those versions, please do file an issue on the Moodle Tracker , describing details. This is still not a major release of scheduler and has no added features (and some bugs like CONTRIB-8013 are still open). Thanks to everyone who filed bug reports or pull requests; they are not forgotten, even if I haven't gotten round to look at them. I still hope to get to that point soon, but the pandemic has put these plans on hold for some time. The major release will certainly be a 4.x release (with x=0 or x=1 being likely).

          "Text": "Hi, Your question made me investigate . What? {what/scheduler} = Comments added to the slot (in the slot settings) = contents of  Comments {comments/scheduler} What resulted? {whatresulted/scheduler} IF you turn on grading in the Scheduler's settings, then Grade info will display in the \"What resulted?\" column What happened? {whathappened/scheduler} = Notes for appointment (visible to student) (cf. {appointmentnote/scheduler} in the slot settings) But also - if in the Scheduler's activity settings you specify confidential notes for teacher/s only, or both types of notes, then (also) the confidential teacher notes will display in the \"What happened?\" column (following the for-student notes) cf. the attached screen from the Overview tab: When you view the particular appointment with these details in, it looks like this: I think I would have two suggestions for the Developer based on this analysis (assuming that it's complete): 1) Re-naming the strings in the Overview table in such a way that they correspond to the various settings: \"What?\" => \"Comments (to this slot)\" \"What resulted?\" => \"Grade (if activated)\" \"What happened?\" => \"Notes for appointment\" So as not to confuse \"Comments\" and \"Notes\" found in the various places, perhaps \"Information about this slot\" could be applied in the slot setting and then as the Overview column heading instead of \"Comment\". Perhaps instead \"Grade (if activated)\" we could use \"Grade for appointment\" - since various grading methods may be used in the scheduler, such as use average grade for calculation in the Gradebook  - I have not exactly checked how all this behaves, though. 2) The CSS for for-student notes vs confidential teacher notes should differentiate between these two types of notes (e.g. different color/ font style, or indeed a prefix like: \"Visible to student and teacher\" vs \"Visible to teacher only\"). It's possible to customise English (and other) language strings on our Moodles to achieve the above effect but I believe changes in standardising the strings would be useful globally? I also think the posited CSS change cannot be easily done since no css classes are used with these notes in the Overview display - the teacher seems to be forced to remember to include by hand the relevant \"prefix\" for the confidential notes. Hope this helps. My analysis is NOT based on the latest version of Scheduler but on v. 3.5.1 2018112602 (Moodle 3.6.10)  , but I think much of it should be still accurate enough. Kind regards.",

Regarding grading based on multiple appointments, I just discovered that the problem may be with the display of the calculated mean: - there are no decimal points displayed in the \"Total grade\" and \"Grade in gradebook\" cells - although the mean itself IS calculated , BUT - only the integer part of the grade is shown, the decimal points are sliced off, the graded is NOT rounded in any way, as shown below: Perhaps a simple solution would be to adjust the code where this display criteria are set and allow, say, two decimal points, as with most grading defaults in Moodle. If I make further progress, I'll report again. I have recently discovered a similar issue with quiz attempt reviews and percentages . Cheers, Przemek",

Likely that this function public function render_scheduler_totalgrade_info might need tweaking - for cases where a numerical grade was sent to Gradebook. I also would not be sure which variable to apply for the decimal points, so for the moment I have stopped exploring further. After all I'm not a programmer ;) .

          "Text": "To correctly render both numbered grades and grading with scales, I have finally settled for the following, I reproduce lines 126 to 150 of the code in renderer.php, and have added bold to my changes: $result = ''; if ($scaleid == 0 || is_null($grade) ) { // Scheduler doesn't allow grading, or no grade entered. if (!$short) { $result = get_string('nograde'); } } else { // $grade = ( int) $grade; // Commented out, or rather moved to l. 143 - PK 2021-05-25 if ($scaleid > 0) { // Numeric grade. $grade = round($grade,2); // Added, PK 2021-05-25 $result .= $grade; if (strlen($grade) > 0) { $result .= '/' . $scaleid; } } else { // Grade on scale. $grade = ( int) $grade; // Added, or rather moved from l. 133 - PK 2021-05-25 if ($grade > 0) { $levels = $this->get_scale_levels(-$scaleid); if (array_key_exists($grade, $levels)) { $result .= $levels[$grade]; } } } This seems to work well, and I  may want to suggest it on the Tracker. HOWEVER -  while comparing what Scheduler claims to be Gradebook's final grade outputs for the Teacher vs the Student , under such condtions: - scales used for grading (e.g. Incompetent-Competent) - mean aggregate selected for grading multiple appointments, then a combination of Competent + Not yet incompetent yields two different overall results :/ : - Not yet competent - on the student's page ( /mod/scheduler/view.php?id=n - the value is taken from the Gradebook here, and I think this IS the correct interpretation) - Competent on the Teacher's page (/mod//scheduler/view.php?what=viewstudent&id=... etc) - this calculation seems to be done within Scheduler, rather than taken from the Gradebook. which I think is understandable, but renders an incorrect result. Anyway. this last discrepancy in aggregation reports seems like another bug to be squashed in Scheduler at some point.",

          "Text": "Case: Students can register in a timeslot to take part in different webinars. They enroll in advance, when the link / platform on which the webinar will be held is still unknown. One week before the actual event, the scheduler closes. When we get the webinar link from the company that will be doing the guest lecture, we need to get it to the students that have enrolled. Problem: I cannot figure out how to automate this. From the moment we get the webinar link, I would like to stage a message linked to a specific timeslot so that Moodle sends out a message to all enrolled students with the link to the webinar immediately after registration closes. At the moment, I am doing all this manually. I cannot even get Moodle to send out a message to all registered student in a timeslot. It only allow me to send a reminder to students that have not yet registered in a timeslot. But I need to reach the ones that have registered! En preferably automate this. I.e. when i setup the scheduler and the timeslot, setup a message that needs to be sent out to registered students at a moment of my choosing. Any ideas anyone?????",

Activate the option \"Send a reminder\", depending on when do you get the meeting link from your customer (I think 24 hours before the meeting is a sensible time window). Edit the Language Strings for mod_scheduler>email_reminder_html. It should somehow include the content of the field/elements comments. This way, you can add the link to the meeting once you get it, and the email reminder which is sent to registered participants would include it. But, as I said, I've never done this and it's just guessing.",

I am a lecturer, and do not have Moodle Site Admin priviliges. It sounds like what you are describing is changing something in a config/html file behind the scenes of Moodle. I do not have access to that alas! I do not find my scenario extraordinary in these times of distance teaching. And it will be here to stay. A proper scheduler needs to have a reminder function where the person that created the timeslot can actualy set a message for the reminder. All I can do is activate the option \"Send a reminder\", but there is nowhere I can type the message that needs to be sent as reminder. That does not make any sense to me. You can only send a preset reminder that cannot be changed without fumbling in .html files that are inaccessible to mere users.",

This would be a great ergonomic advantage, as the further into semester we go, the further down the slot list you have to scroll to manage latest appointments.

Metalinking courses is a bad option for us, as it creates confusion with students by adding yet another course to their list of courses. If a student has 6 courses and sees 6 new meta-courses, it is a recipe for trouble. As a start to making this happen: Can you adapt the plugin where when the teacher sets up a Scheduler activity, that the teacher gets the option - that while creating it in one class - have by default set so that the particular scheduled activity is available for ANYONE with the student role in Moodle? It's not a final option, but it would at least solve the interim problem of having to create metacourses. A future iteration would then include giving the teacher a dropdown list where they could select particular courses for which he/she wants to share the same scheduled activity. What do you think?

My opinion is that scheduler is a very good plugin but do you know if other plugins already conceived with this aim? Thank you Carlo",

After playing around with it, I've established that slots created in April, May and early June are not visible to students, but slots from mid June, July and August are. If I create all of them as repeated slots, then they all show in my scheduler, but for the students, it shows as nothing available until mid-June. Obviously, the settings are the same as they were created together. Selecting or unselecting 'ignore scheduling conflicts' makes no difference. I have no idea where else to look.",

          "Text": "Hi, This might seem like a small problem, but it had me baffled for a while. I set up a scheduler for appointments with groups of students, thus using the \"booking in groups\" parameter. I created the slots, sent the invites. Students came back to me saying that they couldn't book a time slot (not enough place available in the slot, or something to that effect). It took me a while to realize that this is because of the default \"maximum number of students per slot\" parameter set at \"1\" by default in the slot creation parameters. So although one student makes the appointment, you need enough \"space\" in the slot to accomodate all of the students in the group. This is not intuitive (at least for me). A quick solution could be to add that information in the \"max number of student per slot\"\" parameter help bubble, i,e, something to the effect that if you do group  bookings, this parameter should disabled the parameter, or set it to number of students in your biggest groups. Thanks! Best, Eric",

          "Text": "Hi, I have been trying to figure out why \"completion_daily_task\" is not working/finishing. After many hours of debugging this problem I think I may have found the issue. First I found the problem query: SELECT c.id AS course, u.id AS userid, crc.id AS completionid, ue.timestart AS timeenrolled, ue.timecreated FROM mdl_user u INNER JOIN mdl_user_enrolments ue ON ue.userid = u.id INNER JOIN mdl_enrol e ON e.id = ue.enrolid INNER JOIN mdl_course c ON c.id = e.courseid INNER JOIN mdl_role_assignments ra ON ra.userid = u.id LEFT JOIN mdl_course_completions crc ON crc.course = c.id AND crc.userid = u.id WHERE c.enablecompletion = 1 AND crc.timeenrolled IS NULL AND ue.status = 0 AND e.status = 0 AND u.deleted = 0 AND ue.timestart < ? AND (ue.timeend > ? OR ue.timeend = 0) AND ra.roleid IN (5,9) ORDER BY course, userid I noticed that this query results are being stored in a PHP variable name \"rs\", so I took that query and manually ran it against the mysql db and stored the results to a local file. Then I checked the size of the file and discovered it had a size of \"2683650313\" and \"99348759\" rows. Then i did some checking and it appears that php 7.1.2 has a max variable size of 2^31 (2147483648), so it appears that the query is overflowing the varialbe \"rs\", I have not seen any errors when this happens. The task just drops out. When this happens in the normal cron to schedule the task it make all other tasks quite running and I have to disable the \"completion_daily_task\" in order to get cron working again. My question is has anybody else had this problem and is there a way to limit the query so it will complete?

Apart from bug fixes and some refactored code, below are the new and changed features. If you are using Scheduler with several teachers in one course, you will in particular want to have a look at the changed permissions model on the teacher side. There is now basic support for the completion API (when using grades) IMPORTANT: Permissions on the teacher side have changed. In particular: Teachers now strictly need the capability\n'canseeotherteachersbooking' (or 'manageallappointments') in order to\nsee the \"All appointments\" tab. There are new capabilities 'editallgrades', 'editallnotes', and\n'editallattended' which allow users without the 'manageallappointments'\ncapability to edit the grades, the teacher notes, or the attended flag\nin all appointments of all teachers, in the appointment screen only. The configuration setting 'allteachersgrading' is no longer in use. Best wishes Henning",

          "Text": "Hi, We have a large number of Tutors and slots on various dates and this process is incredibly heavy on setting it up. It would be hugely beneficial to be able to import a CSV with some of the data to create slots. eg: Date, time, slot length and Tutor. Our tutorials aren't on the same date or time so using repeated slots means we create repeated slots and then have to then change the date. If we're doing this for say 15 tutors, who have 3 slots a day 3 times a week on different days it's pure insanity! Any ideas? Would this be possible, if so, how much it cost to develop this? Thanks, Juli",

          "Text": "Hi Henning, I support this improvement. In my opinion, the \"Timeline\" block is more noticeable than the \"Calendar\" block, and in the long run would be more popular. Users would get used to see their next events in this area. Think about it this way - The main events that appear in the timeline are due dates of assignments , that are in the end softer than scheduler events. If you miss a due date (which doesn't have a cut-off date, and most don't have in my opinion, at least in my country), it's not optimal but the student can still submit the paper before the teacher actually grade it. However, if you miss a scheduler event, you actually miss a meeting, and someone wasted his time for you. So in that manner, scheduler events are even more important than due dates when thinking about what should appear in the \"Timeline\" block. Thanks a lot for the great plugin and for thinking about such improvements for it",

This is different from the record that you retrieve from the database . (See model/scheduler_instance.php for the details.) scheduler_instance contains information about the scheduler, but also about the slots and booked appointments. In order to retrieve the associated database record, you can call the get_data method. E.g.: $record = $scheduler->get_data(); This will actually return a copy of what is in the $data field. It's not how I would normally use that object, though. Best wishes Henning",

As I manage the subject/course, my role was Manager (we call it Site coordinator), and I was unable to add time slots for myself.  I have solved this by demoting myself to Teacher (we had two Managers in my particular example) and now I can use it perfectly - my name appears in the drop down menu, and I can add slots for myself. Some courses will only have one Manager, and so this won't always be possible.  Is it feasible to request that staff with the role of Manager be included when populating the drop-down menu? Thanks, Montse",

Even if it is so, I want to create two different scheduler activities and conflicting sessions to these scheduler activities. In the documentation its says that, \"In case a conflict is found, the behavior depends on the setting \"Force when overlap\" in the Add multiple slots screen. If this is set to \"no\", then those new slots that would create a conflict will not be created. If the switch is set to \"yes\", then existing conflicting slots will be deleted before the new slot is being created. However, Scheduler will never delete a conflicting slot if students are already booked on it, or if the slot is located outside the current scheduler activity.\" But even if \"Force when overlap\" is set to \"yes\" when adding multiple sessions, the conflicting previous sessions are deleted. It seems a kind of bug. Any ideas how to workaround this situation?",

As the student may have contact with the same adviser over several years, we don't want to strip out old scheduler meeting records, so we roll-over the same activity year to year. A few staff contacted me this week as they are prepping the start of new academic session, and report that they have a group of (say 8) students, but the Scheduler is displaying eg \"4 students still need to make an appointment - send invitation - send reminder\".  The staff want to send a bulk reminder out to their entire student group for the start of the new session, but only some students are listed to contact this way. Is there a simple way to reset this so that it clears the list of who needs to make an appointment so that we can prompt all students to make an appointment each semester or year? I wondered if it was because individual staff hadn't ticked students off as seen after an appointment, but as far as I was aware that only affected students making bookings if it is set to one at a time (ours can make multiple appointments).

I suppose your scheduler is set up to allow only one booking (or a fixed number of bookings) at a time. If a student has made a booking, they will no longer be listed as needing an invite / reminder since they can no longer make a booking. Only once they have been marked as attended, they can actually make another booking (and can be invited/reminded). One option would be that you mark past slots as attended, or delete them if they didn't take place. Another option would be to allow unlimited appointments to students. I hope this makes sense.

          "Text": "Hello Community, Here is my dilemma. I am using Moodle for the LMS for a State agency. I have a course where I use scheduler to sign up for a series of webinars for the supervisors. I have this down and running easily. This year we are trying to get more people involved in the webinars so I am putting them all out. What I am wanting to do is automate the distribution of the distribution of the Outlook Calendar Invite. Our employee do not use the Moodle Calendar, just the Outlook Calendars. So I made a series of .ics files. I can put it in the comments, but it will show the supervisors the comments when they register for 1. I need them to register first before they get the file. So my question is can there be a custom message for each webinar that they register for through the scheduler? Is that message something I can set up with teacher access or do I need to have one of the administrators do it? Thanks",

          "Text": "Hello, This plugin is great but it lacks certain key features that my company would like to have. We really need the following: 1) A way to make the location private, only visible to students who have booked the class. Basically, we're planning to pair each booking with a Zoom (online video conferencing software) link. However, as far I can tell, there is no way to privately notify the students of the location (the link). 2) So the second feature is a little more complicated to explain. Currently, you can send out invitations and reminders to students enrolled in a course, however, there's no way to make these invitations or reminders automatic. And there's no way to save custom messages. You always have to type out the message again or copy and paste. Ultimately, this is what I would like: The student is enrolled in a course. He goes to the Scheduler activity and says, \"I'm going to book a class at 7 pm and 8 pm, on Friday.\" The student, after booking the class, will then be sent a reminder through Moodle as well as a reminder to their email address, with the link to the Zoom channel where the class will take place. As I said, I love this plugin, it's great. It would be extremely helpful if you looked into ways to make the plugin more online-teacher oriented. Thank you.",

My suspicion is that this is actually a bug in the Moodle Core API, it occurs when I ask whether a profile is visible but outside the context of a particular user. I will work on it, but if it's in Moodle Core, this may take a while. If you need an immediate fix and know how to perform this, you can revert the following change in your local installation: https://github.com/bostelm/moodle-mod_scheduler/commit/2a06a9224aa6ed0c79946bc26fc0518df3255a09 Best wishes Henning",

Hence my initial thought was, in these cases, you could simply click the \"Edit slot\" button, and remove the individual student appointments that are no longer required. However, you say that this has not worked for you, giving you an error \" You can't start an empty appointment slot in the past \", is that correct? This seems like a bug to me. However, I tried to reproduce it on the latest version of Scheduler, and for me everything seemed to work out fine. You can tick the \" Delete this appointment (when saving the form) \" checkbox for one student (or more), and the appointment will in fact be deleted. The error message is shown only when you try to delete *all* appointments in the slot, thus leaving it empty, but i understand that that's not the case you're asking about. Hence the problem might have to do with the Scheduler version you are using. The edit screen has changed several times, and the method I described above should work from Scheduler 3.3.0 on. Possibly you're using an older version - which is it? Best wishes Henning",

I'm also unsure how the code change you made influences the problem - I don't think that piece of code is used at the relevant point.

If you would like to change this in your installation, then i think that editing the function scheduler_instance->get_conflicts(), so that it always returns an empty array, should do the trick. (This is in mod/scheduler/model/scheduler_instance.php .) I'm not sure whether this makes sense as a built-in option though. It would be quite easy to include a global option (conflict detection yes or no, for all schedulers), but is this what users want? If this is supposed to be an option on a per-scheduler basis, it becomes more tricky to implement I guess.",

          "Text": "Hi Henning, First thanks for a very useful plugin that has been really helpful for us with booking E-Learning webinars with a global group of E-Learners. Then on to the issue we encountered which caused us some problems last week.  When updating an instance of the scheduler we found that while we made no changes to grade settings the grading disappeared. I did some tests and diagnostics which may help identify the cause. However, first it is worth noting how we use the scheduler as this may be why we have noticed this when others have not. We use a course for multiple intakes. Each course has several scheduler instances for interactive webinar booking.  We add slots for each intake. We grade students for webinar participation. The sum of webinar grades must be above a certain percentage for course completion. Recently we changed the platform used for the interactive webinars ... so we altered the description to add the new details. After this we found in some cases the grades were no longer showing. We were able to restore the grades but as part of looking into it became aware there were some perfectly reasonable actions that were causing the underlying grading problem to recur. When I looked in more detail, I discovered this is due to an issue with the user interface for editing the Scheduler text. The following sequence of actions demonstrated this: Cycle 1 Select \"Edit settings\" for a Scheduler instance Set Grade type as \"Point\" and Maximum Grade as \"2\" (for example) Save and display NOTE: Previously entered grades are shown as expected Cycle 2 Select \"Edit settings\" again NOTE: The Grade and Maximum Grade are set as expected. Set Grade Category as  \"Webinars\" (a category in the gradebook) Save and display NOTE: Previously entered grades are NOT shown Cycle 3 Select \"Edit settings\" again NOTE: The Grade and Maximum Grade are shown as NOT set. Repeat steps from Cycle 1 above … this corrects and restores the grades The way we fixed this was to use the Gradebook editor to reassert the link to the Category rather than doing this through the scheduler editing form. In this case the problem did not occur. However, it was still reproducible if we edited the grade through the Scheduler edit for the link to the Category was broken. I appears that what is happening is that when the Scheduler for is used to updated the grade category, the link to the grader item is lost. Also I notice the Ubuntu logfile shows the following error message when this incident occurs. I am not sure if this is connected. PHP Notice:  Undefined property: stdClass::$ requiremodintro in /var/www/html/moodle/course/moodleform_mod.php on line 894, referer: https://elearning.ihtsdotools.org/course/modedit.php?update=1298&return=1 Apologies for the long posting ... it would be great if this is something that can be fixed.",

There is a new global option setting (scheduler|mixindivgroup) which allows the admin to enable or disable the \"myself\" entry of the menu globally.

All 45 slots have 12 seats and 2 slots have 13 participants enrolled and 2 slots have 14 participants enrolled. We made all parameters verifications : group mode is to \"No Group\" value, groupe appointment is to \"No\" and seats limit is effectively active.

(See CONTRIB-5343 and linked issues.) I have now started to implement such a feature and would like to share it with you early, so that  I can get an idea whether the solution actually meets the need. The rough idea would is that, if so configured by the teacher, students see one text box and one file upload field at time of booking. The text box can be used for various purposes - the teacher can specify in a \"booking instructions\" text what is actually requested. While I was at it, I also added the option to show a CAPTCHA at booking time. I add a few screenshots below, which should give an idea of the new feature as currently planned. The very adventurous can also install it on their test system - see the branch \"bookingdata\" on github - however, please note that this is a work in progress and that I don't guarantee that any data can be carried forward to the final version at all! Please use it on a test system only Feedback is welcome - please just reply to this post. I'm planning to release the feature at approximately the time of Moodle 3.3, and it will likely be compatible with that version only. Best wishes Henning Here's the new section of the configuration screen (Scheduler settings): A student will first see the usual list of slots, with a \"Book slot\" button: Clicking on \"Book slot\", they are presented with a booking form that allows them to enter text / upload files: The teacher sees a \"paperclip\" icon next to the student's booking, indicating that data has been provided: Opening the relevant appointment (by clicking on the student's name), the teacher can access the student-provided data:",

So the students cannot book a suite for a whole week, we limit them to two bookings at a time. The issue with this is that seemingly I have to mark the students as seen every-time they book a suite otherwise they cannot book another one again. As this scheduler is designed to run semi-autonomously and for a lot of people, this is something I cannot do. Is there a way for the scheduler to automatically mark students as seen once the booking has passed or to delete previous slots? This would save me a lot of time Thanks, James",

However, messages are not being generated as emails on the College Outlook system as they used to be. As I haven't had a notification from a Forum I just put a message on, I now rather think it is a more general issue between the Moodle dashboard/messages/calendar on the one side and the outlook email system the college uses on the other, and not so much the scheduler specifically??

However, in the latest version of Scheduler (3.1), teachers can actually upload feedback files. It's maybe not quite obvious, but they can be added into the \"appointment notes\" field, similar to what is explained in this video: (Again, this works only in Scheduler 3.1 and later, earlier versions did not allow for embedded files.)",

For me, the main point is that I'm not sure what exactly users would want in this respect. In our own installation, we don't use activity completion. It's not clear to me (a) how many Scheduler users would actually need this feature, and (b) what exactly would typically mean that a student has \"completed\" the scheduler. You name some alternatives and one could certainly come up with more, but what would actually be useful in practice? In particular, what about schedulers that allow more than one booking, that allow an unlimited number of bookings per student, etc.? If you (or anyone else in this forum) has suggestions, please do comment here or on the Moodle Tracker (ticket linked above).",

When a student has booked themselves in for a slot they have 'completed' the activity. This opens up quite a few possibilities e.g. It allows me to then target students who have not completed it (booked an appointment) by sending out an automated reminder email through the re-engagement plugin. Or I can send out an automated email to users who have completed it with information that they need for the meeting or class. It allows me to download a spreadsheet showing who has and hasn't completed the scheduler activity by looking at the Activity Completion report. It also allows me to restrict access to other activities on the page e.g. I don't allow students to be able to view a certain document until they have booked an appointment. Another useful completion criterion could be that the activity is 'complete' when a student has been marked as seen. Thanks, Catherine",

We're currently using the scheduler plugin in our university to allow students to book tutorials with tutors. We've been hearing that due to the limited number of tutors and slots, that students have resorted to using software to automatically book slots as soon as they become available, apparently they're using auction sniping software to do this. As a solution, how difficult would it be to add a captcha element to the scheduler plugin, probably after the \"Book Now\"? As far as I can see, one place that would need changing would be the studentview.controller.php script - however looking at the new recaptcha api it's just html/ javascript - would it still be possible to implement recaptcha into the plugin despite this? Again, please let me know if this is not something that can be done and I'll try and come up with another solution. Thanks, Chris",

          "Text": "Currently, Scheduler has a capability setting \"mod/scheduler:disengage\" which controls whether students can drop their appointments. By default, all students have this capability and they see a button \"Drop my appointments\" in the booking screen. However, admins can change the configuration and remove this capability from students (I'm not sure how often they do that in practice). In that case, students can't drop their appointments once they've booked a slot. They can only change their booking, dropping one appointment and booking another one at the same time. This seemed to make sense when students were only allowed to book one slot at a time. But since Scheduler 2.7, students can be allowed to make more than one booking, and then the concept of \"changing the booking\" is more complex (and in fact Scheduler will always allow students to drop their appointments in this configuration). With further feature requests (e.g., paging in student view, CONTRIB-5194 ), things will become even more complicated in this respect - which makes me wonder whether the feature to deny students \"dropping\" (rather than changing) their appointments is really worthwhile. In other words, I'm planning to remove the setting in future versions. Students would then always be allowed to drop their appointments, unless the appointments are within the \"guard time\". However, if you still require this feature, please reply here, and explain why you think it's required. Thanks Henning",

          "Text": "Dear Scheduler users Scheduler 2.9.0 has now been released on the plugins DB. This release is intended for Moodle 2.9 and for the upcoming Moodle 3.0. The most important difference to previous versions in the change in group handling ( see here ). Scheduler now distinguishes between \"Scheduling in groups\" (i.e., a student can book their entire group into a slot), and the more standard Moodle \"Group mode\" (\"Visible groups\" etc.) The effect of setting the \"group mode\" is now that students can book slots only with teachers that are members of their own groups. This is a major change from Scheduler 2.7; data will be converted accordingly when you install the update, but if you have used \"group scheduling\" before, it may be a good idea to check your data carefully on a test system before upgrading your live system. Other changes include a much improved export feature, and a redesigned student screen. Note that Scheduler 2.7 works on Moodle 2.9 as well and you can continue to use it, but I would encourage users to upgrade to the new 2.9 branch of Scheduler (MOODLE_29_STABLE on github). We've been working with Scheduler 2.9 on our own installation for a few weeks, and it seems to be working fine; but if you find any problems, please do let me know, preferably by posting a ticket on the Moodle Tracker .

This would prevent you from having the capability regardless of other roles possibly allowing it. You should best revisit your role configuration ( Administration > Site administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles ) and there, for every one of the three relevant roles (\"Manager\", \"Editeur pour l'epfc\", \"Authenticated user\"), check what the status of \"mod/scheduler:canseeotherteachersbooking\" is.

Over time, I have received a number of comments regarding this feature; some were confused about how it works, and others asked for it to be changed or expanded. For the upcoming release of Scheduler 3.1, I have reviewed the \"scheduling conflicts\" feature, slightly altering how it behaves (with the intent of cleaning it up); and in particular, I have documented the current behavior: https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Scheduler:_Conflicts I'd be happy to receive any comments on whether this feature is useful in the current form or should be changed.

In order to facilitate peer tutoring, I've created a \"course\" in every category (categories include physics, chemistry, geometry, etc) called \"Tutors\" in which all students are assigned the role of teacher (which I've renamed \"Peer tutor\") so that they, if they wish, can create a Scheduler activity of their own. That way, students who want to be peer tutors in a specific course category can offer time slots to other students seeking help. I don't want the students in search of peer tutoring to have to enroll in this \"course\" just to schedule a time slot with a peer tutor, though. Thus, I would like anyone logged into my Moodle site but not enrolled in the Tutors \"course\" to be able to click on any student's Scheduler activity and be able to book a time. I have enabled guest access to the \"course\" to accomplish this, but when a student clicks on any student's Scheduler activity link, the following message appears: \"Guests can't do anything here.\" Is it possible to allow users logged into Moodle but not enrolled in the \"course\" in which Scheduler activities are listed to actually book time slots? PS - You can visualize what I’m trying to replicate by looking at the first screen in this video: That’s not my video; I’m just trying to replicate the idea of a “course” in which all tutors are listed on the same page and students can click to book time with any of them.",

First, Scheduler was really designed to allow enrolled students in a course to book slots, and enrolled teachers to offer slots. It *may* allow non-enrolled users to do something, but that is more a bug then a feature ( CONTRIB-6244 ). Also, Scheduler assumes that a user is either a student (with capability mod/scheduler:appoint) or a teacher (with capability mod/scheduler:attend). Depending on that, the user will either see the student screen or the teacher screen. Users can't have both. For a scheduler that everyone can use, I normally place it on the front page (but in the usual student/teacher setup). Best wishes Henning",

You can send me comments in any form, by using this discussion, by downloading the MS Word file and adding comments to it, or by most other methods available. I do ask that any comments be specific. For example, if a comment says, \"The section about modifying a slot confuses me,\" I will want to improve that section, but I won't be sure how to. If the same comment mentions some specific headings, paragraphs, or steps that are confusing, I should be able to resolve the problem.

That way, students who want to be peer tutors in a specific course category can offer time slots to other students. I don't want the students in search of peer tutoring to have to enroll in the \"course\" just to schedule a time slot with a peer tutor, though. Thus, I would like anyone logged into my Moodle site but not enrolled in the Tutors \"course\" to be able to click on any student's Scheduler activity and be able to book a time. I have enabled guest access to the course to accomplish this, but when a student clicks to on any student's Scheduler activity link, the following message appears: \"Guests can't do anything here.\" Is it possible to allow users logged into Moodle but not enrolled in the \"course\" in which Scheduler activities are posted to actually book time slots? Thanks a lot. PS - You can visualize what I’m trying to replicate by looking at the first screen in this video: That’s not my video; I’m just trying to replicate the idea of a “course” in which all tutors are listed on the same page and students can click to book time with any of them.",

Second best would then be for the learner to get a confirmation email which requests them to provide the means of communication by which they would like the appointment to take place but I can't see a way of setting up a confirmation email either, just a reminder.

          "Text": "Students working part-time in addition to studying or having little children need different options to make appointments with their teacher. The challenge is to keep the organisation simple. It is a big advantage for teachers to schedule all appointments with their students in one single tool. Being asked for a teacher might make an appointment with a student that was not offered in one of the regular slots. Here the \"volatile slots\" would come in handy. The teacher could add a single slot for the appointment and reserve it for the student. Without setting it to be cancelled after being released the slot could be registered by other students. \"Volatile slots\" also come with the option to automatically send a reminder and with the option to cancel an appointment. Another nice to have feature would be the possibility to offer more slots but set the number of possible appointments per day/week/month to a maximum (n slots : m appointments, n > m). What do you think? Regards Peter",

          "Text": "Hello Peter I'm sorry, the \"volatile slots\" are now gone for good - and in fact, since I proposed to remove them a year and a half ago, you're the first person to ask for them. I think that few people have ever made use of them (as far as they worked in the first place). From my personal experience in using Scheduler, there's a limit to the \"one single tool\" approach. There are always some special cases where I need to communicate directly by e-mail with students to make an appointment, or where I know that they need not/should not sign up for an appointment; for example, if students are ill, on a leave of absence, can't make any of the slots I offer for various reasons... I think these will always exist, and Scheduler cannot cater for all these special cases. I usually set up an appointment for these student in Scheduler once I've fixed the details with them by e-mail. Regarding more flexibility in how many appointments a student can book, that's an interesting idea; something related has been proposed before ( CONTRIB-5267 ). Feel free to add your views there, or to open a new feature request on the Tracker. I must say though that I'm not planning to implement this with priority; I'm not even sure what solution here would be best for most users. Best wishes Henning",

Last year (running on Moodle 2.6) all was fine, students were introduced to the scheduler and it was soon being widely used.  We did a upgrade to Moodle over the summer (to 2.8 - version details above) and when the students returned in September and started using the scheduler we had problems with this happening to every student.  I scrolled the forums here and tried various tweaks (ie, unlimited to 10, making sure no groups etc) but couldn't find a resolution. So I created a new scheduler, populated all the appointments etc.  All worked fine for a few weeks but then we've started noticing the odd student having problems - as I said, its currently an intermittent problem in this one. I changed unlimited to 10 appointments. Several students have booked since then and all was starting to look ok, but its just cancelled the appointment of the latest student to book.  I have been able to rebook the students onto their cancelled slot and then its booked it no problem so it doesn't even appear to be the slot that is the issue. This course has over a 1000 students on it as its open for all our current students to be able to book an appointment with Cross College Support, and it is a well used resource. I've looked to see if there is any link between the students that are being cancelled (ie, have they booked before, is it just our new intake or is it affecting our returning students. have they booked appointments before) but there is no link that I can see. It not even a case of its hitting every 10 students that try to book. At a complete loss of what to try next. We have another course with a site wide scheduler that all our students can use for booking careers appointments and this one may also be experiencing these problems (although its also not so heavily used so hard to tell) Sue",

There are situations when Scheduler sends a cancellation e-mail and then a notification of a new appointment, but as far as I can see in the code, it always happens in this order - cancellation first. As I'm currently without a further clue, can I ask you to look into the log files? First, this would be the Moodle log of the relevant scheduler (see Scheduler administration -> Logs). Look for the relevant time when the problem happened, you can also filter by user. I would be interested whether you see a relevant event \"scheduler booking added\", \" scheduler booking removed\", or both, or none; if both, in which order they occur. Then, if you have access to them, look at the web server logs. I'd like to know whether at the relevant time, there appears a URL that has the words \"scheduler\" and \"disengage\" in it - and if so, whether this comes from the same  ip address as the user that made the booking (cf Moodle log).

However, immediately afterwards, the page was then reloaded (but this time as a GET rather than POST request, to mention the details). Why this happened isn't clear to me - I reproduced it by clicking into the address bar of the browser and hitting \"Enter\", but maybe it's some browser feature unknown to me? In any case, this triggered a bug in Scheduler so that the choice was saved again, but this time with an empty list of slots. Hence your booking was cancelled. I have made a little change to the 2.7 version of Scheduler so that the problem should no longer occur. It's available from the MOODLE_27_STABLE branch on github.

Mention Number of days (Not date) to reach and complete next activity say activity 2, then activity 3 etc. w.r.t activity 1. Now when user enrolls, We define occurrence of activity 1 say 10 days after USER enrollment and hence all other activities follow accordingly as we have already defined the dates with the help of Number of days between any 2 activities. Here by Activity I mean any Moodle activity such as , completion of a lesson , taking a quiz, completion of feedback, etc. I tried to solve the above issue as stated below using Scheduler + Event reminder + Notifications where in I will create a group of new joinees in a month I will create a set of events (Appointments) in a month based on fixed dates with Comments- \" To complete the activity before XX-MM-YY date\" so even if XX-YY_MM is a holiday USER will take this into account and work accordingly to complete the activity before said date. After trying above steps I came to know that a group cannot select multiple instances as multiple instance is in \"No group mode\" only With help of Event remind er + Notifications Reminders will be sent to users accordingly For a new month we can copy the Schedule activity and Change the months at all places. Now I am thinking of- Make a course for a month Make a cohort of new joinees in a month Add Scheduler activity in the course. Enrol this cohort to Course said above and hence all people in cohort will get the scheduler notices Problem here is that they have to accept these dates but NOw they can reject it as well.   SOLUTION is forced ACCEPTANCE with face to face interaction. Please Solve this Problem for me I have been struggling for Months now on this I will be trying above steps and will keep post the results once I am done. The link you sent definately helped on this thought process. Thanks and regards Manish Kumar.",

Just to remark, you almost always will want to run your scheduler in \"No groups\" mode. Enabling \"Visible groups\" or \"Separate groups\" will, in version 2.7, mean that students can book their entire group into a slot; that's quite likely not what you want in your case. Also, note that students will always be able to change/drop their appointments (you say that \"they can reject it as well\"). This is intended, since otherwise they would not be able to correct a possible mistake (accidentally clicking on the wrong slot). You can, however, prevent students from changing their appointments a certain time before the slot. This is done with the \"guard time\" setting in the scheduler settings page.",

It will be part of an upcoming 2.9 relase.) In previous versions, when you set the \"Group mode\" of the activity to either \"Visible groups\" or \"Separate groups\", then students were able to book into slots one group at a time. This was a bit out of line with how other parts of Moodle handle group mode , where it's more like an access restriction. Now, Scheduler has two group related features which are clearly separated. Group scheduling: This means that students can make a booking for their entire group, similar to earlier versions. The feature can be switched on or off at a per-activity level, using the new \"Booking in groups\" setting. Group mode: The \"Visible groups\" / \"Separate groups\" setting will now mean that the activity is \"split in groups\" in the usual Moodle sense: students can book a slot only with a teacher who is a member of the same group. Teachers who don't have the privilege to \"access all groups\" will also see a restricted set of slots only. The configuration settings will be migrated during upgrade; that is, if before upgrade you had a scheduler in \"Visible groups\" mode, then after upgrade it will have \"Booking in groups\" set to \"yes\" and its group mode set to \"none\". Please check your data after migration.",

          "Text": "My institution has a widespread requirement for a good slot booking plugin in Moodle, and I have been evaluating Scheduler as a potential solution. I have set up the following scenario, and the results raise concerns for us about leakage of students' grades between courses: Create Course A with users Student A and Teacher A. Create Scheduler A in Course A and enable grading. Teacher A books a slot with Student A, marks the student as seen and gives the student a grade. Also create Course B, but with users Student A, Teacher A and Teacher B. Create Scheduler B in Course B. Login as Teacher B (who is not enrolled in Course A). Go to the Scheduler Overview tab and filter the view by Teacher A. Teacher B is now able to see the grade given to the student by Teacher A, in a course that Teacher B is not enrolled on and cannot enter. I would be interested in knowing whether others who are using Scheduler view this as a feature or a bug. Are there any workarounds to prevent this happening? I know that we can downgrade the Teacher role capabilities to those of a Non-editing Teacher, but this leaves Teachers unable to book slots for other Teachers. Any comments or suggestions would be very welcome.",

That might seem a little unintuitive, since Moodle's \"coursemodule instances\" are normally completely isolated from each other, and access rights are maintained on the level of individual \"coursemodules\" (eg, Schedulers). However, to my understanding it's a feature, and one that has been in Scheduler for a very long time (back to Moodle 1.9, before I took over the maintenance of Scheduler). I haven't changed it since. I'm actually not so sure how useful the \"Overview\" feature, looking across all schedulers and courses, actually is.

Thank you for the Drop down 'choose' which appears to be a satisfactory solution. There are a couple of other issues that I have.  From the schedulers I have to create a sign in sheet; I used to do this by clicking on session and then clicking on the pencil/change button and then highlighting the list and copy and pasting but the list is no longer available.  The students are all separated by appointments so this method is no longer an option.  If I copy the front page I get 'Picture of student name,student name' which would mean having to delete the 'Picture of student name' for each individual student of which there are often 24. Also in the previous versions of Moodle when in the student role the students could click on a plus sign and find out who else had signed up for the session.  This has now become a red x/who's there?  It would be really helpful if this could be removed.  I would prefer students not know who else has signed up for the session.  Do you think this might be possible?

If you want to export a list of slots from the scheduler, you may want to use the \"Exports\" tab to save the slots as an Excel file. I'm not sure whether the output is exactly in the format you need, but Excel files are quite easy to edit, so you may be able to tweak the output to suit your needs. Regarding the button with the plus sign, you've found a bug in Scheduler 2.5 on Moodle 2.6. This will be fixed with the next maintenance update of Scheduler, due later this month. Alternatively, you can ask your system administrator to copy the graphics \"/pix/t/switch_plus.gif\" from a Moodle 2.4 or 2.5 installation to your Moodle 2.6 installation, which should also fix the problem.",

I like the Scheduler plugin for this, as students can use the same Moodle login as they are using for self-guided learning. However, I really would like the students to be able to see bookings listed that are already booked up by other students, just so they can believe the instructors are making themselves available. If they don't see any already occupied bookings, they may not believe the instructors are actively posting slots and give up on visiting the Scheduler page. I was under the impression the See other student booking on the slot permission would allow this, or is this only targeted at slots that allow multiple student bookings? I realize this function may clutter the schedule screen for some, but making it an option on the settings page (default: off most likely) would allow students to see that slots are being made available, even if they are being booked up quickly.

Is there a way that the more time slots are visible to students?  I would like for them to be able to sign up on a Friday for a Wednesday 1:00 time slot. Thanks for any help or information!",

I haven't traced the bug down to the individual CSS instruction (I'm not maintaining these, I'm just calling a function from Core Moodle) so I'm afraid that part of the debugging would be left for you to do.

This should solve the original poster's problems and also the problems which arise from the fact that you can only drop yourself from a group appointment. You need the group association for dropping group appointments (to drop a group appointment for every member in a group), this could be implemented by reusing the \"Appoint for\"-dropdown menu. Basically the user selects which groups appointments to drop with the same dropdown menu and then the appointments are dropped for all members of that group, if the group appointment existed. Or maybe it would be better to add a separate dropdown menu. Are there other cases where that group association would be needed (= would it be more reasonable to add a slot-group association table)? Also it could be more user friendly to hide all slots that are already booked by some group. I can implement this if it sounds reasonable. I've chosen to use this plugin at my university, however I think that this group appointment problem needs to be solved somehow first. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice how to proceed. Should I add tickets to the issue tracker? Oh, another issue I had. Slot list pagination doesn't seem to work if the user is a student. I have a use case which requires for continous slots around the clock and without pagination the list becomes too big to use.

          "Text": "Hi Pirkka As you may have noticed reading this forum, the group scheduling process is a quite complex issue. I agree that this is an area of Scheduler which might use some review in future versions. Some of the questions involved are: Should the booking be for a group, or for the individuals that were in the group at the time of booking? Can individual members of the group drop their own appointment (or that of the group)? Who can make an appointment for the group? Should grades be given on a per-person or per-group level? Should the same scheduler contain both group and individual appointments? These are just some of the questions to which different users may have different answers, and I'd be interested to hear what is actually required out there. However, the current group scheduling feature has been around in Scheduler - almost unmodified -  for 8 years or so, and I guess that a number of users rely on the current functionality as is, so changes have to be done with care. I'd also expect that any nontrivial changes to  group scheduling will trigger quite large-scale changes to the code. In short, I'm inviting opinions on this point, to find out what requirements and typical usage patterns actually are. But I'm not planning to implement (or integrate) major changes to the group scheduling feature in the short run. Regarding paging in the student view, this in fact doesn't exist at this time. However, you may want to vote for CONTRIB-5194 . (Zero people have voted for it so far.) Best wishes Henning",

But why not start with the following ( just brain storming, I am not sure how complex to implement): In the scheduler setting  add an option to force group booking. if this option is chosen: the student will not have an option to book for himself only, the drop down will have only one option ( for the group). any one of the group members can make the appointment the time slot will be locked for any additional booking , even there are enough seats. I don't see any problem of keeping the option for the student to drop him/herself. it will be nice to give the instructor an option to revoke entire slot appointments I think this will be a good start , which can be enhanced in the future. regards wasim",

          "Text": "I'm currently a user of moodle 2.6 inside a large university in the UK. I run a non credit-bearing English language support programme for International students which I administer through moodle. I currently allow students to sign up to workshops using the scheduler module in moodle. We had previously used the 'Choice' module but scheduler simplifies things by automating reminder emails and generally providing us with slightly better overall functionality and a bit more information. Unfortunately the ideal maximum number of students per slot would be around 25, but is presently limited to 18. We can't use the 'unlimited' option as unfortunately demand for the programme exceeds what we can deliver and this would be unworkable. We once accidentally set a workshop to unlimited and had over 40 signups in two hours - the workshop had to be cancelled. The e-learning team at my institution have advised that they are not able to set a maximum number higher than 18 due to the scheduler module itself. So, my question is: Is there any kind of workaround that the team at my institution may be unaware of? Having searched this problem before I feel like I have seen people alluding to having customized this. If not, is there any other method of working or other modules which might offer similar functionality to what I need without making administration of the scheme unworkable?",

This will affect all users of the site, though, and will make the drop-down menus longer. I'm not quite sure why the value is 18 for your site.

          "Text": "That's right, you can't start an appointment slot in the past. In some earlier version (back in Moodle 1.9 times, when Valery Fremaux was the maintainer), Scheduler was very strict at this point and didn't accept any slot dates/times in the past at all. The idea is that setting up a slot with a date in the past isn't useful, as it cannot be booked by anyone (in fact, Scheduler would delete such slots if they are empty). However, this sometimes lead to problems when teachers were correcting data of slots that had just recently been attended (they might be editing the data for record keeping purposes). Therefore, I decided to make Scheduler more \"lenient\" at this point and allow slot times slightly in the past. The cutoff of 10 days in the past is, I admit, completely arbitrary but it has so far been sufficient for practical purposes. At the moment, there's no configuration setting or similar with which the 10 days period might be changed. That might be improved, but I'm not quite sure what the expected behaviour should be and why - who really needs to set up appointments in the past?",

          "Text": "Hi Susan thanks for this detailed explanation. I can reproduce the behaviour that you describe, and I must say it puzzled me for a while. The solution is, in short, as follows. You have correctly configured the time format (core_langconfig / strftimetime) to include the AM / PM part. (I would not change core_langconfig / locale though.) However, it turns out that the localized value for the English text \"AM\"/\"PM\" in the Spanish (Mexico) locale is, in the default configuration, just the empty string. That is, someone thinks that \"AM\" in English translates to \"\" in Mexican Spanish. Now this translation is not determined by Scheduler. In fact, it's not determined by Moodle either, and not even by PHP. As it turns out, it is determined by the operating system . On my Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) machine, I solved the problem as follows. I edited the file /usr/share/i18n/locales/es_MX and replaced the line am_pm   \"\";\"\" with am_pm  \"<U0041><U004D>\";\"<U0050><U004D>\" Then I ran \"sudo locale-gen\". This finally makes the AM/PM text correctly show up in the scheduler on Moodle. (Weird enough!) Of course, since all this is operating system dependent, it may look very different on your machine.

If a teacher tries to move to a new page in the \"My Appointment\" View (either by clicking the page number or by clicking the \"Next\" link), they are instead taken to the \"All Appointments\" view. Essentially, the URL used by the page buttons: https://mymoodle.edu/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=00000&what=view&offset=1&sesskey=aaaaaaaaaa is missing the \"&subpage=myappointments\" parameter that keeps it in \"My Appointments\" view.

Well, I've been doing some work on the master branch recently and the 2.7 version of Scheduler should be released soon, i.e., in July or August. Your help in testing would be much appreciated. Please note that the current master branch should not be used on production systems, it's for development/testing only! Wait for the \"official\" release, there will be a MOODLE_27_STABLE branch. For the changes: Although you won't see so much from the user prespective, I've been cleaning up and rewriting a lot of old code paticularly in the student and teacher views. This also included a complete rewrite of all Javascript code (now based on YUI3) and some security enhancements (sessionid checking is now used throughout). While I have fixed some old bugs in the process, I'm sure that I have introduced some new ones as well; I really rely on you to find them! Feature changes: You can now allow students to book several appointments at once. (This does not work together with group scheduling, though.) You can specify, on the activity level, a \" guard time \" to prevent late changes of slots. If, for example, the guard time is 2 days, then students will be able to book new appointments only if they are at least 2 days ahead, and they can't drop appointments if they are closer than 2 days. The \"volatile slots\" feature, on the other hand, has been removed. Also, Scheduler now supports the new logging API (Event 2). At the moment, I've added only very few events, basically when a student views the booking screen, adds or removes a booking. There are certainly dozens of other events that one might define as well, particularly on the teacher side, but I'm not sure which ones would really be useful. If you're missing any event definition / logging feature desperately, let me know. Areas that need review in the future, but that I didn't manage to cover this time, include exports ( CONTRIB-4131 ), notification messages ( CONTRIB-4647 ), and student-supplied data ( CONTRIB-4924 , CONTRIB-4690 , CONTRIB-4199 ). If you want to help in testing, please check out the master branch to a Moodle 2.7 (or 2.8dev) installation, and report any issues to the tracker ( https://tracker.moodle.org ) . Be as specific as you can regarding which version of the code you're using - it's best to mention when you last updated from github (as the code may change frequently at this point). Thanks in advance! In particular, there are some bugs listed on the tracker that I had trouble reproducing. If anyone can shed a light on whether they occur with the latest version, this would be very helpful. Best wishes",

          "Text": "Hello all, here's a short question to Scheduler users, which however needs some explanation. Teachers can, at any time, create appointments for students by editing the corresponding slot (clicking \"edit\" in the list of slots) and adding the student there. However, there are also some shortcuts for the same task, namely via the \"Schedule\" and \"Mark as seen now\" buttons in the list of students. The screens used for these have changed a bit in the latest version as I have reorganized the underlying code. It seems that they can still use some fine-tuning (cf. CONTRIB-5134 ), and I have always felt that it's a bit unclear whether Scheduler does at that point what users actually want. Therefore, I wanted to do a quick opinion poll: which of the following scenarios are actually relevant in your use of Scheduler? a) The teacher selects a student, then enters date and time for a new appointment. b) The teacher selects a student, then selects an existing slot to schedule the student in this slot (without further modifications to the slot). c) The teacher selects a student, then selects an existing slot and edits the slot data (e.g., changes location, slot description, date or time).",

          "Text": "Dear Scheduler users, I'm considering to make the following non-backwards-compatible change in future versions of Scheduler. At the moment, Scheduler has a feature called \"Volatile slots\". When a slot is marked as volatile, and the student booked into the slot cancels their appointment, the slot will be deleted so that it is no longer available to other students. However, this deletion happens only if the slot is within the \"Reuse guard time\" of the current time (the \"reuse guard time\" is a setting at the scheduler level). This feature is somewhat difficult to use and in a sense incomplete (e.g., it means that students can't sign up for new individual appointments shortly before the slot, but they can cancel their appointment, or sign up for a group slot). I'm planning to remove the \"Volatile slots\" feature entirely, and replace it with the following: At the level of an individual scheduler, you will be able to configure a \"guard time\". If a slot is closer than the \"guard time\" to the current time, then students can no longer change their booking on it in any way (they can't make an appointment, or cancel an existing one). There will be no option to configure this on a per-slot level. See also CONTRIB-4862 . However, before I do that, I'd like to ask whether anyone is using the \"volatile slots\" feature at the moment, and if so, for which purpose, so that I'm not removing functionality that is actually required widely.

They wonder if the changes in Scheduler 2.7 will have a big impact on their usage. This is exactly what they have to say : \" We\nuse the feature 'Scheduler' with the possibility of 12 people (up\nto 20 people in certain cases) registering in the session (but with\ncertain limitations...) *A\nnew registration IN the session (or OUT of the session) must not have\nany impact on the other registrations in the session.( The only\nchange to be seen is in the number of registrations available .) *\npeople are allowed to un subscribe\n(if needed) and therefore it will alter immediately the number\nof registrations available .\nThis will offer a new opportunity for a new subscriber. *\nSomebody registration in a session in the 'Scheduler' implies\nthat he/she will not be allowed to register in a new session of the\nsame activity, unless the session is passed. If so, he/she will be\nallowed to register in a new session These\nfeatures are very important for the activity we have set up and\nshould remain the same .... Possible\nevolution : We\nwould appreciate if we could have the following opportunity for the inscription\nlist: So\nfar, the list is 'frozen' at the O Hour: (the exact time chosen\nfor the session) It\ncould be very interesting for us to have the possibility of freezing\nthe list at Hour minus1 or Hour minus 2 in order to print it and keep\nthe list unchanged till the session of the activity. \" Can we have your thougth ?",

          "Text": "Hello Gaël Regarding the first three features that you mention: There is no (intended) change in these in Scheduler 2.7. For this to work, you need to set the configuration option \"Students can register 1 appointment at a time\". This means that students will be able to book a new appointment once the they have been marked as \"Seen\" in the previous one. Since I rewrote a substantial part of the code, however, it may well be that I introduced some change unintentionally, which is why I appreciate your help in testing (see below). Regarding the \"frozen\" slots, this is exactly what I intend with the new \"guard time\" feature: If you set the \"guard time\" to 2 hours, then students will not be able to book slots in the last 2 hours before the session, nor will they be able to remove their booking in the last 2 hours. Since these features are, as you say, very important to you, it would be best if you could try whether they do actually work in your particular setup. That is, you should best set up a Moodle 2.7 site (a test site, not your actual production site) and simulate exactly the steps that you need for your activity. If you encounter any errors, let me know via the Tracker. Best wishes Henning",

          "Text": "Hi, I was at a meeting with one of our departments today, and they thought that Scheduler has a great deal of potential. We went through setting one up and then somebody said \"How can students tell us where they are?\" Ah. Turns out that these meetings take place at a location the student chooses - that might be in their space, or in a place where they would like to display their work, or somebody's office, or wherever. They're art students, but this would be good for students of design, performance, horticulture, anything involving site visits, etc. So I'd like to propose an extra setting which when enabled gives each slot an extra text field with a label prompting students to enter a location. Where enabled, this should be forced, so students can only save once they have completed it. Where an existing record is changed, this should trigger an email to both student and tutor. If you agree this would be helpful, please add your vote on the Moodle Tracker - CONTRIB-4199 / https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-4199 Henning, thanks for looking after this lovely module. At my last place we used a form pasted into a Wiki - Scheduler is so much slicker. Yours, Mira",

If you can prepare a French translation, that would be great. The Scheduler 1.9 strings should be a good starting point, but they need to be adapted a bit, particularly with respect to the e-mail templates and some new help strings. If anyone can provide good translations in any language, I'm willing to add them to the repository. Ideally these would be provided on github so that I can integrate them easily. It's best to work from the \"master\" or \"MOODLE_23_STABLE\" branch. Any questions regarding technical details, please let me know.

The issue we have found is that when students within a group choose an appointment slot, the 'Save my choice' button lies right next to the 'appoint for my whole group' tick box (see screenshot attached).  Alot of them don't read the information contained in the questionmark (Group appointment -Choose whether you want to make the appointment only for yourself, or for an entire group) and just tick the box.  Thus the whole group gets enrolled into the slot. Is there a way the the two items could appear separately so they are not confused.  More spaces between the two options possibly or on a separate line?  How can we edit the code exactly to achieve this and could we change the wording to make the action for explicit? Any advice would be much appreciated. with many thanks, Aleks",

          "Text": "Dear Scheduler users, I'm in the process of preparing a Moodle 2.5 release of Scheduler. Apart from the usual adaptions to API changes, I have also (finally) rewritten at least a part of the module's code, in particular involving the forms for adding/updating slots. There's not too much change in functionality or added features, but I hope to update Scheduler to use improvements of the Moodle APIs (since 1.8 or so) and to bring it more in line with the core code. While I hope that this rewriting of code improves the long-term maintainability of the module, I'm fully aware that it has likely introduced some bugs as well. Therefore, I'd be very grateful if you could test Scheduler 2.5 before I release it. You can do this by checking out the \"master\" branch from the github repository ( https://github.com/bostelm/moodle-mod_scheduler/ ). Please report any errors here in the forum or (preferably) on the Moodle Tracker . Best wishes Henning",

Even if the user is supposed to see the teachers's profile. What happens is that the resulting link is : http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X While the right URL to correctly display the teacher's profile should be : http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X &course=Y How can I have this work ? I can think of 3 logical possibilities : There is a setting somewhere in Moodle enabling a user to display the profile even if the context course id isn't declared in the url (not sure whether such a setting exists) Change the definition of the \"attendant_url\" variable to include the contexted course id Create a new variable such as  \"attendant_course_url\" that would generate a link like \"http://siteurl/user/profile.php?id=X&course=Y\" Having no notions of PHP I cannot fathom how to do this, but I'd be glad to learn for the occasion if someone can think of a simple patch to the plugin to enable it.

I've experimented with the scheduler to let students select time slots for vivas. In order to share out the students, they're randomly assigned to a different tutor. The only way I could see for it to work was to create a group (all students assigned to tutor A), then to create a grouping (Grouping A = Group A); set up the scheduler - for tutor A (so just visible to Grouping A); set time slots & select Tutor A as the tutor. Then do the other groups. Clearly, as they're vivas it's only 1 student per slot. So, I want them to select their own time, but let the rest of the group (who haven't really got anything to do with them, other than randomly getting the same tutor!) choose their own. If you set Site Administration -> Plugins -> Activity Modules -> Scheduler -> Enable group schedulin g to 'No', as suggested, can you still attach groups to scheduler? Or, can anyone suggest an alternative solution? (The appointments were set for one person, but it seems that if someone clicks the 'group' you end up with two in the slot regardless.)",

The drawback of that, as far as I could tell, was that then each tutor could see a list of everyone who's not signed up for a meeting, rather than just those in their group/grouping. I'm wondering that was me selecting the wrong combination of groups/groupings/visibility in general?

I'm using the administrator account and not a specific teacher account.  Maybe that's the problem? Stay tuned.",

I took a while to figure out how he did it, I found it... if I say the slot duration is something like 0.001 minutes in one hour it will produce 60000 slots... A solution I find to deal with this is to check the duration paramenter, something like: $duration=intval($duration); however this can only be done when duration < 1, where it enters the partial numbers, or simply by limiting it to a minimum value of 5 minutes.

A few entries, though, don't appear to be in the \"scheduler.php\" file and are not translated (see attached gif) : Students, Staff, Group Size, Occurances, Appointments, Duration (in pages studentbreakdown, staffbreakdown, etc). Does anyone know where I can find them? Spanish and german translators perhaps? Raúl, ¿has encontrado el mismo tipo de problema? ¿Tuviste que traducir otro fichero que el /lang/es_es/scheduler.php? (I don't have to mention that I do have translated all the entries of scheduler.php) Thanks for your help. SB",

Reasons for this: There are two missing columns in table mdl_scheduler_slots There is one sql-statement to be repaired Fixes, (you can do this at your own risk): Add columns teacher and  appoinmentlocation to the table  mdl_scheduler_slots. For example: % alter table mdl_scheduler_slots add column teacher bigint; % alter table mdl_scheduler_slots alter column teacher set default 0; If you have already entries in table you should change teacher values to zero. I am not sure about this. But I did it. and % alter table mdl_scheduler_slots add column appointmentlocation text; And edit line in .../moodle/scheduler/view.php (line 849), it should be: $sql = \"SELECT * FROM \". $CFG->prefix . \"scheduler_slots WHERE $select ORDER BY starttime ASC, student ASC LIMIT 25  OFFSET \".($start*25); which is understood by postgres7.

We consider it essential to\nmanage the setting of tutorial meetings in our mixed presential/virtual\nenvironment.\nI have reviewed all the versions and modifications published in this thread and have almost completely rewritten the module to synthesize in a coherent code all the useful functions. I have added functionality to support standard moodle groupmode, and manage groups to create new slots (teacher can set that only students that are member or a given group can book) and to appoint meetings (meetings can be established for a whole group at once). Now the module works either in exclusive (only one appointment per student) or non-exclusive (several slots can be booked). I have included a more detailed description in the README within the module. In the way, I have seen easier to re-structure the code if the tables were re-structured also. Now there is an _slots to store only the attributes of a teacher-created time-slot (timing, teacher, type of slot) and a separate _books table to keep record of whom student has booked what slot. Due to this change I have renamed the module as Appointment, just to make possible to have both installed alongside and compare functions. Renaming it back to scheduler is a simple search&replace. The module need a lot of testing, please let me know any bugs, errors, or problems in general that this code may expose. I am open for any suggestion to improve it. Regards Enrique",

Unfortunately, no one has replied, so I can't tell you any more details, although I would love a competent answer. I paste the old post below. Cheers, Michael ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I am not experienced at all with PHP (or moodle, for that matter) but found that the error on the teacher's calendar seems to come from a couple of missing lines in lib.php which don't populate the instance-field in the event-table. Adding $teacherEvent->instance = $slot-> scheduler ; below line 290 in both the update and the insert block will add the instance number (which is the primary key of the scheduler-table) also for teachers and the event will appear on the teacher's calendar. Is this correct or am I overlooking something? Is there a reason why the instance is not supplied for teachers? One reason might be this: Now that I can see the event for the teacher, if I try to edit or delete the individual booking in the calender I am actually editing or deleting that instance of the scheduler, which is of course very dangerous. In any case, would be great if somebody could confirm or not if that is rubbish - or not Michael btw the same thing is true in the appointments object",

I added these two lines (in the code above), which seems to work with the issue discussed in my previous post.

I have created several courses, and I am a teacher of only a few of them. Is it possible to add appointments in different courses without having to manually check thay they don't overlap? I could always add it in the parent course, but since I'm not teacher of every course I would like to avoid that (at least, as long as the group feature of adding activities for a single group is not implemented). Thanks!",

          "Text": "(APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE: I also posted this information under the discussion thread for \"Scheduler\" module, but since I posted here earlier, I wanted to make sure folks received my update. I have updated Scheduler to work with Moodle 1.7.2 and higher (my version is working in Moodle 1.8.2) and I'd be happy to share the revised code with others to test on their sites. Please send me a message with your e-mail address (you can use Moodle.org's built in messaging), and I'll send you my hacked version of Scheduler. As was alluded to elsewhere in this thread, the version of Scheduler (2005100901) currently available for download from Moodle.org (as of 7/31/07) was written for versions prior to Moodle 1.6. With Moodle 1.7.2, Roles fundamentally changed, and the old table used to store teacher/student information was removed. This causes several of the queries that Scheduler uses to fail, because it's looking at the wrong tables. In addition, there are a number bugs other bugs in the code that prevent portions of Scheduler from working as intended. I've documented the changes I made to Scheduler in order to get it working at Lafayette College. It revises the code so that it knows where to look the traditional \"teacher\" and \"student\" role information. That said, this version of Moodle is not smart enough to recognize the post-1.7 Roles system, which relies on \"hascapability\" and other such flags set at the admin level to determine which roles get access to which capabilities within Moodle. My queries work, but the entire module really needs to be updated to integrate properly with the new Roles system. I'm not the maintainer for Scheduler but I would like to collaborate with other Moodle programmers/users to bring my hacks and the rest of the module into line with the current Moodle code base. While this code works for us, I think that it needs more testing -- and more permanent revisions to the way it handles Roles -- before it's ready for primetime. If you are interested in working with me on this project, or have any questions about my changes, please contact me. Ken Newquist Lafayette College",

Obviously, you will surely have translmated the lang/...  subdir, wich will be of a great interest for me to add to the distribution , but you will also want these templates being translated in german, so that mails will be fired in your language. What you need is very simple : clone the mails/en_utf8 dir to mails/de_utf8 with all its content, open every .tpl mail template and translate or rewrite exactly the message you want in.

Feel free using it to report in english issues such as you mentionned in the forum. There is no real plan for a \"release\" version as we worked with a french team to make a \"major debug action\". There may be reliquates, even in a \"release\". I do not have master policy on when I could qualify a version as released. Mostly would it be when actual feature level do not present any noticeable bugs. That should be acheived when enough reporting will have been done. My policy is \"be always urgently reactive when you know where to look for\". Suscribing to that development space will you be immediately informed when a new release is available and which issues it will fix. (both EN and FR communication, which costs me twice !!)

How difficult would it be to alter this mod to work outside of a specific course, and be connected to a specific professor?  Is that option in the pipeline for the future?  Thanks for any help!",

There's not much to be changed about that, at least I'm not planning to; it's the basic structure in which Moodle works. What you can do is to create a scheduler on the Moodle front page , which would then be available to all users. Or you can create one course for each professor, where he communicates with his students/supervisees and can in particular add a scheduler. (This might seem quite complicated at first, but we do indeed run this model on our own site!)",

Basically, after creating a suitable Category in which to hold the moodle sites, you create a 'meta' course and add to it all the child courses that the Prof teaches. Then you merely add the scheduler activity into this course. Obviously the courses will have to be changed each semester / term but that's just a matter of adding and removing the appropriate child courses. There's no way I know of to automate this so while it would work for one or two teachers to do this manually it wouldn't scale to a whole insitution. In the latter case you'd want to hire a Moodle expert programmer  to automate the process.",

The jammed meeting time were 11 and 11:15 this Friday, Nov. 2. I used the \"thumbs-down\" function on the 11 'oclock slot\" (and later he also used the thumbs down function to clear out the 11:15 slot). When I try to reproduce the problem, I am not able to. The appointment slots are limited to two users, as they should be. I set up the scheduler with him, so I'm confident that the appointments were set up correctly. Below is a screenshot of the current state of the appointents that he is referring to (with names redacted). Does anyone know why this might be happening? Could it be a browser issue, or an issue with a lot of people signing up at more or less the same time? I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this, since I can't recreate the problem. Thank you, Rebecca",

I am doing this update with a copy of our production database so that I can test out both the update process and the module behaviour with real data. Now, my understanding is that when plugin modules update if there is a change in a database table this will be taken care of by the updating process. Well, this seems to to have happended for the update I am trying to accomplish because I get the following errors: \n```text\nThis script generated 2 warnings - Scroll to the first warning\n\n\nscheduler module needs upgrading\n\n\n(\nmysql\n): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mdl_scheduler_appointment   \n\n\n(my\nsql\n): SHOW TABLES   \n\n\n(mysql): SHOW INDEX FROM mdl_scheduler_appointment   \n\n\n(mysql): CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid)   \n\n\n1072: Key column 'schedulerid' doesn't exist in table\n\n\n\n\nADOConnection._Execute(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid), false) % line  891, file: adodb.inc.php\n\n\nADOConnection.Execute(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid)) % line   89, file: dmllib.php\n\n\nexecute_sql(CREATE INDEX mdl_scheappo_sch_ix ON mdl_scheduler_appointment (schedulerid), true) % line 2364, file: dmllib.php\n\n\nexecute_sql_arr(Array[1], true, true) % line 1458, file: ddllib.php\n\n\nadd_index(Object:XMLDBTable, Object:XMLDBIndex) % line  116, file: upgrade.php\n```\n Inspecting mdl_scheduler_appointment table reveals that the field schedulerid does not indeed exist.I figured that I could create the field manually and I was told \"Look at the install. xml file in the mod/scheduler/db folder and you should see a description of it.\" Alas, the install.xml file contains no reference to 'schedulerid' in table  scheduler_appointment. So I'm not sure of where to go from here. Maybe if I dropped all the tables and had my test moodle system create them from scratch to see whether schedulerid is created in the scheduler_appointmtne table that would be a start. Then, perhaps importing the production database over the top might leave the filed where it ought to be.",

All slots are provided to the student user for choosing.  Under \"Group Session\" it indicates \"Yes\".  (there is no indication of group size, or number of students allowed into the time slot).  When time slots become unavailable they drop out of the availability list altogether.  An indication of \"booked\" might be better, but not a significant issue. Student chooses a single time slot from the list of slots and indicates the group (within the grouping ) from a single dropdown box at the bottom.  All good. If the student immediately drops the appointment, the other members of the group drop as well.  I think this is ok. If the students logs out/in, the other members of the group are not dropped if appointment is cancelled.  This is good. If the student books an alternate session (after booking/log out/log in), the other group members are moved to the new session as well.  This might be problematic, will see how it goes.  In this case, it might be better to disallow the alternate booking.  Or provide a message...  \"Currrently, you cannot book this session for your group as members of your group are already scheduled in an alternate time slot\".  The way it is necessites the function of a \"team captain\", where I would prefer that any student in the group can book the group (convenience), but where they must cancel individually. All in all, this is very good news for us, and I hope this functionality is found to be useful for others.  Thanks Henning / Vivek ! Note:  I will try and do some more thorough testing for bugs, etc, but its going to have to be lower priority at this time.",

We've noticed a few issues. Here is a list of ones that I've got directly in front of me: 1. The Scheduler description which you set within each scheduler's settings does not show up for students when they are signing up for an appointment. Therefore, it's not possible to create specific instructions for students within each scheduler. 2. a.) If there are two or more separate schedulers within a single course and b.) A student has reserved a spot in more than one of these... Whenever said student cancels or changes their appointment in one of those schedulers, it removes the student from their reserved spots in ALL schedulers within this course. Not good! 3. When editing an appointment slot, all of the slot's settings become reset instead of retaining their previous state. I know there were a few more issues but I think this covers the most serious ones. Should I create tickets for these in the Moodle contrib tracker? As for the new feature part of my subject; I created a new function that retreives the appointment location of each scheduler slot. For whatever reason unknown to me, students cannot see where the appointment they are signing up for is located. In fact, the only place a student would find out the location of their appointment is if/when they receive an appointment reminder email before the appointment date (assuming it's even set to set a reminder email). So, now in the student's view of the sign-ups, they see this: I haven't worked on getting this into the teacher view because it wasn't as much of a priority... if anyone would like to know how to modify their scheduler, let me know and I can post the code. -Tony",

It's not perfectly stable at the moment, and help in testing is appreciated. If you find a problem, the best would be to send me a message via my Moodle.org account . Please note, my current goal is to develop a version of the module which: works in Moodle 2.0 upwards, does not use deprecated function calls of Moodle, integrates with most of the APIs in Moodle 2.x (in particular: gradebook, backup, internationalization). At the moment, I'm not planning to add new features. I would rather start a general refactoring of the code - which is much needed, in fact! - but these are more medium term plans. The new version includes an English language pack only. If someone would like to provide translations (or transfer them from 1.9), please contact me.",

Actually the code that has been released in the HEAD is preparing the Moodle 2.0 compatibility, that will totaly breack the 1.9 behaviour. Thus we are maintaining as far we can the 1.9 version on the MOODLE_19_STABLE branch and refered so as \"Download for 1.9\". I do not know if this covers all the desease you got, but this will probably be frequently happening as soon as non core contribs will be reviewed for 2.0 reintegration. Cheers.",

Thinking that this was following the general Moodle practice of designating a point release, a la '1.97' with subsequent updates for bug fixes as '1.97+' built weekly (or, as I interpret it, the \"latest version\"), I used the \"latest version\". One idea might be to clearly label the versions in the contrib section as being designed for \"2.0\" if that's the case, rather than simply \"latest version\" which is a bit more ambiguous. Happy to say that after I quit trying to \"fix\" the latest version and just deleted it, the 1.9 version installed happily. Apologies to you and others for the misinformation I posted earlier, and thanks for the mod! Cheers!",

I'll get in touch with our system administrator tomorrow and ask him to have a look. We're using version 2008061700 (or earlier, I seem to remember we had to tweak the version number to be able to backgrade to a working version of the module, but the info is on my PC at work) of the Scheduler on a Moodle 1.9.6+ install (Build: 20091104) We just added a few lines of code as described in this thread to prevent admins to show up as needing an appointment. They still show up as possible Members of Staff though. Just a thought: could it be linked to the fact that I'm also an admin of the site? I seem to remember there were issues with that, and none of my colleagues with regular teacher access have reported anything similar, but I'll have to ask them tomorrow. I tested the news forums, other emails are sent normally. We'll be upgrading to 1.9.7 soon, which version of Scheduler should I install and what's the direct link to the package? I'm never sure I download a version for 1.9 or 2.0... At the moment, I'd rather have no reminders sent than one every 10 minutes (which is, incidentally, the duration of the slots) That's all I can say now, thanks a lot for your help, if you have any idea about what else I should do please let me know ++",

Some remarks: The latest 1.9 version of the scheduler is here: http://download.moodle.org/plugins19/mod/scheduler.zip but if you want to be very sure, you can take it directly from the CVS repository at http://cvs.moodle.org/contrib/plugins/mod/scheduler/ (take the version tagged as MOODLE_19_STABLE). For the \"admins show up as teachers\" problem, see CONTRIB-1612 . It's not yet fixed in the latest version in CVS, but there's a patch stored in the bug tracker. I think however that this problem is unrelated to e-mail reminders. If you urgently want to disable the reminder e-mails, look for the following code snippet in \"mod/scheduler/lib.php\", and comment it out (or delete it): \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n  = get_record\n, \n, >studentid\n;\n  = get_string\n, \n.fullname\n.\n;\n  .= get_string\n, \n.\n;\n  .= \n,>starttime\n.\n;\n  .= get_string\n.\n;\n  .= \n,>starttime\n.\n;\n  .= get_string\n.\n;\n  .= \n,>starttime \n \n>duration \n 60\n.\n;\n  .= get_string\n, \n.>appointmentlocation.\n;\n \nemail_to_user\n, , ,\n```",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm using Moodle 1.9 and I am trying to incorporate the schedule module. I am a trainer for a small corporation of 185 employees. Every other month each employee is required to attend a face to face meeting, typically I do this with 9 dates per month and allow employees to choose the date they want to attend. I have several issues which reading previous forums answer some, but I still have a few questions. 1. The employees have a certain time frame to schedule their appointment, once that time frame is past I want to schedule an appointment for them and keep them from changing it. Is there a way for the administrator or teacher to schedule an appointment for the student and then lock them out and keep them from changing it? 2. If I use the group mode is there a way for the group to come on different days? or does the whole group need to schedule the same appointment. 3. I allow employees to change their appointment up to one hour before the meeting. Is there a way to stop employees from changing their appointment 59 minutes prior to the meeting?",

I thought I'd just go in and delete them but it, unfortunately, isn't that easy. There is no way to: 1. Control how many scheduling slots appear on one screen 2. To select all slots at once (\"Select all\") There is a \"delete selected\" button and that would be greatly improved by adding #1 and #2 above.

That's independent of whether the grade scale is set to 100 or otherwise. Regarding the patch: When coming across some odd behaviour with grade display within the scheduler, I discovered that it was not possible to change the grade scale to anything but 100. After fixing this bug, it turned out that with the scale turned to \"No grading\" or non-numeric scales, many other, immediately visible bugs occurred. Hence my impression that the scheduler grade funcitonality is not much tested, and should be used with care. Henning",

I'm using the same version of the scheduler plugin (Moodle reports it as 2008061700).

          "Text": "Hi, until yesterday we used scheduler with moodle 1.8.x without any bigger problems (ok, we just disabled functions not working). Now we upgraded to moodle 1.9.5+ and updated the scheduler to that version for moodle 1.9 available on the module page at moodle.org. But here my problems begin to rise. First there is a bug referencing a variable \"$displayaddbuttons\" in commands.html when viewing the scheduler page as a trainer. This bug prevents the add buttons from being shown. This variable isn't been defined in the scheduler module. After fixing that i'm getting the add buttons. But clicking on the left one (adding a session?) brings up the next error: \" Fatal error : Call to undefined function scheduler_getteachers() in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/addslotsform.html on line 78\". This function isn't been defined in the scheduler module. Maybe i'm missing something or the scheduler module is broken. Maybe this is an outdated version available for download ? Btw . using the cvs version makes things not better. After fixing the bug with \"richtext2\" mentioned in an other thread here, i'm getting the next error message: \" Fatal error : Call to a member function insert_record() on a non-object in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/lib.php on line 35\" . I would like to see those errors fixed.",

I downloaded the scheduler several times now from http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=2732&filter=1 where \"Download for Moodle 1.9\" links to http://download.moodle.org/download.php/plugins19/mod/scheduler.zip . After putting it into my testsystem (following version of moodle: Moodle 1.9.5+ (Build: 20090916)) it installs and upgrades table for scheduler. Btw. scheduler module states itself as of version \"$module->version = 2008061700\". This version does not work for my moodle 1.9 install! See picture in attached zip file. After turning on debugging, i get the following message: \"Notice: Undefined variable: displayaddbuttons in /var/www/html/moodle/mod/scheduler/commands.html on line 4\". A few days before i downloaded an older version of scheduler module from http://www.ethnoinformatique.fr/course/view.php?id=122 which is named \"2008061700 - Scheduler release 11\". This one states itself also as of version \"$module->version = 2008061700\". This version seems to work for my moodle 1.9 install although it seems to be for version 1.8! Making a diff of both of those schedulers i get many differences which shouldn't be if both would be of the same version!!! I will attach a zip file containing a diff file with differences between both downloaded scheduler archives with module version as of \"$module->version = 2008061700\" and the error message when using your recommended version.

J'ai installé la dernière version de Moodle donc 1.9 Par la suite, j'ai dézippé et récupéré les données des étudiantes et de moi comme enseignant dans cette nouvelle installation. Ensuite j'ai installé la version de Scheduler provenant d'ethnoinformatique. J'ai suivi les discussions et installé au fur et à mesure les nouvelles versions en effaçant les données préalablement. Le comportement pas d'enseignant disponible est apparu à quelques reprises mais j'avais l'impression qu'en modifiant la ressource ça corrigeait le problème. Présentement, je suis incapable d'ajouter des créneaux. Évidemment j'ai joué dans les rôles et dans les dérogations en pensant que cela règlerait mon problème mais ce ne fut pas le cas. Trois semaines de cours et après je pourrai réinstaller à zéro toute l'installation de Moodle et ensuite récupérer ma base de données zippé mais j'ai bien peur que ça ne change rien.

If the table model seems to be old, just uninstall and reinstall the scheduler module (uninstall, keep the files where they are and browse once again to admin->notifications).

Ok, \"Delete all slots\" and \"my unused slots\" seems to be clear. But what is the difference between the two other buttons \"Delete all unused slots\" and \"unused slots\"? To me it's not clear, both sound the same. 2. I clicked on \"my unused slots\" which led to deleted appointed slots with out removing the appointments from my calendar and from the calendar of the student. I'm surprised to see that the scheduler checks for collisons when adding new slots. It's nice! What is the next future of scheduler? I would like to see sharing schedulers over more than one course.

          "Text": "Hi Sven, the exact meaning of the button should be told there : http://docs.moodle.org/en/Scheduler:_My_Appointments There was a confusing label in the last release. Basically the four use cases are : I want to delete all slots for every one (the Atilla call !!) I want to delete all slots unused whoever they belong to (closing all scheduling offer) I want to delete all my unused slots, keeping old appointed records I did I want to delete all my slots, appointed or not, but letting the scheduling offer of collegues unchanged. I should have updated labels in the lang files... I hope. Deleting unused slots SHOULD NOT let events in the calendar, as there SHOULD not exist any events for that slots. If it does, it is a bug. If you delete all your personal slots, events for appointed but not met students should disappear, once again, if they do not, its also a trailing bug. Events for other teacher meetings will not be removed. Collisions : the proper of a good information system is getting your information consistent from your point of view. This was essential that you could not make slots in a course when you be already engaged elsewhere. Shared schedulers : working with Michael Schwab (Germany) were some enhancements in the direction : the summary screen summaries all appointments of all your schedulers. The page style is a bit rough and might be reviewed ( css related). Future of scheduler : except for light enhancements and trailing bug fixes, Scheduler should not change a lot from now. I'm now engaged in other developements such as the CodeTrainer module for teaching programming skills online, and have to finish a more general project with Task, TimeTrack and Techproject for student project control.

Once the files are in your system, you must generally browse to the administration/notifications menu to activate the logical installation of your module. Once done, the module is ready to add within your courses. Some module do have some general parameters for tuning them globally. If they do, check that by the Modules/... menu.

I have attempted to view the page using the latest Firefox 2, Firefox 3.0b2, and Safari 3.0.4 browsers (I'm on a Mac so Internet Destroyer, I mean Explorer, is not an option). I turned on ALL of the debugging options to start off. When I clicked on a previously created schedule I got the following message (every browser will ignore this syntax error as far as I know): XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </tr>. Location: http://millen.local/moodle18/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=252 Line Number 171, Column 3: </table> --^ Well, I figured I could fix that myself. But alas, I couldn't find a </table> in view.php. All other parts of Moodle seemed to be working flawlessly so I tried to create a new scheduler activity. When I chose to add a new one I got the following error message: XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </input>. Location: http://millen.local/moodle18/course/mod.php?id=2&section=2&sesskey=EREDXijRfV&add=scheduler Line Number 162, Column 532: <span class=\"helplink\"><a title=\"Help with Default slot duration (new window)\" href=\"http://millen.local/moodle18/help.php?module=scheduler&amp;file=defaultslotduration.html&amp;forcelang=\" onclick=\"this.target='popup'; return openpopup('/help.php?module=scheduler&amp;file=defaultslotduration.html&amp;forcelang=', 'popup', 'menubar=0,location=0,scrollbars,resizable,width=500,height=400', 0);\"><img class=\"iconhelp\" alt=\"Help with Default slot duration\" src=\"http://millen.local/moodle18/pix/help.gif\" /></a></span> </td> So, I decided to delete Scheduler and reinstall it. Even deleting it gave me an error! XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected: </td>.

I ratcheted it down a notch to ALL and things ran like they had before. So, here is the actual useful message related to my error: Parse error : syntax error, unexpected $end in /Library/WebServer/Documents/moodle18/mod/scheduler/addslotsform.html on line 189 Looking at addslotsform.html, it is only 189 lines long so there was some closing line expected I would guess (yeah, you can tell I'm not a programmer!).

Actually the last debugging setting is very \"strong\" and will not let any needle pass through. The first XML strictness error stops processing by your browser. I'm not lucky (or am too lazy) for having Mac version of browsers, working on Windows, and XML error reports on IE or Firefox are really uncomplete, quite unworkable. Yours seem much more interesting. Why you cannot see much stuff in view.php is because I organized the code using includes for isolating modules. The faulty part may not be in view.php, although it is at first loaded through a view.php call. Of course the errors you discovered could not be fixed by a simple reinstall, as they are present in the distribution. Some errors can be fixed so, specially when they are caused by old or obsolete code that has been not correctly upgraded. Anyway, this setting is too heavy just to watch an applicative error that would accept syntactic weaknesses. You were right setting it one level down, although you gave me enough information to tighen my HTML generation. I will check all this at once and give you feedback very soon. Cheers.",

I don't know if it was supposed to copy some lang file or something else for other folder, cause if it was supposed i haven't done that. Other question, to uninstall one block or module i just need to delete the proper folder, right? So, just let put my doubts clear... i don't know if the scheduler module can fulfill all my goals, because what i need is a kind of a weekly calender, divided by hours, where the students can book the access to one computer (for example) and when this booking is done, any more student can't book to the same hour. Do you think the scheduler module still a good option? If not, do you advice me something else? Cheers, Vitor",

Modules are self-sufficiant from Moodle 1.7, that is, the distribution structure now accepts language and help files in the module's package. 2. For uninstalling a module or a block, you FIRST uninstall it logically clicking on the \"delete\" link front of the module name in admin -> Modules -> plugintype Then only will you delete the module directory. If you don't follow this exact procedure, the module still is recorded with the last known version number in Moodle. Still worse : all the instances of this module or references to these instances WILL NOT BE cleanly deleted from other parts of Moodle. 3. For you purpose, Scheduler could do the job, I think. I was thinking about offering alternative timeline views, so that easyer reference to a specific weekday could be available. The slot can of course be understood as \"a time token\" for on person, not only for a face-to-face appointment !! Valery.",

Finally, in case you use other modules from ethnoinformatique.fr, you moight protect the last function declaration in locallib.php, just like this. /** * adds an error css marker in case of matching error * @param array $errors the current error set * @param string $errorkey */ if (!function_exists('print_error_class')){ function print_error_class($errors, $errorkeylist){ if ($errors){ foreach($errors as $anError){ if ($anError->on == '') continue; if (preg_match(\"/\\\\b{$anError->on}\\\\b/\" ,$errorkeylist)){ echo \" class=\\\"formerror\\\" \"; return; } } } } } this is I confess, an architectural irresolution of this module set, that used a redundant utility function in several modules, as we have no common \"third-party\" lib space that would be easily usable for making blind installs. I checked that some data actually do not restore in the scheduler. I work on it before publishing next release. I'll fix all this in release 8. I will add a little enhancement to release 8, that is, allowing to distribute grade and/or comment on all participants of the slot when grading the appointment.

          "Text": "Best is you report as quickly as you did a misbehaviour with the (most) exact situation. There are things odd that will appear only when the module is used in a \"very near limits\" environment. The course settings I made on www.ethnoinformatique.fr for handling module support is precisely to be able to track up bugs in a couple of hours delay, and to keep that kind of delay even when the offer will grow (which is the real nightmare as you are distributing more and more modules !). By the way, could you send me german translations for four new keys, please ? $string['availableslots'] = 'Available slots'; $string['availableslotsowned'] = 'Owned'; $string['availableslotsnotowned'] = 'Not owned'; $string['availableslotsall'] = 'All slots'; Keep on arguing here on Moodle forums as we can discuss about enhancement opportunities, and still get the opinion of the Moodle community. Note that I'm still planning regular enhancements to scheduler module based on my own experience of the module : Next published version has an overall statistics page added to check about registered, appointed, seen, to see, to appoint, missing or unregistered, and finally available slots count, so we can check very quickly the situaiton of a massive appointement process, and know so quickly if we had set enough slots for it. (implemented yet). I plan changing the slot table to a Flexitable, so that it could be sorted, filtered. I still wonder if these features are really valuable. There were some requirements for programming an appointement directly by picking a Moodle group in the course context . This could be fine I think. There is a plan to display a calendarize view of the available slots, such as a cellbar over the slot list (for students) giving \"paged access\" to the 15 following days from \"now\", eventually sliding over future time. This might propose a cleaner view to students to check to appoint that day rather than that other day. Last but not least, I'm studying the situation where the module could be used for managing \"enrolement appointements\" for externals which just should have to have a temporary account binded to an additional role \"Prospect\" or something like that. Least at last . I plan an additional switch to unlock grading possibility to a non owner of a slot. That is right now, if you assign a set of slots to a teacher, only that teacher will be able to give a grade to the appointment, also he can attend the appointment. Adding that switch would let choose a more \"liberal\" and \"collegial\" way to manage appointment resolution. All these are prospective. I would react on \"popularity\" indication for that or this feature... Have not so many time... Thank for arguing, if interested or concerned, of course.",
