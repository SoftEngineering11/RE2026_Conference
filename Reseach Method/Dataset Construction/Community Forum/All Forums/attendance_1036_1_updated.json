I also see a grade of 100% being given if attendance is not recorded at all for the first 2 sessions for a given student, but they are marked as Present for the last 4 sessions. If the above is correct, does anyone know of a straightforward workaround to achieve a passing grade when 5 or more workshops out of 6 are attended (short of creating 6 separate Attendance activities , putting them in a Gradebook category, etc.), and having the grade appear correctly throughout the course (i.e. before attendance for all sessions has been taken)? As always, thanks in advance for your time! Steve",

In that case you will not be able to use this setting within the attendance plugin - set \"prevent students sharing IP address\" to \"No\". Moodle does have some admin-level settings that allow it to control where to look for the users IP Address - ask your Moodle admin to take a look at the \"getremoteaddrconf\" setting under admin > server > HTTP - they may need to add a list of your organisations web proxys to the ignore list and may also need to adjust which HTTP header contains the users physical IP address.",

However, a few students have managed to circumvent this daily attendance check by registering directly as present for future appointments. After the problem arose, I was able to find out through a conversation with the students that the problem was with the smartphone registration. Once the QR code has been successfully scanned, the students are taken to an overview where they can also see all future dates and register for them directly. However, this only works via the smartphone directly after attendance has been determined. A direct click on the attendance module in a desktop browser for example shows them the overview of their own registration but does not allow them to register early.",

Add a session with check this check box 'Allow students to record own attendance' -> Add a students password with QR code -> Create 3. Login as a learner using Moodle Mobile App 4. Add a org name and login 5. Go to the course -> Attendance activity -> Click on the submit attendance button 6. Enter password and submit the attendance 7.

Issue:  I wish to create Repeat Sessions over a Semester for the Monday and Thursday series of lectures.  However, in setting up Repeat Sessions it appears to me that only one time period is allowed by default.  If I use the Monday 11am-12 noon time period, I have no option to change this for the Thursday lectures at 9 am. Solution?  Is it possible to have two different time periods included when creating  the Repeat Sessions or must I consider create all repeat sessions using just the Monday time period and manually alter the 13 Thursday sessions to the appropriate time. Many thanks for reading this.",

After submitting the teacher attendance form, the app takes the teacher to the activity page with the stats. Then, if the teacher presses the back button in the header, they are taken back to the attendance form which they have just submitted. That is somewhat counterintuitive, because they have just submitted the form and they probably want to go back to the course page (if they want to resubmit the attendance they can click the update attendance button again). My question: after submitting attendance, is it possible to make the back button in the header take the teacher back to the course page and not the form page? Another option: in the form submit action, instead of \"method=\"mobile_view_activity\"\" what would be the right thing to write to take the teacher straight to the course page?

I would like to let students record their own attendance by scanning the QR code with the QR code changing every 15 seconds and that Moodle record automatically if students scanned the QR code before the beginning of class (e.g., 10h30) so that the students are marked present but that if the student scans the code after a certain time (e.g., 10h32), Moodle automatically records the student as late. What times would I need to include in the session field here: to make that happen (if it's possible)?  Thank you.",

The pages I downloaded these that these versions from ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_attendance/versions and https://moodle.org/plugins/block_attendance/versions ) say that these versions are supposed to work with Moodle v4.1. The upgrading process went without problems, and Moodle works. However, before the upgrade, when viewing a course's attendance, there were options to \"Add session\", \"Report\", \"Convert\", and others. However, now there's only a button to \"Add session\". I then upgraded Moodle from v4.1.2 to v4.4.1, in an effort to fix this problem (and reinstalled the appropriate versions of the Attendance module and block, 2024060402 and 3.2.6 (2022112500), respectively). Again, the upgrading process went without problems, and Moodle works, but there's only an \"Add session\" button available when opening the Attendance of a course. I've attached a screenshot that shows what a course's Attendance looks like after the upgrade, and a screenshot I found on the web that shows approximately what it used to look like (except that my site also had the \"Convert\" tab). I have googled for a solution for this problem, but have not found anything helpful. Anyone have any idea on a solution?",

Remember to also setup the attendance status, where you can enable which attendance status it must be taken automaticaly. On the other hand, all attendances already registered can be modified from: course->attendance->session->edit. Hope this information helps you. Kind regards",

Ensure that you've set up the plugin properly, including specifying which attendance statuses should be recorded automatically. If the teacher can view the QR code, it suggests that you've already completed this setup. However, it's important to review all relevant options to ensure smooth functionality. Remember, you can also modify attendance records for sessions that have already taken place. Simply navigate to: course -> attendance -> session -> edit. I hope this information proves helpful. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask. Best regards, Kevin",

          "Text": "I read the documentation attendance and auto attendance. I have it set up to semi-automatic, however when I add the session for the week (I don't want to add multiple sessions as I would have to probably put the main under general and try and add each session to each week) I had a student go in and try and check into the course. I was not logged into my teacher interface; they got an email permission error. So, am I misunderstanding how this works? I plan to try and do this tomorrow, if possible, so 1. what is the quickest way to add multiple sessions without going to each week and adding 1? If I add multiple after going to the week number and adding attendance as an activity the whole thing will show up in week 4 in this case. I kind of do not want that. I want each week to be a separate check in. And now that I checked the semi-automatic option in my admin interface, how then can I have the student mark themselves as present if I'm not logged into the interface. Can I have it send an auto email? Or so I need to be logged into my teacher interface, or have one of the other instructors who are in the class be logged into theirs? I did read the docs, but the process is not very clear to me yet. I will get it; it just takes me a while sometimes to grasp a function. Btw my students are visually impaired, well some of them are, and so the QR code might not work well for them even though I have the rotation set to me think 2 minutes to give them time to scan with their phones. Is there another way they can mark themselves as present and accounted for? I want to make sure they are not having any issues due to accessibility . I am taking attendance via a google docs spreadsheet as a back up btw. So that works fine. I'd rather have a backup, always always always. Thanks all for the help you've given me thus far throughout my moodle journey.",

          "Text": "I do not think you can make these kinds of changes after any attendance sessions have been recorded. To change it so that Excused gets the same credit as Present, it can be changed in the Site Attendance settings. Under the tab 'Default status set' you can customise the value of each status. When you create a new attendance activity, it will use these values. I understand that you are already 4 weeks in but you could do the following: 1) Export all attendance data for the course so you don't lose who attended when 2) Create a replacement attendance activity (name it something slightly different to the old one so you don't muddle them up). 3) Create all replacement sessions for your course 4) For each session you have already recorded, you can upload a CSV file to repopulate the entries: a) Click the button to start the register b) Click 'Upload attendance by CSV' c) Drag and drop a csv file with just two fields. I did email and status e.g. \n```text\n    email,status\n\n\n    examplestudent1@thisplace.com,P\n\n\n    examplestudent2@thisplace.com,P\n\n\n    examplestudent3@thisplace.com,A\n\n\n    examplestudent4@thisplace.com,E\n```\n Apparently it will except username as an alternative to email but I didn't try that. 5) Delete the old attendance activity",

We have only just switched over to capturing attendance on Moodle, but all sessions for the year leading up to now are paper registers. Can that data be captured in a CSV and uploaded with student and session info? I can see that sessions can be created using the CSV import option, would I need to create all the sessions first and THEN capture attendance, or can it be done simultaneously? I'm a bit lost, TBH.

Running Attendance plug in version 2023020107 on Moodle 4.1.4 (Build: 20230612) One of our users  has up until now been downloading the individual attendance reports from Moodle for each course. They've noticed an update however, they can click a button to show who has attendance 'below 100%', however there doesn't seem to be a way to 'view all participants' on a course, e.g. they are required to click individually through pages of data (21 pages in the example) and click this button each time. Is there a way around this? Is there a way to change the 'users' visible on a page, or 'view all'? Pressing 'all' at the top right hand side will show all attendance dates, but not all students. In theory they need to download the data from each attendance report, to analyse which students have attendance below 100%. They can click the ‘below 100% button, however if there are e.g. 100 students on the course, they can only view x25 students per page at the moment A follow up question; is this reporting data lost year on year, if it is not extracted? Can a page be archived?",

          "Text": "Hello, We have several of our training programmes using the attendance plugin for their training days. One of the biggest selling points for attendance was the QR code option that becomes available on sessions once 'student self-record' has been enabled. However, one of our administrators noticed that some trainees who weren't in attendance had somehow marked themselves present even though they weren't there to scan the QR code. I realised that the QR code wasn't a key as such (which is what I had assumed), but rather just a hyper link to the self-record page, and any trainee was able to login and self-record during the hours of the session, even if they haven't scanned the QR code. I thought I'd fixed this by setting the attendance activity settings to \"Available but not shown on course page\", but some clever trainees had still found their way to self-record their session, likely through the gradebook or from attendance notifications. Is there a way we can keep using QR codes, which our training schemes absolutely love, but have these QR codes be the only way for trainees to self-record attendance? We really don't want there to be any way for absent trainees to mark themselves present. Is the only way to do it to also use the passcode along with the QR code? Please let me know if you can advise.",

          "Text": "Hello, We are having an issue with grading for the Attendance module. It works great for taking attendance. However, it calculates a student's grade oddly if you are using natural grading for the course. Specifically, it scales the grade up percentage and point wise based on the student's attendance to date. The logic is so that the student is not penalized for classes that have not yet occurred. However, the grade is inflated to the max points for attendance for the entire course. For example, if the total attendance grade for the course is100 points for 10 classes - the student will see they have 100 points in the gradebook after the first class attended rather than the 10 points they have actually earned. The problem resolves itself at the end of the course when all sessions have been completed. However, it skews the grade while the class is still in progress. Has anyone else encountered this and do you have any recommendations? Thanks! Eric Evans Union College",

Our user has taken an export of 1 attendance activity from within a course (there are 2 in the class site), and it's produced a report that shows the sessions from that particular instance of the activity. In this case there are 4 sessions, and student has 2/2 for each, and we are expecting a total of 4 x Ps, but the PLEA grid reports 6Ps, and 12/12. There are another 2 sessions in a different attendance activity that this student has been P for, but this seems to be contradictory given the bounds. So just looking for some clarification if the PLEA rightsection is \"global\" to the course (this is suggested as the Export page does say \"Course attendance\"), and if so this then raises a question about where's the exported information for just this activity ?",

The main objective was to create a report in order to give tutors access to a simple yet effective way of seeing their students' attendance on each course We have developed two plugins, the report mentioned above and a block that can show tutors their students with lowest attendance. A detailed explanation of their functionality can be read hereunder. Report Attendancetable This plugin adds a report to show the attendance percentage of all students enrolled on a course. It generates a table counting all of their attendances on each course (present, absent, late and excused) and calculates the attendance percentage on each attendance activity and the average percentage across all courses. Students can also view said information about themselves. Block Attendancetable This plugin adds a block that shows tutors their students with the lowest attendance percentage an easier to access view for their own attendance. The student block shows each attendance activies' attendance percentage, the course's percentage, the average percentage across all courses they're enrolled on and a bar (which can be toggled off by the tutor) with each session's attendance info, which includes: the date and time, the status and the attendance activity name. Additionally, students can add this block on their dashboard , which is similar to the course block but has a bar for each course instead. All views have a link to the report mentioned above. Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any suggestion.",

I've had a very quick look at the code and reported a couple of things to your github tracker for you to consider but it would also be great to see these submitted to the moodle.org plugins db so that they get more exposure and other people can find them! The other thing I'd recommend you take a look at sometime is the custom report source available for attendance in Moodle 4's report builder tool and the ability to develop/code system level reports using that api ( I've been trying to build out reports in our other plugins using reportbuilder's api rather than the older tablelib/renderer outputs myself, and my longer term plan is to try and replace some more of the core Attendance reporting functions using reportbuilder based reports too.",

Rotation QR code will not help as students can share their passwords to others, send a person instead of themselves or even leave their telephone and ask someone to scan the code. I have an idea - is it possible to make a plugin which will use the camera of lecturers or assistants to scan the code which will be displayed on the screen of the student's phones. For example: while students are entering the classroom, they launch the function, which generates the QR code, shows the name of the student and avatar photo. Assistants can compare this photo with a real person and then scan the code. Plugin will register this students as present at the lecture. Please, see the attached example of the scree on the student's phone during the attendance checking.",

The third attendance doesn't automatically set \"absent\" to the empty student records after more than 1 hour, the only different setting with the first and second one is that I set 'automatic marking' as Disabled (I try to disable because when I choose 'set unmarked at end of session', the automatic status runs well). So, my question is, do we have to set \"Automatic marking\" as Yes or other option (as long as it is not disabled) to make the \"automatic status set when not marked\" works?

Yes - auto-marking must be enabled for it to mark students as absent - here's what the help string for that setting states: If \"Yes\" students will be automatically marked depending on their first access to the course. If \"Set unmarked at end of session\" any students who have not marked their attendance will be set to the unmarked status selected. thanks!",

I can't see how this would work - the users SSID is not passed in the request headers from their browser to the web server - so \"Moodle\" can't find this information out. Usually in this sort of scenario I've seen organisations add the full IP range of known addresses, and then use the QR Code rotation process for marking sessions - that way it forces both the use of the university network, and access to the current QR code... of course that doesn't stop people bringing in multiple devices and taking attendance for their friends. We only get the users originating IP address - The only way I can think this would be possible is to have some form of API that allows Moodle to ask your network infrastructure \"what access point does this IP address use\" - but that would be heavily dependent on your network infrastructure and heavily custom to your specific environment (and hard to make it generic/useful for other organisations not using the same infrastructure.)",

The WiFi access point takes the role of a piece of physical hardware the students have to shake hands with. In our case, opening the entire IP space is really not optimal, because we also must rely only on a single QR-code displayed to all the students, which would be quickly shared to anybody at home... BSSIDs can be detected by eg Android apps, but it seems not really possible in a browser with php/ javascript , which is probably what you refer to. The API should use things like this: Java Examples & Tutorials of WifiInfo.getBSSID (android.net.wifi) | Tabnine , I guess, but no idea how to realize this. Maybe this would work inside a Moodle android app? Quite a bit of an effort, though... Money is not the problem, but rather to go through the administrative offices of our university to be allowed to use the money to fund you. Depending on your experience with such interactions we can surely talk about a project.",

Yes - we can get at the SSID from a Mobile app, however in your initial post you stated that you wanted to allow it from the \"student's phone/PC\" - (not just phones) - If you could force all your users to use an android or iOS device and install a custom mobile app so they could track their attendance, then yes, it might be possible. There are probably 2 ways to do this - we could build you a custom app just for attendance tracking, but it would probably be better to build you a branded Moodle Mobile app and bake the attendance improvements into the custom build for you. It's possible we could push some of the improvements into the open-source mobile app build, but we'd probably need to discuss the details and you'd likely need a good sized budget to support it., But... here's the big thing - you need to work out, how important is attendance tracking - and how much will the feature actually decrease the ability of learners to game the system - the answer is - probably not by much.... devices are extremely cheap, it's relatively easy to bring in multiple devices into a large room and they can just scan themselves and their friends in using different devices... Could that expense be better spent on other methods of attendance tracking that would be more accurate and better prevent \"cheating the system\" - possibly? - but feel free to reach out privately if you'd like to fund some development on this.",

Student at home modifies the mac address (BSSID) on their cell-phone(easy with a number of different free apps) turns mobile hot-spot on, connects their laptop or other mobile device to that hotspot with the modified address and bingo - it lets them record attendance without being on site. lets take a stab in the dark at the cost of developing a custom mobile app with these features and include time spent by university staff/meetings to discuss/lawyers to sign contracts etc.. - lets say USD $60,000 (probably more) worth of effort between all parties, thwarted by a student with an hour of free time then a simple method of reproducing a way to get around it for all your students on site.",

The data for un-enrolled users is still retained within the attendance tables, so it's possible we could improve the attendance reporting to include un-enrolled users, but that would likely require funding for my time to improve the reporting. The longer term aim is to replace some of the reports within attendance with the new Reportbuilder API that is available in moodle 4.0 and higher though - so I'd prefer to see that work completed first before we added further functions to the reports.",

I merely hope (request) that the Attendance module functions the same as every other Moodle core module to allow sorting by any of the name fields (lastnamephonetic, firstnamephonetic, alternatename, firstname, and lastname). The Assignment module, the Gradebook Module and pretty much all of Moodle works this way, ID number ordering by tweaking the source code of the Attendance module is completely doable and I am the site Admin. I'm just a little shocked that such an integral module would not \"behave\" the same as the rest. I hope the maintainers are reading this.

(it may just be I'm using the wrong wording) I need to be able to check that the attendance is being completed by the teachers after each session, as they tend to leave it to the end of the month and then make mistakes. It's a new system for them too and I understand that it takes a while to change after jotting down attendance in a notepad for years. Is there a way to produce a report that shows all of the courses, with all the sessions programmed between certain dates, and which ones have had attendance recorded? The only way I can see to do this at the moment is to go into and check each of the courses individually. Not sure if it makes a difference, but we're using Attendance version 3.9.3 Thanks in advance for any advice and comments. Chris",

Perhaps someone here can offer a hint. Our intended usage: We have a blended class where we deliver lectures to students via Zoom (without the Moodle plugin) and we provide all the other learning resources in a Moodle course. We would like to use the Attendance plugin to track that they went to the Zoom lecture. We would like to use the \"self-reporting\" feature with a different codeword for each session, that will be presented during the Zoom. We would like to allow them to self-report their attendance in Moodle any time after they get the codeword, for a fixed period of time after the Zoom is finished. Let's call it two days. I set up each session with the date and time of the Zoom, and I create a codeword. I went into the \"Status Sets\" and put a value of 2880 (2 days in minutes) under \"Available for Students\" ... and save it. During that date and time window, Submit attendance is available for my students to click on, key in the codeword, and they can self-report. However, after the end of the specified time window, Submit attendance disappears ... it does not seem like my 2880 minutes from the time the session begins is valid. I was then thinking that it is possible that the Attendance date and time was intended only for the session time in which they may mark themselves present (i.e., they must be in Moodle during that windows). My workaround would be to make the \"Session\" last two days ... but a session can only take place in one date with a start and end time. So ... any suggestions? What am I doing wrong?",

If that's the case, this a more serious problem than just recording attendance for other students. 2. You can set the QR code to rotate, and rotate fast enough so hopefully students won't be fast enough to share it effectively. See the following settings in the Site Administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> Attendance area: Rotate QR code/password interval (seconds) [attendance | rotateqrcodeinterval] Rotate QR code/password expiry margin (seconds) [attendance | rotateqrcodeexpirymargin] Of course you have to set the QR to rotate in the activity itself. If you don't have this option and settings, maybe you are using an old version of the \"Attendance\" plugin. 3. If your students attend the campus physically, and you're not already using this option, check the  \" Require network address\" [ attendance | subnet] option and related settings. This way you can limit student to record attendance only while being connected to the campus Wi-Fi, for example.",

Phones are pretty cheap, I have a drawer full of old devices here myself... The other thing you can consider to make it harder would be to implement 2FA for your students - requiring them to login with a second factor - not just a password - your existing identity provider might already have this functionality, otherwise you could use our MFA plugin: https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_mfa One of the things I've thought about in the past is to somehow re-trigger the MFA token request on the take attendance page but that would require some development. but.. to be honest - the students will probably find a way around it - all you can do is make it harder.",

My team and I work on a clients' Moodle - SIS implementation and here is our situation: 1) We don't have access to clients' Moodle server (account) - so we are not hosting it, we can't see the DB and currently we can not get access to it. 2) We solely use API Web Service to communicate to clients' Moodle server using authorization token in their Moodle Instance, and so far we have built multiple functionalities regarding this integration such is getting and pushing students, getting and pushing courses, getting and creating enrollments, getting rolles etc. More than 15 functionalities. 3) In the stock API Documentation, we can not find any `function` regarding pulling students' attendance in the way we need it - to get the data from the `Attendance` plugin they assign to each course and populate with Present, Absent etc. Does anyone know what is the route we need to take?",

If we can not find relevant \"stock\" Web Service, can this be resolved by adding some sort of a plugin or a report that would be designed for our needs either by our client's Moodle host or by us?

If a teacher selects her name as absent or present for that day by mistake, moodle does not exempt her from that day's attendance and adds her to attendance list for that day. There is no way to deselect her attendance once an option is selected. If there is an exempt status added, it is the same as choosing other options. She is added to the attendance and that day is counted. The only solution seems to be adding a \"deselect all\" option under \"set status\" dropdown menu  and deleting the entry for that particular student. Other than this, the student is added to that days attendance list and that day is counted in her total attendance. Do you have another suggestion to solve this problem? or have I understood your suggestion correctly? Kind Regards, Alper",

The result is better when I add a 'curdate' parameter value, such as https://<moodle>/mod/attendance/view.php?id=1553667&curdate=1633372200 (the value of curdate is the Unix timestamp for 2021-10-04, 12:30 local time) Is there a way to get the effect of the 'curdate' parameter without specifying it explicitly and just using the value of the current time?

Or should I set up separate sessions for each group (which seems a lot more time consuming). If I go for the first option of one single session using groups, that session gets marked as completed (green arrow) in the actions menu as soon as any one of the tutors marks attendance for their group ( which is a bit confusing for the other tutors who have yet to record their attendance). Is there a way for groups to share a session but only have tutors see it listed as completed when their student group has had attendance marked? Any advice would be gratefully received. Kathy",

I don't have access to the backend, so is there a way for me to fix this on my end? Or am I just doing something wrong?

We use the attendance plugin to define \"Lessons\", or \"Lectures\" within the course. The courses consist of a face-to-face lecture and a subsequent Quiz. The activity setup is like this: One Attendance activity One Quiz activity To prevent the users from seeing the Quiz before-hand we have added an access condition for the Quiz (i.e. users need to get a pass grade in the Attendance activity to be able to see the Quiz activity) The current design of the Attendance activity doesn't seem to implement the concept of \"adding users on a per-session-basis before-hand and then allowing the teacher to mark the users as present when they show up for the lecture (whose duration corresponds w/ the session duration)\". What I would have liked to see is a feature were we would be able to add a set of users before-hand to a specific Attendance session but not setting their attendance status at this time. Then, during class, the teacher could just tick them of as present/absent, preferably using a block showing the users for the current session and check box next to them. Are there any other methods to achieve this, maybe? Kind regards, Peter Rundqvist",

I've noticed that there are duplicate instances of Attendance listed wherever all activities are shown e.g. under Site administration / Plugins / Activity modules / Manage activities and also under Site administration / Courses / Activity chooser / Recommended activities. The activity chooser will also show our instructors the duplicates, it's not just on the admin side. Here's an example screenshot: We only have one instance of the mod_attendance plugin installed (I assume Moodle makes it impossible to install multiple of the same plugin anyway), so this is very mysterious to me. Is this a bug with Moodle 3.10 or with the plugin? Has anyone else witnessed this behavior? You can see our workaround—we simply hid one of the activity instances—but it's still strange.",

Interestingly, if I try to show or hide the second Attendance plugin, only the first one is affected. Must be somehow related to how the /admin/modules.php page is coded (looks for the first plugin with a matching name and changes its visibility). I looked at the \"modules\" database table and found the duplicate there: we had two modules with `name = 'attendance'` . One of them (the second, the one with higher `id` number) had no associated instances in the \"course_modules\" table. Given that this is our test server , I went ahead and deleted the second row out of the database . Everything seems normal now, no adverse effects yet. My guess is the attendance plugin installation must have somehow been interrupted in the past and the database step was duplicated. It's strange it was only noticeable on 3.10.",

The first thing I want to see is how many people were there at each session. There is a big empty space, where I guess I should see these first level figures between Description and Actions, but nothing shows up... 😪 # How many present / absent in the REPORT First row I hoped to find them at the TOP of the report, but no luck, there must be a theme problem too. Bottom... but with paging I had a bit a partial luck at the bottom of the report, unfortunately, I couldn't find the setting to disable the paging . Therefore Go to report I need to go all the way down I get 21 present and 4 absent on a first page, then I have to got back up at the top, to find the link to the next page then got back down then see the 11 present 0 absent do the math in my head I am sure we have got a very old version of this plugin, or a missmatch with our theme... Would love to get hints on how to simply have the numbers at first click from this activity once the attendance call has been done on sessions. Regards François",

We have a global audience conducting a single ILT face to face session at varied dates, times, and locations. Students are only required to take one session. The admin would need to create each session, not the instructors. It would be great, though, if the instructor could upload attendance after the session in bulk as a csv, if it's possible. (I wasn't clear if bulk upload is possible with the attendance activity? The last post indicated that bulk upload for attendance wasn't available.) To continue, we can't have separate course pages as it would be too hard to track. We have reporting connected on the back end that may be a challenge to attempt to connect to this. To add to that, we wouldn't want students to enroll themselves or send an email notification. When I was checking on setting this up, we wouldn't want the course to have multiple sessions due to enrolling participants manually as it would assign them to all the sessions. I have seen the post to turn off the calendar notification.  Very helpful on that, thanks. Am hoping that there's a simple solution and looking forward to your ideas and processes. Thank you!  Stay safe and healthy.",

When I click on the session link, it takes me to the correct session for that user. Does anyone have an explanation for this behaviour and how I can fix it?? Some users have 10 or more ghost sessions in their calendar! Things I've tried: Delete the (test)user, re- upload , re-add to the course, re-add to the session - other sessions reappear Turn off 'Create calendar events' in the Attendance settings, reset the calendar then turn create events back on - legit sessions go away when 'Create calendar events' is turned off, but the ghost sessions never go away Delete all the sessions and remake them -  legit sessions go away when 'Create calendar events' is turned off, but the ghost sessions never go away Help??",

          "Text": "Hello, sorry for my english, I am german. I hope you can understand my request. I search for a plugin to check our offline course attendance. This plugin works fine but it has one huge downside. Maybe it is possible to fix this or someone can give me a good workaround. We can check the attendance live at the start of that course. But we have to document the status with things like present, absent with illness, absent with valid excuse, absent for other reasons. This will not be done from the teacher of the course. It is a procedure long after the course is finished from another person who can check for the letter of apologies. So my idea was, that the class teacher opens the student detail view (screenshot below) and can change the status to the aforementioned and can add a comment if necessary. This is possible but the class teacher has to open each course for that and has to search for that specific student and must do it for every course on that specific day. It this student is absent for 3 or 4 days it takes ages to change that. The solution for this would be, to change the list entries for status to dropdown (or option button) and for comment to form fields. So it is really quick to change that in a batch. Is this possible and is this a good idea? If so, can anyone add this idea to the plugin? My school want's to pay for adding that option if needed. Kind regards, Thomas Hoyer",

The attendance plugin uses the newer (and simpler) method of using PHP code, templates and Ionic markup within the attendance code to allow support within the mobile app - unforuntately this method does not currently provide support for offline access. It might be possilbe to develop a remote add on (see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_Mobile_2_(Ionic_1)_Remote_add-ons ) but I'm not sure if I'd be all that keen including that in the core Attendance codebase. You could look into adding support to the Moodle mobile app code so that the newer method supports offline access, but there is probably quite a bit of work involved there - and you'd need to get it accepted in the moodle mobile core code before adding support to the attendance plugin. thanks!",

My assumption would be that to facilitate offline access with the ability to store data into the sqllite db we would need to either develop a remote add on like I mentioned above, or develop this functionality within the Moodle app codebase, however I'm willing to see my assumptions proved wrong! If you'd like to improve the ability for offline pre-fetched pages in the app to be dynamic or store information within the sql lite db, I'd suspect you would need to dig into that process a bit more than I have to find out how much work might be involved in adapting the app to support this. As mentioned earlier - I'm not convinced that I would want to maintain a remote add on within the Attendance plugin db - anything that lands in the plugin becomes my problem to maintain in future, so if you decided to go this route you would need to work extremely hard to convince me of the benefits and of your ability to knock this out as part of GSOC. thanks!",

So, I have read the implementation of offline feature of quiz in moodle mobile app. For offline feature, quiz module use TypeScript code written in \"moodleapp/src/addon/mod/quiz/providers/\" folder. Here TypeScript code handle all function such as prefetch, quiz,saving of response, synchronisation etc. We can also use similar approach. In order to add offline functionality for attendance in moodle mobile codebase moodle mobile app community's opinion is very crucial. But unfortunately I did not get any response from 29 December to till now Now I am working on more details of working of offline quiz and offlinefunctions option of moodle mobile app. And also waiting for moodle mobile app community's response Thanks and Regards, -- Shiv Charan https://github.com/ShivCharanSharma https://codebuddy.code.blog/",

FYI I am a volunteer GSOC mentor, and I volunteer time working on a number of plugins (like Attendance) so I won't always have time to respond quickly. The Quiz activity is built into Moodle core, where-as the Attendance plugin is a 3rd party plugin - typically only \"core\" plugins are supported directly within the app, so there might be a barrier getting attendance specific code built-into the core Moodle app. Typically the remote add on option is used for this - and I don't really want to maintain a remote-add within the Moodle code-base unless a client funded my time to do this with the intention of helping with the maintenance costs. If you could improve the existing app in a generic way that allows for plugins to make better use of offline capabilities without having to build specific plugin code within the app that might be more acceptable to the mobile app team.",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm in trouble with grade calculated on sessions taken that is not considering the number of total sessions. Here an example: my attendance activity has \"grade\" set on Point and \"maximum grade\" equal to 12. In this activity I've added 4 sessions. There are 2 participants: User1 and User2. I've registered the first 2 presence for User1 and just 1 presence for User2, without registering the other sessions, so there are just 3 rows on the attendance_log table (two rows for User1 and one row for User2). Into the Evaluation Report for the attendance I see 12 both for User1 and User2. I was expecting to see 6 points for User1 and 3 points for User2 because the other sessions are not registered yet (because they are in the future, so it's like they are absent in the other sessions). This is a problem for me because I cannot use the evaluation of attendance as condition for the course completion, since User1 and User2 have not 4 sessions registered. There is something I can do changing the settings of the attendance activity? Or I need a more complex condition on course completion?",

          "Text": "In my experience, the way the Attendance module determines a grade is not what I would have expected:  I would expect a user not marked present for a session to be assumed absent from that session, while the Attendance module appears to completely exclude from calculation sessions where the user has not been marked (either as attending or not attending). Using your example, my guess is the Attendance module reports 12 points for User1 \\( 12 * \\frac{2}{2} = 12  \\) and 6 points for User2 \\( 12 * \\frac{1}{2} = 6 \\) . This gets even more confusing when a given user is not marked (present/absent) in a given session: to continue your example, in session #3, if User1 is marked as present but User2 is not marked at all, the Attendance module will likely report 12 points for User1 \\( 12 * \\frac{3}{3} = 12 \\) and 6 points for User2 \\( 12 * \\frac{1}{2} = 6 \\) . I hope that helps, and good luck!",

          "Text": "As a Teacher, you can have Moodle automatically mark students as absent after a session is over. As an Administrator, you can set this as the default behaviour in the Attendance plugin Settings, so perhaps your administrator hasn't done this for you. As a Teacher , begin by checking the \"Status set\" and identifying the default status (see screenshot 1 below: status \"Absent\" is probably what you want. Then, when adding a new session, expand the Student recording tab and select \"Set unmarked at end of session\" in the \"Automatic marking\" field (see screenshot 2 below). This tells Moodle to set the status for any students who haven't registered their status to whatever the default status is. Moodle runs a periodic batch job to set the attendance status. If your session is 60 minutes long, Moodle will wait until after that before setting the status. I think you can also specify that students must record their status in say 30 minutes, even if the session is 60 minutes, so I presume Moodle would set the status after 30 minutes in that case.",

The desired output is a printable weekly attendance report that shows an attendance register for a chosen group of users. At this stage the only criteria for \"attendance\" is that the user has logged into our instance of Moodle. We have an instance of Moodle 2.9 that I'm hoping that we will be able to upgrade to the latest stable version, later in the year.  We could add a module at that stage, or possibly before, if it is straightforward. I would be very grateful for any advice on how to proceed.  Also, please do tell me if this module is not suitable, or if I should be posting elsewhere. Richard",

          "Text": "Hello All, Is there a way to hide from students the \"User Enrollment starts:\" date so students cannot see it when checking their attendance reports? The reason being is our admin staff manually enrolls all of our students into all courses using a Bulk upload of a CSV file each semester. This bulk  CSV file is frequently reuploaded daily during the first month of a semester into Moodle. The Registrar updates our Student Information System (Separate from Moodle) and our admin staff exports a CSV file from the SIS and then uploads it into moodle almost daily for the first month of a new semester. This is a blanket roster upload across all courses updating whichever students were not in the previously imported CSV file. Reasons can be late registrants to courses or students who are in appeal to be reinstated into our University after being previously dismissed during the previous semester. We have only begun using the Moodle attendance plugin in the last year and did not realize that every time we do a bulk CSV upload into Moodle it changes the Students enrollment date to the last time a CSV bulk upload takes place. Since all of our enrollments are manual and we do not use start or end dates we have no need for the student to see the enrollment start date in the attendance plug-in and it only concerns them when looking at their attendance reports that their enrollment date does not match the date they originally enrolled in the course. This is the method we have used to upload Rosters into courses since the beginning of time when we started using Moodle back in 2010. It is only after implementing the attendance plug-in that we noticed students could now see every time the admin staff did a bulk roster upload as it would change their User enrollment date starts to the last time a bulk upload of users took place. Thanks in Advance for any advice on how to remedy thuis",

We're using Moodle 3.7.1 here and the issue was also with 3.7+. I don't recall seeing this issue in 3.6 though... I've run the reset calendar report initially with nothing to update, disabling the option for it to delete all the events, then re-enabling the option for it to recreate all the events and they seem to work. All the activities that have Open Dates and Due Dates all appear in the Calendar and subsequent Timeline blocks, but no \"Sessions\" Creating a manual event by selecting \"New Event\" seems to work perfectly fine... Appreciate any guidance on resolving this as soon as possible Cheers, Ray",

          "Text": "Dear Dan and All, Apologies if my questions will appear very basic, but I just can't get the Attendance's automatic feature to work like I would want.. I'm using version 3.5.6 on Moodle 3.5.2. Tried a few sites. Is there a configuration that would allow me simply to: 1) automatically set student status in a session to Present if s/he has accessed the course at the required time period (from an IP controlled machine). 2) automatically set student status to Absent under other conditions. I want this to be done **fully automatically** -  without students having to click on \"Submit attendance\", and ideally without even displaying that \"Submit your attendance\" button at all. I'm not sure I understand how these options above interplay with each other and with the session settings below. (2) Session > Edit session I thought the natural settings for me were : Automatic setting: Yes - I just wonder why this is enabled only when \"Allow students to record on attendance\" is on..? Just how much automatic is \"automatic\"? Is this the setting to avoid pressing \"Submit attendance\"? But I still can see that button there... (Another puzzle, why do the other two options require a possible password..? However, I don't think i need to undersand that right now if it does not concern my problem.) \"Automatically select highest status available\" - I assume this reads the \"Available for students (minutes)\" statuses of a given session , right? So I have that selected. Require network address: Use default or enter manual value - this works. Prevent student sharing ... - I don't need this now, but why does the \"Yes\" setting throw the \"Invalid minutes to release\" alert..? My problems  seems close to what I found  here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=364282 , but I just could figure out the settings.. Please advise, whoever can. Many thanks. Przemek",

          "Text": "Good afternoon everyone, I have a colleague who wants to create the following in Moodle using the attendance plugin. I just want to check that I am not missing something obvious. My colleague has students attending a variety of voluntary workshops. If they mark themselves as having attended X% of the workshops available, they are given a badge. There's no obvious functionality to do exactly this with the attendance plugin. I began to look at using grading to assign x points if the student attended. If they received x points, that would be enough to receive the badge. Unfortunately, t he attendance plugin offers only manual or automatic activity completion based on \" Student must receive a grade to complete this activity\". Because of the activity completion settings, attendance won't work for this purpose as the students only need to receive a grade (passing grade or not) to be marked as complete. So, we've used the checklist plugin instead. It leads to my question. Does attendance provide the \"Points over taken sessions\" or \"Percentage over taken sessions\" to the gradebook? Many thanks, Kerry",

          "Text": "Hi! I found something interesting that is potentially the main problem. I saw that your current version of the mod_attendance plugin is 2016031501, so I went to the upgrade path ( https://github.com/danmarsden/moodle-mod_attendance/blob/master/db/upgrade.php ) and started to read the steps that should be done to upgrade from that version. Line 175 is calling a function attendance_upgrade_create_calendar_events(); located in ( https://github.com/danmarsden/moodle-mod_attendance/blob/master/db/upgradelib.php ) which is doing a insertion to the DB in the table mdl_event. For what I see in there, that function was written back in the day, when the event table had less columns to be filled. If you are working with Moodle 3.7, that means $calevent object defined in line 38, lacks of properties that now are needed. That might be truncating the upgrade of the plugin because the insertions to the database are not succeeding. Do you have a way to verify that? Recommended approach? That's tough. I see 2 possible ways: 1. If you confirm that the upgrade is failing because of those insertions, you can patch the attendance_upgrade_create_calendar_events(); to include the new fields of mdl_event table. 2. Do you have a back up of your site? If so, I suggest restoring the site and doing again the upgrade but gradually. E.G. upgrading Moodle from 2.6 to 3.0 then upgrade your community plugins also from 2.6 to 3.0 then upgrade Moodle from 3.0 to 3.7 and again the external plugins.",

Thanks in advance for any assistance!",

We would like to combine the two so the students receives a score of 1 to 4 or absent. Is there any way that either: 1. The absent mark can be set as a null score so that it does not affect the students %, or 2. If we remove the absent and assume a student was not present if no score is entered, would be possible to deselect (or clear) a students assigned grade. We've tried leaving absent students unmarked but if a teacher accidentally clicks the radio button the only way to unmark it is to refresh the page before saving, necessitating a regrade of all students.. BTW , fantastic to see the module included in the mobile app, that has been a great addition for us. All the best.",

Only users with access to login to your Moodle site (or access to your Moodle database ) will be able to access information stored by the plugin.

Set network address in individual session levels isn't working too. I can use 3G either. Am I setting default network wrong? The network must be \"10\" because the second part of IP already changes (10.45, 10.120, etc.).

As Bruno said, having configured the Default subnet in global settings, I'm am expecting that, in sessions with Require network address -> Use default selected, the default would be used. The current behaviour seems to be different and it seems that the default subnet is never used. I've checked the code and the default subnet is used only as default when creating the Add session form (add_form.php - line 243) and only when the Allow subnet config at activity level setting is not selected. I'm a little confused. What I'm expecting is: when Allow subnet config at activity level is selected, the teacher can uncheck the Use default setting in Add session form and write your own subnet, even disabling the network address check. when Allow subnet config at activity level is not selected, the teacher cannot uncheck the Use default setting Add session form. when the Default subnet is not configured, the Use default should not be visible because there's no default. In both cases, when the Use default is checked the Default subnet from global settings should be used. Am I missing something? Thanks, Giorgio",

          "Text": "Hello all, First of all, thank you for developing and maintaining such a wonderful and practical tool - and plugin! I think it will be easier to explain my issue and, then, suggest how I think it could be solved. I am currently lecturing big classes (up to 120 students), so I do not want to spend time calling their names to manually fill the attendance record, I'd like it to be automatic. Currently, students self-record their attendance through their mobile phones with the password that I provide at the end of the class. However, I presume many students that missed the lecture get the password via whatsapp and register their attendance (even if I restrict the IPs for wireless access, they can be anywhere in the university and register their attendance). So, I would like to make it more difficult - ideally impossible - for them to cheat and self-register. I thought that instead of using a simple password, a random QR code could be projected at the end of the lecture through the lecturers attendance activity. Students should scan the QR code (maybe through their attendance activity) to get the attendance. The QR code would be randomly changed every 2 or 3 seconds so that students do not have time to send it to others. If they miss the code, they just need to keep trying till they get the code in time. This is just an idea - I am open to other sugestions! Thank you very much, Best, Aleix",

          "Text": "Hi Aleix, Yes - this is exactly what I was thinking would be the next logical improvement to the QR code support that was recently added to the attendance plugin. There is a bit of work involved to do this though - the code would need to be modified to store multiple passwords for each session (instead of just a single password as is currently stored) - each password hidden in the QR code would need an expiry time and the page would need to use ajax to update the qr code image (rather than a full refresh which would cause unnecessary load on your server .) You have probably also seen the setting that prevents attendance from being taken on the same IP address - so students can't easily share their password with a friend and use the same device to record attendance for multiple users... but that doesn't stop students from just bringing multiple devices into the session. This isn't something I'll have time to work on as a volunteer - but I'm always happy to receive pull requests from other developers (the initial QR code work was completed by Eoin Campbell) and if you think your organisation might be interested in funding my time to develop this improvement please feel free to get in touch privately.",

Everything is OK for us, except when someone from a group wants to attend to an event for anonther group. But this is not the problem I want to discuss here. For us, each students needs to attend to a number (12) of attendance to get a badge fot this activity. Fot that I set the statuses with 1.67 points for each attendance so the get get 20 points if they attends all of the audioconference. But the way to set the badge is the completion of the attendance activity, completion that is based only on 'The students must recevie a grade in order to complete this activity'. Why not add a completion based on 'The student must pass the grade in order to complete this activity' ? And more, when the student assists at the first attendance, the grade report show that the student receives 20 points for this attendance and the global grade for this activity is 20 points.. For me, receiving 1.7 points should be the good points to display. Is there something I didn't understand or I missed in setting this activity ? Sorry for my English, I'm a french lady. Nadine",

Otherwise, just jump into the code of the module and look for the web services implementation. I'd switch the first two calls, getting the token first and using the wstoken when calling core_webservice_get_site_info . Besides, you can POST username and password to get the token: this will avoid registering the password in your logs. HTH, Matteo",

For the MORE theme, in the Attendance Report page the table of users split between the user names and the emails, just like shown in the image attached. This doesn't seem to be caused by our core code or custom css (we removed css customizations and it's still happening). I am guessing this might happen with Clean as well, but have only tested it on More (which is the theme our Moodle is using). I applied a css fix for now, but that is a short term solution and it can meddle with other sites of Moodle as well. Thanks in advance! Best, Liana",

However, when a teacher went to update attendance today, we discovered that in their view the gear icon is missing from the right hand side of each where it should be listed: I went and set Change Preferences to \"Allow\" as well: But it's still not showing, not just for this one teacher but anyone else I try signing in as with the same role.

The attendance marking page uses the \"Show user identity\" setting found under Admin > Users > Permissions > User policies. \"Email address\" is the default setting - you could untick this box to remove it but it would also remove it from a number of other reports in Moodle that will currently display the e-mail address. It may make sense for the attendance plugin to have it's own \"showuseridentity\" setting instead of relying on the core setting - pull requests and funding (including MUA) are always welcome, but if the intent is to make it easier for teacher marking you may be interested to hear that I am actively working on adding support for the Moodle Mobile app - the code in the github master branch already supports student self-marking within the app and I am currently working on support for teachers to mark attendance as well.",

When I look at reporting in the Attendance module, it looks like it should: It's counting UP - we've had six class sessions, so the maximum grade to date should be 60 points (less for students with absences). In the grabedbook, however, attendance seems to be counting down, and with a different increment. So students with perfect attendance see 150 points; a student with one absence sees 125 points. The setting for Attendance was set for REAL. I changed it to Percentage (real), so it's a slightly better reflection (so a student with perfect attendance now see 100%(150) and a student with an absence see 83%(125). What am I doing wrong?

My \"include empty grades\" was an attempt at a solution, but here is the original error: A professor set up Attendance with max grade of 215 for the entire course - 43 sessions @ 5pts each. At midterms, only 19 sessions had occurred (95 points possible up to that point). In the Attendance module reports, the student had 90/95 points - accurate, desired result. HOWEVER, the problem was in the gradebook - the attendance grade for this student was 203.68/215. I haven't noticed this as a problem before, but the Attendance grade in gradebook was calculating the students' scores based on percentage, not raw points. It was assuming the remaining class sessions were \"Present\" even though they had not yet occurred. It seems like a professor would need to create two Attendance modules to work around this - one for the first half and one for the second half, and/or they wouldn't be able to prepopulate the Attendance with all class sessions for the term. Does that make more sense?",

I did not find any setting where to define this threshold and the mapping from attendance percentage of points to the individual scale items.

          "Text": "Hi Dan, thank you for your answer and naming of the corresponding function. Alex and I did some testing and research and we think that the calculation is indeed buggy respectively needs an addition. You are using this formula to calculate the grades: \n```text\n$usersummary->takensessionspercentage * $attendancegrade\n```\n ( https://github.com/danmarsden/moodle-mod_attendance/blob/master/locallib.php#L256 ) Let's have a look at an example: The teacher uses the Scale \"Not yet competent, Competent\". So, $attendancegrade will be 2 ($attendancegrade = count($scalearray)). He also has 2 attendance status: \"Attended (A)\" and \"Not attended (N)\" graded with 2 (A) and 1 points (N). Now assuming a participant has a \"takensessionspercentage\" of 70% (0.7). Your formula then calcuates: 0.7 * 2 = 1.4. This solution will be mapped to the Scale that lies between 1 and 2 in our example. So 1.4 will be rounded down to 1 and that means that the user will get a \"Not competent\" grade. Now assuming a participant has a \"takensessionspercentage\" of 76% (0.76). Your formula then calcuates: 0.76 * 2 = 1.52. This solution will be mapped to the Scale that lies between 1 and 2 in our example. So 1.52 will be rounded up to 2 and that means that the user will get a \"Competent\" grade. With a scale of two items, the breakpoint should be at 50% attendance (in my understanding). If you would change your formula to the following, the result should be correct then: \n```text\n0.5 + ($usersummary->takensessionspercentage * $attendancegrade)\n```\n Attendance percentage 0.7 => 0.5 + (0.7 * 2) = 1.9 This will be rounded up to 2 and therefore the user will now get the correct grade \"Competent\". Attendance percentage 0.76 => 0.5 + (0.76 * 2) = 2.02 This will be rounded down to 2 and therefore the user will still get the correct grade \"Competent\". Attendance percentage 0.49 => 0.5 + (0.49 * 2) = 1.48 This will be rounded down to 1 and therefore the user will get the correct grade \"Not competent\". Best, Kathrin",

Then visit /admin/index.php on your site and trigger the attendance plugin upgrade. Make sure you have debugging set to developer with display errors set to \"on\" Then check to see if the attendance activities exist in your site. If not, check to see if you still have a mod_attforblock table in your site.",

It is not really necessary to hide this setting, it only creates confusion (especially when this is set to something, and the settings page is not really cluttered anyways. Also, its always a bad idea to hide just a single setting behind another click in my opinion. Even better would be not to hide those settings until \"Allow students to record own attendance\" is checked, but to just grey them out - thats more consistent with other Moodle modules, and makes it easier for users to know which options exist without trying them",

In some organisations, the site-admin sets a default value and the teacher never changes that value so they don't need to see it unless they really want to. What I have done with some of the other activities I maintain is provide the ability for the site-admin to decide which settings should be advanced and this is something I could look at adding - pull requests or funding are always welcome. thanks!",

I got around this by using language customization to change first name to Chinese name, surname to their English nickname . This means a student could be displayed as say 高富帅 John. Within school records, all students have a unique student Id and all ordering on their documents is by ID. Students know their order so a roll call uses this order. However the attendance register uses the nickname ( the renamed surname) for order. This makes it necessary to use a paper record and then transfer instead of hunting up and down a list. I have also created groups within my classes, so  a class may have 3 groups of 18 students. Thankfully the groups follow the student ID order but I still have to check three different groups for each class. Ideally I would like a grouping of my three groups, ordered by student id.  I could then simply open one session, set all to present, read the names from the session, and mark the absences. How could I do this?",

Workarounds include setting up a status set with a \"Dropped status and using the \"Report\" to track how many sessions someone has missed and filling in the first two absences with \"Dropped\". This is not ideal as it requires manual adjustments and is unsuitable for one of our instructors who runs a 240 student course. The other workaround is to use the Attendance module to track attendance, and then use the report to generate grades in Excel with formulas. This is another manual step, but it works if attendance is only being reported to the gradebook at the end of the course. I suggest adding a \"Drop the lowest...\" setting to the Attendance settings so that the feature is available.",

This list should be used in many attendance \" activities \" as this days are common to all the courses. So if you have a classe on Tuesdays, and one Tuesday is on the list, then its deleted automatically. 2 - Add some duration to the course: ex: my course is on tuesdays one hour from 16-17 and i give 24 hour/course. I began on 12 October. So it would create all the sessions needed ( ideally it would pass the holidays as mentioned in the suggestion above). 3 - Possibility to add two-hour sessions ex: Tuesdays from 16-18,,, Really would be equivalent of two sessions one from 16-17 and another from 17-18. A pupil can miss one class but attend the other.... 4 - Percentage of missing classes about the total length of the course. If one course has 25 hours. And i have missed 3 classes. Then my missing percentatge is 12% ( 3 over 25 although we are still in the 10th session of the course) . Misses about the whole course and not what classes have been passed. Thank",

I would really like a tool where the students can mark themselves present.  At the moment, I am using the Choice tool.  Some time in the lesson , I make it visible to them, they mark themselves present, and then I hide it. In earlier versions of Moodle (certainly in 1.X) it worked fine, but in 3.1 my students get many errors when trying to use the Choice tool, and they have to try sometimes up to ten times. Is there the facility somewhere for students to mark themselves present/  Or any ideas on how to fake it using another tool.  (I even though thought of using the assignment tool, and getting them to upload a dummy file, but that seems overkill).

(so you can display it in class for them to use) 2) Subnet restrictions - allowing you to restrict self-marking to a range of known computers (IP ranges). 3) Time-based attendance status - allowing you to provide different statuses to the students depending on how late they are. 4) Auto-mode - allowing you to just ask them to view the course homepage and it will use the restrictions you have set up (including subnet masks/time-based status etc.) - this mode also allows you to set up an attendance session after the class is over - it will look through the course logs and auto-mark attendance based on when they viewed the course homepage. There are further improvements coming to self-marking but it's probably worth trying it out to see if it meets your needs - let us know how you go!",

We use Moodle 3.3 with autoattend plugin (block&mod)  and we have 2 problems (I asked the developer but there was no answer). when we set multiple sessions for about a year from now, a certain hour once a week (let's say 14:00) we get all sessions fine until March, then after March (when our clocks moves 1 hour forward - summer time) all sessions set to 15:00 (1 hour forward) instead of 14:00 . How can we fix this problem? We have correct timezone setting in php.ini Asia/Jerusalem (in our case) . Everything in  our Moodle (assignments\\quizes) with dates and time works just  fine except this issue in this plugin. Any change I can do in the code? 2) When I try to click on the \"P\" link ( Present) so all student will be present with the radio buttons - nothing happens (see image), no respond (in Moodle 2.9 this issue works fine). The Javascript function is \"select_all_radio_in\" Hope there is a solution for that Thanks a lot",

We were using Oracle , but I think the feature can be applied to people who use other database . Since we moved to 3.1, I found the Attendance code had the structural overhaul changes, and I couldn't simply apply the previous fix for 3.1. It took me a long time to hack the big SQL statement in attendance/classes/summary.php, line 206: $sql = \" SELECT atl.studentid AS userid, COUNT(DISTINCT ats.id) AS numtakensessions, SUM(stg.grade) AS points, SUM(stm.maxgrade) AS maxpoints FROM {attendance_sessions} ats ..................................... I think the SQL statement hack for version 3.1 only works for Oracle. If someone is using Oracle and happens to want this feature, I will be happy to share the fix. For the documentation about how the \"Drop the lowest\" works at UMass, here is the link: https://www.umass.edu/it/support/moodle/record-attendance-moodle (go to the bottom of the page).",

          "Text": "i found that 9 year before post but not clear I am using latest attendance plugin with moodle 3.3.1 . Any body can tells how to do in latest version of attendance . I want to disable grade in attendance module . There are two solutions here: put the attendance grade item in a category with grade type set to \"None\", then hide the category so users cannot see it. change a few lines of code in the attendance module to prevent it from registering with the gradebook. Let's start with the first method, since it involves no hacks. Whenever I use activity name , replace it with the name you gave to your new attendance activity. When you create a new attendance activity in your course, at the bottom of the form you can choose the grade category. It defaults to \"uncategorised\". Select instead \"New category\". Save your attendance activity Go to Grades -> grader report You will see your attendance activity inside a category called \" activity name \" Next to the \" activity name \" grade item is another called \"Category total\". If not already done, click the button \"Turn editing on\" A little edit icon appears beneath the Category Total heading Click this icon In the \"Grade type\" drop-down menu, select \"None\" Save your changes Hide the activity name category (there should be a little \"eye\" icon under the heading, if not click the \"Hide show/hide icons\" link above the report, it should make the icon appear). This will hide the whole category from students in your course. Now for the second solution: You need to comment out a few lines in two files: In attendances.php, comment out lines 76 and 85 (put // at the beginning) In lib.php, comment out lines 22 and 40 That's it! However, this second solution doesn't solve the grade items already present in your courses set up before you comment out these lines. You will have to use the first solution for these.",

I get the same result upgrading from the command line or from the browser; whether I'm upgrading from 3.1.0.3 to a 3.3.5 downloaded from the Moodle plugins directory, to a 3.3.5 cloned from Git , or to 3.2.4. Enabling error messages gives me no error messages—the upgrade process just silently hangs when it reaches mod_attendance.

One of the requirements is that we need to record attendance for students as well as teachers and teaching assistants. I come across Attendance module which almost meets the requirement except for the teacher/teaching assistant part. I know it is a special requirement from my side, so I love to receive some guidance on how to alter the code to cover teachers and teaching assistants in the Attendance procedure. I downloaded the code and read it for hours, and hardly found the way out. One of the reasons is because I'm new to PHP and Moodle (though I'm a quite sophisticated Java / C# / SQL programmer). -wenbin",

          "Text": "I teach a large class that I have divided into groups in Moodle for the purpose of recording attendance. The different groups attend at different times/days so using groups makes it easy to record attendance. However, if I want to display or export (to Excel) an attendance report for any one group I get (empty) columns for all the sessions for all the groups. The names from other groups are not displayed/exported. We use Moodle 2.7 or 2.8 (not sure). In earlier versions of Moodle this problem did not exist. Does anyone know what went wrong? Any ideas on how to fix? Thanks.",

          "Text": "My agency offers the kind of standard training that Moodle works well for - students, organized into sessions, with regular tasks and assignments. Moodle will work BEAUTIFULLY for that type of learning. Much of our training, though, is offered differently. Our employees work in teams, of which there are hundreds working each day. From 60 up to 150 of our work 'teams' of 2-8 employees can be assigned to come to our training facility each day to attend short-duration training of around an hour, sometimes two. This training is conducted by an instructor, each instructor teaching 1-30 teams throughout each day. Each instructor can offer between 1-10 different 'drills' in the training period. Sometimes, the employees will get trained on a single drill, sometimes multiple quick drills. Our traditional system has been paper-based, where the team of employees would sign in on the top half of a paper form, and the instructor would pick the drills performed from a selection of checkboxes on the bottom half of the page. There are around forty drills to choose from. Additionally, our 'teams' are dynamic - each team is 2-6 employees from the same work unit, just with different employees working each day. This is hands-on training (we are a municipal public safety agency) and we want the instructors to be able to: pick users from a list of employees in the same work unit (work unit being a custom profile field) pick training from a list of drills do 'instant' attendance, where each user selected for the training is marked as 'present' and the drill is marked as 'complete.' record the training the same way, as many times as each employee attends that training - ie repeat training events by the same employees are expected. I have gone over the attendance plugins, the checklist plugins, and the database plugin, and I'm just not getting it. I know that this is bending the Moodle architecture a  little bit, but I also feel that this is a training model that Moodle can accomodate. Is there a way to do this that I'm just not seeing? Or are we looking at a custom solution? Thanks (in advance)",

As for attendance, I guess I would just use the completion settings for the activities - however, the attendance module does allow for students to mark themselves in attendance so that might help.

          "Text": "Thank you so much, Emma! Yes, there are blocks of drills that will be normally attempted together, but there are no guarantees that all of the drills will be conducted each time - the training is very fluid. We're a large municipal fire department. Each day, 60 or so fire companies are selected for attendance at training. The schedule is set the night before, but it is only a suggested schedule. The fire companies are dispatched to training as a fire 'run' (non-emergency response) and if they are called out on fire duty at 8:59AM, they won't be given their training run at 9:00AM. So a different company would be selected (training must go on!) An additional complication - we can only typically see the fire company's work 'attendance' (kept in an Oracle system which we can ODBC into) after 9:00AM and 6:00PM, when the shifts change. Training 'runs' are dispatched at 9:00AM, 12:30PM, and 6:00PM. And, no, this training would be hands on/demonstration type training, with the students NOT logging in to the system. Only the instructor taking attendance, and with quite the feat of programming if he/she was to see the 'students' expected to be there. We would be very satisfied if the instructor could search for the students by filtering down to their profile field of 'work unit' and then selecting the 2-8 employees from the 25-30 employees listed. Instructor would then pick which drills to give them credit for. I'm thinking we may need to fully explore the database activity, and custom forms, too. Moodle IS going to be our platform for our traditional long-form higher-education type training. We just need a couple of key insights and we'll be on our way for overall training record-keeping. Thanks again. PS - perhaps we could approach our daily training like a sort of 'tutoring'  or extra help module? All users could optionally attend, none are scheduled or enrolled beforehand, and the 'tutoring' topics could be fluid from session to session? Maybe someone has done something similar to that...",

Database might help or maybe just create an assignment for each set of drills each day (just list the drills in the assignment description and then uncheck all submission forms) and then just assign the groups to that. Or, preferably, while it would create a lot of courses, it would be cleaner to create a different course for each set of drills and then just enroll the appropriate firefighters to each course.  This would also deal with duplicate drills and be a much more efficient way of record keeping as it would be using Moodle as intended. Look at the sharing cart plugin - you could create an activity for each drill, copy them all to the sharing cart, then just pick and choose the drills for each new course in the morning.  (Sharing cart is specific per user so teachers would initially have to copy activities into the sharing cart).",

Just to be sure I created a new course and added me as a student and changed the attendance grade to \"none\" before doing anything and the points still show up. It's not a big deal but for a lot of people it's too much information and I thought there would be a check box (if the \"none\" setting didn't work). Also with the updated attendance it uses huge profile pictures of each student which makes the attendance report a bit unwieldy. Again not a biggy, but it would be nice to be able to not use profile pics. I think in the previous version they were there but micro sized so they didn't cause any problem. I can live with both of the above but if anyone has the info that would be great. It's a very good plugin! Rick",

There are a number of strings in there that appear to let you format date and time display in various locations of attendance. The string I think you are looking for is strftimedmyw $string['strftimedmyw'] = '%d.%m.%y&nbsp;(%a)'; I will say that I tried changing the format and could not get any date in the course attendance page to change. If I deleted the whole string I could tell I was definitely playing with the right string, but I never could get the displayed format to change. This leads me to believe their is something else going on that I'm not aware of as on my system I see a / between the digits but you show periods, which is what the format is set for. Removing the checkmark for Cache Language strings and purge all cache's had no affect. Changing to a different separator such as a dash, had no affect. I'm out of ideas at the moment.",

          "Text": "My university is abandoning its current attendance tracking system which involves students tapping their embedded chip ID card on a station outside their classroom.  In its place, I am trying to get the university to adopt the attendance module. The module, however, in its current state cannot be used efficiently for student-based input.  It was primarily designed for use by teachers, or students in a computer lab environment. Since we are in a hurry and I had the wherewithall to make the modifications myself, I haven't gone through the standard process of making a suggestion on the tracker.  My apologies to Dan Marsden! I hope, however, that the intended functionality can be implemented in the standard version of the module, rather than having to be a privately-managed alternate version with an alternate name. What I have done is to allow the instructor to create a set of sessions with a unique code that is announced to the students at the beginning of each class.  There is also a setting called \"minutes until late\" that allows the teacher to set a time frame of perhaps 5-10 minutes after the start of the class, where the student is deemed \"present\".  After that, until the end of the class (as input by the instructor), the student would be marked \"late\". There is also a function for specifying an IP address range, and if the student uses the attendance function outside that IP range, then the student is listed as \"off site\" rather than \"present\". This has not been thoroughly tested, however, and will not work if 1) the wifi transmitters in/near the classroom do not have specific IP addresses, or 2) students register with the smartphones while using their provider's connection rather than the university's WiFi system. This is how it works. If students log in to the attendance module instance on the class page, they will simply see their attendance record.  If, however, their class is currently in progress, a window embedded in a red bar will appear at the top of the attendance display. If they then input the keyword, their attendance will be registered. We have had to make one tweak to the \"settings\" where the instructor can set both the character used to specify the various attendance levels, as well as the description of the levels.  In the standard version of the module, these can be modified and the various levels specified in any order.  We now require the topmost level to represent \"Present\" and the 2nd level to represent \"Late\".  This is normally that case, but does not necessarily have to be input that way. This version works (available at http://tomrobb.com/attendance-robb.tar -- 360mb) on Moodle 2.6 & 2.7 and might work on 2.8.  We are working on another version for 2.9 & 3.0.  This revision does need more testing.  If you do, beware that it does modify the database tables. attendance_sessions now contains two more fields \"keyw\" (keywords being used = \"1\") and \"keyword\" (specifies the keyword for each session).  This may or may not prevent you from reverting to the standard module if you decide to do so.  (No fields have been deleted, so it might not cause a problem.) I look forward to your feedback!",

One important thing to mention though - Davo Smith recently developed a feature that already allows students to mark their own attendance which is already part of the main release, so your feature would need to be rewritten to work with this by adding the settings for IP ranges,  password for marking attendance, and the late timeframe flag - you should also probably have a selector that shows which attendance flag to use when the time-frame is up rather than hard-coding a value. thanks for sharing your work so far!",

But in the attendance report, those district contacts can see all of the students in the class even though they are not in a group with them.  And, if I set the activity to separate groups, then I have to create attendance sessions for each group which puts more work on the teacher...

Would it be possible to add in a filter option to view a single students attendance of the groups they are in? The teachers can export a students attendance, but it shows the attendance for all classes (i.e. groups) on the course rather than just their own module. When a student has many modules (i.e. in more than one group)  the teachers find it impossible to make sense of it when they are doing one to ones tutorials with students. There is no separation of what group that particular attendance figure is for in the .xlsx file I've attached a screenshot to show (some of) the different groups this particular student is in for attendance purposes. It would be great if each group could be filtered in the groups column (or separated columns for each group?) Thanks bobby",

They sent me some comments or improvement ideas for the \"Report\" tab I would like to share here: - It would be good to highlight the attendances that had a remark. Now you only can see them when you're taking/changing attendance or exporting the report. - The last row shows the summary, but it's accumulative. It's interesting to show the summary only for the session column, each column with its separate summary. - When you are using group sessions and there are many groups with many different sessions, it would be very useful a group filter above the report table to show only the sessions for a group. Now, we have temporal filters (weeks, months,...) but no group filter, to hide sessions for other groups and get a more narrow table. Thank You!",

Like many colleges, ours is required to track attendance very closely for financial aid and retention reporting purposes. We need to be able to generate campus wide reports that show things such as: 1. Any classes where attendance has failed to be taken within 24 hours of a session. 2. Any student who has missed two classes in a row. 3. The last day of attendance for any student who has dropped below the number of credits required to qualify for financial aid. (This one is particularly problematic because when a student is unerolled from a class, the reports in the attendance mdoule no long show any record of attendance for them.) Does anyone know of any existing report plugins that can extract this data from Moodle database tables or even better a custom MySQL query that can do this. Much appreciated. Todd",

Or you have a permissions issue on your mod folder... When you upgraded, what process did you go through?",

As a workaround, you can add a manual column to the grade book and keep track of absences - this is easier to do as less students are absent then present (hopefully!). You might want to make this a text column so it is not added to the course total. Another way to accomplish taking attendance is to add a manual column and give everyone 100. Then, for those that are absent, you can decrease the value for each occurrence. Hope this help! Caryl",

At present \"Present\" is #1 and further down at #7 we have \"Unauthorised Absence\". As those two are the most commonly used status's they've asked us to move UA up to #2 and move the rest down by one in the list, but after testing it appears it will affect reports for previously taken registers as the previous registers attendance will have their status in the same checkbox but with a different status name. Guessing the variable order number is the key in that database entry rather than the acronym.... Anyone have a work around?",

It's purpose is to collect all the Attendance module data from a whole site and put it into a single excel file (csv).  We have 150 foreign language classes that use the Attendance module and it pulls the data we want (dates of absences) from all of them.  The dates to pull are configurable as you can see in this screenshot. There are no docs so you just have to try it.  I think only admins can see it on the front page of the site, but I am not sure. We use it in Moodle 2.5.  The data downloaded into the excel sheet will show the course name, course instructor, student names, and dates of the classes as indicated in your Attendance Module. Within the grid, the exact dates of absences will be printed.  We look for absences because our staff will contact students will large numbers of absences from these required courses. You may want different data, so you are welcome to re-program this block and I hope you re-post your new version code here on this forum.  Sorry, I don't have time or knowledge to put this into the Plugins database .  The last time I tried it took me a year and a half to get the Sharing Cart approved. If you want to post comments, feature requests or code to integrate, you can post it here but we only have funds to update it once a year. Cheers and a big thanks to Dan for maintaining the Attendance module.",

We have funding to update the block once a year in March.  So if you can't wait for me to fix it then, please take the code and get a local PHP programmer to adjust the fields as you like--it is probably an easy job to do--one to two hours of coding and testing. You might want to make selectable preferences so that firstname, lastname, fullname, studentnumber, etc. can be selected or just have all those fields output into the excel sheet. Look on this thread, and you will see that Dan Marsden has some new changes that he has not committed yet. Perhaps we can ask him to share his latest version.  If he doesn't see this, Steve, send him a personal message.  Dan has a separate github location. Here is our github location (just found out): https://github.com/VERSION2-Inc/moodle-block_attendance_csv_all If you make a new version, ask your programmer to upload it back there as a branch.  Then we can combine them in March 2016.",

I'm not sure whether the current functionality is intended or whether it is a bug.  Hopefully someone here can shed some light on this. Here is the scenario: \"When testing the report function I noticed that the totals at the bottom of the report were not for individual sessions but working from left to right were accumulating totals. Interestingly, when you the report on a monthly basis the accumulation does not carry over from July to august. Three screenshots attached for All, July and August.\" So the question is should the summary totals be accumulative or should they show the summary per sesession? If it should stay accumulative should the totals be carried over the other months / weeks? I think it might be intended as an accumulative snapshot (only accumulates within the snapshot) in which case it is working correctly. July: August: All:",

I would definitely recommend that if there are records in a group where the teacher failed to mark any of the the statuses, there should be a warning message about this instead of the successful save. Secondly, it would be nice if we could save a remark even if none of the statuses are selected. Thank you. Éva",

I'm going to see if I can create some repeatable steps and then report as a bug if I cannot find it in the bug tracker. Question, what type of enrollment are you using on your system.  We just switched to database enrollment so I'm curious to see if this is common as we have never had it reported before.

          "Text": "Hello everyone and thanks for your hard work to maintain and improve this plugin! I've upgraded moodle from 2.4 to 2.6. and as for the attendace mod/block I installed the following versions: mod:   2014061301 block: 2014062600 I updated the deprecated function get_context_instance manually since it was throwing warnings about it and still I need to remove navmenu() which is also deprecated. Are these updated in any later version by the way? The issue that has arisen after the upgrade is that although the students submit their attendance with success, at the end they can see the error: \"Can not find data record in database table course\" (Debugging is turned off). I can see the debug info from our staging site : Debug info: SELECT id,category FROM {course} WHERE id IS NULL [array ( )] Error code: invalidrecord Stack trace: line 1403 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: dml_missing_record_exception thrown line 1379 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_select() line 6811 of /lib/accesslib.php: call to moodle_database->get_record() line 790 of /blocks/autoattend/lib.php: call to context_course::instance() line 257 of /blocks/autoattend/index.php: call to autoattend_print_user() Can you please advise? Any help would be much appreciated..! Thanks in advance!",

The regulations for the University require that I take attendance in every lecture (don't ask me why). The class is quite large (~ 500 students). Every lecture, I have teaching assistants (~ 5-10) come in and start taking attendance on pen and paper. This is a nightmare as all those papers have to be recorded electronically somehow. Otherwise, they are useless. My initial plan was to use the Attendance plugin for Moodle on mobile phones of my TA's and have attendance taken. That is not going to work. I am looking for some alternatives. There are some attendance taking apps on Android (most TAs - or almost everyone here, uses Android). Some even claim to export their results in CSV format. Has anyone ever used any app like that to collate attendance and then use the CSV file at the end used as an upload to the Attendance module?",

          "Text": "Hopefully this is the right place to post this query.  Lorenzo Nicora is the person identified as supporting the Attendance Register plugin, however it hasn't been updated for a while and uses the legacy logs.  Moodle 2.6 is the last officially supported version, although it appears the plugin works in Moodle 2.7 and 2.8 if legacy logging is turned on.  I haven't heard anything about Moodle 2.9. I approached Lorenzo to ask him to quote for upgrading the plugin on a paid basis.  Unfortunately he says he is not in a position to do the work even if it's paid. So, the question is how to get this plugin back into a supported status and officially approved for use with Moodle 2.9+.   Not having the technical skills nor inclination to do this myself, are there individuals and/or organisations out there who would take this on on a paid basis ?   If so what I'd be interested in knowing is a cost estimate for the following: 1) Upgrade the plugin so that it is formally certified for Moodle 2.9, but continues to use the legacy logs 2) Upgrade the plugin so that it is formally certified for Moodle 2.9,\nbut using the new new logging mechanism so that legacy logging could be\nswitched off (in theory).

I've tried adjusting setting in both the gradebook and the attendance settings, including: Changing the grading to scale and back to points Changing group mode to \"no groups\" and back to \"separate groups\" Checking the multiplicator and the saving changes to the grade settings Does anybody have any ideas about why this is happening or what else I can try? Thank you, Rebecca",

On the other hand,  I configured the Parent role as described in the moodle docs . Logged on as Parent, Administration->Profile settings for Usuario 1 Campus ->Activity reports->Grade for any course his son is enrolled except Attendance, the Parent can see his son's grades. But when the parent select the Attendance course he can only see this: I spect to see the same user report that the student can see, because it gives more info regarding the attendance sessions.. What am I doing wrong ? Thanks, for helping me in giving some advice. Regards, Diego.",

Regarding the attendance plugin, The Parent Role has mod/attendance:view mod/attendance:viewreports mod/attendance:canbelisted Student role has mod/attendance:canbelisted mod/attendance:view Then Logged on whit a parent user, I can see the course with the two activities(attendance), same result as avobe. On the other hand, logged as Parent, I put the url for his son attendance ( http://xxxxxx/mod/attendance/view.php?id=136 ) \n```text\nYou can not enrol yourself in this course.\n```\n So, I enroll the Parent in this course, I tried again and shows the parent's attendance rather than son's records. I think that the attendance module is not designed for parents access yet, if we want to see the mentees' daily records, but for final attendance score is OK. Regards, Diego.",

If students needed some kind of code to log on, that would help, but with email and texting the code would go out immediately anyway, so the teacher would need to check to make sure the numbers match. All of our computers connect through the same DNS so it's easy to check to see who really isn't there, although I have had students check in from their own computers rather than the lab computers, which confuses things as well.

So for example a user enrolled to many courses with Attendance marks on each will go to one course, click on Grades then see their user report which is correct. If they click on the overview they see all courses with most of the Attendance marks correct but some here and there have just ' - ' instead of the mark.... but yet this is fine in the user report for that course...

If you report someone absent on your list, and then that person subsequently gets deleted as a user (from Moodle admin), the attendance report will still report an absence from an unknown person. That is, if you had, say, 14 students in a class, and you took attendance and listed a student as absent, then that student was deleted from Moodle, the attendance report will list 13 present and one absent (total of 14), even though the total number of students in your class is now only 13. This is important because at the beginning of a year especially, when students are enrolling and unenrolling, the list of students you have is constantly changing. Knowing who was absent on any particular day is important for auditing purposes when the administration wants to know who actually showed up in your classes. If the totals are wrong, there is no way of knowing who showed up and who didn't.",

The attendance doesn't disappear from the student's All Courses tab, but it does remove the details on sessions completed etc. I'm attaching a screenshot. Is there any reason it wouldn't make sense to have the item disappear entirely? I guess logic would say assuming the student exited the course with zero attendance recorded, it should disappear entirely. If the student had some attendance recorded, then that data should display?

I have sent another message to Artem to ask if he had any potentially useful information, suggestions or advice.  The romantic view is that someone he has worked for may have a plan, and another developer could take over the project. I will create an item on the tracker.  (Follow the system!!)  I'll email Helen and Anthony. I'd be curious to know how many people this is affecting.  I'm going to flick off a few PM's today to people who I know have posted about Attendance with a link to this thread. I'll post in the lounge. Why would someone bother to support a plugin? My view (admittedly somewhat rosy eyed in view of actual experience) is that if some middle sized institution uses a bunch of plugins, then if they maintain one, they get some sort of kudos and place in the community.  It's \"putting a little bit back\".  The programmer who does the work (and it is usually one although not always) can build up their expertise in Moodle which helps his/her work around Moodle in general.  Usually there will be a few others who act as intelligent bug finders etc, so you get a little community emerging around a small section of code.  [Now I know that isn't always the case, that some people merely manage code just for their own ends, and not really for any general good of the community] Win win and win. That's one part of an ROI argument for any of you out there interested in making a case for your place supporting this plugin. I'm sure others will have a better expression of the value of maintaining  a plugin in the ecosystem of OS. Over an out for now.  Off to my dayjob. -Derek",

When I deleted some of the enrolled groups to minimise their number it worked.  Haven't found a way to solve this issue but at least I know I can't use the module across all the courses unfortunately. I don't know if that helps at all but I hope it does or at least it gives some useful feedback to the developers.",

I have updated the documentation here with details on some of the changes I have made already: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Attendance_module The biggest thing to mention is that the module has been renamed from 'attforblock' to 'attendance' - I've included information on how to upgrade from the old 'attforblock' here: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Attendance_module#Upgrade_from_mod_attforblock_to_new_mod_attendance The plugin has been submitted to the plugins database here on moodle.org but it may take a couple of weeks before it is made public in the plugins db. As the plugin has been renamed if you have any Moodle backups that contain information about older 'attforblock' content this will not currently be restored during the restore process as I haven't written any handlers to restore this content - If someone wants to do this make sure you file a pull request or if this is really important to you and you can fund my time to do this drop me an e-mail It's unlikely I'll be able to spend much time improving the existing feature-set of the attendance module as a volunteer but I'll endeavour to ensure that it works in future Moodle versions. The code now passes the Moodle codechecker tool and I have fixed some minor security issues with the previous code. If anyone else does any feature work I'm happy to review this (please make sure you file a pull request so I can integrate your changes) I work for the NZ Moodle Partner Catalyst IT - we can also provide development services to improve the attendance module if you are able to fund my time. Even though Artem isn't working on Moodle stuff at the moment he knows the code a lot better than I do - so if you are keen to fund work on improving the module you could drop him an e-mail too to see if he might be interested in working on it some more. For those interested in the \"what's changed\" stuff here's a shortlist with some of the changes I've made this week: * Renamed attforblock to attendance * SECURITY: fixed some setType warnings, improved sesskey checks and better cleaning of raw data. * removed all languages other than english from code as AMOS will handle this when it lands in the plugins db * Lots of coding guideline work - the block and module now comply with the Moodle codechecker tool and some phpdoc fixes. * CONTRIB-4246 when editing module name update name in gradebook.",

He has maintained this module for the longest time and has done some really fantastic and timely work to help us all. Dan, thanks for jumping in. I'll get right to it: I need features developed for this module. I'm happy to risk the crowd-sourced funding for it and will make a major contribution from our organization. I feel as though for those schools using Moodle as a blended learning management solution a powerful attendance module will be a great addition to their technology tool set. I believe the module could have the following things in addition to its already wonderful features: Produce printable PDF timetables and reports that can be styled and exported Run a cron job that warns students and their instructors about exceeded absences Have calculation functions for its grade component Be optimized for taking attendance on a touchscreen device Improved for creating and managing large numbers of sessions Usability tested for teachers/users Please let me know the best place to start. I would be happy to hear from others who want to be involved with the project.",

          "Text": "Hi Dan, Kudos for stepping up to maintain the Attendance add-ons. This week I installed the most recent version of moodle-mod_attendance cloned from your Github repo into a fresh installation of Moodle 2.4 and ran into a problem with the install. xml spec attempting to create the new attendance table. When I logged in as Site Admin, after installing the components in /mod/attendance/, I got an error message complaining that the PREVIOUS and NEXT attributes were incorrect. A check of your commit message in the git repo showed that you had recently removed those attributes in keeping with new XMLDB editor guidelines. That change didn't make much sense to me until I found this page by Pavel Timoshenko explaining how his XSLT transform script ' correct-xmldb-format.xslt ' saves developers from the tedious task of ensuring that those attributes are correctly inserted into an install.xml file. It's a great utility (and I have been previously bitten by not getting those attributes correctly inserted!), and when I ran your source through a transform engine with that script, and substituted the resulting XML into the mod/attendance/db/ directory, the installation ran to completion without a hitch. My question is, did I miss completely miss something in the add-on's documentation (or elsewhere in Moodle support docs) that explained that procedure, or is it only an issue in a new (i.e. fresh) Moodle installation, rather than in an upgrade/update scenario? If that's the case, I think that adding a link in the Attendance doc page and Pavel's doc page would provide some helpful clarity to newbs like me. Thanks, Paul",

Think about ways to inspire me to work on the feature - funding helps (a lot) but if you politely and succinctly describe what you are looking for that can help a long way too. It's unlikely I'll have time to work on the feature as a volunteer but occasionally I have some free time and feel inspired to work on the attendance code - so the better you can describe and detail the feature the more likely I might find it interesting to work on.",

We love the Attendance Module and we will help with a few added features during the next year.  Perhaps you know that the Additional Name Fields functionality was added in Moodle 2.6.  Since we work in Japan, we really need display and sorting through multiple name sets and configurable name sets as well as student number.  So over the next 12 months we hope to get this into the Attendance module somehow.  We also need a configurable date format. We will keep you abreast and I hope our programmer can merge his additions smoothly with yours. I think he knows github well to do that. Cheers,   Don P.S.  We have a block called Attendance Site Data which collects all Attendance data across a site.  Anyone can contact me directly if you interested.",

The Grade has a pull-down with 1-100 and a couple of other options like No Grade. I have it set to 100 (so as to get only full numbers, not any weightings). Somewhere else, I must have set the Grade for Attendance as 60 points, because that is what shows up in the gradebook for most of my students: everybody gets 60 points, even though I have entered only 2 out of 15 sessions of attendance. Oddly enough, there are a few students who have no grade (-) or a 0 grade for attendance. I did revise my attendance settings last week (added groups), but am still wondering why that 60 shows up. Where did I enter that in? My Attendance session Variables are set to give 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 points depending on how well they attend. (Participate). How can I make just the completed sessions show in the gradebook? Ideally, the students should see their other grades, along with attendance added, but just the points they have earned so far. I know I am not being very clear here, but would appreciate any suggestions on places to look to resolve this. Should I set Attendance to No Grade?

I'm currently working with a small team on setting up Moodle for a university, and judging from the requirments of that uni it seems that we need to use seperate groups for most courses with cannaccessallgroups and managegroups both disabled for teachers. So far it seems that everything is falling into place but that stopped being the case when I started testing the behaviour of the Attendance module: Here are the steps that I did (as an Admin): Set up a test course with two groups. Enrolled a different teacher to each of the groups. Created sessions for each group. Logged in as one of the teachers expecting to only be able to see the sessions of the group he's enrolled in, but instead I get two surprises. When first openning manage.php, all the sessions for both groups are listed (even though the dropdown at the top doesn't have an \"All\" option). The Sessions dropdown allows selection of the second group to which the currently logged in teacher is not enrolled. I'm currently taking a look at the code to see if I can figure out how to get the behaviour I was hoping for but sadly I have zero experience with PHP so it's taking far more time than I have to spare for this. And so I would very much appreciate any pointers as to what I should be looking for in the code. Thanks in advance for any help.",

We've found that going into the Attendance Activity, clicking the \"Update the Attendance\" button and changing the grade to something other than \"No Grade\", saving changes, then immediately changing it back to \"No Grade\" will pull the item out of the grade book. In your experience - when the activity adds an item in the grade book, does it enter in 0's for all of the students, like it is for us? Does anyone know why this is happening in the first place? Is it a bug? It's becoming a big support issue for us. Thanks, Laurie",

From a user interface perspective, I would see a Notifications tab added after the Reports tab in the instructor view of the module.  The Notifications tab would allow an instructor to define notifications for the specific course -> what are the criteria (e.g. number of absences) and what is the message text to be sent out as a notification when a student hits that criterion.  The Notifications tab would allow multiple notifications to be set up for a course, for example, a warning message when a student accumulates 2 absences and a notice of failing the course when 5 absences have accumulated. I initially thought this might have to be a Cron job, but it probably makes more sense to just have it triggered when an instructor submits a session's attendance data.  Submitting attendance data for a class session could cause the module to check to see if any students have hit the criterion for a notification, and send the defined message for that notification out to the student.  The data tables for the module would have to keep track of which students have received which nofications, so that a student with eg, 2 absences only gets the warning notification once, and not every time thereafter that the instructor submits attendance data for later class sessions.",

Change start date of course and hidden sessions will be shown. You can use this feature to hide older sessions instead delete. Remember than only visible sessions using in Gradebook.\" If you read it aloud you'll be able to spot the mistakes. I know its a minor thing, but just wanted to pass it along for a future update.

Recently we noticed that some of the faculties were too lazy sometimes to fill session's attendance in time. So we restricted the time in which faculy will have to take attendance. We kept a duration of 8 days after which no faculty of concerned subject will be able to take/update attendance nor will he be able to change the settings as the icon for the same would get disabled but at same time admin can see all things so for that we added a new capbility. I think this will be a good feature to add on later versions of module.  Keeping a restriction on how many days a faculty has to fill the attendance the faculty will never miss the deadline to fill it and if he at all fails to fill attendance he will have to go to administrator to get attendance done. Comments on this discussion are most welcome. Thanks",

Of course there would have to be some security/restrictions built into it.  The student could only be counted present if they clicked the button during the class period (or maybe they are automatically counted present during the beginning of the period and late later on).  There would also need to be some ability to restrict the IP address of the computer the student is using to mark their attendance. Anybody else have any thoughts on this?  We'd love to see this sort of functionality added to one of the attendance modules. Jacob",

Let me know what you think about these suggestions and if you have any others that might be useful. Also, if you agree that these would be an improvement, go vote for them. Color code the report that teachers see so that various attendance states are highlighted (such as green for present, red for absent). We would probably have to  also modify the settings page so that users could set the colors for the different attendance choices For the sessions tab, default to all. Currently it defaults to sessions in the current week which can be confusing to users who have just created a bunch of attendance sessions. After adding sessions, the user should go back to the sessions page so they know that the sessions have been created. Right now, there is no indication that the sessions were created. An alternative would be the display of some message that the sessions were successfully created.",

Suggest, next time, posting your own and starting a new thread in a more appropriate forum ... this one might get lost! ;) One thing you need to share when reporting issues ... at least the version of Moodle. It will make a difference in the answers you get. How did you attempt to install? Sounds like uploaded a zip and unzipped - but maybe in the wrong location - or the zip you downloaded an used to install is not compat with version of Moodle you are running. If you installed manually ... are you sure the plugin/addon you are attempting to install is compatible with version of Moodle? Please see: http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Installing_add-ons note that is for version 2.5 of Moodle. 'spirit of sharing', Ken Ken, thanks for your answer...I believe, you are correct, I had just downloaded the \"Attendance Plugin (just the zip file/folder)\", but never configured it or installed it on the server or system (actually I am not at all tech savy). Now I understand that I should have taken help from the developers, who created the site over a server. What should have happened is that post downloading the plugin (just the zip file/folder), I should have installed/configured it on my system (I think), so that the successful installation message could be seen on the Moodle Site Notification. But, the notification was never shown. I still went to install it, which is when I started getting a blank screen. Please help me out..",

Coming straight to your problem: When you download an attendance module zip, in that zip, there’s a file named readme.txt. It provides the detailed instruction of how to install and configure the attendance module. The first requirement of that mod is, as you unzip the plug-in, the folder name should be renamed to \"attforblock\". Then it needs to be copied under the mod folder i.e., your_moodle_folder/mod/attforblock Then from your website you need to follow the site map given below: Home ► Site administration ► Notifications Here the setup is ready and it’ll ask for a confirmation for installation. After successful installation the attendance module is ready to use. Note: - Please make sure you check the version of attendance plug-in and check whether it’s compatible with your Moodle version or not. After performing the above instructed action, if you get a blank screen it means you’ve some error in your site. In that case I’d suggest you to do the following: Please write down the code given below at the end of the file- config.php(path:- your_moodle_folder/config.php) and save it. @error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT); // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! @ini_set('display_errors', '1'); // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! $CFG->debug = (E_ALL | E_STRICT); // === DEBUG_DEVELOPER - NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! $CFG->debugdisplay = 1; // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! After performing this instruction, browse the blank screen from your browser and it’ll show the error in your site. Kindly provide us the screenshots of those errors so that we can help further. I hope this’ll be of your help. Please get back to us for further query. Thanks and Regards Purnendu DualCube",

But unfortunately, , I could not do so despite my desperate search for instructions in the forum as well as in the youtube. The problem I have, I think, is not understanding or not knowing how to do. I am looking for the site or discussion forum link which gives step-wise instructions for a novice. The first step problem for me is where and how to create the folder. Could anyone help out please if there is any link giving detailed instruction? Here is what it says and could not doing despite the instruction: Create folder /mod/attforblock. Extract files from folder inside archive (andreev-artem-moodle_mod_attforblock-xxxxxxx in your case) to created folder.",

I believe if I can locate it and delete it, I can properly download the file. I can't seem to locate the file.

With debugging turned in, this was the error detail: Debug info: The ntext data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT because it is not comparable. SELECT ats.id, ats.groupid, ats.sessdate, ats.duration, ats.description, al.statusid, al.remarks FROM mdl_attendance_sessions ats RIGHT JOIN mdl_attendance_log al ON ats.id = al.sessionid AND al.studentid = ? WHERE ats.attendanceid = ? AND ats.sessdate >= ? AND ats.sessdate >= ? AND ats.sessdate < ? UNION SELECT ats.id, ats.groupid, ats.sessdate, ats.duration, ats.description, al.statusid, al.remarks FROM mdl_attendance_sessions ats LEFT JOIN mdl_attendance_log al So the issue is with the ntext field attendance_sessions.description being included in the UNION/SELECT DISTINCT, ntext fields are not allowed to be used with these commands.  The ntext field type is deprecated in MS SQL Server 2005+ in favor of nvarchar(MAX). After changing the description field type to nvarchar(MAX), the report page is now working for both teacher and student with existing data.  In brief testing of creating a new session and taking attendance, it also worked correctly.  Our faculty return next week for our Fall quarter, and I should know then if there are any issues after they use it more extensively.",

Currently the message for the Attendance activity says that no help is associated with it. I would like to propse that something similar to the following text I lifted from the Wiki page is added to the modulename_help string to describe the activity to users: The Attendance module is designed for teachers to be able take attendance during class, and for students to be able to view their own attendance record. A teacher can mark the attendance status of a student as \"Present\", \"Absent\", \"Late\", or \"Excused\". These status descriptions are configurable, and more can be added. The teacher adds Attendance as an activity of a course, and then sets up the sessions whose attendance is to be tracked. The Attendance module can generate reports for either the entire class or for individual students. Students may also see their own attendance record if the activity is not hidden.",

When I pointed out that clicking on the column headers allowed the instructor to mark all of the students at one time they were astounded. I am not a user interface designer but I presume there would be some design element that could be added to make this feature more discoverable. It is common practice now to allow a table of data to be re-ordered by clicking on column headers. Normally there is some indication that this feature is available such as a small up or down arrow next to the column header. Perhaps in this case a small check mark might serve as an indication to the user that clicking on the column header would check all entries in the column? Only a small suggestion and, as I say, I am no designer. Thanks to all of the people who work on this module. It is extremely useful.",

The image shows how the student can see his own detailed attendance report for the course. I have two test servers at the moment: we plan to switch to 2.5 during the summer and use 2.4.3+ at the moment. The attendance module is the newest one for 2.4 (ver 2012120700) and this behaviour is the same on both Moodle servers. I am not a programmer but had a quick look at the code and it seems to me that in locallib.php around line 1051 the function get_user_filtered_sessions_log_extended uses 2 queries to gather all sessions (one for \"all taked sessions (including previous groups)\", the other is for \"all sessions for current groups\"). I have a feeling that when these two sessions are merged, the records for the filled in sessions are doubled. This is definitely not a theme issue, as it looks the same with several themes (including the formal white). Thanks for any help or advice, Éva",

          "Text": "I looked closer and you are right: the problem is the 2 queries. They don't merge properly. This is because an array_merge does not treat numeric array keys the same as text keys. The arrays from the two queries are indexed by the attendance session ID, which is a number. The point of the merge is that two records for attendance session 5 for example will merge into one, but array_merge simply spits out an ordered array with both entries. I came up with a quick fix that seems to work, but you should test it first (may behave differently depending on your database ). You have to get the index of the array to be text. Moodle uses the first item a SELECT query as the index, so just add a new field as the first field that has some text concatenated. For the two SELECT queries in the get_user_filtered_sessions_log_extended() function, the start of the query would look like this: $ sql = \"SELECT CONCAT( 'key', ats.id) as tempkey, ats.id, ats.groupid, .... I am just adding the text 'key' to the ID as an additional field so that PHP will treat the resulting array keys as text and it will merge properly. Hope that helps.",

I want to ask about a possible fix for a feature of the mod that isn't functioning correctly. The support for group sessions was nice since M2.0, but I can't use it because we need to move students from one group to another. As you know this leaves taken sessions for the student sitting hidden, which can be problematic and difficult to track. Now with Common Sessions, Teachers mark 1 session, then go to the next. The filtering select form shows their group name, but the list is showing all course participants. The teacher has to click off their group then back on for every session. Is it difficult for me to fix this filtering problem? We have 20 sessions per week to mark - tedium magnified. I hope you don't mind this, it would be great to get your advice. I am trying to customize the code for us right now and the reverse engineering is going slowly. Kind regards M",

Teachers take photos of each individual in their class at the beginning of the term. This might result in an extremely user-friendly attendance marking interface that simply involves uploading classroom photos at the end of each week. In-class attendance is taken by pulling out your smartphone and one snap. It would be similar to face tagging used in Google+ and Facebook. Any thoughts or possible starting points? Furthermore, is anyone interested in being paid to develop this for our open-source community?",

As you can see, there is the course ID number, the course name, the student number (firstname field) and columns for each course session (class01-class08).  A date appears next to a student number when that student is absent from class.  The first class is completely blank because that teacher does not take attendance using Moodle, so there is no data.  But the second teacher does, and there are 13 absences in 8 class sessions. Students B130021 and B130625 have three absenses, so they are in trouble. This data sheet is really large because we have 175 separate courses, this screenshot shows only the first three. If this does not fit your situation, you'll have to ask a PHP programmer to adjust some lines of code. This block is fairly simple, so it is not a big job. If someone wanted to create a really useful function of this block, you could program it to generate  automatic email messages that said something like, Hi [studentname], This is your school and we noticed you were absent on [xxx date, yyydate, zzzdate] in [aaa class subject].  You may have to make-up those classes.  Is there anything we can do to help?  Please reply to me if you have any questions.

Many people have posted on the issue, and usually manage to solve it by turning debugging on and noting where the page load fails. It might be attendance, and it might be something else! It is almost always a third-party block though. In my experience, the problem is caused by some code calling a block or module that no longer exists or is corrupted in the instance. Easiest fix is to re-install the missing block, but sometimes you can't (because it hasn't been updated for the current version of Moodle). Other things you can try are digging through all the relevant directories, removing the files completely, and then re-installing. Some things require files in multiple places, so you tend to forget where all of them are! If you remove only half the files, you will get the \"turn editing on vanishes everything\" problem. I do hope you get it figured out. I can tell you that the attendance block is working properly in our instance, 1.8.2+ updated September 7. atw",

I just installed the latest (as of Nov 14, 2007) attendance block and module in Moodle 1.9.2. I noticed these things: - under the Report tab, display of Months and Weeks worked, but \"All Taken\" reported \"Nothing to display\" - the activity was missing some language information, since it appeared as modulename on the main course page (the block did not have this problem) This was a quick test with 1 student - but I thought the info may be useful. Other than the above, it seems to work. I have not done extensive testing, however.",

The totals (P,A,L,E,Grade) are counted based on the sessions since the course.startdate. However, the report shows gradings for all sessions, even before course.startdate (suppose you changed the startdate). This can lead to confusing reports like the one below. Attached is a patch, causing the report to only show those sessions which occur after startdate and therefore report the totals and individual sessions consistently. Thanks very much for the great add-on. Gavin PS why can it not be found under moodle.org's \"modules and plugins\" section.

I turned maximum debugging on via the admin settings. In attforblock, settings.php, config.php was not included or found. I changed this line require_once('../../config.php'); to require_once($CFG-> dirroot .'/config.php'); and that error disappeared. However, I had other errors... A required parameter (id) was missing Stack trace: * line 5741 of lib/weblib.php: call to debugging() * line 296 of lib/moodlelib.php: call to error() * line 14 of mod/attforblock/settings.php: call to required_param() * line 27 of admin/settings/plugins.php: call to include() * line 4037 of lib/adminlib.php: call to include() * line 545 of admin/index.php: call to admin_get_root() the above was on the page moodle-site/admin/ (Please note: the line numbers might be off by 1 or 2, since I tried making a few changes to fix this - but they should be close!) I looked and the line in attforblock/settings.php was $id = required_param('id', PARAM_INT); // Course id I wondered if this was not set because I was in the admin page, not in a course. So, on a course page (the default course, CF101) I see this: print_header() was sent a string as 3rd (CF101 -> Attendance) parameter. This is deprecated in favour of an array built by build_navigation(). Please upgrade your code. * line 2338 of lib/weblib.php: call to debugging() * line 48 of mod/attforblock/manage.php: call to print_header() Course Fullname 101 * Navigation needs to be updated to use build_navigation() * line 3542 of lib/weblib.php: call to debugging() * line 37 of theme/standardwhite/header.html: call to print_navigation() * line 2553 of lib/weblib.php: call to include() * line 48 of mod/attforblock/manage.php: call to print_header() You are here * Moo * / ► CF101 * / ► Attendance But, the block seems to be working, in spite of the errors. With debugging off, the only noticeable thing I recall was that some admin pages were not visible. I used this block in Moodle 1.8 without this problem - but that was an older version of Attendance, and older version of Moodle. I hope the above information is helpful.",

When you turn editing on, you can look in the \"activity\" dropdown box and add attendance the same way you add any assignment, forum, or other interactive object. If you don't want attendance to show in your gradebook, you can then hide it. You use the block to take attendance (which still works even though the activity is hidden), and the students can see their report. (My recollection is that this happens automatically, but you can check the student roles if there is a problem). Of course if you DO want it in the gradebook, don't hide the activity or set the gradebook to show ALL activities even those that are hidden. Personally, I always put the attendance activity in the summary topic at the very top of my course. Hope you get it to work! We love this block. atw",

If I could create a 'template' attendance pattern in a course and then import it into other courses it would make my job MUCH easier. Currently this is not possible....I guess due to the lack of backup support. Is there any forecast date for when the 'backup support' is going to be implemented for the attendance module/block? Or is backup support even related to the issue I'm having??? If I click on \"import\" from a course that doesn't not have the attendance mod/block installed, and then navigate to a course that has the attendance mod/block to try to import it, all the other activities from that course appear but the attendance activity does not.

Attached is a screen capture to illustrate this. In looking at the figure (all of the sessions through February 13 are recorded) I noticed one common denominator among the sessions that are not recorded as taken: They all have apostrophes in the description. I tried to change the name to drop the apostrophe and then go through the process of taking record again, but it did not change the behavior. So I'm pretty much baffled. When tabulating the student's attendance score, the score is taken from all sessions but the possible score omits the four that are shown as not taken. Thus all of my students have >100% attendance at this point. I haven't updated my attendance module since the start of 2008, so if this has been addressed since December my apologies. If it hasn't been addressed, it would be cool if someone could figure out what is going on. Thanks, Richard Edit: Added screen capture of report",

The spreadsheet option sounds even better to me but I'm not sure if I can get it all set up or not.. I need to generate attendance settings (specific dates over the course of a semester - three different patterns) for quite a few courses and I was thinking that importing them from a template course would be the best way but I guess, if my skills were up to par, I could do it other ways too.

In order to create an attendance block and sessions on a given course, you need to add one row to the mdl_block_instance table which is the same as adding the attendance block through the webpage. You then need to add a row to the mdl_attendance_sessions table for each date a given course needs to call attendance, which is equivalent to creating the date sessions in the web interface. You can do this by running SQL insert commands like the example I've given. http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/2207/sql1.html Alternatively, it might be easier to create a spreadsheet with all of the records you need to add for a given table. You can then export them to CSV format and use the LOAD DATA INFILE SQL command to import the rows into each table.

I tested and when I create a new session with an apostrophe in the description (ummm, was that actually the problem or did I notice a false pattern?) it worked fine so future sessions shouldn't be a problem. To make sure what I did is clear, I created a zip file with the mod/attforblock, blocks/attendance, and lang/(all of them) and sent it to the computer administrator (I am the Moodle administrator, but I don't have access to the computer or installing files--doesn't make sense but that's the way our computer services department trusts faculty with computers) who copied the structure into the Moodle directory. He said that when he went to \"an admin page\" which I assume is the blocks or modules page, it showed lines indicating that the database had been updated. However, he said after it showed the database update info, it said he had to log in as administrator (he couldn't have arrived at that page without being logged in as administrator). Thus I'm guessing something funky happened in the database repair. Anyhow, is there a sql command I can manually enter to repair the database? Thanks for all of your efforts! Richard",

I managed to add the necessary row and fields to mdl_block_instance but the block did not 'appear' in the course that I added it to. The course ID is correct as I can also see it in the address bar of my browser when I access that particular course. I thought maybe the block had not appeared yet because I still needed to add rows and fields to mdl_attforblock and mdl_attendance_settings and eventually mdl_attendance_sessions. I tried to add the rows and fields to mdl_attendance_settings as follows: \"\",\"82\",\"P\",\"S\",\"Super\",\"3\" \"\",\"82\",\"A\",\"P\",\"Present\",\"2\" \"\",\"82\",\"L\",\"L\",\"Late\",\"1\" \"\",\"82\",\"E\",\"A\",\"Absent\",\"0\" using Import from PHPMyAdmin which uses the LOAD DATA INFILE command. I have a very strange problem though. Every time I try to add the 4 rows listed above, I only get 2 rows successfully added and every time they are the one containing 'Super' and the one containing 'Late'. It skips 'Present' and 'Absent' every time.... I've tried all kinds of things (using different field separators, different enclosures, using just 'Import csv file' instead of 'csv using LOAD DATA' but nothing seems to work. Every time I just get those two rows. I also went back to the course (number 82) to see if the attendance block was showing up but no luck, it's not there. I am probably missing something really simple...... can't, for the life of me, figure out what it is though. Advice and help will, as always, be greatly appreciated. Jason Edit - I manged to add the 2 rows through phyMyAdmin by clicking on Insert and adding one row at a time (not how I want to do it for 200+ courses) but the block still doesn't show up in the course I've added everything to...",

          "Text": "Gavin, Thanks again for your help and patience with a beginner. I think I'm dealing with several issues at the same time here and haven't probably made them clear enough. My understanding is that if I create rows and fields in the following tables: mdl_block_instance mdl_attendance_settings mdl_attforblock (this one too?) and eventually mdl_attendance_sessions that the block will appear in the course specified. So, in mdl_block_instance I created a new row that looks like this: 812 | 33 | 82 | course-view | r | 1 | 1 | The column headings are (id, blockid, pageid, pagetype, position, weight, visible At this point, should I be able to navigate to the course (82) and see the attendance block? It seems that this should make the block appear but it does not. My next problem is related to the settings in mdl_attendance_settings and not being able to import the csv file correctly. (only 2 of the 4 rows get imported). I did go ahead and put them in one line at a time but still don't see the attendance block/mod when I go to the course (id is 82). I also created a row in mdl_attforblock that is the same as other lines in that table but with the appropriate course id (82) but still no attendance block/mod on the course page. My development instance of Moodle is a MAMP package running on my laptop. I guess I can access SQL directly by using the terminal. I'll give that a try using the commands you've provided and see how it works. It seems that I've been able to create the rows and fields correctly but the block isn't showing up so I'm confused. I even went to the course via my browser and created the block via the web interface and then went back to the database to see the new row in the database with all the same values (except for the incremental id of course). Creating the attendance block via the web site adds the row to mdl_block_instance right after the one that I added manually. It seems like I'm missing something when I add the block manually into the database... Also, in regards to the mdl_attendance_settings, it seems that you are saying that if I just change the defaults I won't have to make any other changes to mdl_attendance_settings...? But when I look at the mdl_attendance_settings, there are rows (4 of them) for every instance of the attendance block I have created on my site.....so don't I need to create those rows for the attendance block of each course that I want it in? This is a study in database organization for me in addition to manipulation. I don't think I completely understand the relations between the tables (block_instance, attendance_settings, attforblock) yet and apologize for my bone headedness. If you can grant me a little more patient assistance I will probably eventually figure it out Thanks Jason",

You're trying to run the exact same SQL commands which the moodle attendance block itself does in creating each attendance module. So, one approach to understand what's going on is: 1. Set up a test server and install moodle attendance. 2. On your database, turn up the debug output so that each query gets output into a text file. 3. Login and create a new course. Record the time on the server. 4. Now set up attendance in that course via the webpages. 5. Record the time on the server. 6. Now look at the log file and see what SQL commands got run. On a debian linux system with mysql, it appears you turn on the query logging by uncommenting this line in /etc/mysql/my.cnf #log = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log and restarting mysql. Gavin",

          "Text": "Gavin (and anyone else following this thread inside the main thread ) I've finally managed to figure out how to: 1. Get the attendance module to 'appear' in a course through manipulation of the database. and 2. Insert attendance sessions into each instance created. The process (for #1) involves modification of the following tables in the database: mdl_attforblock mdl_course_modules mdl_course_sections mdl_course The module simply needs to be added for each course in mdl_attforblock. That part is rather simple. Adding it to mdl_course_modules isn't too complicated either. For mdl_course_sections, if adding the module to the top center block ('0') the sequence needs to be modified so that Moodle knows in which order to display the default News Forum and the Attendance activity. The hardest part is that in mdl_course, the modinfo field must be modified to include information about the module you have added (in this case Attendance). If you don't make this modification, nothing is displayed in the top center block. Under activities \"Attendances\" will be displayed but clicking on it produces an error. I'm working on first getting the task I need completed and will then try to write this up in a more user friendly post. At that point I'll start a new thread (and link to it in a response here) rather than continue to add on to this forum. Many thanks to Gavin for pointing me in the right direction and helping with great suggestions that allowed me to figure this out! Jason P.S. As for #2 (adding attendance sessions) that will just involve adding the appropriate rows to mdl_attendance_sessions. I'm going to be doing that as well and will include more detailed instructions for that process as well.",

Attendance is the name of the module and it has a physical path of <moodle directory>/mod/attforblock.  The <moodle directory>/ is taken for granted and the / is replaced with a _ in the path listing shown here.  The attendance block is installed in <moodle directory>/blocks folder so it shows up as: Attendance block_attendance (Don't ask me why \"blocks/attendance\" turns into \"block_attendance\" in this one!)

To be fair, there are some excellent intentions behind the update, but if this and several other very critical mistakes in usability are not corrected in a few weeks I think we'll be finding another solution for our Attendance records (paper maybe?) - or I am on a crash course in plugin development for moodle :\\ Oh, you might try a bigger LCD monitor or increase the resolution on your screen for a quick dirty solution. Or export attendance and it's on the last column. Big ups to the developers though, I do not mean any offence by that said, just honesty. You all do a grand job sharing your marvelous work (I am not being sarcastic). I love moodle and open-source, just need to get a better handle on it myself (and quickly) so I can fix these problems or I might be in some trouble with my director for being so enthusiastic about upgrading from 1.9 and into a separate groups setup. Big question mark [?!] to Human Logic (Moodle partner in the UAE) who, last we spoke, had developed an updated version of their Attendance module and hadn't gotten around to sharing it with the community.

This is what I intend to implement: Today sessions. When you list the available sessions in the activity it's annoying having to scroll to the present day. I'd like to show those sessions in the first place. (Already done!) Grid view. For the people who are not good at matching faces with names, like me. It is also better for touchscreen devices like the iPad or a smartphone. (Already done!, just giving the finishing touches...) Allow more than one attendance activity per course. I grade the attendance on each quarter, and I'd like to have independent grades in the gradebook for each one. Copying attendance data from other sessions. In some subjects I teach more than 1 hour a day but I must take attendance in a hourly manner. This feature would allow me to easily copy the attedance data from the hour before and then modify it. Fast session switching. It would be nice to have a quick way to switch from one session to another, especially if they are in the same day. Some real screenshots of my (Work-In-Progress) Grid View: By the way, Merry Xmas! Best regards, Luis-Ramón",

As a minimum, with the participation of Dmitry and A. T. Wyatt. My thoughts: 1. Which page do you mean? And the 2.2 version of attendance already has \"Day\" view mode... 2. Need more statistics, who need this functionality. I looked at the patch. I think - it's controversial issue whether we should change the database structure and store the settings for each attendance instance. Or each user can select the view mode (selection can be saved in user_preferences). 3. Requires more planning (attendance block, user reports, etc...) 4, 5. Need more statistics, who need this functionality. Happy new year!",

I know that the module is GPL'ed, but I always like to ask for permission because I think it's better to work on the same code branch than fork the project. I'd like to explain some background information about my intentions: Our goal is to let Moodle become the standard \"teacher notebook\" in my school. Moodle, in its 1.9 base setup, provides a rather nice gradebook and also stores the students' profiles. Two months ago we determined that, in order to fulfil all the requirements for the notebook, we needed an \"attendance\" module and an \"academic program progress\" module. That is why I started test and analyzing the attendance module. About your thoughts: Yes, you're right. The 2.2 version supports \"Day\" view mode. I thought I had 2.2.0beta installed on my test system but it was an older version. Nice work, by the way! The grid view mode really enhances the user experience when taking attendance with a touchscreen device (e.g. iPad or smartphone). It is also convenient when you still don't know your student faces . I made a, kinda adhoc, survey with other teachers and almost all liked the new view better that the old one. Anyway, my idea was to let the user switch views at will. I really like your idea about making an user preference instead of a instance setting. Yesterday I made all the changes on my testing system and it seems to work. I'm now in the testing phase just to make sure it doesn't affect any existing functionality. I do! I think it would be convenient for those who teach more than one session with the same students in the same day. Refer to point 4. As I said before, these changes are pointed to adapt the actual attendance module to our needs, which are not necessarily the needs of anybody else. I'd really like to discuss the suggestions with Dmitry, A.T. Wyatt and you. Should I contact them directly with a more ellaborated proposal? Happy New Year to you too! P.S.: I found a bug in the styles.php in 2.2.0beta. The appended styles for support YUI dialogs are affecting the entire Moodle site. I'm attaching a fix.",

          "Text": "Some news about this: I took away the changes in the database structure for the grid mode. As you said, it's actually more convenient to store that info in the user preferences table (thanks for the idea!). About allowing multiple instances, as you know, sessions and statuses where referred by 'courseid' in the database. So, in order to distinguish more than one instance in the same course, I had to add one field ('attendanceid') to attendance_sessions and attendance_statuses . I also studied the code thoroughfully and fixed the places where 'courseid' was taken as the module id or used in filters. Also I took into account the new field when creating new records. So far, it works: Updating from an old version adds the new fields on the database and updates its value. Creating more than one instance in the same course is allowed. Attendance sessions are not shared among instances. Attendance logs put the attendance data in the right instance. Reports and exports work right, showing only the sessions belonging to the instance. Gradebook shows as many instances as you have, with different and independent grades. Backup and restore also seems to work. By the way, I've kept the backup format untouched (so it's backward compatible with old backups). I still have to test restoration in a different platform, through. I'm looking forward to test grouping , as I don't have a real course with groups enabled. Is there any other test cases you find interesting? I am attaching a diff related to the head on your repository. It's from my 'test' branch (I'm really get excited on git workflow...) On the to-do list: I have to modify both index.php and the 'attendance block' to show the list of the instances (they assume only one!). I've also added a new user preference (attforblock_showendtime) which allows showing the time when a sessions ends instead of its duration (for those cases where is more useful to the teacher). I still have to add a button to switch the pref. Thanks in advance for your time Arteem. Best regards!",

DO NOT USE on production servers !!! \" I am looking for a way to purge attendance records from sessions in groups that a student in no longer in. My goal is to clear the records and therefore correct the attendance grade from miscellaneous records that are unseen. A way to unmark attendance could help or someway of transferring the records into the new group's session. Recently the admin office at my college made a mess of the registrations, suffice to say, we had to do a lot of transfers early on. As the attendance sessions are associated with the groups in a separate groups setup, if they were moved into a different group and the teacher had already marked them absent inside the first group, it goofs up their attendance score. To have those records moved with the student would be preferable although separate groups is a nice benefit of the new module. It's good to separate by groups so the teach can easily see sessions they have not completed, but if the student changes groups, this problem occurs. Please see attached PNG of what the individual's report might look like. You can see the repeat sessions, 1 marked present and the highlighted marked absent. This also effects the Attendance Grade. How can I remove a session from ever being recorded, or can anyone think of a nice solution to fix it for these students?",

I noticed that the module's main documentation page for Moodle v2.3 hadn't been update since 2010, and still talked about an earlier version of the module meant to run with Moodle v1.9.  I updated the installation instructions based on other documentation on this site and on my own installation experience. A couple of points that need attention from someone: 1. The documentation page should be fully updated to conform with v2.4.0 of the module. I'll probably do that as I continue testing the module. 2. If v2.4.0 does work with Moodle v2.3, something I'm not yet completely certain of, its documentation should be updated to reflect this fact -- or rather, it should be versioned to v2.4.1, since at least one file would need to be changed. 3. It would be really nice if this module would be published in the standard way, on the Plugins page . 4. The old documentation mentioned in passing something called the Attendance block, inadequately documented at page Attendance block .  What is it?  How is it installed?  The documentation page says very little.  (I'm fairly new to Moodle, so I might be missing something that's obvious to more experienced users.)",

The problem is when anyone of the teachers take the attendance, he will be able to take attendance for all three groups. The teacher can choose his group and he is able to take others aswell. Actually every teacher can access of his groups only on the attendance sheet. I have enabled a link \"Available for group members only\" which is available in Site administration>Development>Experimental>Experimental settings. I have created different groupings and place each group in one grouping . Another problem is that in Attendance activity Show advanced button in Group mode is not available/visible.

          "Text": "I just installed the new attendance module for my 2.3 moodle site. There are three issues (2 minor and one major) They are: #1 (minor) Is there a way to display the dates in the mm/dd/yy format? This is the North American standard, and it is difficult for some to adapt. Its really easy to forget and pick the wrong dates. #2 (minor) Is there a way to change the duration of a class manually? The drop down box for class duration only makes 5 minute increments. But my classes change sometimes at, say, 2:12, and 3:14, etc., and they last 50 minutes. But I think some schools have different durations and class start times that do not fall into neat 5 minute increments. Just allow me to manually enter the exact times for start time and duration and I will be happy! #3 (major) Although I can access the attendance module in section zero (it is invisible so that students can't see it there) and it works fine if I click on it there, when I try to use the \"BLOCK\" version of attendance (to take attendance for example), all I get is a white screen and Moodle hangs. If I go back a screen, I can still use Moodle, but accessing the attendance from a block when the module is installed and working (but invisible) in section zero causes the block to crash. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks.",

But I must acces it from the course page. I tried to get teh dates and times to default to US English by changing to the US language pack, but no joy. Dates and times still display in the International standard. I have noticed a new issue, and this simply doesn't work. The Remarks column accepts input, but there is no method to extract out the remarks. This is very important to me, and I need to see that data in a report. It contains remarks that I use to evaluate a student on their tardies, or on whether they brought required materials to class. Not being able to see those remarks is irritating. Is there some workaround? Now, as far as what is happening to the block. Well, I installed the version andreev-artem-moodle_blocks_attendance-b0c969a I am running the most current version of moodle (2.3.2) What happens is that I use \"Add A Block\" to put the attendance block on the same page as the course. I then click on the \"Take Attendance\" and all I get is a white screen. It goes nowhere and does nothing. I can go back a page to see the moodle page again, so it doesn't lock things up. It just doesn't function. So tell me, how is it that the Block version of Attendance is \"calling\" the attendance activity? How does it know? Maybe that linkage is missing? I would love to make it work, but as of now, it doesn't.",

I think the reason that the newest (Artem's version) is not in the plugins database is because he did not choose to put it there.  I don't think anyone else would be comfortable adding it, since that is more appropriately the developers choice.  I had some correspondence with him about it last year, but it appears that he prefers to keep up his github site instead of publishing in the modules database.  His github site is commented, and he has more projects on it than attendance. With respect to Dmitry's version, it still resides in the old plugins and modules database, but as far as I know, is no longer being kept up.  Of course as we move further and further from Moodle 1.8, the less likely it is that people will want to install that particular version.  In our case, we were using a REALLY old version, not wanting some of the extra features he put in later. As far as I can see, the release notes for Moodle 2.3 do not include attendance, so it won't be in core any time soon.  Perhaps you might want to direct message Artem and ask? Perhaps the best way to deal with the docs situation is to find out how to open up a new page that focuses on Moodle 2.x attendance.  In that case, I think the only module would be Artem Andreev's.  Would you be willing to get it started?  We are just now moving to Moodle 2.x, so I haven't had any experience with the new attendance module.  I can ask Helen or Chris Collman about it. atw",

New plugins directory has some strictly requirements. I tried to register module in october 2011. I got error with table names.

We are on a site that is hosted by Moodlerooms.   Our Moodle server is at 1.9.15.  We use the Attendance module with a version of 2009022800.  I don't have access to the files so I don't know if there is a different version number located there. We are having a couple of problems. 1.  When do the reports get generated?  At times the reports generate immediatly and at other times it does not.   Sometimes we can change the display from All taken to Weeks it will display the report. 2. Grading works sporadically.   If we set the grade to 10 points at times the grade records in the grade book properly as points out of the percentage of 10.  Other times it gives all 10 points even if a person has attended 1 period out of 20. I know we should go to 2.x and we will, but right now we are on 1.9.   What version should I be on for Moodle 1.9...latest stable?   Who is now in control of this module?     Are there different owners for the Moodle 1.9 and Moodle 2.x Attendance modules? Thank you for your time.",

The auto-attendance block has links to the auto-attendance screen which is very similar to the attendance screen. In our case we have set attendance taking to \"automatic\" rather than \"semi-automatic.\" Then we set up the sessions (days of our class in which we want attendance taken). And the computer pretty much does the rest. You have to hit the refresh button on the general autoattendance tab and it goes out to the logs and imports the data into the report.

          "Text": "Hi, I just installed version ver 2.0.2 of Attendance for the first time and am having some problems. I will list them in order of importance, so please answer any you have knowledge about. I am running Moodle 1.8.2 and PHP 4.4.6 on host bluehost.com. 1) I was able to add the Attendance as an activity on the main Moodle page, but was not able to see it in the Activities menus in any of the courses. All I can see are the standard modules and then modulename at the bottom of the menu. Any ideas how to get this into the individual courses? 2) I can probably deal with having everyone take attendance on the main page rather than in their courses since this is a small K-8 school. But I would like to order the students by classes to make it easier for the teachers. Is there any way to order the students by group rather than alphabetically in the attendance list? Is there a way to show only particular groups in the list, not everyone who is enrolled? 3) Whenever I go to export the attendance lists to Excel or another format, I get an error that says \"Students Not Found!\". Any ideas? 4) Is there an easy way to remove the feature where you can change the status for everyone by just clicking on the code (e.g., clicking on P changes everyone's status to Present) or should I just look through the code any remove that feature? I'm not a php programmer, so any hints as to where to find this would be helpful. 4) I am not able to access the help files for Attendance. When I click on the ? it says \"File Not Found\". The help files are currently in /moodle/blocks/attendance/lang/en_us_utf8/help/block_attendance and I also put them in the same place in en_utf8 and in /moodle/lang/en_us_utf8/help/block_attendance. Permissions are 0644 or 0744. Where should they be? Also, there is no file updateattendance.html, although this is the one called for by the question mark at the top of the attendance page.",

This block requires three things: one, install the activity which goes in the mod folder; two, install the block, which goes in the block folder; and three, install the language files, which go in the appropriate language folder. Perhaps you missed some little part of that? 2) You can use groups, but right now the groups are shown by group number rather than group name. The group function works like other areas using groups--you should force groups in your course settings, enroll students into the groups, and then use the drop down box to see all or a particular group. 3) If your excel export says there are no students, then I would look for a reason why the activity/block is not picking up students. Perhaps you haven't enrolled them into the course, or perhaps they haven't been enrolled into their groups? I can tell you that the export does work properly on my system. 4) In my experience, being able to mark the majority of the students at once (click the P and get them all!) and then change the few who are not present is much less clicking. If you don't want to use the letters at the top, then you can simply click each radio button in the list. If you want to hack it, you can certainly do that. My recollection is that the code is documented well enough. I tend to see that as a feature, though. 5) We were working on some additional helpfiles in another thread. They might not have made it into cvs . Look for other threads in this forum about attendance 1.8 and you might find them. Do you think the permissions problem is creating the [] display? That is interesting. Hope some of that helped! atw",

The Moodle mods are supposed to be self-contained so you don't have to move any language files \"into the right location.\" However, the packaging of the attendance pieces contains both a mod and a block. The language files for both the mod and the block are contained in the block folder (that is, the blocks/attendance/lang/* folders have both attforblock.php and block_attendance.php while the mod/attforblock/ folder has no lang folders). As I see it, there are two fixes. You can move the contents of the lang folder into their the base lang folders, or you can follow the \"new\" format of having self-contained packages by moving (or copying) the language files for the mod into the mod folder. I prefer the latter approach (easier to troubleshoot language issues IMHO ), so here is my simple fix: Copy (not move) the lang folder from blocks/attendance/ to mod/attforblock/ If you are in a UNIX environment, then my recommendation is to navigate to your Moodle installation directory (that is, the directory with admin, auth, backup, blocks, et al.) and type the following commands: mkdir mod/attforblock/lang cp -R blocks/attendance/lang/* mod/attforblock/lang/. This does lead to a duplicate language file in each folder, but is less work than moving half of the language files one at a time!",

          "Text": "Ben, When you unzip the block_attendance_for_v19, it should create a folder (my Mac names it block_attendance_for_v19 Folder--how convenient with two subfolders named blocks and mod . If you look at your Moodle installation, you will see that among the many subfolders in the Moodle folder, you again have folders named blocks and mod . The idea is that you copy the contents of the block_attendance_for_v19/blocks folder into your moodle/blocks folder (so you will have a moodle/blocks /attendance/ folder with all of the files and subfolders copied as well) and likewise copy the contents of the block_attendance_for_v19/mod folder into your moodle/mod folder. What I wrote above is one of two ways to fix an oversight in the language folder. Moodle has a general language folder with language files. \"In the old days\" you copied the contents of block_attendance_for_v19/blocks/attendance/lang into the moodle/lang folder, and all will worked correctly. This still works, but is not the preferred way anymore (at least for me). Moodle now allows you to keep the language files with the mods and blocks so they are self-contained and you don't have to fiddle around with language files. I prefer this method because it is easier organization (to my way of thinking). However, the language folder in block_attendance_for_v19/mod/attforblock is missing (the file attforblock.php that should be in this missing language folder is instead in the attendance language folder) . As a result, attforblock does not have its ten (yes, only ten) strings defined. This is very noticeable because the modulename and modulenameplural strings (the labels that show up in the main course page) are defined here. So, without either following my instructions in the previous post or doing it the old way, you are going to see modulename and modulenameplural where the author intends you to see Attendance and Attendances. (Personal note, I recommend editing the ...lang/en_utf8/attforblock.php language file and replacing each occurrence of Attendances with Attendance. Some dictionaries say that attendances is the plural form of attendance while others say there is no plural form. I am more comfortable with the latter.) Richard",

This approach is ideal for our school, because we also maintain a paper attendance book as the final authority. The online Attendance Module allows students to see their own status at any time. If you need an automatic version for a computer lab, I have heard of ones. You might check the Modules and Plugins database or contact Tom Robb who has built his own version. With regards, Don",

          "Title": "Re: Problems with Attendance Module",
          "Text": "As Don said, the attendance module is a module designed to take attendance during class. If you are looking for a record of students visiting specific pages in a class (or a specific class), that information is available in the \"Reports\" function (you will find Reports in the Administration block), but not nicely tabulated. Since Moodle collects such data it is certainly possible for someone to create a module that would track an \"attendance\" record for each document in a class, but I am not aware of one. But, assuming that you indeed want to take attendance in the traditional sense, here are some instructions on how to get started with the attendance module. After successfully installing the attendance module (including a visit to the admin page to make sure the database is properly set up--I don't know if this mod requires it but I do that as a matter of course any time I install a new or updated mod just to be safe), you must add attendance as an activity to each course you wish to keep attendance in. This is done by first ensuring that you are in the edit mode and then selecting, \"Attendance\" from the \"Add an activity...\" pull-down menu. Note that you may only add the attendance activity once per class and it may be located in any of the section blocks. Because attendance is for the entire course, I generally put it in the top box (the one that always shows). Once you have added the attendance activity, you are ready to start using the attendance module. However, I find the section link that was just added in the preceding paragraph to be the \"clunky way\" to work with the attendance module. In fact, I hide the link I just created! That way students don't see it cluttering up the section block where you placed it. Of course, we DO want students to be able to view their attendance records, just not with that link. There is a second, better, way to accomplish this. Select \"Attendance\" from the pull-down menu in the \"Blocks\" block. This will create a block with options to take attendance, report on attendance, or change the attendance settings for you, and an attendance report for students. So, time to set up your attendance. The clear choice now is to select \"Settings\" from the attendance block. This brings you to the letters, descriptions, and grade (points) to assign for the four attendance options. By default these are Present, Absent, Late, and Excused. I prefer the word Tardy to Late (same meaning, of course) and I prefer Tardy before Absent, so I make appropriate changes here to the names, order, and grades. Next it is time to add sessions. Note that there is a restriction here. You can only have one session per day. Since you can only have one attendance activity installed (which means that I cannot have a lab attendance activity and a lecture attendance activity) and can only have one attendance session per day, if you have more than one class session per day you will have to be creative in taking attendance. And if you have more than seven class sessions for a single class in a week--then you are overworked! To add class sections , click the \"Add\" tab (second from left) at the top of the page (if you left the attendance page, select any of the three links from the attendance block to return to the attendance page and gain access to the \"Add\" tab). You have two options here, to add a single session or to add multiple sessions. The single session is self-explanatory so I will go straight the more useful option, how to add multiple sessions. Choose the date for the first session you wish to add followed by the date for the last session you wish to add. Next select the days of the week on which the class meets. The final option, frequency, may look confusing but it is actually straight-forward. This is an option that you only need to concern yourself with if your class doesn't meet every week. If your class meets every week (the normal situation) then you want a frequency of 1 week which is the default. If your class meets every other week, then you want a frequency of 2 weeks, and so on. When you click the \"Add multiple sessions\" button, your sessions will be created and you will see a message indicating this. Now head to the attendance tab. Here you see the list of all attendance sessions you have added. You can delete individual sessions by clicking the X to the right of them. (Personal note, it sure would be nice if there was an option to select a few sessions and delete them all at once--I use the multiple sessions option to put my sessions in for the entire semester and then have to go and remove sessions for vacation days one at a time.) You can edit a session (change the date or add a description) with the standard hand icon to the right of the session, or you can take attendance for a session by clicking the green radio button to the right of the session. Sessions where attendance has already been taken do not have the green button, but instead the description is a link that takes you to the screen to modify the attendance record for that session. A quick note on attendance session descriptions. I used to spend a lot of time editing each one to give the appropriate description for that class period. But then I discovered that the students don't see the descriptions I entered--all they see is \"Regular class session\" regardless of the session description. Thus I do not recommend spending the time to name the sessions unless you will get confused without them. You will note that the column headings in the page for taking attendance are links. If you click one of these column headings, all students will have their status changed to the status you selected. Thus, if everyone is absent (God forbid!), you merely click the A and it will change everyone's status to absent. If Little Johnny is the only student absent, you would logically click P to set everyone to present and then go down to Little Johnny and change his status to A. Enter remarks as appropriate (I enter the reason for an absence if known or the minutes late if someone is tardy) and click OK to complete taking record. Finally, you have the reports. This is, again, obvious. One of my colleagues prefers to take record on paper and transfer it to Moodle. She suggested printing the monthly report before the start of the month and then taking record on this report. It has an added advantage because you have each student's picture with the record sheet. Of course, that is only useful for students who actually put photos of themselves in for their picture. A final note here. If you added the attendance block as I recommended, you may wonder what it looks like for students. It is completely different--showing a summary of their attendance record and having a single link for them to view the details of their personal attendance. Another reason why I think the attendance block should always be added when you use the attendance module. And unlike my previous post on how to install the attendance module, short and succinct could never be used to describe this message Good luck! Richard",

OK, now that I have corrected that, to add the block you must be on the main page for your course and in edit mode.  At the bottom of the left column you should see the \"Blocks\" block (Blocks are the boxes on the left and right side of your Moodle page).  From the drop-down menu select Attendance as shown in the figure below and it will add the Attendance block.

That zip file doesn't have the directories referenced in the readme.txt file. One of the github locations that is supposed to be 'current' has the project listed as 'unresolved' Quote: Place the \"attendance\" directory in your blocks directory, \"attforblock\" directory in your mod directory It doesn't have 'attforblock' directory. Assuming root of the zip is 'attendance' there is a block_attendance.php file - Is that supposed to be the one called \"attforblock\" ? Should that directory be created as 'attforblock' and the file moved into that directory, or does it depend on another block from a different location? Sorry for all the Q's, but it's frustrating trying to guess on versions, knowing a mistake can corrupt your installation. If anyone can shed some light on this, I'd sure appreciate it- and I know lots of others would welcome the information. Thanks. - John",

Those acronyms are taken from the current translation strings. From that moment, every new \"Attendance Activity\" you create will take that default set of acronyms, even if the active locale is different. There is one exception: when there was a former attendance activity on a particular course that was deleted and recreated. I don't recall an easy method to change the default acronyms without tinkering the database, but I might be wrong... Nevertheless, there is an easy fix to that: just let it ignore the default set and, instead, read the acronyms each time a new activity is created. I could show you the changes the code needs to work that way if you need them. Best regards!",

First I want to apologize for the fact that the last formal change of the project was three years ago. It is difficult to create something great for free on weekends and at night. The situation is complicated by the fact that in Russia it is very difficult to accept donations, even if you decide to support the development. But there are solutions! The head of my university (Novosibirsk state pedagogical university) stated that the development of open source projects can be supported financially by university, if these projects are in demand in other educational institutions in the world. Thus you can get the new version of the project for free, and I can include the \"Attendance\" to my roadmap. If you want to support the project \"Attendance\", please send a request to the improvement of the project (this can be \"Updating for Moodle 2.0\" or something else) on the official letterhead of your institution with seal. You can send the document in the form of a good quality scanned image (tiff, jpeg) or PDF format to my email (dlnsk at mail dot ru). I would be very grateful if you send the original by traditional mail to the address: Russia, 630126, Novosibirsk, Viljujskaja st. 28 (for Institution of Open Distance Education to Dmitry Pupinin). Compatibility of project with Moodle 2.0 will be implemented in the first place. Thanks a lot!",

I hope that a large group respond to this to show how useful your mod has been. To further enhance your cause, is there any way to tell how many times the mod has been downloaded or how many of the 50,794 currently active sites that have registered from 214 countries currently use the mod? You might also compile numbers for how many unique individuals have posted to this forum and the number of posts+replies to this forum to further augment the importance of this project! Good luck!

The missing reports has to do with problems with the usergetdate function in Moodle.  Based on the problem, the usergetdate function has been rewritten for recent versions of Moodle.  The problem appears in the attendance mod in the file moodle/mod/attforblock/report.php .  I fixed the offending lines so it will work correctly with both the original version of usergetdate and the current version (at least I believe it should--I haven't tested it extensively).  Here is the code to change if you want to give it a shot: Replace lines 82-86 (original code shown below): $now = time(); $current = $current == 0 ? $now : $current; list(,,,$wday, $sday, $smonth, $syear) = array_values(usergetdate($firstdate)); $wday = $wday == 0 ? 7 : $wday; //////////////////////////////////////////////////// Нужна проверка настройки календаря $startdate = make_timestamp($syear, $smonth, $sday-$wday+1); //GMT timestamp but for local midnight of monday with replacement code: $current = $current == 0 ? $now : $current; $tempdate = usergetdate($firstdate); $wday = $tempdate['wday']; $sday = $tempdate['mday']; $smonth = $tempdate['mon']; $syear = $tempdate['year']; Similarly, replace lines 132-134 (original code shown below): } elseif ($view === 'months') { list(,,,, $sday, $smonth, $syear) = array_values(usergetdate($current)); $where = \"courseid={$course->id} AND sessdate >= $course->startdate AND sessdate >= $current AND sessdate < \".make_timestamp($syear, $smonth+1, 1); with } elseif ($view === 'months') { $tempdate = usergetdate($current); $sday = $tempdate['mday']; $smonth = $tempdate['mon']; $syear = $tempdate['year']; $where = \"courseid={$course->id} AND sessdate >= $course->startdate AND sessdate >= $current AND sessdate < \".make_timestamp($syear, $smonth+1, 1);",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I have a problem with the reports in the Attendance Module. We need to view the weekly attendance, and our weeks here run from Monday to Friday. I've tried looking everywhere and I can't figure out why but attendance always starts the week from Thursday and goes to Wednesday. See this image: In Moodle our week starts on the default (Sunday) and the calendars display starting from Sunday. Everything else follows that setting, except Attendance. This makes retrieving the data from Attendance very painful for the poor girl who has to do it, and I don't understand  why this happens. When I \"add sessions\" to a class, the \"Session Days\" go from Sunday to Saturday. I thought maybe Attendance starts the week by whichever day the course is created on, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to force the reports to follow the Moodle setting? A second question, we added 'username' to the report display - which is \"Student Number\" in the image above - but there is no option to sort by this category. Is that possible to be done? Thanks so much, Phil. PS. this is my first ever post",

          "Text": "By groups and grouping in the course level you can't hide the course from students but can only hide activities/resources in that course. For making the activities invisible it should suffice that you tick the 'available for group members only' in each activity and make sure that all the students who should see the activity belong to some group in the course. Anyone who does not belong to at least one group won't see the activity. For that you don't need to set the groups mode in the activity or in the course settings and you don't need to use grouping. Having said all that, I think that what you really need is to set permission in the course category level. You will probably need to create new roles (e.g. 1st year, 2nd year etc.) assign these roles to students/teachers and set the access to courses in designated categories to designated roles. This way '1st year' students/teachers won't be able to see or access any course in other levels and you won't have to hide individual activities within the course. hth",

For my CTE and project-based courses, I use it to record a daily employability grade for each student. For my math and science classes I use it to record daily attendance, participation points, and behaviors all-in-one. Lots of flexibility. One gotcha: I like to use a clear \"description\" for my variables so the students can understand what I am marking - the \"My Settings\" form only allows you to input about 7 characters, so I have to make a quick trip to the MySQL database and add my final words. But this only needs to be done once setting up each course - all the reporting automatically shows the full description.",

          "Text": "Greetings, Peter! You are not the only one asking this question.  I think you might do some searching of the forums, but in particular look at activity tracking.  There are a lot of difficulties trying to figure out how much time people spent on a course.  The most ingenious solution I heard about was letting the screen dim after a few minutes of inactivity.  If the user clicked, the screen brightened and it was logged as continued activity.  If there was no response by the user, then it was logged as \"user inactive\".  But this kind of solution would not be available in the basic moodle install. You could try to do some statistical analysis of log data, but that can be difficult. It is much easier to track completions or transactions.  You can use activity logs to show you how many times a resource was opened or when an assignment was turned in.  You can show how much time a student took to complete a quiz. If you do find an answer, the rest of us will want to hear about it! atw",

Teachers can see attendance in student report all courses view for all courses, not just their courses. I think It would be better when they could see the attendance of a student just for their courses. 2. I translate the addon for Hungarian (I send it for the package, if I get an adress). I translate the statuses too (Present, Excused, Late, Absent), but on the settings page, there are the english ones. Ok, I can overwrite these, but it is easier for our teacher if they get the hungarian translation as default. I look at the code, the names (Afull, Efull, Pfull, Lfull) in the language file aren't in any php file. I think it would be very good too, if I can set the grades as default for our teachers.

I have been using it for a few months without any problems whatsoever, until today, when I tried to use reports Here is the problem: I have a course which is shared between 2 teachers. Each teacher teaches 2 groups each. Teacher 1 teaches groups A and B and Teacher 2 teaches groups C and D. Groupings and groups are set up and it shows in the drop down box when I take the attendance. So, when Teacher 1 take attendance for group A, he only sees students from group A. Groups A, B, C and D do not have lessons on the same day Group A has a lesson on Monday, group B has a lesson on Tuesday, group C has a lesson on Wednesday and group D has a lesson on Thrusday. So I set up 4 sessions per week. So far, no problem. But, when attendance is taken for members of a group (say, group A), others members (even though hidden - groups B, C and D) are still \"expected\" to be here by the attendance module, when really they're not supposed to be here (as they don't have a lesson). This means that the reports are all false e.g. in a normal week, any student from group A, will have an attendance score of 25% (1 lesson/4), as the attendance module \"thinks\" that he/she should have attended every session for this given week (4 different sessions for 4 groups). Is there any way to omit sessions that should not be taken by certain groups? Or can anybody think of a workaround? The only one I've thought about so far is having \"weeks\" rather than actual dates, but it's a little bit of a pain to setup.",

Maybe, when create a new attendance session it could have the option of assign it to 1..n groups exclusively? then, grades could consider not all sessions for all people, but only that sessions that had assigned to them?

We ran into this when teaching a course with 20 sections , and the Attendance was being taken by undergraduate interns; I think it took me a couple of days to figure out how to set that up, and it could have been so simple.",

When I mark my attendance, I do so for my group (class) however the problem is that other teachers cannot mark their attendance as the green button disappears. Now excuse my ignorance, but if the green 'take attendance' button remained an option after I had marked my group - could other teachers not jump in and mark their class too (on the same day). Is it possible to modify code etc to keep the 'take attendance' button as an option? If yes, how would I do this? Cheers",

If that's the case then you really don't need that attendance module instance. If you can figure out which course it is you could delete it's record from the mdl_attforblock table (after taking a backup first). Then you could also delete any sessions for that course in the mdl_attendance_sessions table and any logs for the deleted sessions in the mdl_attendance_log table. Maybe it's something simple like you added an attendance block without adding an attendance module. Cheers, Barry",

For instance, if students have selected choices made by moodle itself, I would like to link those choices for lab sessions directly into the sessions for attendance, and grade the labs using input boxes to represent the fields to calculate our attendance, directly by accumulation of marks. 3. If you can provide me a common code which I can directly incorporate for the selection of instructors (Teachers for eg.) directly for the course, I could incorporate these features myself. 4.

These work exactly like the 'Remarks' field at the moment, but I intend to change them into drop down lists where a status can be selected e.g. 'Due, Submitted, Approved' etc. It's quite easy to do. Just add your extra field to the attendance_logs table using PHPmyAdmin and Moodle's XMLDB editor. Then find the code for the 'Remark' field, copy it and change 'remark' to your new field. In a table there is always two parts: a header and data. You have to add your new field to both. - 4. I'm new to coding in Moodle myself. Using something like the Moodle IDE/Eclipse/xref.moodle.org helps to see where/how things are defined. Looking at code others have done can give you a clue of how to do what you want to do. Just find a page in Moodle where you see something similar to what you want, find the PHP file that displays that page (it's in the address bar) and try and find the elements you want to use. Then try and figure out how it works. The moodle/lib folder is full of functions that can do all sorts of complicated things very easily and there are some notes there on how to use it.

          "Text": "I am web developer and programmer myself. Writing SQL is very simple. But I do not have time to review too much material on all the moodle details and functions/tables, as I am a new instructor to moodle. Eg. which table has all info on the session attributes (teacher, title, duration, date etc). I only want to do some simple things. My idea is simple. 1. Create sessions for each lab class for a semester with specified date range. Associate an instructor from the users created for the course with a teaching role. I would like the drop-down list to reference the users with the teacher role only, so I dont need manual inputs. Which function from which library would be able to select all such users without me needing to spend too much time on writing SQL. Can I utilize get_record, how does that work. If you can guide me to that, then great. 2. When a session is created, it happens for a duration of about 12-15 weeks with a limited capacity for students, eg 30 students per class. I just want a simple script that would create all the weeks based on frequency (1 in my case) generated automatically on the date range, directly on the page for the respective session. So that would mean, for each particular session created, there is a standard number of weeks associate and a description by date for each week of 5 working days (Monday to friday). Eg Wk 3 (June 1-5, 2009). On the session page, I should be able to select the respective week (eg Week 1, Week 2 .... Week 12..etc), and then just update marks for the student for that week. 3. After the sessions are created, I would like the students to sign-up themselves for the sessions created. To do this, I need them to select exactly one of the sessions created, representing the whole 14 weeks. So that would mean integrating the choice function with the session ids from its respective table in the database, which I have no idea of. So I do not need to manually create choices for each of the session, but rather pick from the sessions created. 4. Students sign-up using these choices, and when I click on a session eg. Monday 9-11 in venue Lab-1, it should link to the sign-up completed by students using the choices in a grouping , so I do not get the whole list of all students 5. In my gradebook, the mark associated from labs is simply an accumulation of each week lab marks in the specified period. So I just need to add a column in the gradebook to have the sum of the weeks involved. That should be simple. 6. When the instructor for the lab logs in (depending on role), should only be able to view labs that is assigned to the instructor. So that would mean an a simple link for the instructor (e. My Labs to grade) and then he views all sessions relevant to the instructor and just updates those. 7. Perhaps it is better, if I get some idea of how can I have a page like create_semester_lab_weeks_for_grading.php, where I specify the common date range for each session, to automatically create the number of weeks associated in the range as fields in the respective attendance table. This would mean, just having a tab in the attendance setting tabs to create weekly range. and then just select that for the session being created. It is very important to have a system that associates each week with a date range eg. Week 1 (June 1-5) for the 5 working days only for eg. If you can assist me with some sample code to refernces the instructors for the course with a particular role, I can do this myself. My second aim is to be able to get a script to generate the number of weeks by frequency for the specified date, and have this consistent for each session. If I am able to get some idea on the first 2, the rest is simple. My core problem is I am not aware of which function to use to fetch records of a particular attribute from a table and just integrate that into the drop-down lists, like Javascript . If I am able to do this, the rest is simple. Anyway, I would be grateful if you are able to give me some feedback with code, to keep your module stable, as I will be using it for a very large number of students in a major institution. The features I intend to include, are really easy to implement and should not take me more than a day, if I can get some core code for the basics. Thanks a lot.",

The only way I know of how to restrict access to activities is by either not allowing a student to enroll in the course containing the activities or by assigning a 'Grouping' to each activity in a course. You can then assign Groups of students to the Grouping. Groups can have enrollment keys which you could probably hide in a quiz or something. Maybe a multiple choice quiz with only one attempt allowed. Then you hide the enrollment key for each Group in the feedback of each answer. For instance we 'schedule' our exams using Groups and Groupings without using the attendance module at all.",

The way we would prefer to work is this: 1. Create groups and let students sign up themseleves (done) 2. When we (our institution) use the attendance module, we would prefer to be able to select these groups as values for my Session, rather than manually create, since the sessions are already identified in those groups. 3. We need to have the teacher role/non-editing teachers be the ones that could be represented in the teacher field for the session, as our institution is specific to only have them edit. 4. Then, just have the weeks involved directly created as columns for each of the session pages based on the date range we specify for each of the groups session student sign up for. For eg. when create sesssion is clicked, we have an option to choose from existing groups to describe the session, next, we specify the Date Rnge and automatically columns of weeks appear in the session page, with the fields that we grade in as input boxes validated to a range. It is less effective for us to have so many sessions representing so many groups. Eg if there are 12-14 weeks per session, we end up create for 10 sessions that run over 12-14 weeks, about 120-140 sessions to represent all sessions for the whole semester. The grade we provide is just the sum of the values for each week for the total lab grading. Even if you could add the ability to reference the instructors from the teachers/non-editing teachers in your code as an option to select from, that would be great. The last bit is that when the instructor logs in to moodle, to find a link (such as My Labs To Grade) that would get ONLY the labs the logged in instructor teaches.

The extra fields I added don't control anything, they are purely there just as meta data. It's like the description field broken into smaller sections . To make my 'teachers' menu select teachers/non-editing teachers shouldn't be too difficult though. There is a function in locallib.php called get_teachers. You'd need to edit that function.

The fix is to make Moodle's usergetdate function (in lib/moodlelib.php) return the same parameter order as php's getdate function. This will require a change to the attendance module. Specifically, the report module will need to be modified to work with the changed usergetdate function. The suggestion from the bug report is to \"access the array using keys like this... $thisdate = usergetdate(time()); echo($thisdate ['mon'] ); Accessing usergetdate in this manner will work with any argument return order and thus work if people have the \"old\" version or new version of moodlelib.php.

Let's look at your requirements: - Create a category specific to a project - Create multiple courses under that category [project] - Subscribe certain project members to categoryI think this not so straightforward. Use Meta Courses and Child Courses for the above. If Moodle allowed you to enroll students into a Course category you would be better off (less work to do later when it comes to reporting). - Schedule the training plan Do this by creating sessions in Attendance module? - Take attendance for each of the planned course [If there is an option to capture the attendance if an only if someone has provided the feedback, it would be great] Do you mean you don't want them to appear on the list unless they've provided feedback to a specific feedback questionaire? If so, you would need to edit the attendances.php file and possibly the locallib.php file. You would also need to create a form of some sort and add database table/fields where you can store which feedback instance has to be completed for them to appear on the list. This whole part is a big job!",

You can add 'Category' field if you want. I don't have time to work on it and don't have any need for it. It should be simple. Maybe look at how I added 'groups' and work from there.

The right combination of filters (to report everything leave everything on 'All') A valid date range set in the filters Also on the advanced report page in the 'Status' filter section, if you select e.g. 'Course 2 - * Present' and 'Course 1' under the Course section you won't get any results. In other words if you drill down that far you have to take it one course at a time because each course has it's own set of statuses in the database (even though they look the same). I have just tried with two courses following all of the above and I get everything on my report (only the sessions where attendance has actually been taken), so I can't reproduce your problem. To find out which files to edit: Browse to the relevant page in your browser and then look in the address bar. The name of the main file will be there. I also use Eclipse to help me find out where functions were defined etc. Saves me lots of trouble. Cheers, Barry",

If the course start date is later than the session date this can cause problems. If you could figure out (by experimenting) what triggers certain courses to be listed and certain courses not listed in the dropdown box I'll be able to fix it. It's not giving me any problems. Maybe write down all the variables of your 20 courses e.g. course start date, session dates, attendance has been taken, students are enrolled, etc. Then see if your list makes sense. From the list then check which courses are not being displayed in the dropdown box. With this info you/I should be able to figure out what's going on. Cheers, Barry",

This solution converts the HTML table of the Report into a javascript Data Grid widget. This allows you to click in the grey area of any header to allow for column sorting without page refreshes. Another feature of this widget is having the ability to resize the columns (like in Excel) by hover, click, drag action. So with a bit of dragging you can hide sessions you don't want to see. To try it out unzip the attached file, replace your report.php with the one attached and paste the 'codebase' folder into your attforblock folder. Unfortunately this solution will not work on the attendances.php page because the values of the radio buttons contain student ids etc. This solution uses the dhtmlxgrid. Enjoy! Barry",

I see the table isn't rendered properly with the javascript widget because the 'userpic' column's header is empty. A quick fix for that is to change $table->head[] = ''; to $table->head[] = 'Pic'; Now the % column will appear but it still doesn't sort properly. It sorts by string rather than by integer. So % between 1 and 9 (& 100 %) will appear in strange places... To get it to sort properly with the dhtml grid is possible but might be bit complicated: See http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/kb/index.shtml?cat=search&page=1&q=11236&ssr=yes&s=grid%20sort%20html To do the sort the way you are thinking is probably not going to work unless you change the whole way the code works for this report: You might need to use the flexible_table class from tablelib.php instead of the print_table (from weblib.php). It has built in table sorting capabilities. There are probably other ways of doing it as well: Replacing the foreach php loops with sql as far as possible and building your sort string in the sql with extra sort paramaters for the % column. Lastly, the dhtmlxGrid can also be initialised from a database call rather than by transforming the already rendered html. have a look at the documentation, examples and knowledgebase at dthmlx.com if you want. It's quite straightforward and they have loads of examples. Cheers, Barry",

You might need to change the whole way the code works to add your sorting by status. To add a filter: I'm assuming your three attendance statuses are hardcoded. Are they numbers or text? I mean the statusid field values found in your attendance_log table Add a new paramater near the start of attendances.php e.g. $filter = optional_param('filter', 'unfiltered', PARAM_ALPHA); // if using text or",

Ideally I'm looking to be able to only show those of the selected status and be able to sort them by name etc. If you click on the arrows then you create a filter and I thought it would be best to have a remove filter button. I haven't gotten any of this working yet. Just so you know I have the statuses so that you will always have three but they will always have a different I.D., that is why I added the links in the following way: \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n $statuses = get_statuses($course->id);\n```\n \n```text\n $i = 4;\n```\n \n```text\n foreach($statuses as $st) {\n```\n \n```text\n $tabhead[] = \"<a href=\\\"\njavascript\n:select_all_in('TD', 'cell c{$i}', null);\\\"><u>$st->acronym</u></a><a href=\\\"attendances.php?id=$id&amp;sessionid=$sessionid&amp;filter=$st->id\\\"><img src=\\\"{$CFG->pixpath}/t/down.gif\\\"/></a>\";\n```\n \n```text\n $i++;\n```\n \n```text\n }\n```\n Is this O.K?? I tried adding in your lines of code but I seem to be having two problems, the first is that when I apply the filter the students not included turn red but are still there, is this what it is supposed to do? Then the radio buttons of the students not included change to absent (I have the system set up so that if a student doesn't have a status then it is automatically set to absent). Any idea how I should go about fixing these problems? Also I don't know much about filtering, I gather this is a php thing? Really new to all the moodle developing, I've been winging it so far but I'm starting to think there is a lot more to it! I have created a simple website using php and mysql for recording attendance before I knew about this plugin and I have a llot of java experience but thats as far as my experience goes.

I haven't got the time to go into too much depth here but it should be easy to use my code for your purpose, just trim off the bits that you don't need... www.w3schools.com is a good place to find info on all sorts of languages including sql . Filtering is an sql thing which you can program using php. e.g. in this line of code: $att = get_record('attendance_log', 'sessionid', $sessionid, 'studentid', $student->id, 'statusid', $filter); get_record is a Moodle function programmed in PHP. To find out how it works go to xref.moodle.org, hover over search in the top right and type in get_record in the function box, and click search. This will bring up the file and line where it is defined plus all the references in Moodle's Core code. Here is a snippet from it's definition (copied from xref.moodle.org): \n```text\n 391\n \n/**\n\n\n 392\n \n * Get a single record as an object\n\n\n 393\n \n *\n\n\n 394\n \n * @uses $CFG\n\n\n 395\n \n * @param string $table The table to select from.\n\n\n 396\n \n * @param string $field1 the first field to check (optional).\n\n\n 397\n \n * @param string $value1 the value field1 must have (requred if field1 is given, else optional).\n\n\n 398\n \n * @param string $field2 the second field to check (optional).\n\n\n 399\n \n * @param string $value2 the value field2 must have (requred if field2 is given, else optional).\n\n\n 400\n \n * @param string $field3 the third field to check (optional).\n\n\n 401\n \n * @param string $value3 the value field3 must have (requred if field3 is given, else optional).\n\n\n 402\n \n * @return mixed a fieldset object containing the first mathcing record, or false if none found.\n\n\n 403\n \n */\n\n\n 404\n function \nget_record\n(\n$table\n, \n$field1\n, \n$value1\n, \n$field2\n='', \n$value2\n='', \n$field3\n='', \n$value3\n='', \n$fields\n='*') {\n```\n I would recommend using an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans. You can then add a project containing all of Moodle's core files + add your code from this plugin. Then as you code you can highlight a variable / function to jump to it's definition in one easy click. That's really how you learn about how a specific PHP program (like Moodle) works: Jumping from function definition to function definition to learn how it is defined, then using search to see examples of how it is used.

Excel Report: To get the description in your Excel download you could make a small change to the export.php Change line 67 from $data->tabhead[] = userdate($sess->sessdate, get_string('strftimedmy', 'attforblock')); to $data->tabhead[] = userdate($sess->sessdate, get_string('strftimedmy', 'attforblock')) .' - '.$sess->description ; If you want to include the weekday e.g. '(Mon) (Tue)' you could use $data->tabhead[] = userdate($sess->sessdate, get_string(' strftimedmy w ', 'attforblock')).' - '.$sess->description; In this case you would need to edit your language file (mod/attforblock/lang/en/attforblock.php) Change $string['strftimedmyw'] = '%%d.%%m.%%y &nbsp; (%%a)'; to $string['strftimedmyw'] = '%%d.%%m.%%y(%%a)'; This is to get rid of the '&nbsp;' in your excel export. It will also change the format 7.09.09 (Mon) to 7.09.09(Mon) - it get's rid of the space before '(' from your Sessions list under the Sessions tab Cheers, Barry",

Which version are you using? If you have a different version you can either upgrade or comment out the 4/5 lines of each section of code that contain something like: count_records('attendance_sessions', 'courseid', $course->id, 'sessdate', Or, if you want it to check the start time + description for duplicates then do the following: 1. make sure you have the lates version 2. uncomment all the lines mentioned above (delete the // at the start of each line) 3. Change line 88 to: if(count_records('attendance_sessions', 'courseid', $course->id, 'sessdate', $sdate, 'description', $fromform->sdescription) > 0) { 4. Change line 148 to: $count = count_records('attendance_sessions','courseid', $course->id, 'sessdate', $newdate, 'description', $fromform->sdescription); I'm almost sure it would work (but haven't tested it myself).

I believe the problem lies in different versions of PHP returning different orders for the function usergetdate($firstdate) which is called in lines 84 and 133. The funny thing was, things were broken on my Mac \"test server \" and after exploration I changed the order of arguments in lines 84 and 133 and got it working (although I think I didn't have the order perfect to be honest). But then when we went to the production server, the order I had cobbled together was wrong and the order that came with the attendance module was correct. Thus my conclusion was that it wasn't technically a bug with the attendance module, but rather one with the usergetdate function. Someone with actual programming knowledge should be able to get to the root of this quickly I suspect. Richard",

          "Text": "I was thinking about this some more. Here is the definition of usergetdate from lib/moodlelib.php (quoted here from Moodle 1.9.6 although I verified that it is the same for Moodle 1.9.3): \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n usergetdate\n, \n=99\n \n \n = NULL;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n = \n;\n\n\n \n \n = get_user_timezone_offset\n;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n > 13\n \n \n \n \n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n= dst_offset_on\n, \n;\n\n\n \n \n= \nfloat\n \n HOURSECS\n;\n\n\n\n\n \n = \n, \n;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n,\n\n\n \n \n = \n, \n;\n\n\n\n\n \n \n;\n```\n Note that if the timezone is out of range (not between -13 and +13) then the function returns getdate ( $time ) otherwise it returns the specified order. The obvious question is, \"are these different?\" The answer is yes. Below is the argument return order for the two possible situations: Return order Valid Timezone Invalid Timezone 0 Seconds Seconds 1 Minutes Minutes 2 Hours Hours 3 Day of Month Day of Month 4 Month Number Day of Week 5 Year Month Number 6 Day of Week Year 7 Day of Year Day of Year 8 Name of Day Name of Day 9 Name of Month Name of Month Looking at the returns 4-6 are shuffled between the two. I have no idea why Moodle has chosen a different return order than the standard PHP return order, but I'm pretty sure that is the root problem. So, the likely solution to this problem is to update your time zones and choose a valid time zone. As a side note, I recently installed PHP from scratch and noted that on some systems PHP itself does not have a valid time zone set. I haven't tested to see if my problem was related to the time zone set in PHP or set in Moodle because I don't have the computer that had the problems anymore. So, if updating your Moodle time zones and choosing a valid one doesn't solve the problem, check your php.ini file for the default time zone (here's the link I used for info: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20090831101932728 )",

But then I decided to look at what students see. They don't see the session names! All they see for a description is the default \"Regular class session.\" The funny thing is, that I have been spending the time to type in the name for each session (and it takes quite a while because of waiting for a web page to reload after changing the name for each session--a nifty feature would be a table where you can change a large number at once before submitting--such as you can do with grades using Gradebook Plus v2) but I had never even looked at what the students saw.

Black for things working well. 1) Separate groups forced from course settings seem to work fine 2) Marking attendance worked fine. 3) I did get an error when I forced it to add a session for a date that had already been added. I got the error message that the session already existed, but the \"continue\" button gave me a 404 error. 4) If I added multiple sessions and then added the same sessions again, I got this error \"A required parameter (sdays) was missing\" and the continue button took me to the first page. 5) If I installed the activity but then hid it so that it did not report to the gradebook (set hidden items to not show in gradebook), everything worked fine. 6) I like this new red text when I forget to take attendance for some! That is different! 7) I changed the $string['nodescription'] = 'Regular class session'; from 'no description for this session'. My instructors wanted a generic description that worked for multiple session generation. They felt compelled to change the description each time when it said \"no description for this session\". In fact, I will attach the language files. I made quite a few changes, small things like capital letters. Use them or not, as you wish. 8) Sorts in the attendance taking screen seem to work properly. 9) Version for printing works 10) Student one-page report works 11) When on settings page, no changes made, click update and error appears: A required parameter (id) was missing. At this point the continue button takes you back to the front page. Same behavior if you restore defaults or try to change a setting and save. (see post above--this is confirmation) I am tired now! Let us know when you are ready for us to test the next version! atw",

At the bottom of the menu there is an option called \"Period\" and then a pulldown menu from 1~8 followed by \"week(s)\". I'm probably totally missing it but I can't figure out what that means?? I think I've got everything else and will try to get the files to your (or up here) by the end of the upcoming week (busy busy busy) but wanted to check on the \"Period\" option. Maybe I'll go to my 'playground' course and try changing the setting and see what I get. Jason **Edit** I just tried adding sessions and used different \"Period\" settings but still can't figure out what this setting changes.... If you can help me to understand what this setting is for, I'll do my best to write a clear explanation of it in the help file.",

Originally I wanted to integrate the two modules (attenance and ILP) but I don't think it's really necessary.

I'm thinking to include a single line on my new 'advanced report' page to display the attendance summary for each course if 'all courses' are selected in the filter.  If one course is selected only the summary for that course should be displayed. Maybe I could add another filter option: Report Style (Show all, Summary Only, Detail Only).  Then the page is only as cluttered as you want it to be. The 'this course' and 'all courses' pages seem to be more targeted to students and I think the current amount of info for students is probably sufficient. I could probably tweak the advanced report to give access to students so they could only see their own data. Filtering on an attendance status proved a bit more complicated than anticipated since each course has it's own set of variables.  So the drop down can potentially get quite big if you have attendance module instances across multiple courses. The latest code is here CONTRIB-1400 Anyway, here is a screenshot of what I managed to pull together for the UI so far.  The summary section in the report currently only shows the summary of the current course.",

Quite often teachers want to have a quick glance at a particular area of attendance (how many sick notes need cleared? What are the names of the students who were late today? etc...). I have thought of a few possible specific reports if you are interested. Would it be possible to allow a teacher to change the status of sick notes/make-up notes straight in the \"advanced report\" page (basically reproduce the drop down box which is available when the attendance is being taken) - or if that is not possible to provide a link to that particular sick note/make up note? e.g. if a note is \"due\" then the word \"due\" appears as a link?

Having the student/course names on the left rather than above will increase the width of the report which will also cause more scrolling (vertically if the columns are wrapped and horizontally if not wrapped). I have followed the layout similar to the user report in the gradebook (Student name > Detail). This will also enable each student's records to easily be printed separately by using page breaks. Some people tend to want to print things... E.g. if you had lots of sessions, how would you print a page from the Reports tab? If you need to, it should be easy to change the layout, I've commented the code quite a bit if you want to have a look. It's just a case of putting the course/student name in a column rather than on it's own. The key to making the lists shorter is to apply filters. I could make filters for 'Title' and 'Description' as well, maybe that would help. Another idea for a quick overview is to add a count of make up notes / sick notes due in the summary section. Then if you view summary only you can see who has a high count. I could add this to the report.php page as well.",

Users who can't use AJAX/ Javascript can use the links to get to the normal screen for updating these fields - I don't have time to add a non-Ajax method to the advanced report screen. I'm also making good progress on my barcode scanning module. The scanning bit is mostly ready, just the 'applying the rules' bit to still work on.

Note: You can see all groups across all courses so this is a bit like sitewide groups except it's the normal groups... Scanning Module: At the moment you can use this only to record the comings and goings of students so not very useful yet - still in Development, and currently only available to admin view. Each student needs a Custom Profile field containing a passcode (numeric) The student scans in/out by swiping a barcode containing their username followed by their passcode (or by typing it in). If successful the scan is logged as in/out The idea is to run scanlib.php to update attendance_log table based on the scans stored in attendance_scan_logs.",

Lets say, there is an attendance for each roll call class in the morning (this is where we check which students are absent for the day and generate a report so teachers can check their class absences against the roll call list for truants) where the roll is done using attendance. Each teacher then does the attendance in their course through the day. At the end of the day the attendance report for each class is compared against the roll call attendance and any inconsistencies are reported/highlighted. Students who are late for a set % of lessons are highlighted for checking and those marked absent in a class when the were present in roll call are marked as truant for follow up by the truant officer. This would be a great extension for this module for secondary schools don't you think?",

Then find this code in the attendances.php file: $table->data[$student->id][] = profile_display_fields($student->id); And change it to: $profilefields = get_records_select('user_info_data', 'userid='.$student->id, '', 'data'); foreach($profilefields as $field) { $table->data[$student->id][] = $field->data;} This solution will add a data in a column for each custom profile field you have. If you have more than the 2 custom fields and you only want to use two specific ones you'll need to go about it a bit differently: Something like: // this is for the first profile field. Change '1' to whatever datafield id corresponds to the field you want to use $profilefield1 = get_records_select('user_info_data', 'userid='.$student->id.\" AND fieldid='1'\", '', 'data'); foreach($profilefield1 as $field) { $table->data[$student->id][] = $field->data;} // this is for the first profile field.

          "Text": "Mark - Sorry to hear about the confusion you had with CVS and thank you sharing your experience. I think for most folks, the Modules and Plugins database provides the easiest way to get the latest version of CONTRIB code. For those experienced with CVS, you have to keep in mind which version you are getting as we have multiple branches. For that matter, even within the Modules and Plugins page you need to keep in mind which version you are getting. Moodle uses CVS branches for each major version of Moodle (1.8, 1.9, etc.). In theory, the code for the 1.9 version of the attendance package found in Modules and Plugins should be the same as the code found in the MOODLE_19_STABLE branch block and modules you mentioned in CVS. The link in Modules and Plugins points to the Moodle download server which should keep an up-to-date copy of whatever is in CVS. What may have happened in this case is that the maintainer applied a change to 1.9 version or the HEAD version and not back to the other. So at least in theory the code from M&P and CVS should be the same. It would be good if we could track down what happened here to understand what might cause others confusion and elliminate it. Thanks for your attentiveness to this. Do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or need anything. Peace - Anthony p.s. - A package is nothing more than a combination of various plugins (blocks and/or modules) and makes a convenient download of a single zip file possible. It just combines the code from CVS.",

          "Text": "Last summer I worked on a database driven website using php and mysql called ARD (Attendance and results database) . It is similar to this attendance plug-in except you can upload attendance that is recorded using a bar code scanner and student ID cards with a unique bar code. This summer I am attempting to migrate it into moodle, but I am still a student and I am still learning so iI am struggling a good bit. Instead of starting from scratch I plan to use the Attendance module and make the necessary changes. My first change is to have it so that there are only three variables in the settings, Absent, Present and Excused, You cannot add or delete any more and you can only hide the excused variable. I have completed this succesfully. The next step is to have Absent set as the default value when taking attendance, this I am finding rather difficult so if any one has any ideas I would really apppriciate the help. I have tried playing with attendances.php and messing with the lines foreach($statuses as $st) { @$table->data[$student->id][] = '<input name=\"student'.$student->id.'\" type=\"radio\" value=\"'.$st->id.'\" '.($st->id == $att->statusid ? 'checked' : '').'>'; but no joy so far",

This should already be in your module as students can have common names and need unique ids to separate them. - decimals places for grades. The way our grading system works is like this. I developed it myself using modules and modifying them, but minor things I mentioned remains. a) students select a group to attend (the group automatically has the session details, so we dont need to create individual session, but 12-14sessions as we have that many weeks. To update student grades for attendance we just toggle between different groups. b) we have labs/classes where there raw mark for attendance can be a decimal based on our criteria. its not exactly an integer. we have max scores eg 5 and least 0.And we can range the scores 3.5, 4, etc as our attendance criteria is based also on student response in labs to questions Finally, even with radios the tool is useful, so long as we have decimals to grade. The acronym field size should be more than just 2, maybe about 4-5. If you are able to give me ideas on how to do the decimal bit, because I need to change the xml file, it would be great. I can work with PHPMYAdmin, but it defeats the purpose of standardizing the module. As for the future, this tool is our future. I only need this minor change of adding username and decimal place grading. That's it. I have already been able to change the field size in the database , and also change the field size in php code, but you seem to have some rule that prevents adding the variables to the database. It really is a small request if you have time. It only makes your tool better and more credibility to your work, which does still have many limitations. There is no purpose of having many days of the week to grade, when the groups exist to represent them, and student sign up for those days. Having text box is the same functionality as using range of values in radios. That is why, when creating variable, its better for the user to choose whether check box or radio or text, and leave the values in the value as the max value to be obeyed. But that is just my opinion.",

Anyone using the interface, will only enter integers depending on how they feel. Anyway, how does the code change in your PHP pages if the data is changed to decimals and field sizes changed. The grade activity uses the grade interface, which does not suit our purpose of lab grading.  It is the same as the attendance except we can have decimals.

I have used it good effect, but I need some assistance to change the same interface for only some small things. This will make it COMPLETELY functional to our institutions requirements. See attached. They deal with the manage.php and sessions.php pages. I also want to change the Variable from radio buttons to input boxes. When creating My Variables, it should be possible to be able to have input boxes instead of radio buttions to represent 'P', 'A' etc. These are simple things that will add 100% functionality to our requirements.

          "Text": "Our system works differently. We can already create groups of sessions and describe attributes such as Day/Time/Venue for a lab directly in the self-group selection tool. So this attendance module is not needed to do that anymore. The module is used to generate weeks to grade, and the accumulation of the week scores appears in the grade book. To grade for a particular group we just switch to the group. We dont need to specify information such as duration etc, its useless. The MOST important bit is to convert that radio button into an input text box where figures can be entered rather than as buttons. If my variables page can have a field Input Type with options check box/radio/text box, and have that integrated with attendance.php so that when taking attendance, those variable fields appear as those types. Hopefully there is a validation feature already there so that values outside min/max cannot be entered into a text box. I implemented the other features myself even before you posted. Actually they are simpler than I thought. But since everything is dynamically generated, its difficult to track how to change the type to text box and have the user enter values and grading happen as normal with entered values in the range.  It would be great if a field called 'Input Type' is created in 'My Variables' and then it creates attendance taking as anyone would please. I believe that would be great to any institution that prefers whether to enter values (because there are different grading criteria depending on institution) Thanks for the input and hopefully I get to change the radio button types.",

This allows you to have several sessions during one day (one session every 5 minutes if you wanted to!) I have also added a \"Description\" facility to the \"Add multiple sessions\" as I needed it. So I can now create several sessions with the same name e.g. Year 13 Computer studies, and it will appear automatically for all these sessions.",

I have the same problem with the gradebook, when there are too many items, they just go off screen. I've worked out a \"hack\" for the gradebook that only works in IE but would probably be applicable to the attendance module as well (I think). Basically, it displays the headings (names of assignments) vertically rather than horizontally, thus saving some screen space. I would think it is possible to add the time on the individual reports. I will definitely look into it some time this week. I'll post the files here when I'm done with it. Cheers, Fred",

I actually reported it in the tracker a couple of months ago. I have noticed that it happens when you create sessions that take place \"in the past\" e.g. adding a session for the 6th October when it is the 7th in real life. Not sure whether this makes sense All I know, is that when you try to download the data to Excel or something like this, all sessions should appear just fine. This issue has even sorted itself out for some of my attendances???? @Barry, I've looked into the DST issue further and found out that the timezone is set in your php.ini file. I haven't had the issue that you have as I live in an area which does not use DST. I have tried to add a function which would force the attendance module to not use DST but I have failed so far. If you are interested, I tried to use this function http://th.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php Would you have any idea how to use it? I'll keep looking into it. Cheers, Fred",

I've been thinking about the sessions that go off the page and thought maybe the layout of the report should be changed i.e. instead of expanding horizontally it should expand vertically in the same way as the layout of the individual student reports. Maybe use a drop down list somewhere to easily narrow it down to one student's records. I suppose it's more of a problem for schools (like ours) where the attendance is taken by one central officer for all students in all classes/courses as apposed to tutors only taking attendance in their own course as in a university. I also think if you view the report as \"All taken\" and you've taken more than 256 that it would not work in Excel (which only has 256 columns). I'll be playing around to see what I can come with.

I only made some changes to allow multiple sessions per day. So the Javascript that allows you to select all present students is the work of Dimtry Pupinin, creator of the block (sorry if I didn't spell your name properly). To answer your question about automatic attendance, I heard of people being able to link their SIS with the block. I think it all depends on how attendance is presently recorded with your RFID / barcodes. If the data is saved as a UNIX timestamp (which it probably is), then you will be good to go as the database uses these. Thanks a lot for your feedback. I will repackage the files and make them available to everybody in this thread. Cheers, Fred",

          "Text": "Note: This message may appear in multiple forum threads, as I hope it will be of interest to many. Fellow community members, I understand that a Moodle module for attendance is now in late stages of development / testing phases. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a Moodle solution that Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) has developed. For the past 2 academic years MMU Department of Computing and Mathematics (DoCM) has been utilising the Moodle quiz module to monitor the attendance of students known as the Student Monitoring System (SMS). MMU staff understand the need for an attendance monitoring system in order to protect the best interests of the student; not only to ensure the best academic performance possible, but also the pastoral care of students who have for instance, recently moved away from the parental home for the first time. Attempts at MMU for paper registration systems and in-house developed electronic solutions have failed to engage staff due to the commitment required to enter data manually from the capture sheet, nor the student body as it does not offer them any added value. The quiz module has been used in DoCM by setting 2 Moodle quizzes for each day of the academic calendar; AM and PM. The quizzes are Subnet IP restricted, so students must be within the department network range to be able to respond to a quiz. As teaching from within the department is mostly “hands-on” there is no issue of time required for a student to log onto Moodle to respond to the sessions quiz. Students are only expected to respond to 7 quizzes per week, of the possible 10 (Monday - Friday, AM/PM) to show their commitment to the course. In exchange for students engaging in the quizzes, within the feedback of the Moodle quiz a link to the forums is shown. Though like virtually all university courses a forum has been available for many years, since the beginning of this experiment there has been an increase in forum posts of 50 fold, creating a community spirit within each year group. Further to this, students understand the requirement for the University to monitor their attendance and when asked, most students will report that the system shows that the University care about their well being as well as their education.",

We take attendance in classrooms where students access the course information during the session period. I have made an improvement on your module to take a semi-automatic attendance. I have added a “filter students by session access” button (it is really a link) that removes students that don´t have made any click at the course during the session period. If the filter is active, then a new column shows information about student´s accesses during session period. The information that this new column shows is: 1. The IP from where the student access. IPs may appear with one “R” saying that this IP was used by more than one student. 2. The session period is showed as a string of characters; a “*” says that some click was made and “-“ says that there was not any click. 3. The total number of clicks. I have made another improvement. During a week, we have several sessions and a student must go only to one session per week. Every student is member of a group and every group has an assigned session. If the teacher makes a mistake in taking attendance a student of other group, then he needs to remove it. In order to remove student’s attendance of a session, I have added a new column with radio buttons to select this action.",

So now what we want that teacher put all the attendance into moodle so taht when ever student can see his/her attendance so for that we want manual attendance system. we have seen the latest attendance module it is very good no doubt but it is for only the teacher when the students are online then only they can take the attendance but in our case students use the Moodle after the class or when they are at home so we want manual system where teacher can click on take attendance and he/she can see the list of all the students listed into his/her course and then he mark attendance like in yours.",

          "Text": "Hello, first of all, thank you for allowing us to have a nice preview and test the new version of this fantastic module, and thanks for all the hard work. I have tried today's version of the package and have come to the following conclusions: I love the new forms, they're much easier to use I LOVE the fact that you can choose whether the attendance appears in the gradebook or not I love the fact that you can select more than 1 session at once, especially when you want to delete lots of sessions... When I enter a duration for a session, I get strange values e.g. if I input 1, I get 8 hours. It would be great if there was a \"day\" option for the report, allowing you to see only a report for a specific day There is an issue with Daylight Saving Time. If you enter multiple sessions until June for example, then it ends up being (+/-1 hour depending on your hemisphere) wrong as of the last Sunday of March onwards/Last Sunday of October onwards When I access the module from the block, the direct link we used to have does not work any longer (i.e. it doesn't take you directly to the exact session you need anymore) Smaller header (possibly vertical) would be needed for the reports, as there can now be lots of sessions in one week/month (and day when we get the option ) and it takes lots of horizontal screen space. Now, I tried to fix all the \"bugs\" from numbers 4 to 8 when I added multiple session capability to the module (not as nicely as you did though), and haven't been able to come up with a solution yet. Here are my findings anyway: 5: I'm sure it's quite easy to do and I found where to do it, but it just won't work when I do it . it seems as easy as adding an extra option in the drop down box (did that) and then get the code to return what you want (did not manage to do that) 6: this seems to be due to the fact that the last argument of mktime function is now deprecated. No way around it apparently... It is not a massive deal though 7: Once again, I know where the problem is, but I cannot do that as I'm not good enough with mktime. I don't know which value to input in the mktime function (I suspect I need to put zeros somewhere, but I don't know where) 8: I don't know how to change the CSS for this particular table only as it uses the \"make a table\" Moodle function. If we could have a \"one off\" table, I would be able to change the CSS pretty quickly and easily. Once again, thanks a lot for all your hard work Dmitry, I really appreciate it. Cheers, Fred",

          "Text": "Hi everybody- I'm a Moodle newbie but I am very impressed so far. I'm a firefighter with a large urban fire department, with a large MS Access training records database kept at the fire academy. My current job involves a ton of work just to keep this monster working, and I will move us over to Moodle, with a just little help. We (me and the academy's summer intern - a CS grad student, thankfully) have our basic setup running nicely on a windows box, with phpmyadmin, mrbs , and php acceleration added in. The intent is to begin with Moodle as a central record-keeping tool AND a repository for course presentation materials and handouts. Once it does that convincingly, and with less effort than what we have to do now, we'll expand into all the other features. So far, works GREAT. Our difficulty is this: the academy training right now is recorded in MS Access with three key fields: userid, courseid, and completion_date. The course duration varies from 23 weeks down to single day seminars. The thing to keep in mind is the focus on the completion date - the \"finish date\" which we use to build each FF's master training record and produce college-type transcripts . (We are also a credit-granting agency with a full-time registrar.) In terms of enrolling students, the six month courses and other \"longer\" courses work fine in Moodle as is. A student would only enroll in such a course once. The single-day training that we have is repetitive, though, and is scheduled in terms of firefighting units , not individual members/students. We know Engine 1 is coming for the drill, as scheduled, but the members working that day will be enrolled/recorded as trained only after they get here. A firefighter may come four times in a year for the same drill - \"Tactical Unconscious FF Removal\" or \"Self-Rescue Rope Refresher.\" Upon completion of the drill, a hand-written sign-in sheet goes to the data-entry person. Most firefighters and their officers will repeat at least one of the single-day drills during a two-year period. They are essentially re-taking a one-day class. We've looked at groups , restoring courses, etc. and haven't found a solution yet. (One particular drill/class is conducted 300 days a year, and most training is conducted at least once a month.) The solution we desire will let the data-entry person, who is swamped, enroll anyone off of her backlog pile, some of it more than a month old, as well as the current 'today' students. It will let specialty instructors build attendee lists for future multi-week classes that are offerred 4x a year. And, eventually, regular instructors in the classroom will sign in to Moodle and before starting their refresher training Powerpoints or printing their new handouts, they can go around the room and take names/enroll students right from the podium. In short, we need to enroll students in a course, then find and enroll them again in a new \"section\" of the same course next week or next month, and we need to back-fill 200,000+ training records across 20,000+ active/retired members within 400+ current/archive courses. We've been tempted to add a training_date to the role_ assignment table, then modify the assign.php/html files so when assigning the role 'student' for a course, the user will have to pick a 'section_complete_date.' (the date of training for one-day courses, and the \"finish date\" for multi-day or multi-week training.) As we say over the radio, \"Can anyone advise...?\"",

We would use it for sicknotes and 'make up notes' which we require for students who missed teaching sessions.

          "Text": "Hello, I just had a very strange problem occur with the attendance module. I am using the 2008627 version. My school does not use excused absences so our teachers don't use the \"E\" option in the attendance module. I downloaded attendance reports from 7 different classes two weeks ago in order to check attendance data in preparation for a test that we are giving. Everything looked normal at that time. The teachers were all using A & P (Absent and Present) to record their attendance. I just checked again today and suddenly everywhere that an A was used before has now turned into an E. I have no idea what caused this but it is just short of a disaster for us. In the Spring of this year I noticed that when a teacher goes in and changes the \"My variables\" for attendance settings in his/her course it sometimes causes the site wide defaults to be modified so I removed the capability to even see the \"Setting\" tab by modifying teacher permissions. Therefore I don't see how this sudden problem could be related to anything a teacher did but I'm not sure.... I now have a ton of attendance data that has been corrupted and I'm not sure what to do... Jason",

          "Text": "Dmitry, Thanks very much for such a fast response. Sorry, I didn't report a bug in the spring because I was swamped at the time and I couldn't really nail down exactly what the issue was. For the current issue, I forgot to mention one thing. The attendance module is set up for all courses (we have about 300) as follows: Present = 2 Absent = 0 Late =1 Excused = 0 When I noticed all the \"E\" on teachers attendance reports I looked at the settings and saw that Present and Absent both were set to a value of 2....This really has me perplexed because, as I mentioned in my first post, I have altered teacher permissions so they cannot modify the attendance settings. So, I can't figure out how they would have been changed. We did have some courses in the Spring that used only 2 possibilities for the attendance P or A and I removed the title for the other two settings in the attendance mod. So, when the teachers took attendance they saw 4 columns but only two had headings. At that time I did give one of the blank columns the value of 2 and the other 0. They would have been the A column and the E column. Anyway, so when I saw the P = 2, A = 2 this time I immediately went to the database and checked to see what the default setting was for A and was surprised to see it set to 2. I know it was 0 just two weeks ago because on the 20th of January I downloaded attendance reports for 7 classes (and still have them) and they were all in order (i.e. P was being given a score and A was being recorded as 0). I did change the default setting in the database back to 0. That way, as long as the teachers were judging by the letter (P = present A=Absent) the figures should be correct. Jason P.S. I am using Moodle 1.9.2+ Unfortunately all the courses contain sensitive student data so I cannot distribute them.",

I just opened a backup of my database from late December and I see that I had my defaults set as follows: P = P = Present = 2 A = P = Present = 2 L = L = Late = 1 E = A = Absent = 0 I can now vaguely remember changing the defaults because we don't use E. It seems like, for some reason, my defaults got erased so in all instances where teachers had entered an A (which was assigned to the graded item E) all of the grades change to E. Not sure what made this happen though... I see that the version currently under development allows for adding additional grade settings. Can you also reduce the number of settings from 4 to 3. That is really what I need and what I was trying to accomplish with the defaults listed here. Seems that it got me in trouble though. Jason",

With the defaults that I was using E was not an option so the only thing that I can think of is that my defaults got erased or reset to the original defaults... Even if I change the defaults, the underlying lettering scheme still remains P, A, L, E right? So if I change them to something like this for example: P = P = 2 A = P = 2 L = L = 1 E = A = 0 If my defaults get reset, a teacher who used A might have his/her record changed to an E. When I noticed the problem today I saw P = P = 2 A = A = 2 L = L = 1 E = E = 0 So it seems that the lettering had returned to the defaults but the values had remained the same. It seems like when we had a problem with this in the Spring that is was related to the language the teachers had set in their profile. In that case (in the Spring) we had a teacher log in to take attendance and she had her language profile set to Japanese and after she took attendance all the attendance records site wide were in Japanese.

When I click on the settings tab (just clicking on the tab) the default text titles for each of the settings get reset to the original settings.

How calculate percents if teacher has deleted some status? I want to use hiding for this situation but I think this not solve the problem... I see one way: don't delete statuses at all, just hide them (like with users in Moodle) and save for each user teacher's choice and list of all statuses used in this time... What do you think?

But, also we would like to allow parents to have a view of their children's attendance.  E.g. after we created the parent role (it is well documented in moodle), they can check their children's grades as follow: 1.- As a \"parent\", when I click on a \"child\", I must immediately select a course at the Profile tab (which is the default tab). 2.- Select the Activity reports tab 3.- Click on Grade sub-heading 4.- then I see my child's grade. I've tried following same procedure for attendance, but when I perform step 3 (click on \"attendance\" instead of \"Grade\" sub-heading), attendance records are wrongly displayed. Actually, a message is shown saying.... \" there is not attendance records for this user\" (looks like it lookups for parent's records instead of the ones for the student). I am not a php programmer (just implementor). Does anyone know how I could accomplish that? Or is there other way to get same results? For security reason, granting allow for \"attendance report\" to the parent role is not an option since it displays all the students records for the specific course.

          "Text": "Hi, At our Bible College (WHBTC) in Salford (UK) we run up to 8 sessions a day (morning + evening) for 3 different groups (Year 1 Part/Full time & Year 2 Full time) We would like students to use a scanning system (Barcodes or something else) so we can track their attendance.  They should just scan in in the morning and scan out in the afternoon.  (Not in and out for each session) We want the system to automatically recognise which student was late/absent/left early from which session etc. This would free any admin staff from having to log the students attendance manually. (We have different rules for international students (stricter) and we have a very strict attendance/make up policy - more below) We already have a simple version of this idea working on a MS Access Database but would like to develop a Moodle version so that students can view their attendance directly on the web. Our attendance policy tries to discourage absentism by forcing students to buy CDs/Mp3s of missed sessions hand in make up notes. We want our module to selectively charge students for Mp3 downloads at different prices depending on whether or not they missed the session. Furthermore the system should be able to keep track of the submission, approval/rejection of make up notes and be able to do reporting at any level. Any ideas/suggestions would be appreciated.

A: Gradebook display how much points student had in this course in comparison with how much he could have. Pages of block display percent of attendance. For example, if student for presence had 3 points and for absence had 1 point then he can't have 0% in Gradebook even though he was absent always, but on block pages in this situation he will have exactly 0%.

Now go into the block_attendance folder you downloaded--->click on blocks----> and now just upload the folder titled attendance to the block folder of your Moodle install. It should run fine as soon as you go into admin. Deon Dmitry, Going through it I have a few bugs. When not adding a session right away and just clicking on reports it gives me a URL not found error with block/attendance/add.php& whatever the course id is. The other bug of not taking any attendance and going into report is still present from your previous version of Warning : Division by zero in D:\\..\\..\\blocks\\attendance\\lib.php on line 211 Thats all I can see right now. Thanks for all your work. I wish I could fix these for you. Deon",

The Attendance module and attforblock block seem to otherwise work fine. I added the Attendance block to my demo class already populated with students and assignments. I setup Attendance with past, present, and future dates. I took attendance. Looking at the My SQL data tables, the 3 tables for the attendance module are all populated with data, however, the table for attforblock does not have any data - normal or weird? I did install Michael Penny's gradebook 1.5 plus and this works great. My understanding is that this is only a \"shell\" on top of Moodle's standard gradebook to make entering grades easier and doesn't actually modify Moodle's standard gradebook tables. How should the attendance block report grades? Do you need to setup a special category? (I added an \"Attendance\" category but no attendance was reported.) Any ideas for troubleshooting would be helpful and appreciated! Thanks.",

When trying to create an attendance record for a period of 2 weeks, only entries for one week are being created. I'm selecting 2 weeks from the drop down menu, but it doesn't make any difference. 2. The multiple entries are not showing a subject, it means I have to go into each individual day and type in the subject name.  I tried using the field in the single day section to see if that would make any difference but it didn't work. Are these two bugs or is it me? Thanks John Moon",

The big issue is that we also have a number of training courses that are single-day refreshers - Tactical Refresher, Auto Extrication Referesher, etc. Every day that training happens we have firefighting units rolling through the gate to our academy to train on these refresher-type courses. These units are selected based on their unit training history. The staffing on these units is handled elsewhere, and typically there are last-minute changes and manpower swaps. We only discover who is being trained today AFTER they arrive at training. The goal is thus to have all active members (students) enrolled in every refresher course automatically (done) and then take attendance daily. The problem is, our attendance list for the day is thousands of names long for each course. Additionally, we have dozens of duplicates on first name/last name. We truly need help with this. Is there any way to simplify this? We really like the functionality/behavior of the role assignment screens, where we search for potential users then select and enroll them in a course. We have even done a (minor) hack where we can find these users by name OR by unit, and are very satisfied with that enhanced usability . We have taken the good advice however to not hack up the assign.php/assign.html files any further, as we risk breaking things in plenty of other places. Can anyone direct us to a person or place who can help us resolve this issue through using the attendance module?",

I haven't used groups much in my classes, but it seems to me that attendance did support groups. I think they were coded by ID number, not whatever string you assigned to name the group, but if you wrote down the ID number when you created the group, you could figure it out. And it might have been fixed by now! That is the best advice I can give you at this time. The other option would be to hire a developer. I am not sure if you want to go that route or not!",

          "Text": "Dmitry, Thanks for your kind words. I am looking at export.php and wondering if there is a way that it could be modified to allow me to export the attendance records for multiple courses at one time? The global attendance records block that I saw discussed a month or so ago would be nice if it could be configured to view certain courses or categories but in the absence of that option, the ability to export multiple courses at one time would be very helpful. For example, we have a category of courses called \"Supplementary Courses\". The attendance policy for these courses is fairly strict so we have teachers recording their attendance on our Moodle site. We check the attendance records by exporting the attendance records for these courses. It takes a while to get all of the records exported and aggregated though... If we could specify which courses we want to export (multiple courses) and export them all at once it would really speed things up for us. Initially if I knew which part of the export.php file to modify I could do it semi-manually using the script. Later, if it could be written so the configuration could be done via the browser, it would be even easier to use and easier to allow others to use. This is something that would really help us....not sure if others would use a function like this or not...? Jason",

All appeared to go ok, however when I come to add this as an activity to a course, it opens the page to give it a title. Then when I click any button to save, all it does is produce a blank white page. If I go back, nothing has been added the course and the activity cant be found. Im assuming that someone else must have had this issue, or knows how it can be resolved? Many thanks for your help.",

I poked around in the database forever trying to figure out why 'attendance' was not showing up as a graded event in his gradebook and finally got it to show by changing the grade for his \"P\" setting that he wasn't using to a numeric value (greater than 0).

So.....here it is again: I really need to be able to import a preset attendance 'activity' but cannot. When I click on import from within a course and navigate to a course that has attendance already setup, attendance does not show up in the list of activities . Without this capability I cannot create a template attendance setup which is going to make it extremely difficult to impossible to use the attendance module program-wide at our university. Does anyone know what needs to be done to make the attendance 'activity' importable into another course? Jason",

What I meant by template was that I would set up a course that is just used to export from. Then I would set up, in that course, attendance dates that correspond with our academic calendar (e.g. class sessions on M/Th or T/Fr or W/Sat and eliminate attendance dates for holidays etc.) Then I would import that attendance setup into all applicable courses. I would need 3 templates because of the three different class schedules we have (M/Th, T/Fr, W/Sat). I've been pointed to another option for now which is to use MySQL to create the module and attendance settings. (discussion starts here ) I guess I'm going to experiment with that for now as I need to have everything setup by early April and it doesn't look like there are any other options right now Thanks Jason",

We're using Moodle 1.8.4+ currently and will be upgrading to 1.9 when the stable build is released. For each of the subjects (courses) taught, there are a number of classes (groups). We have a tutor (non-editing teacher) in each of the classes (groups). What we want is to have the tutor add new sessions and take attendance for them with students in their class (group). These sessions are not to be viewable by tutors (non-editing teachers) of other classes (groups). This is possible if we create an instance of an Attendance activity for each class and assign them individually to each of the classes (groups) in Moodle 1.9, however, this not the most efficient method and generation of reports will be a problem as the subject head (editing teacher) will have to run the report multiple times for multiple instances of Attendance individually when he/she wants the results of all attendances. Is it thus possible to have the Attendance activity more group-oriented?",

We plan to ask each teacher to either take attendance 'online' with a computer in their classes or record attendance on a piece of paper (we supply a standard form) and enter the records into the computer later that day or a minimum of once a week. (from the teachers lounge or from home) The big problem for me right now is that I cannot 'import' an attendance activity meaning that, if I want to set things up for my institution, I will have to hand create each course (several hundred!) and then hand generate the attendance dates for each course!! I could ask teachers to do this but we have many teachers that are not yet that familiar with Moodle and it would surely set us up for lots of chaos.

          "Text": "Carina, First, am I correct in assuming that you have installed the Attendance package (block and module)? It is found here or from the Modules and Plugins page. With Dimitry's attendance package installed you should be able to take attendance for a class. Unless you have also installed the ' auto attendance ' option, taking attendance is always 'manual' meaning that a teacher, or someone, has to click on the attendance session for each day and then click on the correct item (present, late, absent etc.) for each student. If you want to allow a clerk to take attendance you could create an entirely new role and allow that person to take attendance or you could use non-editing teacher as you have mentioned. I guess what I am not clear about is whether or not you have the basic attendance package installed and functioning properly? From the looks of the photo you have attached I guess you do have it working.... So you just want to create a new role so someone other than the teacher can take attendance? Is that correct? Jason",

The attendance clerk role has to be able to get into any course on the system in order to mark attendance.

How you create a role that can do that is beyond me! But is probably needed in this case! atw",

The version file does not list a version number, so I don't know what version of this module I have. I do know something is not right about it. All I actually have is an attendance chart. I can manually click on a few options (OK, substituted, excused, - ) but these don't mean anything as they are out of context . According to the language file, there seems to be something about automatic attendance and a lot of other really cool things that seem to be used to configure the module. Unfortunately, I have nothing 'user-side' to configure or update. All I have is ... a chart. I guess what I'm trying to say is something is missing. I have read this entire forum, all the way back to 2004, and honestly, I can't make heads or tails of what is actually available and working. Could someone please direct me to a working version of the Attendance Module (with everything it's supposed to have i.e. blocks, updates, bug fixes, whatever else) for Moodle 1.7 and would someone PLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE be so kind as to put the latest version on the Modules and Plugins page?

See what they are on a module that works and then try to apply the same rights to the attendance folder/files.

Administrators need to have access to students profiles and see which students have cause any problems like classroom disruption and what were the comments posted and dated to respective teachers to students profile.  ADministrators also will need to have access to teachers profile and see the list of students with discipline comments and we want the teacher profile to show each student with their respective notes as a group.  Finally we need intervention by the dean and counselors and we want them to add comments and resolutions as well.  We want all staff to have access to a single file per student and we need to limit the content based on the user.  Administrator will see all coments, and will have the option to hide comments that are consider private and that teachers or counselors do not need to see.  Teachers and counselors will be able to see and edit their own comments but will be able to also read allowed comments after prioncipal and deans approval.

This supported my rubric that combined behavior, preperation, and attendence. However I am php newbie, the hack took me a lot of time, and it quickly became obsolete with the important updates to the attendence module.\n\nSince then, I reworked the existing 4 ratings to include a coarse measure of behavior and attendence, on a 0 - 3 point scale.\n\nI believe an enhanced attendence module could serve both purposes.",

          "Text": "We have experienced a problem with the comment jumping around to a different user with the new module and I was writing to notify Dmitry but to warn people what is happening and how to fix it. With the new system when registration is taken for a course you now have to choose absent or present rather than students all being marked as absent. We have a register which includes teachers and some courses have 3 or 4 teachers on them. When one teachers takes the register they have not been marking the others present or absent, just leaving it blank. What this has been doing is making the comment in the comment box move to a different student when the OK button is pressed. This then logs the comment against another student. For example: Student S was absent because of a dentist appointment.  The comment \"Dentist\" was written in and OK'd and saved.  Because Teacher A did not have any mark (Present or Absent) recorded against her the comment actually jumped into Student T, who was present.  On a second viewing of the attendance for that session Student S was absent but no comment and Student T was present but comment was at the dentist. The way to fix it is to ensure all students and teachers are marked Present or Absent.  I know it should be that way but if you forget or don't bother you will get data errors. Dmitry, I don't know if you can look at this.  I am not sure what solution would be easiest to implement. Many thanks, Duncan Edwards",

Still when I call the summary, the program still shows the original ones. My students are upset because I changed the second entry A(bsent) to a B(uono)=good. So they seem to get an absence while they should have a good mark (the final score is correctly computed with the new values, though). It is possible to show the updated labels in the summary too? 2)How do I use cvs to update my installation? I tried : cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net:/contrib/block_attendance login but I got: cvs login: authorization failed: server moodle.cvs.sourceforge.net rejected access to /contrib/block_attendance for user anonymous thanks, Piersante",

I got on the Moodle.org site and found newer versions that claim to support the grade book.  I first upgraded to v1.0.7 and got several errors so I then tried an older version (v1.0.3) and wasn't able to delete all my old sessions.  When I tried to revert to my original version (sorry I'm not even sure what version it was) I got a ton of errors.  In a panic I deleted everything that has to do with Attendance module/block from my admin area and then tried to reinstall.  Now when I visit my admin area and click on blocks my instance of Moodle does not even acknowledge that I have installed the attendance block I can check via  my cPannel and verify that it is there but Moodle seems to be totally ignoring it now......  What have I done Any ideas?

I changed the attendance codes, but for some reason the change was non activated until after I did a cvs refresh. Unfortunately, that is a group activity, with different teachers recording group attendance in different days. So now I have attendances recorded with different codes in the same session I will need to correct them manually, with a lot of guessing. It would be much easier to correct the table with a simple script, if it contained a timestamp! cheers Piersante",

Is there a way to have attendance for each group or do I need to replicate the course? I tried adding attendance for each of the two days to the single attendance block, and then just taking attendance for each group on their respective days, however both days show up when I view the report and it likewise affects the students attendance grade. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks kindly, Julian.",

It's only a small group (33 students in total) so it's too bad to do, but it would be a bit tedious for a larger group. What is interesting is that there is active competition for the grades, and people are checking their attendance regularly (these are post-grads) Hope this helps",

Each instructor can customize his/her course attendance as per their individual policies. These settings will override the global settings for the attendance block. -Customized weighting is now available for excused, absent and late options. -Report tab, intially designed by Dimitry, has been fixed with large modifications.

The problem is that we have 10 day cycle (over 2 weeks- Week1 = Mon to Fri and Week2 = Monday to Friday), with weekends between. Is there any way to double the number of weeks, so that a lessons can be selected over 2 weeks rather than the current 1 week. Quick Note: (Not to much thaught about this idea) For wider use, on first setup of each instance of the block, let the user select the number of lessons over a flexable period : Not related to a date, or date added at the point the attendance is done - what issues would this cause?

As a teacher I can just say I would like to either be able to set point values for each denotation (present, tardy, absent, excused) and then that could be added together and entered under something called attendance in the gradebook.  The other nice way for teacher controlling point total clodely would be to have to option to base it on the student's attendance percentage and they get that much of how ever many points I say attendance is worth.  So if I say attendance is 50 points and you have an 80% attendance rate you get a 40 in the gradebook.  Either way would be grand even if not both.

My current non-moodle system uses 15 different marks, all with different point values that are calculated into a student's total grade: A (absent, 0 points), AE (absent excused, 4 points), SR (school related absence excused, 4 points) and so forth... I don't wish to bore you! The addsession.php page is good: it allows you to customize the acronym, description, and percentage. All I need is to be able to specify the number of different marks. Right now, the number of marks is fixed at 4. I believe this tweak would also meet Jason's needs, and most other teachers. Then I would just convert my point system to the existing percentage system - no big deal.",

The client was generous enough to allow us to\nrelease their customizations back to the Moodle.org community. Since the attendance module is no longer maintained, we approached it\ndifferently. We wanted to design something that wouldn't require an\nin-depth integration with Moodle but would be easy enough if required in the long run.\nA block seemed like the obvious way. =) PURPOSE The attendance block is designed to allow instructors of a course keep an attendance log of the students in their courses. The instructor will setup the frequency of his classes (# of days per week & length of course) and the attendance block is ready for use. To take attendance, the instructor clicks on the \"Update Attendance\" button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course, along with 4 options: Present, Absent, Late & Excused, with a Remarks textbox. Instructors can download the attendance for their course in Excel format or text format. Only the instructor can update the attendance data in the block. However, a student gets to see his attendance record as a block. Please note that the email block is still in development .\nIt is not the final release. This release is for testing purposes. It\nis being released under the terms of the General Public License. Please\nlet me know if you run into any bugs or problems. I would greatly\nappreciate it. Lastly, enjoy. Developing this block was a lot of fun for my development team. I hope you enjoy using it too.",

If you have any other ideas or require a customization you haven't seen  yet, I'll be more then glad to sit down and discuss them. The beauty of such customizations is that if 1 person requires it, chances are that others may want that feature too; a customization almost never goes to waste =) Thanks! -Waleed",

I used it and like it, but once again I am an admin.  I have to add this to each teacher's courses for it to work.  That's a pain.  Can it be modified so any teacher can set this up on their own?  Without that option to leave it in the teachers hand it is difficult from an admin standpoint. Lastly, I was going to second some statistics options if possible.  Whether its a percentage of on time versus late and absents, or the ability to somehow convert the attendance into a gradebook entry and give them points for being on time it would be nice to have some method to easily see how they are doing numerically.  The other attendance module had this originally before it broke, and it doesn't need to be the same as that.  Just some percentage or scoring for quick reference or use in grading (I would just use the percentage ontime as an assignment I entered myself at the end of the grading period). Thanks again for the block, and for listening as some of us suggest some features and ask some questions.  Either way, if you fix the teacher vs. admin issue I will love you the other stuff's just wishes. mrjohnston",

          "Text": "Alright I have tested this quite a bit. I am just going to first say it installed fine the second time, all tables present. Next I just want to say the usability issues I had that you MAY want to consider depending on your client. I think they are pretty general though. First it only allows a bulk attendance add (where I select days of the week between two dates) once. Then you have to add day by day. If a teacher decides to use the course as a year long instead of as a semester, or just adds the dates to play with it, they then have to add the future dates one by one for the rest of the year. If possible you should have both the bulk and single session add displayed at all times when settings is clicked. Just have separate submit buttons so each person can add sessions however is convenient regardless of its the first or 8th time they are adding sessions. A delete all sessions button would be nice too if someone screws up, that way they can easily start over from scratch. Maybe just at the bottom of the attendance tab (the one you get to by first clicking settings). I think this is really minor but I would either display last names then first names, or have it put last names first when you sort by last name. Every roster I have seen is last name, first name. I do not know if you client has it this way, but if they do it would be helpful for them likely to see it the same way their roster shows it. My other issues still stand as well. Teachers should be able to create sessions and manage them instead of just admins. Also teachers should have a stats tab under settings that basically shows a percentage like the scripts shows to students. Ideally teachers could select how many tardies and excused absences make an absent, say anywhere from 0 (do not count as absences at all) through 5 where each tardy or excused would be one-fifth of an absence). That way the script could be adjustable by the teacher to suit their needs and make sure it shows an accurate percentage to the teacher and students of their attendance. Even without the adjustability it would be highly beneficial to at least display the current percentages for each students on-time is a stats tab as I stated before teachers can then use this to determine an attendance grade, as well as it being an easy way to see each students attendance in general thourhgout the semester or year. Sorry to put so much stuff down, but you said it was under develepment so I figured I would test it out and try to give some input while I can from a teachers and admins perspective Thanks for the block and I hope something I said helps you and your client make the script fit the needs of students and teachers using it. mrjohnston",

I modified it into a homework block for offline checking homework if anyone wants it [attached file], it's pretty much the same thing but will install as a new block and can be used for homework checking (done, incomplete, not done, excused). I do have the problem that everyone else is having with a twist though: All my teachers can't do anything with it. It's like they are recognized as students without a student id so they don't show up in the block but will see it as a student will. BUT one of my teacher's can use it fine. He doesn't have any more rights to anything that the other's don't. I looked through the SQL tables and everything matches for all teachers. It's driving my up the wall trying to figure it out. If you can help that would be much appreciated. I am working on a Korean translation for both and will post the file here when it's done. Thanks again, Chris Patch",

If you have a session on Friday and another one Monday, the student is either there or is not there. Even if the class has, for example, lectures on Monday and labs on Friday, attendance is taken not per hours of session but per session itself. To change R - Retard you'll need to make changes in the following areas block_attendance.php in the lang dir line 36, 37. change to $string[' R '] = ' Retard '; $string['late'] = ' Retard '; index.php in the main folder line # 203. change to $late = get_attendance($user->id,$course->id,' R '); That should do the trick.

This means that students enrolled through automatic email are not visible in the attendance block and each teacher has to manually enrol the student from the teacher admin.This is an additional job to the teacher. 2. Also I see all the days of the semester in the attendance tab. Since, my course is scheduled only for four days (Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri) in a week, I need not see all the days in the semester in the take attendance page. It is too difficult for me to match the date and day in the attendance page for whole semester and delete the sessions one by one. It is better that the setting page may have additional details to fix the days in week and only the specified dates are visible in the attendance page. I understand the present format is done intentionally to enable the teacher to adjust the missed lecture day and compensate on some other day. In that case the day may also be made visible so that teacher can select and delete the unwanted sessions.",

Without you, none of this would have been possible. I appreciate the time and effort all of you have put into this. The error that was coming up (instructors unable to use the block, etc) was actually fixed by my team last week. However, we were unable to post the updated attendance block due to some technical difficulties. By the time we resolved our issues and looked up at moodle.org, I was very pleasantly surprised; the ingenious community of Moodle.org had taken the bug into its own hands and fixed it too, locating the exact place where the problem was occurring. Thanks to Lady800cc who took the time to answer some queries and provide solutions (all that documenting the code finally paid off, eh?). There are a lot of recommendations and feedbacks on the page here which I appreciate. Im going to take the next day or two to read over and write up responses to the peoples questions and see which direction our team is headed to with the attendance block. Ill post up a new release of the attendance block later on today/tomorrow in a new message to the forum, with responses to you folks.

When I mark an absent student as excused (for illness for example) this session should be excluded from the percentage attendance, but this is not happening.  You can see an example from the screenshot below.  The student has not been absent at all, and has been excused once in 6 lessons, so the attendance should be 5/5 = 100 %, but instead it is 5/6 = 83%! I'm sure that fixing this would be a fairly simple change to one line (touch wood!) but I'm hopeless at PHP and wonder if anyone could give me a pointer as to which line I need to change to fix this faulty arithmetic.

          "Text": "Hmmmmm - I'm think you missed the point. There is a valid question as to whether a student who was excused for one lesson out of  four (for example) should have their attendance calculated as 3/3 = 100% or 4/4 = 100%.  I think the first is more logical, but others may have different opinions on that. The second issue is whether the \"Attendance percent\" is intended to be a mere count of how many times the students has attended classes,  or whether it is some kind of qualitative score of their attendance.  I suppose there could be a preference setting for this but IMHO for most people a percentage (especially in this context ) implies a kind of assessment and therefore if that is not what was intended it should be changed (because it is misleading).  If the intention is to merely  document how many times the student has attended then a simple total would suffice (which is in fact already there as \" Number of days present \"). IMHO nothing needs to be coded into Moodle regarding what an \"excused absence\" (\"E\" in the attendance block) is - that can just be left up to the judgement of individual teachers.  I just gave one example, but what if a student fell sick and was rushed to hospital, would it be fair to penalize the student in that case? There are many different scenarios, and from the Moodle point of view it should be left up to the teacher to decide what he or she wishes to excuse and not to excuse. If a teacher wishes to never excuse anyone, then they would never mark a student as \"E\" and therefore the problem would never arise.  But if there is even just one occasion on which a teacher would excuse a student, then it would surely be wrong to penalize them vis-a-vis another student - because that is what \"excused\" means! Otherwise there would be no need to even make a distinction between \"Excused\" and \"Absent\". Anyway, this is just my opinion - what do others think? Tim.

As for how one calculates attendace, we took a basic approach to it. If they're not in class, then it's a count against them. The attendance block was to note how many times a student was in class, and if wasn't in class, then the official reason presented to the students. That's how our client wanted it done. At the same time, I understand what you're saying Tim. If a student is excused, then they are excused with a reason from their attendance being counted towards the final grade. However, if they missed class without an excuse, then it is an absent count against them. How a teacher handles excused absences and unexcused unabsences is their choice. We can make a note of this recommendation for future updates of the attendance block. Thanks for that. Only with your feedback is that possible. =) Hope that helps Tim. I'll post an update on the excused attendance situation tomorrow. -Waleed PS: Glad you like/love the attendance block =)",

When installed correctly, it began to work. Now, there are/were still some issues: several files use <? instead of <?php. There are some sites (ours, for example) where it causes problems and the block does not work, if a student of the course is in some other course defined as teacher, then he/she has teacher rights in attendance too, several places show some string title - for example when clicked on \"Take Attendance\" - attendance , or \"Settings\" - newsession in the title of the tab. But anyway, it seems to solve our needs for attendance. Thanks. M. Fikar",

Guess we didn't try installing it as a mod (I wasn't aware that Moodle would even do that but I guess it will!). I'll have my team look at the concerns that you've posted. I can answer you on one though. If a student is made a teacher, then they too, yes, automatically get rights to attendance. They also get the ability to play around with the entire course settings because they're the teacher. Am I correct on this? Please let me know. Finally, I'm glad that this solves your attendance needs =) It's great to see how many people are having a great success out of using the attendance block. -Waleed",

' %'; Why: If a student joins in mid-term it will calculate his attendance based on the total sessions marked, rather than just the classes he has taken.  eg. If there were 20 classes and a student joins in for the last 5, he will only be able to get a total of 25%. There is also no way of marking him excused for any days before he was enrolled without editing the database. This will total up all sessions he has been enrolled in the class for and give a correct percentage. ps. there is also a mod attached that takes homework information as well, I found that the two look work good together. It's only the same one with a few changes made to it.",

Do you extract days from percents? What this means? It is subtracting days from days - the idea was to subtract the number of excused classes from the total number of classes for a particular learner BEFORE converting it to a percentage. Tim.",

But, none of the attendance entries that were previously entered will show up (they work again when I downgraded it back to the old one). Question about the new options in the config options: I use a multi language site, my teachers and the student's parents don't speak the same language. I made a korean language translation so when the parents log on the can see it in korean. But with the new options, don't I have to pick one language? Thanks a lot for the block by the way, it was exactly what I needed for the school and overall it works great. Chris ps. I'll post the translation here if anyone is interested in having a korean version (don't know if you made your own Tim). Only the few strings that the students can see are done, but I can finish it off if there is a need for it.",

          "Text": "Dear Dmitry , This is Somaroy from Human Logic again .Your work towards the enhancement of the attendance block is greatly appreciated.But the block seems to be highly unstable . These are some of the bugs that I encountered once i installed the block : 1. The settings link in the cofiguration>blocks which allows you to set the values for the variables used to denote present absent excused and late and their relevant calculation system in relation to the attendance calculation method has been completely ignored from the previous release . These are very essential settings for the block to make it really flexible for the users to have personal settings in the way that the block is used. 2. The block errors when it is shown on the home page of moodle which is course 0 which is not any particular course are not handled. It gives error message saying courseidwrong and when the continue button is pressed in that location it goes to a invalid URL saying Fatal error: Class 'block_base' not found in blocks\\attendance\\block_attendance.php on line 5.  ( These were handled properly displaying a message in the previous version released by Human Logic.) 3. If there are no students present in a course and when we click take attendance button it gives errors saying  Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in blocks\\attendance\\updateattendance.php on line 118 (These were handled properly displaying a message in the previous version released by Human Logic. ) 4. The new report tab added works with proper url only when moodle is installed in the root of the webserver. Like www.domainname.com but does not work inside a folder. The URL generation variable has a problem. 5. After taking attendance in a course, updating attendance does not work. The attendance values which were previously selected for each student are messed up. 6. In taking attendance, default Absent in your release but selecting  Present by default is more appropriate as the number of students attending the class should be more than that of the ones being absent.(most of the time.) 7. In attendance home page, the title is coming like attendance , this is not defined in language file. PS : I suggest that you follow the same pattern that the block is developed so that we dont loose upon features and end up with bugs as we progress.  We will incorporate the report tab properly and release it in the CVS once its ready and if you have any suggestion please post.",

I think some sort of attendance function is required, particularly for those instructors who use Moodle in a computer lab situation, as do many language teachers, in particular. I've\nbuilt my own using a different algorithm that perhaps is better, algorithm-wise, although my code, too, is not so well written:  On\nthe course settings page, the days & times of class meetings plus\nhow many minutes after the start is considered 'late' are set (and can\nbe set differently if the course has groups inside it).  When a student\nenters a course, 1) a cookie is set and 2) one record is placed in the\nmdl_attendance table.  As long as the cookie is set to this course for\nthe set duration of the class, no other records are written to the\nmdl_attendance table. The admin block then has a link for 'attendance today' and 'attendance\nthis term' which displays green, yellow (late) or red dots for each\nstudent for each class meeting day.  An excel spreadsheet can also be\nprinted out. The advantage of this set-up is that it isn't a module at all, but rather something that happens passively as long as the student logs into the page during classtime (or within 15 min. before it starts).  If you wanted to get fancy, you could also have an IP address filter so that 'attendances' from remote locations aren't recorded as such.",

There seems to be an overlap in requests on these Moodle forums for an attendance report and management system that automatically records and reports on the regular online engagement by students and one that a teacher can use to manually record, manage and report on face-to-face attendance in regular class. One system could easily cover both. I envisage that this could work if there is an\noption for the system to automatically flag a daily attendance event for a course when a student click engages (perhaps at\nleast twice on a day).  This might resolve some of time zone issues raised by another user or requirement for all students to be online at once. Another option may be for a teacher to manually flag on a particular day another attendance event (user defined as absent / present / late / sick etc) . The information kept in the student attendance log table could then be tabulated into a report that would mirror the familar attendance roll kept by teachers, export to a spreadsheet etc. Is this what other users are looking for?",

The only draw back to your demo was that I had to view in in IE (I normally use Firefox ) and that I had to allow it to use ActiveX (which I generally try to avoid doing). Other than that, I wish I had such a file for the whole Moodle training for our faculty here! Thanks again.",

I don't have an opinion about what approach is best (not familiar with blocks), I am just glad to see that there is at least some interest in resurrecting attendance.  I am only a beginner with php (though I have a lot of experience in C/C++) so I am not in a position to help at this point, but if someone does begin work on attendance, I would be interested in testing/reviewing any alpha version as soon as it became available.

You know I am still in the learning process. ) the Attendance module. I hope it is \" OK \" to add to Vijay's wish list (to include some things I have learned while using Moodle and playing with code)? 1.  Making the Attendance module send results to a central table (I read about this a lot with the Gradebook module) so that it is easier to move students (From what I understand this feature will be in future Moodles relating to the Gradebook) between different classes with the same subject and still maintain their attendance record on a continuum.  Also this will be helpful when Student Moodle pages, Parent Moodle pages, Guidance Counselor Moodle pages, (in other words \" Role \" specified pages are eventually developed. 2.  Making attendance \" PDA \" compatible so teachers, parents and specified others can take and monitor attendance from a HandHeld . 3.  Making it optional to assign a grade to attendance which is determined by a specified protocol.  For example, 100% attendance is worth 100 points, 90% - 99% attendance is worth 95 points, etc. 4.  Ability to automatically make certain days count toward attendance and others not.  For example, weekends. 5.  Ability to fine tune what days count toward attendance and which ones do not.  For example there may be A weekend activity that students are expected to partake in. A holiday within the week that is a \"no school\" day for students. A protracted holiday affecting weekdays. For example, spring break I think I am done for now. WP1",

Some ideas: One thing that must change is that one attendance activity must not spew multiple copies of itself throughout the course.  It's confusing to users and it breaks a lot of rules in the code which causes other problems (eg backups). If it was a block it could - be self-contained - not be tied to any particular topic or week - function across/between courses - provide an overview display that is always there For repeating events, it could add entries into the calendar, entries with links that called the block with different parameters. I also think the automatic mode should process the standard Moodle logs in order to find out when students were present or not.",

Prof Okuda, Narumi Sekiya and Thomas Robb have developed the feedback module (originally an adapted journal module) http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=22526 with which one can give each student a unique random code number in chapel (perhaps handing them out at the door) that the students then have to enter into the feedback module for that week. The problem is that one has to print and cut out enough little pieces of paper for the numbers, but it was very popular with the teachers that tried it here. BTW Recently photocopiers have been installed in our university that connect directly to my computer. I believe it is possible to merge data from microsoft word and excel, so that, for example a column of addresses is taken from an excel file and added to the top of a letter, so that each letter printed has a different address. The same technique could be used to concatenate the code number with some lecture notes, or chapel hyms, so that the unique identifier is appended to the top of a lecture/chapel handout. Swipe cards can be lent to other students. Chris Martin",

          "Text": "Current version of Moodle (1.4+) is really lacking a tool for retrieving students' activity in a downloable Excel format. I am thinking of something along the lines of WebCT's Track Students tool, which neatly displays the following info for students enrolled in one given course: Personal Information     Access Information         Articles Full Name User ID First Access Last Access Hits Items Read Posted (where Articles = Forum discussions in Moodle) All we have available at the moment is the \"people\" block, which gives a list of the particpants with their login status ( Never or time elapsed since last login ). This is not very helpful, and if more details are needed, then the only way is to click on a students' name, which gives too many details and we lose the \"class\" overview. What is needed is something in between the \"minimal\" participants list with login dates and the detailed \"individual\" data. In the present block: people -> participants -> the list looks like this: First name  / Surname    City/town    Country    Last access John Smith    Rennes    France    25 days 23 hours John Doe    Rennes    France    5 days 3 hours a) I personally do not find it very useful to have Last access displayed as time elapsed and would find it clearer to have this as a date & time instead (but this is a matter of taste) b) I really need not one column where first name & last name are put together, but 2 separate columns , sortable, of course. In the present system it is possible to sort the \"First name/Surname\" column on either First Name or Surname, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, when you do a sort on e.g. Surname, then Surnames are displayed in alphabetical order but, unfortunately First Names are not, which means we can have the following: Peter Smith    Rennes    France    25 days 23 hours John Smith    Rennes    France    5 days 3 hours What is needed here is that when a primary sort is wanted on First Name a secondary sort be done on Surname, and vice versa. I'd be grateful if someone could suggest ways of overcoming these problems. Joseph_R PS Regarding the display of data about students' visits & activity in Moodle in general, I do not care much about graphics being displayed (they are useful, of course) but what I need in order to track my students' activity are data downloadable in Excel format , for further examination, etc.",

I think I stumbled on a bug in the \"Adding Multiple Attendance Rolls\" page ( mod/attendance/add.php ) at line 52: $enddate = $curdate + $mod->numsections * 604800; The Format that I am using for the course is \"Topics Format\" not \"Weekly Format\", so $enddate shouldn't be calculated.  With a small number of topics, this variable can chop off the number of repeated multiple attendance rolls. Is there a variable/library call available that I can check to see the what format the course is, so I can set this in an \"if\" block? Thanks for any help, Kent",

The only thing, I believe, would make this module more effective is to add time element for example: A class meets every Monday at 3 pm. for 2 hours in a computer lab or online then any student login to the class at 3 pm. and will be attended automatically, if s/he logout then the time s/he stayed online will be the period s/he was attending the course; therefore will be graded according that time. If a student login later than the time of the class his attendance will be stamped with, lets say, Tardy for If a student login after the classs time is over s/he will be Absent. This will make the attendance and its grading much accurate.",

These groups then meet for a seminar, led by a seminar leader who takes an attendance record. We would like the seminar leader to enter this attendance record into Moodle, so that the teacher can see it for all students. Now it would be very inconvenient if the individual seminar leader has to search for his small number of students inside the long list of all class participants in order to enter their attendance. Instead the seminar leader should be shown a list of only those students that were supposed to show up for his particular meeting. Of course Moodle needs to know which student belongs to which seminar group. We are proposing to hold that information an extra column of the user_students table. There also has to be an additional table course_groups, each entry of which corresponds to a group and determines the group's seminar leader. It is the id number of the group in this table that is contained in the extra column of the user_students table. Using the information in these tables, a seminar leader can automatically be shown only those students from the large class that were actually supposed to attend his seminar. Maybe Russell can build this functionality into his module, if not we will build on his work later. And Russell: we need it soon",

To checkout ( download ) the entire Moodle code for the first time, use this command: cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.moodle.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/moodle co contrib Later, to update your local copy of Moodle to the current version in CVS you just need to go into your local moodle directory and type: cvs update -dP From a Windows computer To get started with a fresh copy of Moodle, follow the following steps: 1. Get TortoiseCVS from tortoisecvs.org and install it, then reboot. 2. Find or create a new folder somewhere where you want Moodle to be downloaded to. 3. Right-mouse-click that folder and choose \"CVS Checkout\" from the menu. You should see a dialog box. 4. Copy this text into the CVSROOT field: :pserver:anonymous@cvs.moodle.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/moodle 5. Press the button: \"Fetch list...\". 6. To the right of the button you'll see a list of modules: choose \"contrib\" from that list. 7. Press the button: \"OK\" and everything should be downloaded.

This modul fits their new \"sheep countin need\" THANKS (So i would propose to replace the current icon with a white sheep ) Another \"new need\" is that the teacher needs to know if students have the choice to be present in an offered meeting. (if no student will coem, the teacher can help other students..) The same for exams: students can choose from a list the date they will take their first exam. Thinking how I could use your modul for this, I got a brainwave: I can use poll for that, all the functionality is there. Just clone poll and give it a informationmark icon, changing the text a little... Question to Martin: is worth to make a new modul of it, or is it to close to poll?",

When trying to use the choice module to book students there are two obvious limitations that might be easy to fix (but again it might be more related to the attendance module than the choice..) I could not find a way for a student to re-schedule, once a choice is given it stays. When using as a booking method you would like to offer the opportunity for the student to reschedule (make a new choice). Number of seats, often there is some limitations in seats. It would be of great help if a max number of seats could be entered for each choice. Once the limit is reached, no more student can book that seminar (make that choice). So take it as an idea for further improvement of an already excellent package. Thanks Roger",

Any attendance roll that has this option checked will be edited by the cron library function to reflect whether a student has performed ANY activity at ANY TIME on the day of the attendance roll. I've left this feature pretty simple for the time being. If the roll contains multiple hours, all hours will be marked as present or absent based on whether the student performed any logged activities between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM on that day. I'm willing to enhance this feature to allow for more options, but I'd like to know what users really want in terms of behavior. It's not entirely clear how the details of attendance as it's implemented would map to automation. Should there be time ranges to limit the attendance? How should multiple hours be mapped to that kind of time range? I've cleaned up and enhanced the page navigation bars for the multi-page views in this update as well. Have fun! Russ",

I've heard that that's coming in a future version. As for why they're mixed up, I've not seen this before. They should be sorted by date and time. If they're not, then you may have to set them all to be automatically assigned to sections based on date, which is an option for each attendance instance. The presence list is filled in by the instructor. It can also be filled in automatically, based on the logged activity by each student.

Do I a. create an attendance on every day of the week, b. create just one on a monday, c. create just one on a friday? Ideally I would like to create one which is a week long one in each of my course weeks.",

Am I right (right way around this time ) in thinking they could ALWAYS be hidden? If that's the case, could they be made hidden when they get created? Or perhaps that could be an option. In my case I'm going to drop 50 instances into a 10 week course and then make each of them hidden Oh, one further point, can I do anything about recording attendance in a Topic based course? Again I would like to record whether there's been any activity in each week. That looks more like a job for a simple front-end to an SQL statement running over the log table. What do you think?

When you add a single instance it sets the date to what you've chosen it to be, but ignores the 'dynamic placement' option, leaving it in the section you created it in. If you create multiple, it will create them in the range specified by the start date of the course and the number of topics, I think.

I've called it Activity which is not a particularily good name but it's vaguely appropriate . I tried calling it Usage but that's a MySQL reserved word Although this module is pretty trivial it's actually essential to the use of Moodle locally as I am required to produce weekly \"attendance\" lists on both my current courses (one is Weekly based, the other Topic based). As the courses are \"on-line\" courses in the main, measuring log entries is actually better than recording physical presence in the weekly workshops. I count on-line activity at any time during the week as \"atendance\" in that week. If you copy the zip into the moodle directory and unzip it there it should set up the files OK. You will need to login as Admin and go to the Admin page to \"install\" it. Have a look at the README file. As I say it's pretty trivial but I think it fills a gap. (Also it's task is not particularly well suited for a module, it's very simple, and would possibly be better as an Administration \"function\" but that's something for the future.) Please let me know what you think, in particular, does the attached module do something which the Attendance does not easily provide and, if not, could the Attendance module be extended to provide this info?

When re-editing an attendance record that has already been submitted, I've noticed that the radio buttons on the edit form end up at the default setting, and not the previously entered value. For example: My attendance default is set to Absent (A). John Doe is marked Present (P) on 3 September 2003, but when I edit the roll for that date, everybody (including John Doe) has their radio button set as 'A'. I cancel the edit, view the attendance for that day, and confirm that John Doe was Present. Enter the edit for that day, and everybody is set to 'A' again. Repeat ad infinitum... Is this how a 'clean' recordset (i.e., one not created by non-standard SQL import) also behaves? Or have I really botched something up someplace...? AND, BTW , how can I turn off the feature that treats attendance as a gradeable assignment?",

          "Text": "The short answer is that this is how I've designed it to work. If you save the changes to an instance, it will save the proper settings for each student for each hour of the roll. The long answer: Read a couple of replies up - you'll see that as long as you haven't saved changes to an attendance roll, the roll stays marked as all 'present' until you edit it the first time - at that edit it sets all the defaults to the preference setting you chose in settings for the default attendance. This is done to allow all your rolls to be added at once at the beginning of the course - but still to allow the ones that haven't been edited yet to *not* affect the overall attendance totals. Once you edit a roll for the first time and save the changes, it is assumed that you're taking roll for the course for that day, and you're interested in convenience and speed for editing the roll (thus the default setting of all to one status - absent, or tardy say) and then once you've saved the roll ,you want it to affect the overall attendance totals for the course. If I were to set all the attendance instances to the default as soon as they were created, and not at the first save, the overall totals for attendance rolls would be useless, as students would be counted as 'absent' or 'tardy' for days that haven't even come up yet in the course. Consider it as a compromise between ease of use in creating multiple attendance instances at once and ease of use in actually using those instances later to take roll on the day it was created for. Does that make sense?",

But once I've actualy set the roll, say a student that was not present when roll was taken shows up...at that point, I need to go back and edit his/her roll for that day. But then I'd need to remember which were present and which were not from the listing, because when I go to the edit page, all of those changes are not shown. When I wrote the attendance feature for my own LMS (which I'm considering abandoning production for in preferene of Moodle), I made it so that the db query accurately showed the roll as stored in the database ...I set up a switch scenario that put 'checked' in the radio button HTML code as the page is generated so that each button set for each student reflects their stored settings. It makes sense to have the first view of the roll page show up with the default settings, but each edit after that really ought to be based on what's actually stored in the db. Otherwise, edits to accurately update one student's attendance run the very real risk of introducing inaccuracies into the rest of the class... Does that make sense? *grin*",
