          "Title": "Global timeout even though maxtime was not even nearly obtained",
          "Text": "Hello. I am teaching a basic programming course and I use VPL for my evaluations. Most questions are fairly simple and can be solved in a few miliseconds, so I randomly create 100 test cases and assign a grade according to how many of them are correctly solved. Most questions take one or two seconds to be graded in this manner (or at least this is how long it takes after I click on the \"evaluate\" button). However, the \"Maximum execution time\" is not respected. Here's a MRE: There are 128 test cases, all equal to Case = Test input = 1 output = 1 Solution (in C) is #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"1\"); return 0; } It takes about 2 seconds to compile and 1 to evaluate, when it works. Maximum memory is 512MB, maximum execution files 128MB and maximum processes is 10. When I set up Maximum execution time to 8 minutes or more, it evaluates as above; However, anything below that yields \"Global timeout\". Some VPLs which I created evaluate in 4 minutes, others 2. I couldn't find a pattern. IT in my uni noticed that vpl_evaluate.cpp ( https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl_evaluate.cpp ) has these lines: int timeout = maxtime / testCases.size(); for (size_t i = 0; i < testCases.size(); i++) { //... if (timeout <= 1 || Timer::elapsedTime() >= maxtime) { //... addFatalError(\"Global timeout\"); and that maxtime = maximum time in seconds (integer). So if maxtime < testCases.size() we automatically get a \"Global timeout\" error, and this might be related to this issue. However, it does not explain why it does not evaluate in 4 minutes. So, I always have to set up a relatively high maximum execution time in order for correct answers to be properly evaluated (4 or 8 minutes, usually), even if they are actually evaluated basically instantly. However, whenever a student makes a nonending loop, they have to way for that whole time (4+ minutes) in order to get the timeout error message and be able to try again. This hinders VPLs usability in exams, which are time-sensitive. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem as a professor (no access to uni server and moodle plugin configs)? Or is there anything I could indicate IT to do? I note that this problem was already noticed in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=451871&lang=en . Thank you very much.",

          "Text": "Hi Luiz, Thank you for reporting this issue, and sorry for the inconvenience you’re experiencing. You are correct — the BIOTES evaluator represents time limits as integer seconds and distributes the total maximum execution time among all test cases. Specifically, the timeout for each case is calculated approximately as: `timeout_per_case = maxtime / number_of_cases` Because of this design, if the number of test cases is large and the total time limit is not proportionally higher, the timeout for each individual case may become too small, causing a “Global timeout” error even when the total execution time seems reasonable. To avoid this, you should ensure that the maximum execution time is greater than the number of test cases . The more test cases you have, the larger this global time limit needs to be. Better Solution: Use the GIOTES Evaluator This limitation has been resolved in the newer GIOTES evaluator (VPL version >= 4.3.0), which is mostly compatible with BIOTES but provides much more flexibility in timeout management. With GIOTES , you can: Define a default timeout per test case using \"time limit=\" before any case, Override the timeout for specific cases using \"time limit=\" in the case, and Use floating-point values for more precise time limits (e.g., 0.5 seconds). This allows you to manage large numbers of test cases efficiently without artificially inflating the total maximum time. Server Configuration Note Be aware that the jail server configuration can also limit the maximum execution time.\nBy default, the jail server’s global timeout is 1800 seconds (30 minutes) , but this can be freely adjusted by the jail server administrator. In most cases, the default settings work well. However, reducing the number of allowed processes too much can negatively affect performance and lead to unexpected timeouts, so I would recommend keeping the default or slightly increasing it rather than lowering it.

          "Text": "Hi, VPL is a two-part solution. The first part sits on the server and runs the code in a sandbox environment. Thus, if we want to run a specific package of, let us say, Python, then if the computer that has the VPL server running can compile Python, and has the package available and correctly configured, the code sent to it will run, and you will have an output. The Moodle plugin facilitates sending the code to the server; thus, instead of the professor downloading the student code to their development machine, executing the code, and viewing the results, the plugin does this work. There is also a way to automate checking. If the professor spends a little time, higher automation in the evaluation of the results is possible. This summarises the workflow. Now, to address your query: The sandbox environment should also have access to the GPUs. There is work to be done under the hood, however, if there is experience in setting up GPUs on another machine of similar architecture, it should be a cinch. Extensive testing is required to fully understand the workflow. Process execution limits should be suitable for the proposed workload. Very few institutions will run the backend jobe server on GPU and CUDA capable servers, although it is possible. We are curious to now the outcome and welcome the experience of your team and the professor's success in this interesting, relevant and emerging learning direction.",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm trying to set the final grade for a VPL activity using the 'vpl_evaluate.sh' script. According to the documentation, the correct way to assign a grade is by echoing a string in the format 'Grade :=>> [value]'. For example, I'm using: `echo \"Grade :=>> 8.33\"` However, when the evaluation runs, the string \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" appears in the output of the evaluation report, but the actual grade for the submission is not being set by VPL. It seems like VPL is not interpreting this line as a grade assignment. Here's an example of the output I'm seeing: \n```text\nGrade\n8.33\n\n\n\nGrade :=>> 8.33\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n (Note: The \"Grade 8.33\" line before \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" is part of my script's output, not the VPL grade assignment itself.) Could anyone please advise on what might be causing this issue? Is there a specific placement for this command in 'vpl_evaluate.sh' (e.g., must it be the very last line of output)? Or are there any other configurations in VPL or Moodle that I need to check to ensure this command is correctly parsed as the final grade? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

          "Text": "Hello, I am creating programming questions using the VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) plugin in Moodle. Recently, I noticed that the editor is no longer showing syntax highlighting or automatic indentation for students. The editor now appears as plain text, which is making it difficult for students to read and write code efficiently. Details: Programming languages affected: Python, HTML, CSS , JavaScript . Issue occurs both in new and existing VPL questions. Previously, the editor worked correctly with colored syntax and proper indentation. We are using SEB during exams, but the issue is visible even when testing outside SEB. I have checked that the VPL questions have the correct programming language selected and the editor type is set to the default. Question: Could anyone advise on: How to restore syntax highlighting and smart indentation for VPL questions? Whether any specific VPL settings or templates might have been changed in recent Moodle updates that could cause this issue? Any recommended workarounds for students taking exams in SEB if the editor scripts are being blocked? Thank you in advance for your help!",

          "Text": "Hi Andrew and Garth, Thank you for your detailed message and for testing VPL with R on the Docker-based jail server. I’ve tried to reproduce your issue using the Docker image `jcrodriguezvpl/jail-ubuntu-full` , but so far, I haven’t encountered the same problem. The message you're seeing — `Error constructing proxy for org.gnome.Terminal` — appears to be related not to VPL itself, but to the container’s graphical environment or its resource constraints. Running R in VPL 4.3.2 With the release of VPL 4.3.2 , we have simplified R integration by using VPL’s new running modes . These allow better control over how R scripts are executed, especially in text mode or GUI terminal environments. As you may know, the R tool is based on a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface, which complicates direct integration with VPL. After exploring various approaches, the latest solution uses `Rscript` , which is better suited for automated/scripted execution. Here's how R execution works using Rscript in VPL 4.3.2: The first `.R` file in the student submission is run using `Rscript --vanilla` . Since `Rscript` is not interactive, you need to: Use `readLines(file(\"stdin\"), n = 1)` to read input. To display charts: Save them as image files using `png(\"file.png\")` or `jpeg(\"file.jpg\")` .\nGenerate the image, chart, etc.\nClose the graphics device using `dev.off()` .\nShow the image with an external viewer using: \n```text\nr\n   system(\"nohup xdg-open file.png &\")\n```\n (Note: This need a text in GUI run mode) Suggested Setup (if not using VPL 4.3.2) If you're not yet on VPL 4.3.2, you can configure R execution manually by using the following `vpl_run.sh` script in \"execution files\" for text-only mode : \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script for running R in VPL\n. common_script.sh\ncheck_program R\nget_first_source_file r R\ncat common_script.sh > vpl_execution\necho \"Rscript --vanilla \\\"$FIRST_SOURCE_FILE\\\"\" >> vpl_execution\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n To run in a GUI terminal (text in GUI mode) , you may add to the previous vpl_run.sh: \n```text\nmv vpl_execution vpl_execution_in_gui\ncat common_script.sh > vpl_wexecution\ncat <<'END_SCRIPT' >> vpl_wexecution\nif command -v gnome-terminal &> /dev/null; then\n    gnome-terminal -- bash -c \"./vpl_execution_in_gui; echo; read -p 'Press Enter to continue...'\"\nelif command -v xterm &> /dev/null; then\n    xterm -e bash -c \"./vpl_execution_in_gui; echo; read -p 'Press Enter to continue...'\"\nelif command -v konsole &> /dev/null; then\n    konsole --noclose -e \"./vpl_execution_in_gui\"\nelif command -v xfce4-terminal &> /dev/null; then\n    xfce4-terminal --hold --command=\"./vpl_execution_in_gui\"\nelse\n    echo \"No terminal emulator found. Running without GUI terminal.\"\n    ./vpl_execution_in_gui\nfi\nwait_end vpl_execution_in_gui\nEND_SCRIPT\nchmod +x vpl_wexecution\n```\n Best regards,\nJuan Carlos Rodríguez",

          "Text": "Dear Amit Singh, Thank you for your patience and for following the instructions to execute your JavaScript code in the VPL environment. It seems the issue persists despite the script adjustments for the NODE_PATH environment variable. This suggests that there might be another underlying issue at play. You can explore additional debugging steps: Environment Check: Although the provided script should correctly set the NODE_PATH, it's worth manually verifying the environment variables within the jail server to ensure they are set as expected. You can do this by adding debug statements in your `vpl_run.sh` script to print out environment variables to the console. Resource Limits: The issue might also be related to resource limits within the VPL environment. It's possible that the compilation of the evaluation program exceeds the available memory, causing it to terminate. To diagnose this, you can temporarily increase the resource limits for your VPL activity and see if the problem persists. Direct Execution Test: As a more direct test, you can attempt to execute your JavaScript code directly in the jail environment without using the VPL execution scripts. This can help determine if the issue is with the VPL setup or the code itself. To facilitate this, a simple C program like the following can grant you access to the jail command line, enabling you to run the JavaScript code manually and observe any immediate feedback or errors. Set the file with the following code as first file in your submissions. \n```text\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    system(\"/bin/bash\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n Please, attempt these steps and share any findings.

          "Text": "Dear Steve, Using pre_vpl_run.sh to install the required Node.js packages during each execution or evaluation is possible, but it tends to be time-consuming and not always reliable. A more effective approach is to install the necessary packages globally on the execution server. This ensures they are readily available without repeated installations. Regarding the issue with asynchronous input/output, you're right—Node.js and some of its packages can take full control of the terminal, which can interfere with VPL’s evaluator and cause unexpected behavior. After testing several packages that support synchronous input/output, I found that readline-sync works well and integrates properly with the VPL evaluator. I’ve tested it successfully with both VPL version 4.2 and the upcoming version 4.3. I hope this resolves the issue you're facing. Note: Please avoid using the plugin notification feature to ask technical questions, as it does not support threaded communication. Best regards, Juan Carlos Rodríguez",

          "Text": "Hi Giuseppe, Thanks for your message. I understand that when you mention \"I have set VPL to listen on port 8443 HTTPS and 8080 HTTP\", you are referring to the VPL Jail System . Just to clarify, installing the VPL Jail System on a VPS is not the most typical setup. If accessing `http://server:8282/OK` returns “OK”, then the VPL Jail System is likely running correctly. However, there may be a small typo: based on your earlier message, I believe the correct port should be `8080` , not `8282` . Assuming your Moodle site is using the default ports (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS), here are a few key points and recommendations to help you troubleshoot the timeout issue: Checklist to verify configuration Verify the ports Double-check the port numbers you’ve configured, both in the VPL Jail System and in the Moodle VPL plugin. Use full external URL In the Moodle VPL plugin configuration, ensure you're using the full external URL (e.g., `https://your-domain:8443` ). Do not use `localhost` here, note that this URL is send to the browser to access the VPL-Jail-System. Check HTTPS functionality Make sure you can access `https://your-domain:8443/OK` . This will confirm that the VPL Jail System is properly serving over HTTPS. URLPATH security It is highly recommended to configure the `URLPATH` parameter in the VPL Jail System. This adds a layer of security by ensuring only authorized Moodle servers can access it. Self-signed certificate setting Since you are using a valid Let's Encrypt certificate, the \"accept self-signed certificates\" option in the Moodle plugin should be disabled . Reverse proxy and WebSocket support If you're using a reverse proxy to expose the VPL Jail System, ensure it supports WebSocket connections . Note that the `/OK` endpoint does not use WebSockets, so its success does not guarantee that task execution will work properly. Remove unnecessary HTTP port If you're not using HTTP on port 8080, consider disabling it to reduce attack surface and potential misconfiguration. Let me know if you continue to experience issues after these checks. We’ll be happy to help further. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos",

          "Text": "Dear Karolina Suliga, Thank you for your question. VPL is a flexible system that can be adapted to many different approaches. While the default Basic Input/Output Test Evaluation System does not directly check the content of files, you can use the “program to run” and “program arguments” options to execute custom commands that do. I’ve reviewed the “pars” activity on the demo server and have a few suggestions that might help: Preventing Students from Modifying Header Files: If you want to ensure students don’t change the provided header files, include those headers in both the Requested Files and the Execution Files . In the VPL editor, these will appear as read-only, and during execution, only the versions from Execution Files will be used — giving you full control. Writing to and Checking File Contents: It seems you were close to a working solution. I’ve corrected and improved the execution scripts on the demo server. The activity should now correctly check the contents of the output file. I recommend adding a few more test cases with different file content outputs to thoroughly assess student solutions. Best regards, Juan Carlos P.S.: I’ve uploaded the corrected execution files here to ensure their content is preserved",

The `multipathd.service` is typically used in enterprise environments to provide redundancy and high availability for storage devices. Unless you have a specific need for that kind of setup, it's safe to disable the service. Also, I recommend updating your VPL Jail system to version 4.0.4, which includes various improvements and fixes. You can find the release notes here: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/en/home/news/94-release-of-vpljail4-0-4 Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Before we realized, LEARN the umbrella organization and the player EduNET, which is everywhere, were providing the resources resp. expertise. The write-up has the details.

          "Text": "I’m trying to set up VPL test cases with input and output, and I’m facing an issue with matching the output to a regular expression. When the output is correct, everything works fine (it simply displays “test cases passed”). However, if the output fails, it shows the exact regular expression used in the test. I want to hide this. I tried using the fail message option, but it hides everything (both input and output), only displaying the fail message. I’ve also attempted to use a multiline fail message, indented to show the expected output rather than the regular expression, but it’s not working. It seems that the fail message might not support multiline. I checked the BIOTES documentation, but I couldn’t find specific information on this issue. Has anyone encountered this problem, and do you have any workaround? Thank you in advance! Sample Output",

For many years, the run of `sql_run.sh` execution script for SQLite3 generate a code to go in interactive mode showing the software version. However, it seems that now also shows the version when VPL is evaluating the student code. Upcoming Fix: In the next VPL release, we plan to modify the sql_run.sh script to suppress the SQLite3 version output when in the evaluation process. Workaround: In the meantime, to resolve the problem, you can customize your `vpl_run.sh` (based on `sql_run.sh` from the VPL source) . For example, modify the code block that checks for batch mode. Instead of: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n    echo \"sqlite3 $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n you can change it to: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   if [ -f vpl_evaluate.sh ]; then\n       BATCHOPTION=\"-batch\"\n   fi\n   echo \"sqlite3 $BATCHOPTION $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n If you wish to avoid going in interactive mode of SQLite3 when running use: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   echo \"sqlite3 -batch $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n Thanks again for your valuable feedback. Please let us know if you have any further questions or suggestions. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

However, because VPL can be configured to manage different runtime environments (e.g., text terminal, GUI, or web applications), it’s theoretically possible to adapt it for Tomcat-based web applications. If you have experience with Tomcat, you can use the existing PHP run script as a starting point and modify it to launch Tomcat (or another Java web server ) within the VPL environment. This approach may also involve adding Maven (for dependencies) and the Tomcat plugin to manage deployment. Keep in mind that configuring a servlet/JSP environment in VPL requires additional resources and significant setup time. If you decide to pursue this route, you will need to : Install Tomcat (or another web server), Maven, etc. in the VPL execution server. Customize a run script to compile your project (using Maven, if desired) and start Tomcat. Configure ports as the PHP script does. This is definitely an advanced use case and may require considerable effort, but it can be a viable solution. If you do try it, your feedback or any shared scripts would be valuable to the community.

Your thorough investigation is much appreciated. This problem may have existed unnoticed for some time. One of the improvements in the latest VPL update is enhanced error reporting related to communication issues between the Moodle server and the jail server. In previous versions, such errors were silently ignored, often leaving users to retry the action without understanding the root cause of no result. We understand the challenge of balancing security and functionality. Protecting servers from external attacks is a top priority. Interestingly, after a similar incident within our organization, a colleague humorously remarked, “In trying to protect ourselves from denial-of-service attacks, we ended up denying our own services.” It seems your experience echoes this sentiment. Thank you again for sharing your findings. Best regards,",

Sometimes, it seems, a server will identify via ipv6 and an 'uncategorized' country, and other times it will identify as ipv4 and an ASN of 0... In each case, it fails to properly identify itself and CF treats it as a threat (based on my blocking of non-North American traffic). Either way, the problems seems to have something to do with the way server's are identifying themselves. As a workaround, I've whitelisted the IPs (ipv6 and ipv4) as well as the ASNs... Hopefully this handles things until I can figure out why the server's aren't properly relaying to CF who they really are",

Please note that the demojail server has been running on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS for two years without exhibiting this issue. Regarding the unusual correlation between the problem and the settings in `/etc/profile` , these settings should only affect bash behavior for the user, not script execution. About `$2` in `vpl_run.sh` The second script argument ( `$2` ) in the execution scripts for different programming languages is specifically intended for passing additional parameters to the compilation or interpretation command. In the C and C++ execution script , `$2` is currently used by the debugger preparation script to compile the program with debugging information ( `-g` ) and no optimization ( `-O0` ). The current VPL execution server does not add extra parameters when executing `vpl_run.sh` . Next Steps From your report, it appears that you modified `vpl_run.sh` . To further investigate: 1. Could you provide the full content of your `vpl_run.sh` file? 2. If you are using the VPL \"based on\" feature , please also share the inherited files. Temporary Workaround Since you are not using the debugging button , a simple and safe workaround is to remove `$2` from the compilation command in `vpl_run.sh` for the affected activity. This should prevent unintended arguments from being passed to `gcc` . Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Set the `TASK_ONLY_FROM` parameter, which allows you to define a whitelist of IP addresses without relying on an external firewall.

The Virtual Programming Lab (VPL) uses a plain input/output testing approach, which works well for many programming tasks but does not inherently support the dynamic nature of web browsers displaying HTML content. Therefore, evaluating the result of an HTML file rendered in a browser is not directly compatible with the default VPL testing mechanisms. If your goal is to evaluate the HTML code written by students (e.g., validating its structure or specific tags), this would require customization. For instance, you might use a script or tool to analyze the HTML file programmatically and provide automated feedback. Alternatively, you could consider integrating browser-based testing tools or frameworks if you want to check rendered web pages. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

          "Text": "Dear Rajasekaran, Thank you for your query regarding the execution of Pygame or Turtle programs in VPL. Let me clarify how VPL determines the execution environment for programs and provide some guidance. The current version of VPL automatically selects the execution environment (text terminal, GUI, or web) based on criteria specific to each programming language. Unfortunately, manual selection of the execution environment is not yet supported. However, this feature is planned for a future VPL release. For now, the execution environment is determined by the type of executable file produced during compilation phase: vpl_execution for text terminal, vpl_wexecution for GUI, vpl_webexecution for web. Workarounds To run your code in the desired environment, you can use one of the following workarounds: Modify the Execution Script: Copy the default execution script for your programming language from the VPL source into a file named `vpl_run.sh` in the execution files section of your activity. Edit the script to rename the executable file produced during compilation (e.g., from `vpl_execution` to `vpl_wexecution` ). For Python Programs: If your program requires a GUI environment, you can \"cheat\" the execution script by including a reference to `Tkinter` in your source code (e.g., adding a comment like `# Tkinter` ). This triggers the script to use a GUI execution environment. These methods should allow you to successfully run Pygame or Turtle programs in VPL. Please note that additional adjustments may be needed depending on the specifics of your program or setup. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Addressing this concern is on our TODO list, and we have planned different approaches to resolve it effectively. These include: Generating a zip file for each submission. Creating a single zip file containing old submissions for cleanup. While these features are under development, you can try the following interim solutions: Adjust the \"Discard Submission Period\": In the plugin's global settings, increase the \"Discard Submission Period\" from the default value of 1 minute. This change can help manage submission retention. Perform a Backup and Restore: (risky) As a more involved solution, perform a backup of the course (including users and activities ) and then restore it. This action will remove all submissions except the most recent ones. These steps should help mitigate the issue until the planned features are implemented. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

In VPL, grading permissions are designed such that any teacher (whether an editing teacher or not) can grade a submission.

This restriction is in place to maintain accountability and avoid accidental grade changes by others.

The current VPL-Jail- Server launchers use the default VNC server of the Linux distribution they are running on. Regarding your observation, the RANDR (Resize and Rotate) extension is indeed essential for dynamic resizing of display outputs and screen resolution changes. From what I understand, TightVNC does not support the RANDR extension. If your application or environment does not require RANDR, you can safely ignore this message as it is purely informational and does not impact functionality in most cases. However, if your SDL-based application relies on RANDR for creating windows and setting dimensions (as indicated by the error you shared), switching to a VNC server that supports RANDR could resolve the issue. For instance, TigerVNC is a suitable alternative that supports RANDR and is commonly used in Fedora Linux distributions.",

In the second py file, we only work with text console: we open the data file, read the array and write it to the console. We also insert those numpy arrays in the test cases as output. Now in the vpl_run.sh file, there will be consecutive runs for vpl_wexecution and vpl_execution. First created and runs wexecution for the first graphical program, then vpl_execution is created and run for the second console program. And the evaluation script won’t throw up the error saying it’s not possible to evaluate with vpl_wexecution… Is that possible? Thank you.",

If I edit pre_vpl_run.sh file and change: `file=${qvplfile%_qvpl}` to: `file=$qvplfile` Then validate option in teacher correction will not show error and in question preview Pre-check button works fine and program validates correctly. Also in quiz when students submits a quiz it will be graded correctly using program to check. From this I presume that problem comes from executing renamed program to run (check_code.sh_qvpl). If I edit pre_vpl_run.sh to be: `for qvplfile in `ls -1`` `do` `if [ \"$qvplfile\" != \"check_code.sh\" ]; then` `file=${qvplfile%_qvpl}` And in locallib.php of VPL question edit function that formats execution files not to edit files with name \"check_code.sh\": `if (substr($content, 0, 6) != 'UNUSED' && $name != 'check_code.sh') {` `$formattedfiles[$name.'_qvpl'] = $content;` `}` Then everything work just fine. But it is not a solution because then we can only user one extra program and it must be named \"check_code.sh\". Is there maybe problem on our jail server that aborts execution of files with edited names (like check_code.sh_qvpl)?",

A similar bug was fixed in VPL version 3.5, where an inefficient regular expression (regex) caused issues when rendering evaluation reports. If you are using an outdated version of VPL, I recommend updating to the latest release, as this might resolve the problem. As a workaround for the current issue, you can go directly to the Submission page (not the \"Submission view\" page). You can access the Submission page by copying the URL from another user who is able to view it, and then ask the student to submit a new version without the circular dependency. Once the student submits a corrected version, the submission should display correctly, and the issue will be resolved.",

This linking process is handled by the browser, which struggles to manage such a large number of lines efficiently. This may be due to an inefficient regular expression or poor string handling in the JavaScript responsible for this task. I am marking this issue as a bug, and it will be addressed in a future release of the VPL plugin.

This limitation is due to the way the VPL Jail Server URLs are structured. While this could be addressed in the future to provide more flexibility in how the VPL Jail Server is configured, it is not a high priority at the moment. For a workaround, I recommend using an alias name for the Nginx server instead of a subfolder. The alias name can redirect requests to the VPL Jail Server, allowing you to place the VPL jail server machine (with other name and IP) behind the Nginx server while keeping the current URL schema intact.

I am very fascinated about your VPL Jail Server Projects and its features. We have been recently moved to MOODLE LMS system. And we are using VPL for programming practices. We are having 3000+ users. Under normal circumstance VPL is responding good if more number of users using we find VPL is bit slow. So we decided to put more horizontally scale based on no of users. For that i have personally testing VPL docker images especially ubuntu-full. Everything works fine if i created as separate docker container in a separate VM and accessed through common physical router. But when i tried to run moodle and vpl containers in same machine and connect with docker network it is not working. In console i am getting ws (web socket) error. Please advice on this i have tried in many ways but the result is same. Dr.Rajasekaran",

          "Text": "Dr. S. Rajasekaran, Thank you for sharing your experience with VPL. Details are important for understanding the behavior and performance of VPL. Could you please indicate if you have tested adding more Jail servers to your Moodle server to resolve the performance issues and what resources (especially RAM) the machines you added have available? Using one machine for both the Moodle server and the Jail Server may raise some inconveniences. You must limit the resources available for the Jail Server to avoid slowing down Moodle when the jail server gets very bussy. From your statement, “I tried to run Moodle and VPL containers on the same machine and connect with Docker network,” I understand that you are trying to expose only the Moodle server to the internet. Note that, as indicated in the manual, the Jail Server must also be exposed to the internet (see the third requirement). Documentation on VPL Jail System Requirements To run both servers on the same machine, you may use two names or different ports for the same machine. The first approach requires proper configuration of a reverse proxy using Nginx or Apache , for example. Remember to set the correct URL (reachable from the internet) for the jail server in the VPL plugin configuration. Note that if you use localhost or the localhost IP (127.X:X:X) for your jail server it will only be available from a browser on that machine. If you are trying to build a Load Balancer, please read the following documentation: Load Balancer Documentation Additionally, be aware that modern browsers reject non-secure requests (HTTP or WS) from secure pages (HTTPS).

I have installed it globally on the JAIL server and modified the javascript_run.sh script to link to the module. Due to permissions, it cannot access the module. However, it works fine if I copy the whole node_modules folder into the execution directory at run time. This seems unnecessary and repetitive when it is being used multiple times and by many users. So, basically, is there a shared directory which all users can access during execution where I can put the module files? Or if I create one, what ownership and permissions would it need? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hi Bruna, It seems like the issue is related to the use of the backslash \"\\\" in your regex. In programming laguages strings, the backslash is used as an escape character to represent special characters in a string, such as \"\\n\" for newline and \"\\t\" for tab. When using regex, backslashes are also used to escape special regex characters to treat them as literal characters, for example, \"\\.\" to match a dot instead of any character. However, in VPL regex, the first use of the backslash (for special characters like \"\\n\") is not implemented. So, if you want to represent a newline, you should directly write the newline character in the editor instead of using \"\\n\". Please try replacing your \"\\n\" with an actual newline character in your expressions. Note that the \"output=\" option in VPL allows for multilines. Additionally, using regex can sometimes be complex and may require external tools to identify discrepancies. Simplifying the expected output of student's code, using simpler regex patterns or other types of expected output as numbers or text may ease the process of writing test cases and improve readability.",

In this case, it will attempt to open a browser. Otherwise, the system will run the PHP CLI, executing the first student's file. For more details, you can refer to the default PHP run script available at the following link: default PHP run script . If you want to change this behavior, you need to create your own `vpl_run.sh` script. Note that you can detect if you are running in an evaluation action by checking for the presence of the `vpl_evaluate.sh` file. Remember to select the PHP files in the “Files to keep when running” section. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos",

It is working fine now, but I had a few issues during the installation: First, if you are using a router, you need that your real IP ports 80 and 443 from outside be foward to your local IP (192.something) [you do it by configuring your router] and that those ports also be fowards from your IP to your NAT IP inside Virtual Machine (10. something) [you do it by configuring the network on Oracle Virtual Machine). Second, I got a hell of time to put the SSL certificate to function. The non secure host / OK was working fine but the SSL  host / OK was given a not secure error. I tried to copy the etc/letsencrypt .pem files to the respective correct names on the etc/vpl, however, it did not work. Later I verified that the size of the copied files were way smaller than the original ones and instead of copying the files, I just put the link of the pem files inside the vpl jail server conf files and it started to work just fine. Those were the two major issues I get and I had to say it took me a couple of hours to solve it, but now I'm happyt it is working fine. PS: Do you guys know some low cost 24/7 linux server account where I can run a vpl jail server?",

          "Text": "Dear Amit Singh, It's important to note that the jail server installer typically installs, using the local package manager, the latest versions of development software stock available in the Linux distribution you are using. This include npm, used, and nodejs. However, you have the flexibility to use any version of the development software on your jail server. The key limitation is ensuring that the command line interface of the software version you choose is compatible with the scripts used by the VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) plugin. Specifically regarding your query, the npm command is utilized by the jail server installer exclusively for installing Node.js packages. Meanwhile, the Node.js command is employed by the VPL plugin's JavaScript runner. Both commands rely on straightforward command line interfaces, which means you should encounter no issues when updating or downgrading these pieces of software. Regarding updating Node.js to a version that is compatible with npm 10.4.0, as you've described the requirement ^18.17.0 || >=20.5.0, it can be accomplished in the usual manner and with the standard precautions associated with software updates. Please note, this process is independent of the VPL jail server's specific considerations.",

VPL Jail System Network Requirements This includes verifying that both the Moodle and execution server (VPL Jail System) are accessible to the end users' browser. Port Accessibility : Since you mentioned using port 444 for HTTPS of the execution server, ensure that this port is properly opened and accessible over the internet. Firewalls or network policies might be restricting access to this port, leading to timeouts. If these steps do not resolve your issue, sharing your VPL Jail System's configuration file (while redacting any sensitive information) could help identify any specific misconfigurations. Best regards, and I hope this helps you resolve the connectivity issue. Juan Carlos.",

          "Text": "Hi all I just installed the vpl-jail-system on a dedicated server , which is otherwise a production Moodle server running Debian 11 - all default LAMP . The machine serves a few Moodle instances for different Apache virtual hosts. The machine's canonical FQDN is different from all the\ndomains of the Moodle instances and is itself an Apache\nvirtual host and reserved for the vpl-jail-system. All the HTTP traffic to\nthese hosts are redirected to HTTPS. The SSL certificates are from Let's\nEncrypt. The vpl-jail-system install script ran smoothly. At end asked it not to stop Apache, set PORT=8080, SECURE_PORT=8433 in the conf file. The service start complained about the SSL certificate chain. Got certificates from Let's encrypt for the FQDN of the machine, pointed SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE to them and the service starts without complaints. Haven't tested through the Moodle VPL plug-in yet but http://fqdn:8080/OK returns OK. My question is about the security of the machine. I observe that http://fqdn:8080/OK stays HTTP, i.e. not redirected to 443 or 8443. This is to be expected from the Apache default.conf: \n```text\nRewriteEngine on\n\n\nRewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =host.example.com\n\n\nRewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]\n```\n That is OK with me. But I see that the service is available on a full TCP/IP port (host.example.com:8080) and is reachable from outside. Since the vpl-jail-system will serve only the localhost, can't it be shifted to localhost:8080, for example? Or, do I have to set the firewall? What is your advise? P.S. The load the VPL will cause is no concern - the server hat plenty of horse power!",

No error logs in Moodle, only access logs. vpl-jail-server doesn't have logs per execution, only when the service starts, it seems. So, hopefully the final question: why doesn't console opened, and even if I open it manually before execution, no output?",

A Moodle site with VPL plug-in installed responds to the Pascal \"Hello, World!\" by opening the console and printing the output - if I give the http://demojail.dis.ulpgc.es . If I change to http://fqdn:8080 of the first vpl-jail-system or http://ip of the second vpl-jail-system, no console opens. I can see Run in a pop-up which vanishes, saw at least once \"Get execution server\" in its title. But no \"Hello, World!\" output. The odd thing is, it always says, 1 test run / 1 test passed, even if I deliberately change the output string. I must repeat that both http://fqdn:8080/OK and http://ip/OK brings 'OK'.",

It works with a self-signed certificate, if user accept it once following the pop-up attached below. P.S. I see the Note on https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/installation.html#getting-vpl-jail-system === If you have your own SSL certificates for the HTTPS and WSS communications,\nyou must copy your public certificate to the “/etc/vpl/cert.pem” file and the\nprivate key to the “/etc/vpl/key.pem” file.

This means that the specific data you're seeking is not directly stored by VPL in its standard operation. However, partial information about each student's activity, which includes the results of their code evaluations, can be downloaded from the \"Submissions list\" report in VPL. This report might provide some of the data you need, although it won't include the exact state of the code at each run or the output/error messages generated during those runs.",

Since this snapshot happens after a student evaluate his/her code the old evaluate will be replaced with the new one. How do i pass that variable to another php file and that the data is always updated to the new evaluations? Greetings Nash",

          "Text": "To address the \"Http(s) Unsupported METHOD CONNECT\" error, let's break it down: The check you mentioned pertains to WebSocket connections' URL paths. These connections originate from the user's browser. The error message \"Http(s) Unsupported METHOD CONNECT\" indicates that either your browser or a proxy in your network is attempting to send a CONNECT method request to the Jail server. The CONNECT method is typically used by proxies but doesn't make sense for the Jail server. To resolve this issue, consider the following steps: Verify your network configuration: Ensure that there are no misconfigured proxies in your network that might be causing this issue. Use a full transparent proxy: If necessary, set up a transparent proxy that doesn't interfere with WebSocket connections. Direct connection to the Jail server: If feasible, try connecting directly to the Jail server without any intermediate proxies to see if the issue persists. I hope this helps you diagnose and resolve the problem effectively. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos.",

Since this activity doesn't have an exact output (student may submit the activity on any date before the deadline) I want to write the test case to evaluate the student's answer with the date where the student is submitting the assignment. To achieve this, I gave the test case ( vpl_evaluate.cases ) as follows. \n```text\ncase = print current date\n\n\nprogram to run = chkDate.py\n\n\ninput = \n\n\noutput = \"OK\"\n```\n In the chkDate.py file, I wrote the code to get the current date as follows. \n```text\nimport datetime\n\n\ndatetime.date.today()\n```\n In my understanding according to the above test case, the test case file looks for the chkDate.py file and after executing the code in that file it will check that output against the student's output and grade accordingly. But when I tried to evaluate, the following error occurred. So to overcome the file permission issue, added the following code to the vpl_evaluate.sh file as follows. \n```text\n# Adjust the file permissions\n\n\nchmod +x chkDate.py\n```\n Now when I try to evaluate the message displayed in the VPL editor as \" The compilation process did not generate an executable nor error message. \" FYI , I also added the files to keep when running as follows. I can't seem to find a way to evaluate this activity, any help is much appreciated.",

          "Text": "The issue you are facing stems from the fact that VPL attempts to run the source file as is, which may not work without the proper file permissions and, in Python, the inclusion of a shebang line as the first code line (e.g., `#!/bin/python3` ). It's worth noting that, currently, the evaluation program does not automatically adjust file permissions before running a program. Introducing this feature into the evaluation program should be carefully considered due to potential security implications. In this particular case, it seems that you may not need to use the \"program to run =\" option to execute the student's code. If you remove this line from your configuration, VPL should run the student's code for the test case without requiring any additional configuration. However, if you still wish to use the \"program to run =\" option, you can run the student's code by invoking the Python interpreter and specifying the student's file as an argument. You can achieve this by configuring the following settings: Program to run = /bin/python3 Program arguments = chkDate.py For more detailed information, you can refer to the VPL documentation at https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/biotes.html . I hope this guidance helps you resolve the evaluation issue with your Python activity on VPL. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos.",

However, it's crucial to understand that there are three distinct levels of resource limits to consider: VPL Execution Server Level: The first level of resource limitation is at the VPL execution server. You can configure resource limits at this level, and details on how to do so can be found in the official documentation here: VPL Execution Server Configuration . Moodle Plugin Configuration Level: The second level involves setting resource limits at the Moodle level through plugin configuration. You can explore the necessary configurations in the plugin's global settings. Refer to this link for more information: Moodle Plugin Configuration . VPL Activity Level: Finally, the third level of resource limits is at the VPL activity level within the activity settings. It's important to understand that the most restrictive limit among these three levels will be applied when executing VPL activities . You can find additional details on this level of configuration here: VPL Activity Level Configuration . In summary, while there isn't a fixed hard limit for memory allocation, the resource limits imposed by the three levels mentioned above collectively determine the maximum memory available. To extend this limit, you should carefully adjust these configurations as per your requirements, keeping in mind that the most restrictive setting will take precedence.",

I recommend configuring the VPL execution service to use different ports, such as 8080 and 8090. You can usually set this in the configuration file of the VPL Jail System. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/configuration.html#network-parameters Missing Certificate Files : The logs indicate that the VPL Jail System service is failing to find a required certificate file. Ensure that the SSL certificate file paths are correctly specified in the VPL Jail System's configuration file. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/configuration.html#ssl-cert-file For more details , see documentation at https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/ I hope this assists you in resolving your problem.

In my case, I have a VPL with several files containing C source code, e.g. task1.c, task2.c, task3.c etc. Each source file is a task on its own and thus each file contains a main function. Since the standard build / launch script (blank vpl_run.sh) compiles all source files present, the linker complains about multiple definitions of main. The easiest way of interaction for the student would be to see only the currently edited file to be compiled and executed, leaving all other files untouched. Since I use a custom build / launch script, I was thinking about a special environment variable containing the path to this specific source file. Do you think it would be feasible to add such a variable? Best regards Kay Otto",

To address your query regarding the back-and-forth communication: While VPL doesn't support this directly, it is flexible enough to facilitate your approach with some adjustments. To achieve this, you will need to modify the `vpl_run.sh` script. The goal is to generate an executable named either `vpl_execution` or `vpl_wexecution`. In this context , the executable will be a bash script. Within this bash script, you should set up two programs, one for posing questions (`ask`) and another for responding (`answer`). Additionally, you must create two named pipes (FIFOs) to facilitate communication between these programs. Here's a basic outline: \n```text\nmkfifo pipe1\n\n\nmkfifo pipe2\n\n\nask   < pipe1 > pipe2 &\n\n\nanswer < pipe2 > pipe1\n```\n Note that the entire program will conclude when the `answer` program finishes. I hope this provides a clear direction for your project. Please let me know if you have further questions. Kind regards, Juan Carlos.",

I would like to use VPL to propose some challenges to my students in my algorithms and abstract data type course. To be pertinent, the challenge must treat large (up to 10 to 20MB) files as input. My problem is that the files are displayed in the main page of the activity : the page is thus quite slow to load (a few seconds). The IDE is also slow when I want to save a file, it seems that all the files are saved even if only one single file is modified ? Here is my question : how could I solved these slowdown issues ? One solution could be to create my instance files on the fly, but maybe there is a better solution or a configuration that I missed ?",

Thank you for bringing up your concerns regarding the page load speed and file saving behavior. I'd like to address each point: Slow Page Load for Showing Large Files: The delay you are experiencing is due to the system is interpreting unknown file types as code files, thus attempting to render them. Solution for Slow Page Load: To circumvent this issue, you can rename the files with a .bin extension. This will mark the files as binary, and the description page and editor will not attempt to display their content. To add these .bin files to the editor, you can use the drag-and-drop feature or the import functionality. Required vs. Execution Files: You don't necessarily need to add these large files to the \"Required files\" section. Adding them to the \"Execution files\" section and marking them as \"Files to keep when running\" will suffice for your purposes. File Saving Behavior: The editor, by design, saves all the files every time you execute a save command, regardless of whether a single file or multiple files have been modified. I hope this addresses your concerns and assists you in efficiently using VPL for your educational needs. If you have further questions or require additional clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

It's important to note that these problems manifest both when using the exercise within a \"normal Moodle\" task and when coding directly within the question bank. Consequently, it seems that this issue is affecting various aspects of the platform. Additionally, I must emphasize that if I attempt to utilize my own VPL jail servers and then endeavor to save a question bank (for example, by modifying some pre-existing questions), my entire Moodle instance experiences a collapse. This results in a lack of response and a \"504 Gateway Time-out\" error. After several minutes (approximately 2-3 minutes), Moodle comes back. Regrettably, the changes to the questions are not saved.

Unfortunately, I've been trying various things related to this all day, and I haven't been able to fix anything. I can say that when using reverse proxy with Nginx Proxy Manager, the option to allow Websockets is enabled by default. However, either that's not the problem, or there are other issues related to my router or Ubuntu installations. To be honest, I couldn't find any clear solutions after researching online and trying different things. At the same time, I'm considering other ways to solve the problem. As I mentioned in the original post, I have Ubuntu installed on one computer and VPL Jail on another computer, which means they are on the same network but not on the same IP. Do the rest of you (those reading this) have both of these things in the same location? If that's the case and it doesn't cause any issues, my last option would be to migrate Moodle to the same computer as VPL (not the other way around, because I'm using Ubuntu 22.04 and unfortunately can't install VPL Jail on it).

          "Text": "Dear Pius, In order to conduct a more thorough investigation into the issue you're encountering with the VPL Jail System, I would require some additional details. This would greatly assist in pinpointing potential misconfigurations or compatibility issues: Operating System Version: Could you kindly provide the exact version of the operating systems you've tried (both CentOS and Ubuntu)? This will help ascertain if there are any known compatibility issues with those specific versions. VPL Jail System Configuration: Please share the configuration settings of the VPL Jail System. If there are any sensitive or private details in the configuration, you may omit them or replace them with placeholders. Ensure that you provide details related to file system mounts, permissions, and any other settings that might be relevant to this issue. Service Details: It would also be beneficial to know how the VPL Jail System service is being started. Is it being initiated automatically upon boot, or are you starting it manually? Additionally, please provide any service override configurations, if they exist. Recent Changes: Were there any recent updates or changes made to the system prior to the appearance of this issue? Sometimes, even unrelated changes might have unforeseen consequences. Once I have this information, I'll be in a better position to further diagnose the problem and offer potential solutions. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

It is imperative to employ the `end_of_jails` command as last line to ensure that other execution servers are not inadvertently used. Furthermore, I recommend leveraging the \"based on\" feature. This allows you to easily modify configurations by using one as a foundation for all subsequent activities pertaining to the same programming language. For more detailed information, please refer to the following documentation: https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/advancedfeatures.html#local-execution-servers and https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-3.4.3+/advancedfeatures.html#the-based-on-feature Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

Kindly ensure that your machine has direct and unrestricted access to the execution server. Additionally, it is worth noting that certain browsers limit WebSocket connections to only encrypted (ciphered) connections. If you are utilizing an unencrypted (unciphered) connection, this could be the root cause of the problem. To further diagnose this, I recommend inspecting the JavaScript console of your browser when the issue manifests.",

There are cases with correct quiestions that are marked as wrong one time and then correct the second time. 5) When re- evaluating I sometimes get the following error \"Error: mdb->get_record() found more than one record! line 1636 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to debugging() line 1596 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_ sql () line 58 of /mod/vpl/jail/running_processes.class.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_select() line 567 of /mod/vpl/vpl_submission_CE.class.php: call to vpl_running_processes::get_run() line 440 of /mod/vpl/vpl_submission_CE.class.php: call to mod_vpl_submission_CE->cancelprocess() line 273 of /mod/vpl/forms/edit.class.php: call to mod_vpl_submission_CE->run() line 106 of /question/type/vplquestion/locallib.php: call to mod_vpl_edit::execute() line 97 of /question/type/vplquestion/question.php: call to qtype_vplquestion_evaluate() line 109 of /question/behaviour/deferredfeedback/behaviour.php: call to qtype_vplquestion_question->grade_response() line 57 of /question/behaviour/deferredfeedback/behaviour.php: call to qbehaviour_deferredfeedback->process_finish() line 1356 of /question/engine/questionattempt.php: call to qbehaviour_deferredfeedback->process_action() line 1437 of /question/engine/questionattempt.php: call to question_attempt->process_action() line 896 of /question/engine/questionusage.php: call to question_attempt->regrade() line 345 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to question_usage_by_activity->regrade_question() line 511 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_attempt() line 420 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_batch_of_attempts() line 260 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_attempts() line 104 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->process_actions() line 97 of /mod/quiz/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->display()\" The jail servers I'm using is the jail server in spain and a local server in Italy Any suggestion?",

In addition, I attach an .exe file (we program in C/C++) so they can run it and freely interact with the program. Afterwards, they try to replicate it based on their interaction. I do it this way because there are many nuances that are easier to understand and observe through the executable program rather than just a description. That's why I was asking if there is any way for them (the students) to, for example, have a second \"Run\" button that executes my solution code (which obviously wouldn't be visible to them) and allows them to test the program as I explained earlier. (The \"Run\" button was just an example; I would be open to any solution that achieves a similar result).",

That's why I was wondering if, for example, the same code I use in Teacher Correction (where I also check the \"Validate\" option) could be executed by the student (let's say it would be leveraging the execution performed by VPL for validation - I suppose that's how it validates). Is there any Github or available space for the tool where I can make suggestions for implementing features like the one I mentioned?\nThank you very much.",

First, they have to ask how many titles the person wants to enter (number), and then the input \"Enter a title\" comes up as often as the first number mentionned. The output is a list of the titles. As this programm is to see how \"for\" works in python, I would like to get a second exercise with a nicer output: not in a list, but in a row like: title title title And here starts my problem: the output without quotes will also take a list-utput as true. And then I enter quotes, the output is evaluated to false because of the first input (number of songs, you want to enter). Thank you for any help! Luise expected code and testcase: musik = [] anzahl = int(input('How many songs do you like to get in your list?

I thought that with \"input = ...\" I give a fixed input (not coming from the students) and with this input I would like to have a specific output: not in a line or list, but every input as a single output in a new line. My input (via testcase input) is: 3 (number of titles I want to add to the list \"musik\") a (first title) b (second title) c (third title) the expected output is: a b c and I would like to reject with the testcase outputs like: a b c [a,b,c] So, the input is not coming by the students but by the testcase itself. But I can't handle the output. Without the quotes my testcase will also exept the output I would like to reject, this the quotes, my testcase rejects all output I have, also the correct one in several lines.",

Below is the steps for preparing the jail server: Install Xephyr (apt install xserver-xephyr) Modify /usr/sbin/vpl/vpl_vnc_launcher.sh, replace the line \"$HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\" with the following block \n```text\n        if [ -f $HOME/.glx_required ]; then\n          VNCDISPLAY=$(ls $HOME/.vnc/*.log | sed -e \"s/[^:]*://\" -e \"s/\\.log$//\")\n          XEPHYRDISP=$(($VNCDISPLAY+25000))\n          Xephyr :$XEPHYRDISP -fullscreen &\n          while true; do\n            DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP xdpyinfo >& /dev/null\n            [ \"$?\" == \"0\" ] && break\n          done\n          DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        else\n          $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        fi\n```\n For a VPL instance that requires GLX support In \"Execution files\" section, add an empty file called .glx_required In \"Files to keep when running\" section, tick .glx_required In \"Resources limits\", the option \"Maximum memory used\" should be at least 256MB In fact, the workaround is a preliminary work. It has been tested in single-user case (at least for my programs). I am not sure whether it works without trouble in multi-user case. Hope this would help in your case.",

We're using VPL for Java , C and Verilog here at York University and are looking to expand its use because it's so useful.  Being able to harness the student ID would be great. James P.S.

          "Text": "Dear Community, I'm testing VPL Plugin and question type VPL with following settings as a teacher I create an VPL activity. In execution files I create a file called \"createtable. sql \". This file contains sql code which creates a table with some content. then I create a vpl_evaluate.sh-file which contains the cases to evaluate additionally I configure VPL activity according to instruction in: https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_vplquestion then I create a VPL question where students have to put in sql-query (eg: count all lines in table) The question type seems to work correctly (if students write correct sql query, they will get full points). But in the bottom of the question in \"Evaluation details\" there will be shown a compilation error: \n```text\nmv: cannot stat ‘vpl_evaluate.cases_qvpl’: No such file or directory\n```\n \n```text\nmv: cannot stat ‘createtable.sql_qvpl’: No such file or directory\n```\n \n```text\nmv: cannot stat ‘vpl_evaluate.cases_qvpl.vpl_save’: No such file or directory\n```\n \n```text\n\"vpl_evaluate.cases_qvpl\" lost\n```\n \n```text\nmv: cannot stat ‘createtable.sql_qvpl.vpl_save’: No such file or directory\n```\n \n```text\n\"createtable.sql_qvpl\" lost\n```\n I think it is related to \"Execution files: Create a file named pre_vpl_run.sh, and paste the following code in it (this is the code that deals with submitted execution files):\" \n```text\nfor qvplfile in `ls -1`\n```\n \n```text\ndo\n```\n \n```text\n     file=${qvplfile%_qvpl}\n```\n \n```text\n     test \"$qvplfile\" != \"$file\" && mv \"$qvplfile\" \"$file\"\n```\n \n```text\ndone\n```\n Does anyone know how to avoid this kind of error message? We are using Moodle 3.9.16 and latest VPL Plugin, but I don't know exactly the VPL Jail Server version. thanks & br, Anton",

          "Text": "Hello, Intro I was testing VPL for some time and it is a great piece of software. Inspired by its flexibility, together with my colleagues I am trying to connect it in the common workflow with programs we have installed on our server . Our use case is as follows: on our server, we set up a VM with Ubuntu 20.04 64b and latest VPL jail jail server communicates with Moodle without problems, we can run standard software tools and software we compiled and installed in `/usr/local/bin` , for example we have mapped a partition with additional software to be able to access and run the software on the mounted partition, the user needs to be added to secondary group, let's call it `secondarygroup` with guid `2000` `` in Ubuntu VM we are able to add the `vpl` user to `secondarygroup` using `usermod -a -G mygroup vpl` and we are able to run the software. But of course the vpl user won't be a prisoner in the VPL jail. So we need to add all prisoners to `secondarygroup` . Question So my question and problem is: how to add prisoners to (a) secondary group(s) . What I've tried For the purpose of testing I reduced the `MIN_PRISONER_UGID` - `MAX_PRISONER_UGID` range to 10000-10007. I found `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` file, which seems to be executed each time after I run `systemctl restart vpl-jail-system` I modified `set_etc` function in the mentioned file so that `$JAILPATH/etc/group` file has an additional line with `secondarygroup` and `$JAILPATH/etc/gshadow` file is generated (details below) `` Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/ehjSaSoZPX , I also attach the files (before/after) `` Result (VPL in the browser) `` For the testing purposes, I put several command in the `vpl_run.sh` , and the result is as follows: `` \n```text\ncat /etc/passwd : \n\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:10000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:10001:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:10002:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\n\n\np10003:*:10003:10003:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\n\n\np10004:*:10004:10004:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n\np10005:*:10005:10005:prisoner 10005:/home/p10005:/bin/bash\np10006:*:10006:10006:prisoner 10006:/home/p10006:/bin/bash\n\ncat /etc/group : \n\nroot:*:0:root\np10000:*:10000:p10000\np10001:*:10001:p10001\n```\n In the `groups` and `id` I would expect seeing `secondarygroup` , but it is not there. Also, `gshadow` looks like this in Ubuntu VM: \n```text\ncat /jail/etc/gshadow\ncat /var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/gshadow :\n\nroot:::\nsecondarygroup:!!::p10000,p10001,p10002,p10003,p10004,p10005,p10006\n```\n I also did an experiment when no custom `gshadow` is generated, with the same result as above. Summary So it seems that either I am doing something wrong with purely linux-related files that determine user groups or there is something VPL related I am not aware of. Is there any way to add prisoner users to secondary groups? I will appreciate any help.",

          "Text": "It looks like I found a partial solution to my problem. Not sure about its safety, but seems to be working. The trick is to modify and recompile the vpl daemon C++ code so the user GID is always the same (2000 in my case). Technically no secondary group, but I get the group membership I need. Won't work if several groups per prisoner are needed. Procedure: Do all the steps on the installation page until this step . Stop before executing `install-script-sh` . OR simply `cd` to your `vpl-jail-system-[version]` directory you used for vpl jail installation. Find the following line: link `src/processMonitor.cpp` file `processMonitor::becomePrisoner(int prisoner)` method `setresgid` function ( `unistd.h` ) Modify the line: `if (setresgid(prisoner, prisoner, prisoner)!= 0) {` After modification (hard-coded gid=2000 in my case): `if (setresgid(2000, 2000, 2000)!= 0) {` Stop the daemon and backup config if you made any customizations: `sudo systemctl stop vpl-jail-system.service` `sudo systemctl disable vpl-jail-system.service` `` `sudo mv /usr/sbin/vpl /usr/sbin/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/ /etc/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf.backup` Re-run installation script in order to recompile the daemon (respond \"no\" to software & SSL key installation queries if you have them already installed): `sudo ./install-vpl-sh` Edit `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` (fresh one was copied from `vpl-jail-system.initd` during the previous step). Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/1JZPOA982x Before: \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$I:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:p$I\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n After (replace `mygroup` and `2000` as needed): \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        local MYGROUP=\"mygroup\"\n        local MYGROUPGUID=\"2000\"\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$MYGROUPGUID:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        echo \"$MYGROUP:*:$MYGROUPGUID:\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n Note: it is another topic, but you may need to add `set_other /yourpath` in `start_vpl` function and `unset_other /yourpath` in `stop_vpl` function to be able to access custom-mounted filesystems in the jail. Restart the vpl jail service: `sudo systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service` Result (in the browser): \n```text\n+ id\nuid=10005 gid=2000(mygroup) groups=2000(mygroup)\n\n+ members mygroup\np10000 p10001 p10002 p10003 p10004\n\n+ cat /etc/passwd\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:2000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:2000:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:2000:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\np10003:*:10003:2000:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\np10004:*:10004:2000:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n+ cat /etc/group\nroot:*:0:root\nmygroup:*:2000:\n```\n To summarize: I think this is a good enough temporary solution (although with ugly hardcoded gid) but I would be happy to know if it can be done better (or included as a feature in the next VPL Jail release) and about security issues The solution doesn't add prisoners to secondary group. It just sets common primary group for them. Is there any solution for prisoners to belong to several groups? I have no idea what is the purpose of `/etc/shadow` file in the jail context , since both `/jail/etc/shadow` and `/var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/shadow` contain host server users' info and not the prisoners' I think there is a small bug in the original `vpl-jail-system.initd` script. Result is similar to the one above: for `MAX_PRISONER_UGID=10005` , the user p10005 is not added in `$JAILPATH/etc/passwd` and `$JAILPATH/etc/group` . Only the users p10000-p10004 are added. However, the daemon sometimes randomly selects such user.",

We recently started the process of integrating the functionality of VPL into our own moodle and to evaluate VPL concerning its interoperability with other automated grading systems for programming tasks . In this context m y University, in colaboration with many other universities, developed an XML exchange format called ProForma . ProForma is an exchange format for programming exercises/tasks. It formalises the specification of programming exercises, for example, the description, required programming language and suggested tests for evaluating the student submitted code so that exercises written for one tool can be exported and imported into another tool. We are interessed in extending the functionality of VPL so that it would support the uploading and further processing of tasks in our ProForma format, and if possible, we would like to avoid breaking the VPL standard, as we are interessed in making use of future new VPL releases. Therefore, we are wondering if there is interest from the side of the global VPL community to integrate this extra functionality into VPL and if so, we would like to collaborate with the creators of VPL for assistance. That way, everyone could make use of the ProForma format to exchange programming tasks independent of the learning respectively grading platform and we would still be able to rece i ve future VPL updates down the line. Please contact me if you are interested. Best regards, Zaid Akad",

The only way I guess to do this is to discriminate the traffic based on the server name in the URL. I suggest using two names for your server. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

This feature reduces drastically the resources needed on the server and improves development possibilities. Also, this removes the compatibility problems due to the use of a VNC client. Improves and functionalities: - Speed up the task start process - When running, It is possible to edit the code and save, updating code in the execution server without restarting the task. - Do not close the text terminal, to close the text terminal stop the running task. Notice that you can move and change the size of the text terminal. - The text terminal shows the URLs that the browser requests. - For security reasons, teachers must run the web apps in a browser without credentials to access Moodle. To get this an easy action may be to right-click on the open link and select an incognito o private window. Another possibility is copying the URL on the open link and using it in another browser. - You can use the development tools of your favorite browser to debug HTML, CSS , JavaScript , etc. Best regrads, Juan Carlos.",

When the URL that you send to this web server points to a directory the web server searches for \"index.php\" or \"index.html\" inside the directory and served it if the file is found. Notice that the web server does not search for \"index.htm\". The URL send as the first request to the server is the user root directory \"https://servername/\". To resolve the issue you must use \"index.html\" as the starting page name and not \"index.htm\". I don't know if it will be better to use a URL to the first (htm|html) file as the first request. The screenshot that you show indicates you are using VPL plugin version 4.0.1, the last version so far, and the message you get from the execution server that you are using a VPL execution server version 2.8 or higher (maybe 3.0.0).

Here is a minimal example to explain what I mean: - The students are supposed to write the ubiquitous helloworld . - The expected output string is \"Hello, World!\" - They are allowed to evaluate the answer  any number of times. - During the evaluation I want to catch typical wrong outputs like \"Hello World!\", \"Hello, world!\", etc. and give them corresponding feedback, \"Comma missing\", \"'World' should be written in uppercase\", etc. How can I achieve that? My first thought was the vpl_evaluate.cases file, but it is a list of correct cases, I found out. First time user. Apologies if this is a FAQ.

It is possible to only edit some of them. In your case, you only need to edit `vpl_evaluate.sh` All files submitted by the user are available in the environment. The `vpl_execution` file should write on standard output all information regarding the evaluation of the submitted code. All files submitted by the user are still available in the environment. There are several line formattings you should know about: - A line starting with `Grade :=>>` followed by a grade will set the grade of this evaluation. - A line starting with `Comment :=>>` will output a comment visible by the user. - `<|--` and `--|>` can be used to display multi-line comments. - Within multiline comments, lines starting with `-` will be displayed as headings, lines starting with `>` will be displayed as pre-formatted text. Dummy example for vpl_evaluate.sh contents: \n```text\n  echo \"echo Grade :=>> 100\" > vpl_execution\n  echo \"echo Comment :=>> \\\"Well done!\\\"\" >> vpl_execution\n  chmod +x vpl_execution\n```",

I usually use the due date as the last possible date to submit an vpl assignment and I set \"Expect completed on\" a week or two before the due date. I use this technique with other acitivities as well, e.g. quizzes, lessons, ... all of them show up in the timeline block with the \"expect completed on\" and there actual due date as long as the activity was not yet completed. VPL activites are not in the timeline block, neither with their due date nor with their expect completed on date. In the course calendar the due date results in a calendar entry, but again not the expect completed on date as it is, with the other activities. Is there a specific reason for this behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Both VPL and moodle have their latest version installed. Regards Lisa",

I get a popup whenever clicking the save/floppy icon : \"Maximum server post size exceeded. Please, remove files or reduce files size\". However, I can't seem to see any HTTP Request issued by my browser along the way Also, the jail server (2.7.2) I've installed seems to be working fine when I'm testing connectivity with \"Check execution servers\". I've tested the same behaviour with Firefox and Chromium... I suspect some weird issue on the plugin side, and not on the jail server's (there's no request in the jail server happening in its logs). Unfortunately I don't have access to logs of our Moodle PHP server at the moment. Is this a know issue ? Thanks in advance.",

Notice that instead of using symbolic links you also can use the new parameter to indicate to the SSL certificate (fullchain.pem) and SSL key (privkey.pem) files.

          "Text": "HI Visvanath. Notice that if you want to use VPL and Apache at the same machine and Apache is using Certbot to get the SSL certificates the correct way to install VPL is to indicate that you already have certificates and using symbolic links or the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE parameters to allow VPL to get access to the certificates got by Apache. I guess that if you are getting two different certificates for the same HOSTFQDN the Certbot generates two different directories. If you are using Apache on the default ports HTTP:80/HTTPS:443 you must set VPL on two different ports g.e. HTTP:8080/HTTPS:8081. You can also remove the HTTP port from VPL. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-2.7.0/configuration.html#ssl-cert-file Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, I have been struggling for days trying to make our vpl jail server work behind an nginx reverse proxy. Everytime I tried to compile and run a program inside the vpl module in Moodle, I got no console displaying and a logged message \" URL path not found\" in syslog. When I traced connections to the vpl server, I could see that the Moodle server correctly sent the piece of code and all relevant data to the vpl server, but the Websocket connection from the browser to monitor the execution failed. Eventually, I had a look into the source code of the vpl server and discovered that this error message is thrown when vpl is called using a plain http request that do not match robots.txt or favicon.ico. Websocket requests are handled by another part of the code. So, I managed to find why vpl did not consider calls to the monitor as WS requests. It seems that a specific header is used to check if a request is a plain http or WS request. After Qwanting (like Googling, but using Qwant), I found two lines I had to add to my nginx site configuration file to make it proxy requests as WS requests: proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; Now, everything is working smoothly. BTW , I was previously using HAProxy as reverse proxy and it correctly handled ws connections without any further configuration. I hope this will be helpful to other people...",

If this is expected behaviour then it was successful. If this is not expected behaviour then it was unsuccessful. In either case the \"No execution server\" error does not display. Maybe I am misunderstanding the \"Check execution servers: VPL Editor and Compiler\" page. The \"Current Status\" column has a \"Ready\" value, but the \"Last error\" column has a \"request failed: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\" value. I understand the last error and I have fixed that error during the upgrade. The problem, I believe was that the cert.pem file was linked to X.509 certificate instead of the full chain (cert.pem -> /etc/letsencrypt/archive/jailserver/fullchain5.pem). Browsing to both http://jailservername/OK and https://jailservername/OK returns OK. I also confirm that I can access the paths by using wget from a command line from the Moodle server , and it also returns OK.

To avoid the problem, the \"Maximum memory used\" parameter in the site administration vpl plugin must be set to a value equal or lower than the MAXMEMORY in the execution server configuration and the available memory in your execution server. The line with \"Memory requested 2097152000\" shows a strange number of bytes. It seems that your installation has a very high \"Maximum default memory used\" value (site administration vpl plugin setting) and a low MAXMEMORY in the execution server configuration.

I tried modifying the format of the test cases but they still failed. For a while, I thought that the testing system has some bugs, but After many tests, I rewrite from scratch your test and voila the tests worked as expected. ​At that moment I was astonished. I looked for hidden characters in your test code with no luck. Finally, I realized that to represent the minus sign, you wrote a large hyphen from the UTF-8 charset (\\342) instead of the common hyphen of the ASCII table with char code 45. You can see that the hyphen near the 1.0 is a little bit larger than the hyphen near the 2.0 Please, use the common hyphen to represent the minus sign and the problem will vanish.

But as soon as I am trying to grade the tests based on the Moodle Plugin vpl_question, I get the error: \"An error occured during question grading (no grade obtained)\". I tried to debug this (debug level 8 on the jail server ), which shows me that the files are uploaded as expected, the output of the test result is written into the log entry also. But it seems that this result is not transferred back to the moodle server correctly. I get the same error when I activate the checkbox \"Validate\" inside the question activity, as soon as I try to save the question. Can you please help me in solving this problem? Many thanks!

          "Text": "Hi Astor Bizard and Alexandre Meslé, Thanks for the help. I worked last week with the administration, but I am not an administator. We try several configurations in the global configuration, some stop the pre-check from working, and no configuration could make the grade working. We conclude that should be something in the execution server, since we change the local execution server to http://demojail.dis.ulpgc.es , it works, if we set to our server https://vpl-jail.uab.pt (or http://vpl-jail.uab.pt ) do not work the VPL question, but work the VPL activity. I made now a test, after submiting a VPL question that return no grade, go to the VPL activity and submit the data that was there (from the VPL question), and return the following: Testing 1/1 : 1 <|-- -Summary of tests >+------------------------------+ >| 1 test run/ 1 test passed | >+------------------------------+ --|> Grade :=>> 1 So, it appear that only our execution server and VPL question are not working 100%. I will confirm with the administration, but I think we have the latest version, since the platform have the upgrade last month. I checked the grade in VPL activity and it have a grade, that is visible to the students (but the course is now closed, I am preparing the next semester). I already setup a quiz without time limit, so the students can return and continue, during each module. Thanks to the VPL question type, I could put all content in a single quiz, so I can also make a block with results of top 100 of student progress, based on that quiz. I will keep the previous tool as a backup, but I think this will be a clear better tool/method, since the students are reading and have a zone to write / complete the code and check the result, and I can see what the students are doing. If the problem is not solved until the semester start, I can always setup the quiz without grades, but with that I would lost the top 100, that I think works well in student motivation.

But if you want to check the existence and content of files created by the student code you can use the features of the test cases to check it. For example, to check the existence of a file after a given test, you can: 1- Write a script to check the file's existence and its content. 2- Add a test case that runs the script. The test case after the case that creates the student file. \n```text\nCase =\n Checks file content\n\n\nprogram to run =\n check_file.sh\n\n\nprogram arguments =\n student_file.txt correct_file.txt\n\n\nFail message =\n The file created does not exist or does not have the expected content\n\n\noutput =\n \"OK\"\n```\n The script \"check_file.sh\" that checks the student's files. Notice: first parameter student file, second correct file. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nif \n[ -f  \"$1\" ]\n\nthen\n\n    diff \"$1\" \"$2\" >& /dev/null\n    \nif \n[ \"$?\" == \"0\" ]\n    \nthen\n\n\techo \"OK\"\n    \nelse\n\n        echo \"Differ\"\n    \nfi\n\n\nelse\n\n    echo \"The file $1 does not exists\"\n```\n fi Note: the script and the correct files must be in the execution files and in \"files to keep when running\" Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

I pay for moodle hosting.  VPL writes data files and directories to /repository/moodledata/vpl_data/.  Three times over the past 18 months, directories from vpl_data have gone missing.  The only reason I know this is because I will go back to a previous VPL assignment and find that data is missing:  NO test cases;  NO required files; and NO user files -- all the .java files are gone!  So I contacted the host and they found a server backup.  I replaced the directories and all the VPL assignments worked again. QUESTION:  Have you heard of this happening to anyone?  Do you think the hosting company system is removing the vpl_data directories?  Do you think it is when the Moodle version is upgraded?  Do you have a suggestion of how to prevent this from happening?

          "Text": "Dear Juan Carlos, your above solution seems to be exactly what I have been searching for. However, when I tried it, it does not work as I expected. I have this: vpl_evaluate.cases \n```text\nCase = Checks file content\nprogram to run = ./check_file.sh\nprogram arguments = test.txt\noutput = \"The file DOES exist\"\n```\n check_file.sh \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nif [ -f  \"$1\" ]\n\n\nthen\n\n\n\t\necho \"The file $1 DOES exist\"\n\n\nelse\n\n\n    echo \"The file $1 does not exist\"\n\n\nfi\n```\n --> for start, just wanted to simplify and check if the file was found. When I test this with a simple Python program: \n```text\na = input()\n\n\nf = open(\"test.txt\", \"w\")\n\n\nf.write(a)\n\n\nf.close()\n\n\nf = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n\n\nprint(\"Read:\")\n\n\nprint(f.read())\n```\n or with a simple C program: \n```text\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n\nint main()\n\n\n{\n\n\n    FILE *fp;\n\n\n    char buff[255];\n\n\n    \n\n\n    fp = fopen(\"test.txt\", \"w+\");\n\n\n    fprintf(fp, \"blah blah\\n\");\n\n\n    fclose(fp);\n\n\n    fp = fopen(\"test.txt\", \"r\");\n\n\n    fgets(buff, 255, fp);\n\n\n    printf(\"%s\", buff);\n\n\n    fclose(fp);\n\n\n    return 0;   \n\n\n}\n```\n The message is \"The file test.txt does not exist\" although both programs create and read file test.txt well. What am I missing here? Thank you! Sasa Dumic",

It seems that something (between the Browser and the Moodle server ) is removing the header with the payload size. I don't know the reason.

Also, they think it is petty and that it is some kind of a punishment. I believe that a better solution would be to limit the submissions to X times a day.

I am wondering if it is possible to check the Java or C/C++ style Guidelines. In a first-year subject is very important that students learn a good codification: getter, setter, equals, etc. Is it possible to add this feature?? I find out a book \"developing programming courses with moodle and vpl\" that shows a solution for my purpose, however, from my point of view, it is a bit difficult to do it. And finally, I don't know if it is possible to integrate the PMD analyzer code in VPL (or another one) in which you can set the features that PMD has to check in student programs and VPL returns an error it has not a good codification. Thank you very much and you've done a really good job!!!",

I'm trying to use the forward slash character (/) within a regular expression in the \"vpl_evaluate.cases\" file but \"no test case found\" message is shown when evaluating the output of any student program. I guess there is something wrong when Moodle is processing such a regular expression... For example, the output of the program should be the string \"2/2\" or \"02/02\", i.e., both strings are valid, so I think regular expressions come to play in this case because using exact match we can not define alternative clauses... If I define the following test case: \n```text\ncase = Test 1\n\n\ngrade reduction = 20%\n\n\ninput =2\n\n\n2\n\n\noutput = /(2\\/2)|(02\\/02)/\n```\n Moodle shows a \"no test case found\" message when I tried to evaluate any program. I think the problem is related to the use of '/' within the regular expression, any help? Thanks in advanced! José",

Also the execution server administrator can control the access to the server by configuring the vpl-jail-service. Notice also that by default if your Moodle server use HTTP connection the browser will use not cyphered WebSocket connections with the execution server. Parameters at /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf you can use to control the access to your execution server: PORT : Sets the server port number for http and ws. Default 80. If you change this port only users that know the port number can access using HTTP to your server. In a future version, this access can be removed. e.g. http://servername:34377 URLPATH : Represents the PATH expected in execution requests. It acts as a password, if the URL PATH in the execution request does not match, the request is rejected. By default \"/\". If you set it only Moodle server that uses this URLPATH can use the service. e.g. http(s)://servername/PASS TASK_ONLY_FROM : IPs or networks (type A, B or C ) from which execution requests are accepted. You can set multiple separated by spaces. This parameter only affects Moodle servers, access from clients (browsers) is done using frugal tickets. If this property is not set the server will accept requests from any machine that set the correct URLPATH. Default not set. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

If I try to reduce any of these numbers - the compilation of the second project hangs and I receive a timeout (there is no error in logs, even when I raise log level to maximum).

I tried using this guide which you recommended: http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Tutorial:_Moodle_VPL_--_A_Multi- File_Java_Program_with_Data_File However, even when I click the keep files when running on my text files the VPL dosen't seem to accept this kind of argument as in the guide. for example when I type case=Test 1 input= input.txt output=\"1\" The VPL interprets the \"input.txt\"(which is a file I kept in the execution files) as a string to enter the student program. I would appreciate your help of how to run a test case with a text file of my own. Thanks alot!",

          "Text": "Hello. Ron Viner. I guess that you need (required) to use the standard input to give the data to the student's program. You can resolve this need with this approach: 1) Create a  script \"inputFile.sh\" to pass the file to use as standard input to the student's program. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nread filename\n\n\nif [  ! -f \"$filename\" ] ; then\n\n\n    echo \"Error: file $filename not found\"\n\n\nelse\n\n\n    # Runs student's program with $filename as standard input\n\n\n    ./vpl_test <$filename\n\n\nfi\n```\n Remember to mark \"inputFile.sh\" as \"file to keep when running\". To have the script available at testing time. 2) You must add to each test case at vpl_evaluate.cases file the following: program to run = ./inputFile.sh Example: \n```text\nCase = Test file input\n\n\nProgram to run = ./inputFile.sh\n\n\ninput = data1.txt\n\n\noutput = \"Expeted result\"\n```\n Important: VPL is not ready to evaluate based on the code runtime. VPL does not use a queued execution leading to the possibility that some tasks run in the same execution server at the same time. To palliate this problem the teacher, after all, can reevaluate all the student submissions using a dedicated jail server. In this situation, the evaluation tasks will be run one by one.

Notice that the execution process takes different steps and requires different network connections that need to be established with the same server in the cluster. For example, the evaluation process takes these steps. 1) A user launches an evaluation process. e.g. the user clicks evaluate button. 2) The browser sends a request ( AJAX / JSON ) to the Moodle server. 3) The Moodle server selects an execution server (with retries) and sends the task to an execution server (HTTP/XMLRPC). The execution server generates different security tokens as a response to de request. The task start. 4) The Moodle server responds to the Browser request with information with the \"execution server URL \" and the security tokens. 5) The browser connects with the execution server using the URL+security token and the \"WebSocket\" protocol to monitor the task. 6) When the task end, the monitor sends a request (AJAX/JSON) to the Moodle server to retrieve the task report/result. 8) The Moodle server request the \"execution server\" the task result (HTTP/XMLRPC) with the security token, save it and return the result to the browser. 9) The browser shows the result.",

I then chmod'd 755 both cert files in /etc/vpl/ and tried starting the service and got the same error. Since that still produced the same error (error:02001002:system library:fopen:No such file or directory) I chmod'd them back to 400 (still owned by root, root). Out of frustration with certbot, I then re-ran the vpl installer, chose self-signed cert (NOT LETSENCRYPT) and vpl starts up without changing the .conf???!!!! Question:  The vpl-jail-system.conf file is still pointing to certbot's SSL fullchain1.pem and privkey1.pem files.  Why did running a self-signed cert process through the vpl installer suddenly make things work correctly?",

I'm sorry for being clueless, but I still can't get the debugging to work in DDD inside VPL. * I checked the \"vpl_debug.sh\" option in \"Files to keep when running\", but nothing changes when trying to debug the code in VPL. * I reviewed the \"Execution files\" area, and the \"vpl_debug.sh\" file is empty. I don't know which script should be in it, but it seems that it isn't the same script in \"vpl_run.sh\" file (and that also makes sense), because when doing that the DDD program doesn't even open when trying to debug the code. For example, that's the script (without the enclosing dash characters) I have in \"vpl_run.sh\" file, in the specific example that I used today for tests: ---------------------- #!/bin/bash #load common script and check programs . common_script.sh check_program gcc get_source_files c #compile gcc -std=c90 -o vpl_execution $SOURCE_FILES -lm -lutil ---------------------- * When the \"vpl_debug.sh\" script is empty, DDD can be opened when trying to debug, but DDD displays the following message at its terminal: ---------------------- GNU DDD 3.3.12 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu), by Dorothea LReading symbols from vpl_progr3rn...

Mi caso de uso: case = test input = 5 5 output = 10.0 Mi programa en python es el siguiente. Escriba un programa que solicite al usuario 2 números y cuyo resultado de 10.0. Los casos de uso funcionan cuando los datos del programa son estáticos por ejemplo. a = 5.0 b = 5.0 sum = a + b print(sum) Fallan los casos de uso cuando se solicitan datos al usuario: a = float(input(\"n1>\")) b = float(input(\"n2>\")) c = float(input(\"n3>\")) sum = a + b + c print(sum) Ejecuto el programa, introduzco los numeros ejemplo 5 y 5 y pasa el caso de uso, pero ojo si introduzco un numero mayor ejemplo 6 y 7 sumados daria 13 y tambien se evalua como correcto cuando es totalmente erroneo. Quiero saber si estoy haciendo algo mal, si es configuración del servidor, o si estoy usando la versión incorrecta del plugin. Ojala alguien pueda ayudarme, básicamente el problema se origina cuando se utiliza la sentencia input() de python.",

          "Text": "Q1 Wanted to know how I can add unavailable languages like Ruby or Oracle db. A1 You can install the compiler/interpreter into your execution server and write an execution script. You can know the available languages by creating a file with \".all\" extension and running it. Due that VPL is a stateless execution system, may be difficult to develop scripts to execute Oracle queries inside VPL due to the need of keeping Oracle security/passwords and its and own users. Q2 Can I even evaluate multiple languages in a single program. Is creating a VM the correct way to execute it? A2 The I/O test system is independent of the programming language. The system detects the language used based on the filename extensión. If you want the student to write a program using a mix of languages you need to write your own scripts. Q3 Can I create evaluation scripts directly in the plugin to achieve the same or web services would be a solution. A3 Yes, you can customize the system. But notice that all executions will be done in the execution server. Q4 Any instruction documentation would be great. A4 Sorry for the poor documentation.

I can't replicate the problem then my answers are based on suppositions. I suppose you are getting this message when you are trying to run code? This message is saying that the response from your Moodle, to an AJAX request from the IDE, is malformed. May be that you has your Moodle server in debug mode and some debugging message is interfering with the response. Check your web server log looking for PHP messages related with VPL. The message \"'mode-cases.js' not found\" is generated by JavaScript , but this do not means a problem. The only effect is that the file \"vpl_evaluate.cases\" is not highlighted. 'mode-cases.js' has not been made yet. All installations of VPL 3.1 generate this message. Best regards.",

Two of my students also contributed by adding Scala-Support (however, I should probably send you my updated version of the execution script). Everything is running fine, but apparently since the jail server was updated last time (it's now running version 2.0 I guess) I cannot run and evaluate programmes that need a network connection (the programme under test is supposed to read data from some URL ). With the old version this problem was fixed by copying or mounting the etc/network stuff into the jail. Nevertheless now I get a connection time-out when running or evaluating a programme. However, when I log into the jail server, run \"chroot /jail\" the network seems to be fine. I've also already added FIREWALL=0 to the config file an restarted the service. Any hints on how to enable the network during evaluation? BTW : When I stop the service I get lots of messages saying that /jail/etc/[something] (e.g. calendar ???) cannot be removed, since it's a directory. Should this make me worry in any sense?

          "Text": "Hi Juan Carlos! Thanks for the fast reply! It turned out to be very helpful, since you've forced me to prepare a reproducible example. So I tried to come up with a python sample and figured out that it worked. Then I refactored the actual Scala sample and saw that the problem was not the network but some misleading \" java .lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread\", which doesn't indicate a memory issue but has to do with getting new threads from the operating system. As a consequence I increased the number of processes in the jail config file, but without any effect. More or less by accident, I figured out that one can set the number of processes per submission in the VPL-Moodle plugin. After increasing the number of processes there from 16 to 40, everything worked! So I can only repeat myself and thank you for this great tool! Here's my currently used scala_run script that we use instead of the default one: \n```text\n. common_script.sh\n\n\ncheck_program scala\n\n\ncheck_program scalac\n\n\nAPP=${VPL_SUBFILE0%.*}\n\n\nscalac $VPL_SUBFILE0\n\n\ncat common_script.sh > vpl_execution\n\n\necho \"scala -nocompdaemon -classpath ./ $APP\" >> vpl_execution\n\n\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n Compared to your current default script it assumes that the scala code is an application like follows: \n```text\nobject MyApp extends App {\n\n\n...\n\n\n}\n```\n This is way more common than writing scripts. The file, however, has to have the same name as the object defined in it (in our case \"MyApp.scala\", which is the same as in Java). Then this file is compiled and the app started. Probably you might use this as a new default script! Regards, Peter",

To verify the working conditions of Jail-server, I used the following commands on URL . 1. http://192.168.49.65:80/Ok 2. https://192.168.49.65:443/OK First URL reports \"OK\" on the web browser and the second command (i.e https://192.168.49.65:443/OK ) shows warning report. Here I have attached the error report for your reference. We can execute moodle & jail server inside the college without any issues. But when we trying to execute from outside of our college, it will not execute the coding and also it does not report any error. We thought may be the above warning the browser unable to communicate with jail-server while trying from outside LAN.

To be reachable outside college it will require an alternative/additional i.p. address. Update: Someone on Quora came up with a good analogy: \"So you will see it often, but by and large you can ignore it. If you are not directly connected to the internet, you will usually have an address in this range. But this is rather like a lot of people are called Mum and Dad in their own homes - it doesn't cause confusion because other people don't use those local names.\"",

Both Moodle server and Jail server is working fine inside college (Local Area Network). Without any problem VPL also working.

Now we can access Moodle server outside college but not\nable to run VPL. It doesn't report any error. We thought, Jail server\nalso required separate public IP address.

Now we can access both moodle server and jail server( with help of this command http://server:PORT/OK )  from outside LAN. But still VPL is not working. (i.e unable to run program). Note:\nif we assign demo jail server link ( inside jail server list),  VPL is\nworking and automatic evaluation is done without issues.

I was able to get the java applet editor to run in Firefox on my Mac, but not in Chrome. Perhaps the fault is with Chrome or my Mac, but I just thought I'd let you know. Also, I think \"Editing\" or \"Editor\" or \"Edit\" would be a better tab title than \"Edition\" in your English language version of the module. Keep up the excellent work!",

In my last post I said that the “/jail” would be an adapted replica of the root file system, I omitted that this replica is made automatically by NFS. The vpl-jail-system service is the responsible to prepare the “/jail” directory (make the replica) and enable the vpl-xmlrpc-jail daemon. You can use the command “service vpl-jail-system restart” to check if appear any error messages in this process. If the vpl-jail-system start correctly you must see a read-only replica of “/bin” at “/jail/bin”. To add software to the jail system you only need to add software to the host system. Juan Carlos.",

Or choose compile/run script from a number of existing ones. It couldn't be done in one script since some assignments require one special library, some - another and some no at all. (Of course, it would be better if code for such library could be uploaded by web interface, but not strictly necessary).",

The libraries can be used in two ways: as source code  files of a VPL's activity, (they must be added in the “execution files” configuration page , better in a VPL activity shared as “based on”), or as software installed in every jail-servers you use. To use one assignment for different tasks you can use “Variations”.  The variations define sets of different requirements for an assignment.  Each student will be randomly assigned a variation. Each variation has an identification code and a description. The variation description is shown to the students with the assignment description. The identification code is reported in the vpl_enviroment.sh , so it can be used in the script files (vpl_execution.sh, vpl_evaluation.sh) to do different actions depending on it. Another way to control different task for one assignment may be to write a complex script able to detect the type of assignment submitted by checking , by example,the file names submitted by the student.

Or server where jail service is running?  I am running jail server on separate machine and I configured firewall settings. A1. In this paragraph “server” refers to “jail server”. Q2.    What is meant by \"/RPC\"? A2. The requests from the “moodle server” to the “Jail server” use XMLRPC protocol and “/RPC” is the default path in the URL of a XMLRPC service. Omitting the “-uri” parameter is equivalent to use “-uri /RPC” Q3.   Do I need a value for \"/path\"? What is it? A3. To simplify the configuration you may use “-uri /” then you can use as URL of your “jail server” http://hostname:port Q4.  What is value for \"-uri\" argument? A4. Well, “uri” is the parameter name for the “path” in the URL to the “jail server” (http://hostname:port/path) Q5. I didn't set any *.sh file, do i need them even I want to run each submission alone? A5. The VPL versions <=1.3 always need to setup “vpl_run.sh” file or  “vpl_evaluate.sh”  file to run programs. You may use the \"based on\" option to reduce the script files setting. The VPL 1.4 version will be loaded with default scripts for common programming languages as C, C++, Java, C#, etc. A basic file for “vpl_run.sh” or “vpl_evaluate.sh” for Java may looks like this: =========================== #!/bin/bash #load VPL environment vars . vpl_environment.sh #reset LC_ALL export LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 #Set path to JDK PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk/bin #compile echo \"The first file/class must have the Main method\" javac -J-Xmx64m *.java NAME=$(basename $VPL_SUBFILE0 .java) if [ -f $NAME.class ] ; then echo \"#!/bin/bash\" >> vpl_execution echo \"export LC_ALL=en_US.utf8\" >> vpl_execution echo \"PATH=\\$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk/bin\" >> vpl_execution echo \"java -Xmx64M -enableassertions $NAME\" >> vpl_execution chmod +x vpl_execution else echo \"No compiled or error in file name\" fi =========================== Examples of /etc/xinetd.d/vpl-xmlrpc-jail file: 1) ==================================== service vpl-xmlrpc-jail { … port = 8080 # no server_args parameter … } ===================================== If the server name is “jail1.uni.edu” then the URL to access the service in the “jail server” would be http://jail1.uni.edu:8080/RPC 2) ==================================== service vpl-xmlrpc-jail { … port = 52000 server_args = -uri / … } ===================================== If the server name is “jail1.uni.edu” then the URL to access the service in the “jail server” would be http://jail1.uni.edu:52000 Hope that this helps you.

          "Text": "Dear Udara, I’ll try to respond to your questions but not in the order you ask them. ========== Question 1) what should I do with *.sh files, where should I create those? Answer 1) There are three types of execution you can set for an activity: “run”, “debug” and “evaluate”. The “run” and “debug” actions do an online execution in a console (the console is part of the applet editor). The “evaluate” action does an offline execution and its output is saved as part of the submission. Each action (“run”, “debug” and “evaluate”) has its own script: vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evalaute.sh.  The goal of these scripts is generate a file named “vpl_execution”. This file must be a binary executable or a script and if it exists, after running the action script, it will be run. You may set your script files (vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evalaute.sh) by “updating” your VPL activity and then selecting “execution”. You can't set scripts when you are creating a new VPL activity. ========== Question 2) I got the message stating \"not executed\" Answer 2) This message say that your script linked to the action you request do not generate a file “vpl_execution”. ========== Question 3) What is the purpose of ACodeEditor? how can i use it? Answer 3) Really, to run VPL you don’t need the source files of “ACodeEditor”, the applet code editor. The VPL module already has the “ACodeEditor” compiled.  The source files of “ACodeEditor” are at the download page of the VPL site because it is Open Source as the rest of VPL. ========== The log file you attach says that your Jail server is running OK, so far, but at your post you say that you are trying to run a C program and the file you use was “hello.java”. To populate the script files, you can use the content I have suggested in other messages of the forum. Best regards.",

After the release of VPL 1.4 we will start a 2.0 branch of VPL. We are planning to make a first 2.0 compatible release of VPL before the end of the year.

For security reasons, applets are forbidden to connect to the local machine. Really, applets only are allowed to connect to the server from where they were downloaded. Oracle Java plug-in seems that prioritizes the ban. Best regards. Note: the user can give more priviliges to a Java applet, but I think that in this case it is not needed.",

This version incorporates many new features, highlighting that now you don't need to set up a script to run or debug programs and that you can test students programs without any programming. Has been added default scripts to run and debug programs written in the following programming languages: Ada, C, C++, C#, Fortran, Haskell, Java, Matlab/Octave, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Ruby, Scheme, Shell script, SQL and VHDL . Has been added an evaluation program. To evaluate an student program, it is enough to write a file of test cases. Has been added syntax highlighting for Matlab and Python. Has been added a option to check and report jail-servers availability. The applet, by default, is now launched using the Java Network Launch Protocol. The applet now show figures and play sounds for Matlab/Octave programs. The jail installation script now can install many compilers and interpreters. The vpl-jail-system now are also distributed as LiveCD, allowing easier testing or installing a jail system in a real or virtual machine. This version is backward compatible with previous VPL versions. You can test this new version at the demo site http://demovpl.dis.ulpgc.es/moodle/",

I know that many VPL features need more documentation and your suggestion of using a wiki seems to be a good idea. The three numbers that appear at the similarity function are the percentage of similarity found using three different metrics. Each metric is affected by different patterns of source code change. This information is used to order the pairs of files from most to less similar, but the teacher always has the last word. You can get C/C++ activities; with a similar behavior to what you ask here; taking into account those: 1) You can add files to the \"Execution files\" group. These files will be compiled with the submitted files by the student. These files are never shown to students and they can't override them. 2) You can add the same files of \"1)\" to the \"Requested files\" group. These files will be shown to the students and must be submitted and the students can change its content, but at compilation time, these files will be replaced by the corresponding files in the \"Execution files\" group. 3) You can show code of “1)” in the full description of the activity.

          "Text": "Hi Juan, Thanks for the tip to add files into the \"execution files\" AND \"requested files\" section. It's not pretty but serves the purpose. Must not forget to keep both versions in sync. I have another tip: if you want to test Java exercises where students write \"public static void main(int args[])\" in their Assignment.java code, it is possible to test this by adding a Tester.java file that calls Assignment.main(args) with args set from evaluation inputs. However, the default java_run.sh script may call the wrong main method. So I changed the java_run.sh in moodle/mod/vpl/jail/default_scripts so that IF there is a Tester.java file present, that wil be called as main. #Search main procedure class for FILENAME in $VPL_SUBFILES do grep \"void[ \\n\\t]*main[ \\n\\t]*(\" $FILENAME 2>&1 >/dev/null if [ \"$?\" -eq \"0\" -a \"$MAINCLASS\" = \"\" ]        ; then MAINCLASS=$(basename $FILENAME .java) fi ## jand: Tester is special case if [ \"$FILENAME\" = \"Tester.java\" ] ; then MAINCLASS=\"Tester\" break fi Maybe this helps others writing testcases using Tester files too. Next problem we have is: is there a way to test the student's code for specific constraints like \"must use 1 FOR loop\" or \"javadoc must be present\" or \"maximum of three variables may be used\"? Tnx for any hints.",

At this moment, this feature works only with groupings. It is possible to run a batch evaluation of submissions (at \"submissions list\") At global module setting has been added options to set default resource limits.

The setup is as follows: - Moodle Server: openSUSE 11.4 + Moodle 2.3 + VPL 2.0.2 - Jail Server: Ubuntu 12.04 + Jail system 1.2 Both machines run as VMs, have access to the internet and are accessible from the university intranet only. At the moment we've got two points that we seem to be unable to resolve: 1) Run / Debug When I put in a HelloWorld-application in C or Python evaluation works as expected. The code is executed and graded according to the evaluation cases configured. Hitting the \"Run\" or \"Debug\" button, however, results in a timeout. No console window is shown either. When I try the demo course ( http://demovpl.dis.ulpgc.es/moodle/ ) it works fine - so it's probably not an issue with the browser or Java plugin. The moodle Server is running the susefirewall2 and I've configured it to allow access to TCP and UDP ports 22, 80 and 51001-51500. I've tried both the default run-files and custom ones with the same result. The firewall-log messages don't show any allowed or rejected connections to ports 51001 to 51500 - only ports 22 and 80. The Jail-Server isn't running any firewall - although I've tried activating one to log the incoming and outgoing messages. Have you got any further suggestions based on what differences there are between run/debug and evaluate? 2) Java Unlike the other programming languages, Java code cannot even be evaluated. When evaluating, the JVM cannot start up due to the following message: execution.txt: Comment :=>>-The compilation or preparation of execution has failed <|-- Error occurred during initialization of VM Could not reserve enough space for object heap Could not create the Java virtual machine. Not compiled --|> Grade :=>>0.00000 The settings that I've figured out which influence this are as follows: Moodle -> Settings -> VPL Administration -> Advanced settings -> Maximum execution resource limits -> Maximum memory used: 256 MiB Moodle -> Site administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> Virtual programming lab -> Maximum memory used: 512 MiB Moodle -> Site administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> Virtual programming lab -> Maximum default memory used: 256 MiB vpl_run.sh: javac -Xmx16m; java -Xmx16m Memory free: 1,5GiB I've tried changing these values and also adding -Xms Parameters - but with no different result. I've also tried switching from the standard OpenJDK to the Oracle JDK 7 - didn't change anything either. Running exaclty the same javac-command locally on the machine works without any problems. The only way to reproduce the error-message on the commandline was to add a -Xms larger than 4GiB (Server has only 2GiB RAM). Do you know of any further settings that may be associated with this error or possible complications with the current (default) values? Saludos, Michael",

There is a workaround for this problem: you can code the content of a binary file to (for example)  base64 and decode the file content in the server. The problem here is that you need to change the default script to decode the file. In the next VPL release, the decode process will be added in the default script and all the files with b64 extension will be decoded to a binary file with the same name but with the b64 extension removed. I hope that this help. Best regards.",

Although we have made some progress in this development, we have not achieved a full functional version and does not seem to be near. I will try to answer your questions about java output terminal. A 1. At this moment, you cannot save the program output to a file which is stored in the Moodle server. To get something similar, you must write, in the configuration file \"vpl_evaluate.sh\", the following: ---------------------------- #/bin/sh . vpl_run.sh ---------------------------- this will make that when you push \"evaluate\" the program output will be saved as the result of the automatic evaluation. I add to the list of tasks to be done: to allow copy text from the terminal to the clipboard A 2. Sorry, but the output terminal is almost a dumb terminal and it does not emulate terminals as \"VT100\". This feature has been for a long time in the TODO list and still is there. Best regards.",

          "Text": "Great tip, thanks Juan Carlos! I'm interested only in evaluation, so I tried to create a custom vpl_evaluate.sh script in Python (attached). Although I used correct shebang line, the system still tried to execute it as a bash script. Is it a bug or feature? Anyway, I got around this by adding my testing script as separate file and executed it via vpl_evaluate.sh. But I still have trouble getting the evaluation output right. According to VPL inline help, it should interpret text following \"Grade :=>>\" as proposed grade. But when I'm evaluating, I see all the output from my script as simple text in a box titled \"Compilation\". Have I misunderstood something? I also noticed a confusing thing (bug?):1) Initially I misunderstood the difference between \"execution files\" and \"requested files\". I added my tester script via requested files and as a student I uploaded only the solution file. The system gave me confusing error message about \"incorrect file name\". Actually the first file was left empty (I assumed it will be filled by predefined file content), but second file had correct name. I'm starting to like VPL more and more! (But the road to the enlightenment has been quite rocky ) Aivar. PS. Initially I thought that vpl_run.sh is used when student presses \"Run\" button and vpl_evaluate.sh is used when student presses \"Evaluate\" button. Looks like it's not so simple though. Later I noticed that documentation actually explains this, but maybe it's worth pointing this out more directly.",

In the next version of VPL this problem will be resolved -- Answer to Q2 Yes, the \"misunderstanding\" is this: vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh are script to prepare the execution stage. The result of running one of this script should be a vpl_execution file (script o binary). You can use a vpl_evaluate.sh like this: #!/bin/bash cat >> vpl_execution <<'SCRIPT_END' write here your phyton script file SCRIPT_END chmod  x vpl_execution -- Answer to Q3 (comment) \"requested files\" are the list of file the student must submit. But the teacher can set a initial content to this files, but the student must submit the files. \"execution files\" are the scripts and files that will be send, with the student's files, to in the jail server.  If you don't check it in \"Files to keep when running\", all \"execution files\" will be removed before run vpl_execution. The student must submit all the \"requested files\" and in the proper order (future release of VPL might improve this). The files that can be optional are (\"Submission restrictions|Maximum number of files\" - \"number of requested files\") -- Comment to PS Your initial thought was the correct, but these scripts must generate vpl_execution.

If you want to get activities similar to those of CodingBat with VPL, for example: an activity that asks for the sum of two integers, follow these steps: 1) Add a new VPL activity and write there the problem description. 2) Go to “VPL administration>Requested files” and add the file Sum2.java 3) Edit and write the following code in Sum2.java ----------------------- public class Sum2 { public static int sum2 (int a, int b) { / / Add here your solution } } ------------------------- This will be the initial content file for the student 4) Go to “VPL administration> Advanced settings > Execution files” and add a file called LoadSum2.java 5) Edit and write the following code in LoadSum2.java import java.util.Scanner; public class LoadSum2 { public static void main (String [] args) { Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in) ; int a = input.nextInt (); int b = input.nextInt (); System.out.println (Sum2.sum2 (a, b)); } } This code will pass test cases to the student’s code. 6) Go to “VPL administration> Test cases” and write as example two cases: Case  = Case 1 input = 1 2 output = 3 Case = Case 2 input = 5  -1 output = 4 7) Finally, go to the “VPL administration> Execution options” and set Run and Evaluate to Yes. Now you have a VPL activity with functionalities similar to CodingBat. I don’t know if these steps are too complex but once you do one of these activities it is easy to do a lot of them.

This new version is compatible with Moodle 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, incorporates new features and fixes some minors errors of VPL 2.0. This release candidate version will be the final release of 2.0.3 if no significant error emerges within the next 3 weeks (please report any issue you find). You can download this new version from the VPL site Download page. The bug fixes and new features are the followings: VPL now strictly follows hidden/show grade as set in gradebook \"Activity Description\" shows relevant settings to teachers \"activity description\" shows execution files to teachers At similarity page, teachers can get all the students’ submissions in a zip file. At grade page, teachers can “Copy” current submission to its work area. This allows modifying and testing student’s submissions easily. Add syntax highlighting for Scala language (1) Add similarity checks for Scala and Python languages (1) Fix and improve syntax highlighting of Matlab Fix syntax highlighting of scheme Add code to run/debug/evaluate default scripts to decode of base64 (b64) files. This is an easy way to send binary files to jail servers. Add the German translation (1) Update the Catalan translation (2) Update the Japanese translation (3) Fix group work check for managers to allow editing and uploading work group submissions. (1) Thanks to Lang Michael, Lückl Bernd and Lang Johannes (2) Thanks to Antonio Piedras Morente (3) Thanks to Imaizumi Takashi This new version of VPL is accompanied by the release of AcodeEditor 1.3. AcodeEditor is the applet that let edit the code and run the programs in a text console. The bug fixes and new features that came with this new version are the followings: Add syntax highlighting for Scala language (1) Update Java reserved words Fix minor errors in test cases syntax highlighting Fix Matlab Strings syntax highlighting Fix auto remove spaces Fix cut operation Deactivate Drag and Drop when in restricted mode Released under GPL 3 IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to the security issues emerged in the last two years in the Java Applet technology, the behavior of Java browser plug-in has changed trying to avoid the execution of malicious Java code. These changes require (for a smooth operation) that you keep updated Java to the last version. Any way, you can review and compile the ACodeEditor source code.",

If you set this memory for the heap then you will need a memory limit great than 512M (the execution of the Java VM needs much more). You should be aware that if you do not specify a value for the limit of memory to use in an activity, it takes the default value set in the global configuration of the module (Home ► Site administration ► Plugins ► Activity modules ► Virtual programming lab) (the default value is 256MiB) . The default scripts for all programming languages ​​are located under /vpl/jail/default_scripts The default script for Java uses a heap of 16M I add the default script to run Java programs (VPL 2.0.3). If you need an specific script due to your Jail servers configuration then you can change your default script. If you need an specific script due to your activity, but you plan to use this script in other activities then you can try using the feature \"based on\". Best regards Juan Carlos",

These messages are generated by the default run script that don't find the java compiler (javac) and the php5 interpreter in your CentOS 6.3. The problems may be different for java than for PHP. The default script for PHP tries to call to \"php5\" that for your system may be \"php\" If you are sure that you have installed the java JDK and the php-cli, try writing your own \"run_vpl.sh\" script for a test activity in “execution files” configuration page. You can start with the \"java_run.sh\" I attach in a post in this thread a few months ago. Try removing the “check_programs” lines. After you find the correct script for your installation you can replace the default script in your Moodle server that is located in .../mod/vpl/jail/default_scripts and please post your solution here.

The VPL Jail 1.2 limits the virtual memory of users’ processes (but the virtual memory is not really the memory that the process is using). Java tend to use a large amount of virtual memory, in 64 bits systems Java maps easily more than 2Gb, in 32 bits systems the size of virtual memory that Java needs can be superior to 256Mb. Running java (OpenJDK7 32bit) with your suggested command line option (-client) seems to use around 65MB less virtual memory than without it. We think that it will be better switch to VPL 3.0 + jail2.0 as soon as possible. By default, the memory limit in jail 1.2 is INT_MAX. Add a memory limit in your jail server 1.2 configuration will not change the problem. Best regards",

The module and the jail server are ready to use files in a directory structure but in this first feature release, this is only possible at the editor. You can't upload files to a directory without the editor. 3) \"... installed a lot of GUI-related packages. Can this be avoided?\" The new jail server can run programs with GUI. If you don't use it you can remove it from your jail server, but I think that freeing 1 GB of disk space don't pay the work. 4) \"... Are these meant only for saving students the hassle of installing necessary stuff on their computers?\" In general our students are free to use any IDE, but in the first contact they may prefer an easy to use development tool with few options (save/run/debug/evaluate). They also can work in any PC with a browser and get the bonus of using the evaluation feature. On the other hand they lost the autocomplete features and a good debugger of an IDE. On the other hand, if the student use the editor, the teacher can get a better picture of the students' work (the system keeps previous submissions). The teacher can easily answer questions about a student work without the need of download or run any code in their machine. The teacher can also run easily GUI works as part of the evaluation. We also use the system to do exams under controlled conditions, in these cases the use of the editor is required. In short, many students and teachers use the editor when the job is small or even medium, but this is not commonly mandatory. Best regards",

I agree that often the installation of tools can be too frustrating and sometimes the tools themselves are also frustrating But still, more experienced students do love their IDE-s. Have you considered adding a web API to VPL? This way one could integrate other tools with VPL, eg. there could be an Eclipse plugin for submitting code directly from Eclipse. I've heard that a Finnish company has tried something like that ( http://viope.com/en/schools/news/viope-eclipse-plugin-2013.html ). Currently I'm working on a Python IDE for beginners ( https://bitbucket.org/aivarannamaa/thonny ). In the future this IDE will be able to talk with our own home baked interactive web-textbook: The student logs into the textbook and clicks a special link next to an exercise the server responds with a python file containing a submission URL together with a token generated for identifying this student and this exercise the file gets opened in Thonny IDE (alternatively the student just copy-pastes the url+token from the textbook) the student writes the solution and presses the submit button in the IDE (no login needed here, the token is used for authentication) server checks the solution (possibly inside VPL jail, if I'm able to decipher the protocol) and sends the response to IDE, which shows it to the student (if necessary, the student goes back to point 4) I think the same scheme could work also when you substitute textbook with VPL and Thonny IDE with Eclipse. I could contribute to creating the Eclipse plugin, if necessary.",

There are two small issues remaining: although I set up the plugin to use http, when I press \"Evaluate\" in the editor, it tries to connect to \" https:// <my-jail-server>/OK\" and because of self signed certificate it creates this warning and requires accepting the certificate. Is there a way to avoid this? This is NOT a issue, it is a feature. No matter what type conection you use from Moodel server to jail server (http or https), if you connect your browser to your Moodle server ussing https then the browser MUST connect to the jail server using wss. This is not a VPL elecction is a browser requisite, almost all browser reject to mix https (secure http) with ws (plain websocket), only Chrome accept this mix. In any way, we think that its better to use https and wss with self-signed certificates than clear text. (Unfortunately I don't know much about network stuff, so I'd be grateful if you could recommend me a tutorial or guide for changing the certificate, if that's what is needed). To avoid this you must get a certificate signed by a trusted CA. Also, you can easy customize your self-signed certificates. Take a look to the installation script 'install-vpl-sh', change the certificate information and run the script again (it is safe to run it several times) but before remove the key and certificate files \"/etc/vpl/*.pem\". This will regenerate customized certificates, but this will not avoid the request of accepting self signed certificate. What are the possibilities for formatting the evaluator feedback? When I look at the output of built-in, IO based evaluator, it looks like there is some special markup used that allows to create headings or smth like that. Is this documented somewhere? No, but I write it here. Grade comment (automatic or manual) format Lines starting with \"-\" are titles. The title may end with \"(grade)\". Example:- Error bla bla (-2) Students don't see this discount. The grade (negative value = discount) is used by the button \"calculate\" in grade page. Lines starting with > is shown as preformated text. filename:linenumber generate hyperlink. Thanks for your work again!

The IP of your server (172.16.15.13) is a private address which makes it not accessible from the internet, is only accessible from the same private network. If you plan to use VPL from outside this network, be aware that this IP is unreachable from the browsers and VPL 3.0 requires that the browser connect directly to the execution server. To check if your execution server is running try this command from your execution server console wget http://172.16.15.13/OK or wget http://127.0.0.1/OK if all is correct, you must receive a 200 OK response Best regards",

It took me a while, but everything seems to run fine.   I have a simply python 3 program called test2.py that I am currently using as test: \n```text\nx = float( input( \"> \" ) )\n\n\ny = float( input( \"> \" ) ) \n\n\nprint( min( x, y ) )\n```\n And I have a vpl_evaluate.cases file to test it: \n```text\ncase = Test 2a\n\n\ninput = 3\n\n\n5\n\n\noutput = 3.0\n\n\ncase = Test 2b\n\n\ninput = 3\n\n\n3\n\n\noutput = 3.0\n\n\ncase = Test 2c\n\n\ninput = 1000\n\n\n-1000\n\n\noutput = -1000.0\n```\n When I run or evaluate the script with the default vpl_run.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh, i.e. without specifying them, I get the console, and I can enter 2 numbers and get the smallest one back, and the evaluate gives me a \"0/3 tests fail\" which is good. When I create my own vpl_run.sh script, it also works fine and runs the program in the console. \n```text\n#! /bin/bash\n\n\necho \"#! /bin/bash\"     > vpl_execution\n\n\necho python3.4 test2.py          >> vpl_execution\n\n\nchmod a+x vpl_execution\n```\n However, trying to set the vpl_evaluate.sh script to the code above makes the system hang. A 1-line window opens up and starts showing a counter showing seconds elapsing: \"Evaluating: 3 seg\", then 4 seg, 5 seg, etc. When I look at the vpl-jail-server, I see that a new directory is created \n```text\njail/home/p15913# ls -l\n\n\ntotal 16\n\n\n-rwx------ 1 15913 15913 1559 Jun  7 21:28 common_script.sh\n\n\n-rw------- 1 15913 15913   77 Jun  7 21:28 test2.py\n\n\n-rwx------ 1 15913 15913  360 Jun  7 21:28 vpl_environment.sh\n\n\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 15913 15913   32 Jun  7 21:28 vpl_execution\n```\n but it seems that vpl_evaluate.sh or vpl_evaluate.cases does not get created there. I've been tweaking many different things, but I'm not finding out what the problem is.  It looks like my vpl_evaluate.sh is missing something. Is there something obvious I'm missing? Many thanks for any info/feedback you could share. Dominique",

All types of executions (run/debug/evaluate) take two stages: The first generates vpl_execution or vpl_wexecution, the second executes vpl_?execution.

Your 'ls' may be showing that you are in the second stage. You can go to \" ADVANCED SETTINGS /  FILES TO KEEP WHEN RUNNING\" and set the files that you miss as to be kept.

Nevertheless, I found that apport is logging a normal action in vpl-jail-server as an error. This is my fault I wrote a call to abort() instead of exit(). This problem (the logging) of apport will be solved in vpl-jail-server 2.0.2. Returning to your question, I think that the better way to help you to resolve your problem with vpl_evaluation.sh is that you show the details of the activity you are developing. A backup file with the activity migth be great! if you are using \"based on\" don't forget to also add this activity Best regards. Juan Carlos",

I would like to have students submit assembly language programs, and one of the requirements for one of the tests would be to generate code that as small an executable as possible.  In other words they would have to pay close attention to the size of their code and of their data. I have figured out how to test/evaluate an assembly language program.  That's fine. (By the way, I documented the VPL activity here for those interested: http://cs.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Tutorial_Moodle_VPL_Assembly_Language_with_Output ) Now, I know I could add a new program to the \"Execution Files\" section of the VPL administration block that could get the size of the executable version of the student assembly program.   This second program could easily output 100, 90, 80, 70, etc... depending on whether the size of the student program is within 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, etc.,  of the best size. I would like the output of this second program (with will be a number between 100 and 0) to become the grade assigned to the student program. I'm still very confused about how to write a vpl_evaluate.sh script that would take this number output by the program and make it the grade. Any suggestion or hint? Merci! Dominique",

This will allow to write external clients for VPL (for example: an Eclipse plugin). 2) Adapt the code to running in Moodle 2.6 and 2.7 3) Add default script for Lua, D, Clojure and lisp languages 4) Add support for regular expressions to the default evaluation program 5) Update to noVNC 0.4-173. This fix the keyboard problem 6) Fix minor errors. At this moment there are isn't a Jail server API documentation. But if some people is really interested in using the jail server for other purposes I will write the docs. In any case, it will be of low priority for me at this moment. You always can deduct the API by reading the code of the module. Best regards Juan Carlos",

If you have enough hardware assigned to the moodle server you can install Virtualbox in your virtual machine (yes, a virtual machine into a virtual machine) and install there the jail server. You must be aware of three things: 1) Your jail server (service) must have assigned two ports differents than defaults (80 and 443) for example 52000 and 52001. Change properly the configuration file. 2) Your jail server ports must be accessible from internet (not only from your Moodle server). You can use NAT port forwarding if using in VirtualBox 3) Use the correct URL (eg http://servername:port/path) in the general plugin configuration in the Moodle server Best regards Juan Carlos",

The script \"vpl_run.sh\" is intended to be only for the execution (in terminal) of student's own code. You must copy (or move) your vpl_run.sh to vpl_evaluate.sh. Other comment about the script that you show: I think that is better to use the script to compile the code and after, if all is OK, generate the execution script. VPL processes the output of the script execution (vpl_run.sh,vpl_evaluate.sh) and the output of the vpl_execution on different way. Best regards.",

The problem that you expose here is very interesting and the answer may be useful for many VPL users. The first thing we have to be aware is that If we use the default tester program of VPL, we only can test the response of the program to any input but no how the response has been achieved. The first solution to your problem is that the teacher do a slight revision. This is bad news but not entirely. If we make the proper exercise we can get what we want. To facilitate the automatic evaluation of a exercise it is preferable that every requested element may be checked separately, if necessary we must divide the exercise in various parts. In your case you can separate the \"factorial\" function from the \"main\". To test the factorial we can generate an activity that request the funtion in a file \"factorial.c\" without main (only the factorial function) we add to the \"execution files\" of the activity a file main.c with the main.  To check the main do the inverse. A more complex way, but better is doing your own \"vpl_run.sh\", this way you can fine control the execution and the interface that the student generate. Best regards.",

A simple way to start a own script is to take the default script for the language used as the start point. The default scripts are located in \"/mod/vpl/jail/default_scripts/\". The purpose of the script is to compile or prepare the implementation of the action requested run/debug/evaluate.

Is there a easy way to unroll all the changes the install script made so far to my system? By the way, where can I find uninstall information for both the VPL moodle plugin and the jail server? Thank you.",

Compilation phase: the script is run generating \"vpl_execution\". 5. Execution phase: \"vpl_execution\" is run If you want to run python3: 1) Install python3 in your jail/execution server 2) Make one or more of the following steps 2.1) Change your default python interpreter in your jail/execution server 2.2) Change your file \"vpl/jail/default_scripts/python_run.sh\" in your moodle to generate a vpl_execution that use python3 as interpreter 2.3) Modify python_run.sh as described in 2.2 but save it to vpl_run.sh of your VPL activity. This activity will use vpl_run.sh instead of the\"vpl/jail/default_scripts/python_run.sh\" 2.4) Create a new activity called \"base python3\" follow step 2.3 and then uses this activity as \"based on\" in \"execution options\" in all the activities that you want to use python3.

Generally all the execution/jail servers must be accesible from internet. But only the ports used (http/ws and https/wss) of the servers need to be reachable. In your case, if you don't want to use another public ip, you can set the \"jail server\" to use differents ports (80 and 443) than your moodle server. Configure your virtual machine hypervisor to port forwarding from your public ip (in this case shared with your Moodle server) to your jail server private ip. After that, you must access to your \"jail server\" using the public IP/name with the new port. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Essentially, any time the g++ in /jail/bin is used to compile, the above error is produced. But /jail/bin/g++ is an exact copy of /bin/g++ , correct? And /bin/g++ never produces this error. My best guess is that something is off in the configuration of the jail server. That something isn't getting copied over when the jail server is started that needs to be copied over. That, however, is as far as I got. Suggestions?",

What OS version are you using in your jail server?

The only problem will be that you will get an editor with so many files opened that will be difficult to manage. The file editor of VPL 3.1 is not thought for manage so many open files. There is a workaround that can help you with task of sending so large number of files to the execution server: 1) Package your files  (tar, zip, gz) eg. pack.zip 2) Encode your file to base64 format 3) Rename your encode file to pack.zip.b64 4) Add the file to your activity (import or copy/paste) 5) Add code to your (run, debug,evaluate) script to uncompress your pack.zip before use. Beware that the system will decode from base64 any file with extensión \".b64\" (and remove the .b64 extensión) The next VPL 3.2 will resolve this problem with an editor ready to handle a large number of file (including images and other binary files). I attach images of the new editor in action Best regards.",

I've used client computer from this subnet to access Moodle website. VPL works, I can run tests. 2. Same settings, but this time I've used my home computer and accessed Moodle website through the Internet. I've struggled with WebSockets problem. As I described above, we use proxy (Squid 2) for external access into internal network (where Moodle and jail servers located). And Squid doesn't allow WebSocket connections. So, I've got \"Connection failed\" error in browser's console. HTTPS also haven't solved the problem. And I can't change Squid settings. So, it's the end for this option for me (internal jail server). 3. I've switched back to http://demojail.dis.ulpgc.es Same error: No execution server available: demojail.dis.ulpgc.es request failed: connect() timed out! Seems like cURL methods in VPL classes don't use system proxy settings. When I SSH to Moodle server and execute #curl demojail.dis.ulpgc.es/OK - it works. But it doesn't when client clicks \"Run\" in their web browser. (I use tunnel for SSH) I believe, I should explicity set proxy settings in VPL config files. Please, point me to the appropriate files. Also, you can add proxy field into VPL settings in Moodle in next releases. The code may looks like this: \n```text\nfunction\n curlFile\n(\n$url\n,\n$proxy_ip\n,\n$proxy_port\n,\n$loginpassw\n)\n{\n//$loginpassw = 'username:password';\n//$proxy_ip = '192.168.1.1';\n//$proxy_port = '12345';\n//$url = '\nhttp://www.domain.com\n';\n\n\n    $ch \n=\n curl_init\n();\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_URL\n,\n $url\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_HEADER\n,\n0\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER\n,\n1\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_PROXYPORT\n,\n $proxy_port\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE\n,\n'HTTP'\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_PROXY\n,\n $proxy_ip\n);\n\n    curl_setopt\n(\n$ch\n,\n CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD\n,\n $loginpassw\n);\n\n    $data \n=\n curl_exec\n(\n$ch\n);\n\n    curl_close\n(\n$ch\n);\nreturn\n $data\n;\n}\n```",

With Java tasks, this process seems to iterate over all submissions, but when I check later, some submissions still show the previous evaluation result. When I evaluate those manually, everything goes fine. I made a small test -- when my vpl_evaluate.sh is \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n\n\nprintf '#!/bin/bash\\n' > vpl_execution\n\n\nprintf '. vpl_environment.sh\\n' >> vpl_execution\n\n\nprintf 'echo \"Grade :=>> 1000\"\\n' >> vpl_execution\n\n\n\n\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n then batch mode updates all grades. But when I add java compilation: \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n\n\n# compilation\n\n\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n\n\njavac -d . -encoding UTF-8 -cp .:/usr/share/java/akt/* *.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprintf '#!/bin/bash\\n' > vpl_execution\n\n\nprintf '. vpl_environment.sh\\n' >> vpl_execution\n\n\nprintf 'echo \"Grade :=>> 1000\"\\n' >> vpl_execution\n\n\n\n\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n then some submissions are skipped. When I run the batch several times, then finally all grades will be updated, but it takes quite long time. What could be the problem here? Is there a time limit for running vpl_evaluate.sh?",

I did see connection error message 3 times during the batch processing, but it seems that those students were the ones who did get updated.

I think that the security could be a problem, but I am sure that the execution of external code can consume CPU (eg an infinite loop) and degrade the response rate of the web server. I will try to brief you about the required connections of the vpl-jail-server daemon. This daemon is charge of managing the execution of the code. The source files come from the moodle server as a XMLRPC request by http or https. When the code is running, the server also requires communication with the user's browser by Websocket technology (ws: or wss . Bets regards.",

Change properly the configuration file of the jail server (service). 2) Your jail server ports must be accessible from outside (not only from your Moodle server). If you are using NAT in your guest machine network then you must configure port forwarding: 52000 to guest_ip:52000 and 52001 to guest_ip:52001. If you are using bridge mode then you don't need configuration. 3) Use the correct URL (eg http://moodleservername:port/path) in the general plugin configuration in the Moodle server. The machine name must be equals to the Moodler server. 4) If you are using a firewall in your host machine you must open the selected ports.

This happens every time a student saves his file. Is this normal? Can I prevent the student from doing a submission anytime he saves the file he is editing? 2) I've set the option \"Maximum number of files\" at 1, and after a student submits a file from the \"Submission\" section, by teacher side I see the submission. If the student tries to submit another file, by student side the submission succeeds, even though by teacher side I don't see the submission in the \"Submissions list\". But if the student modifies the file from the \"Edit\" section and saves it, as the point above. Then he is able to submit another file from the \"Submission\" section. Can I prevent the student from avoiding the \"Maximum number of files\" restriction?

I will try now to answer every question A1) This behavior is normal. VPL lacks of the concept of draft or final submission. A2) The \"Maximum number of files\" is maximum number of files the student can upload every time.  If you don't want to keep all the versions you can change it at the plugin setting. A3) Yes, the student can resubmit again the work. Really this is a bad behavior of VPL. We will change this in the next release. All these questions are related to the expectation that VPL would have a similar behavior to the assignment module (task). We are asking help to the users of VPL to guide its development by answering a survey. We have asked about these features in the first question. You can find the survey at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GWIkSi30DQVOAda7L0OvdB-mX6XvHUN53-t255Caq4U/viewform We are sure that the way that VPL is used may be improved. Best regards.

So far this has been working fantastically for courses where the programming assignments involve producing ASCII-outputting applications. For programming assignments that produce graphic applications this was not tested yet. This is now my task: I have been teaching Computer Graphics at the CS undergraduate program for 16 years and the endeavor to revolutionize the teaching strategy is now mine. The course is divided into 3 modules: Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics : Here the students have to stepwise develop an Interactive Graphic System from scratch, including clipping, curves, surfaces, meshes,  stops when they can produce 3D wireframes of bicubic surfaces. We decided to state C++ and GTK+3 as requirements and have tested some dummy assignments on VPL and everything works fine. This is perfect. Light, zBuffer, Shading and Surfaces (also implemented from scratch): same as above. Can be solved on the VPL with GTK+3. Hierarchical Models and Animation : here the students have to use OpenGL . This absolutely did not work on VPL 3 , not even the simplest empty-window opening program. We performed various tests and I will describe each one in the next posts.",

Since the error message hinted at version and extension, we tried two things at once: produce OpenGL code that does not employ GLUT (even if this won't be feasible later for educational purposes - but it is a form to test if OpenGL runs) produce OpenGL  code that does not rely on the possibility of cretaing an OpenGL 3.0 context, but rather has the ability to fall back to an earlier version). We tested the code first on a barebones Linux distribution with the minimu infrastructure and it did run. It did also compile on the VPL server. It did not run on the VPL server. The error message, however, was different this time: \n```text\nInvalid GLX version\n```\n So apparently the application did try to open an OpenGL 3 context, did not succeed, did then try to open an OpenGL 2.1 context and also failed producing this error.

Currently neither the vncserver nor the client support OpenGL graphics. I have been searching for a solution to your problem, especially at server level, but I have not found any. The nearest solution is VirtualGL+turboVNC, but the problem here is the need for a specific client. Sorry, but I think that OpenGL will not be available in VPL in a near future. If you want to try other server side solution and need help, feel free to ask me. Yours faithfully",

From the project's wiki: \"WebGL is a cross-platform, royalty-free API used to create 3D\ngraphics in a Web browser. Based on OpenGL ES 2.0, WebGL uses the OpenGL\nshading language, GLSL, and offers the familiarity of the standard\nOpenGL API. Because it runs in the HTML5 Canvas element, WebGL has full\nintegration with all Document Object Model (DOM) interfaces. WebGL is a DOM API, which means that it can be used from any\nDOM-compatible language: JavaScript, Java, or—if you embed WebKit into\nan application on a Mac—Objective C. Major browser vendors Google (Chrome), Opera (Opera), Mozilla\n(Firefox), and Apple (Safari) are members of the Khronos consortium's\nWebGL Working Group, along with many other 3D graphics developers.\" https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_Started Kind regards, Daniel",

To use TigerVNC instead of TightVNC you must avoid to install TightVNC for the first time, it seem not enough uninstall TightVNC. You must modify the installer to remove the installation of TightVNC. To install TigerVNC go to its home page and download and install the appropriate Ubuntu binary https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.4.3#files I don't know if this solution will be used in the next release of VPL, but at first sight, works.

If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for your jail server then you may have g++ 4.8.2. This compiler support c++1y by using the option '-std=c++1y'. If you want to use c++14 then you need to install g++ 5 or other c++ compiler that support this standar. To use '-std=c++1y' in your g++ you must write a script and add it the vpl_run.sh file of the \"Execution files\" of your activity. Next, I show you a modified version of the default VPL C++ script that uses this option. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n#load common script and check programs\n. common_script.sh\ncheck_program g++\nget_source_files cpp C\n#compile\ng++ -std=c++1y -o vpl_execution $SOURCE_FILES -lm -lutil\n```\n Best regards",

I could find that every time a new vpl activity is created, a new directory is being created in /var/moodledata/vpl_data/ , every time a number incremented. I would like to know how can I get the number associated with a particular activity. Earlier I thought it was one less than the id passed in the url as a parameter, but it is the activity number given by moodle. I would like to know the mapping of an activity to the directory its files are stored in vpl_data.",

I think there is a problem while uploading non-text files like jar and zip.

I am able to get the files he has edited in a sitting as it is being stored in an incremental folders fashion. I would like to get where I can get the other data I mentioned. This will be used for analyzing student behavior and other such stuff. Regards, Rohit",

As a workaround you can use base64 files. From v3.1.4 if you submit (not editing) a .zip, .jar, .jpg or .gif file the system will convert it to base64 and adds \".b64\" to the file name.

If you activate this option, beware that the initial results will not be accurate. 2) Create a dedicated execution server for this activity and assign it as the only execution server of the activity. (Go to the activity administration->Advanced settings->Local execution servers, see help to control the servers used) 3) Check the server with activity administration->Advanced settings->Check execution servers, check that only the dedicated server is used. 4) After the \"timing sensitive assignment\" ends, go to \"submissions list\" and select \"evaluate\"->\"all\" 5) The system will execute one by one all the submissions.

The version at github with higher numbers are unstable. The last change of code about the the connections from VPL to the jail server was done in the 3.1.1 version: -------------- Added a global configuration setting for the type of WebSocket connection (wss or ws) used from browser to the execution servers (contributed by José Norberto Luiz Fernandes Corrêa): 1) Use ws or wss when using http or https to access the moodle server 2) Use always wss 3) Use always ws\" --------------- This modification was done to resolve problems in some network configuration with proxy and/or perimeter firewalls that may interfere with the WebSocket protocol used to connect the browsers with the jail server. I don't think that your problem is related with Ubuntu 14.0.4.3 LTS. if your VPL plugin can use the demojail then it seams related to the network architecture where your jail server is located. To try to better spot your problem try: 1) Using a https conection with your Moodle 2) Change the global configuration setting to the option 2 or 3 You can also, if you trust me, let me test your jail server sending me, in a private message, the URL to acces your jail server. I will use it from a VPL activity on my test Moodle server. Best regards Juan Carlos",

I built my automatic tests based on a test activity , but when I backup and restore  it is left behind. In fact, I want to move it to another course and I do not want to bring previous students assignments. This is the fact why it is not coming in the backup file. To me it is important to have the test activity since I am always improving the tests and the activity itself. If fact I have been inspecting the VPL module code and I realised that the test activity is related to the user that created it, and as such is not backed up with the VPL when I ask not to bring user's data. I think that philosophically the test activity do not belong to a user but to the test activity. I also realised that it is reasonably easy to change that. So my questions to the developers: Do you agree with that?  If so, l can this be changed ? Should I change and send you a patch? Regards, Jean",

The backup of the VPL activity is not related to any user, of course the submissions are associated to their submitter and the evaluator (if there is one). The problem you report is related to the limitations of the Moodle backup. If you have an activity based on other into a backup you must restore both is you want to keep the relation. Beware that this relation is not keep based in the name of the activity it is based on the database row id. This problem is shown not only if you restore an activity without its related ones. It can be seen if you import one activity from other course or if you duplicate an activity in the own course. The reason is that in all this action the restore process is taken and this process can only restore the data selected to be restore. I don't know if try to connect the activity taken the name of the activity would be secure enough. I am open to any improvement, if you solve this annoying behavior, I will accept it. Best regards.",

We then rewrite the vpl_execution.sh so that we compile the files accordingly. At the end of the day we have a single file that is prepared for compilation which includes the necessary tests. As we do thing in C/C++ we  just check if the student handed in the file name X.cpp or X.h and write the includes on the one that ought to be compiled. 2) This second one is nice feature that we are also having a hard time to implement. We haven't done anything for real, but we played with the idea of setting some variables on and external server using wget. We have a script that checks a number of submissions by accessing a webpage from within vpl_evaluate.sh and we increment it using another script. We were trying to emulate what happens on the questionnaire module, but it is far too complicated to put in practice. A nice feature request: To be able to demote the grade by x% per each submission.

The way it is implemented the test activity is related to its creator an any other activity. Then, the way moodle's backup works, it will be left behind if I choose not to bring user data to the next activity (what I do is to migrate a full course from one semester to another and start fresh for the new students). I believe, that the test activity should be part of the VPL itself (like the personalised scripts I write for vpl_execution, or my test cases). In that sense it would be backed up and brought back with the VPL activity. I understand that if there is a relation between two VPLs they need to be backed up together and recovered together. I already asked our local moodle development team to sort it out. As soon as we have a solution I will post it for your evaluation. Regards, Jean",

For example to build an Arithmetic unit he needs an adder. He wants to test the adder on itself at first, and the put into the context of the Arithmetic unit and test again. The solution we built here was to write all the tests (alone and together) and then to build the final test using the vpl_execution.sh.

So, I will supply a class and and run that class. That means that I need to look at vpl_run.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh. I did this successfully with C/C++ last year. For Java, I used the vpl_run.sh file that you supplied in your answer to Brandon in 2010 (see above dated Tuesday, 21 September 2010, 1:07 AM). I updated the path to work for java 1.7, though I don't think that is an issue because both java and javac are in /usr/bin on the jail server. I decided to test it with a normal java program with a main method, that is, without using my main.java file. However it doesn't work. When I click evaluate, it simply displays a popup which counts the number of seconds. If I delete this vpl_evaluate.sh file, then everything works as expected. The submitted program is compiled and run against all the test cases and a mark is supplied. In order to debug the problem, I added a line to type out the vpl_execution.sh file which was created by vpl_evaluate.sh and then I executed that file on the jail server. The java program ran and was sitting waiting for input from the test cases. If I supplied input manually, then the program printed output as expected. In short, when I create vpl_evaluate.sh, the java program is compiled and run but does not seem to be supplied with input from the test cases. Can you explain what I am doing wrong? Thanks in advance, Charlie PS attached is the vpl_evaluate.sh file (slightly modified from your version) Also I am using vpl plugin 3.1.2 and Moodle 2.9.1+ (Build: 20150828)",

I could not make anything work with vpl_evaluate.sh, but if there was no vpl_evaluate.sh, then the following vpl_run.sh worked: ============== #!/bin/bash # compilation NAME=DoubleX javac -d . -encoding UTF-8 -cp . Main.java $NAME.java if [ -f $NAME.class ] ; then printf '#!/bin/bash\\n' > vpl_execution printf 'java Main\\n' >> vpl_execution chmod +x vpl_execution else echo \"The program did not compile\" fi ================== Then evaluation will run as desired. My main program is compiled and run with the student's DoubleX.java file and so I can test it exactly as I would like. It uses the test cases in vpl_evaluate.cases and produces a mark for the students. All the best, Charlie",

The default vpl_evaluate.sh use the current vpl_run.sh to generate the student's program. The current vpl_run.sh may be by default or customized, as you have done. In this case, if you remove your own vpl_run.sh the default script will run your code.

          "Text": "OK Juan, As I said I am writing documentation for some colleagues here to use VPL. What do you think about the text bellow? Does it make sense? ------- Similarity checking in the VPL environment works by doing a syntactical analysis of the code handed in by the student followed by clusterization and metrics extraction on file-by-file comparison. It starts with a tokenization followed by a language-bound syntax normalization on each file within the handed in work. With that  the comments and name identifiers are left behind. After that, files are compared in pairs using a clustering algorithm. This clustering algorithm will match syntactically similar work, which them will be compared upon some metrics. In VPL we have three different metrics, which can be understood from the Figure bellow \\ref{fig:metrics} \\begin{figure}[htpb] \\begin{center} \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{metrics.jpg} \\caption{Description of Similarity Detection Metrics - Picture from The VPL Forum at Moodle} \\label{fig:metrics} \\end{center} \\end{figure} All the metrics will filter out comment and the name of identifiers. Metrics one and two will not be affected by code reorder, while metrics 2 and 3 are affected by size and number of systematic changes, metric one is just slightly affected. Metric one is affected by the complex changes in the expression, while metrics two and three and only affected by the size and number of changes. In practice the there different metrics will help you to assess how similar two handed in files are even if code was re-ordered (Metric 1), and if there are changes in this code what's the size of these changes (Metric 2), and the number of overall changes  in the two compares files (Metric 3). ----- As I said similarity checking is one of the most cryptic part of the VPL environment. To convince people around here I will have to explain some of that. Posting on the forum will also help other to follow and keep it for the posterity. Regards, Jean",

Compile LAMA on one of the jail servers(is it required to compile on jail server itself). 2. zip the compiled binaries(100 MB approx). convert to base 64 format. 3. add them to execution files. 4. unzip and use them. Is there another way by which we can make it available at jail server itself so that we don't have to send the 100 MB file over network every time student calls run or execute?",

You can do this to spot the problem: a) when the system go slow login at the jail server and           run top or ps to see what is loading the system. b) You can obtain a detailed log of the service by starting it in debug mode with \"service vpl-jail-system start -d 8\". The logs will be written in \"/var/log/syslog 2) The check of the memory used by a task is done each second. All task may runs a second using more memory than the allowed.

I think that: 1) I think that to run servlets or JSP you need to start (and stop) a new instance of tomcat for every task, see https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/RUNNING.txt Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances 2) To run PHP you can use the new PHP Built-in web server http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php 3) If you need to see static html files, you can use de default html script of VPL (do nothing) Best regards.

          "Text": "Hi, Let me explain you briefly the changes which we have done in VPL. Vpl is a plugin in moodle but we have changed it as an independent system. Dodo works independently with separate user management. Once the student passes all test cases ,i.e on evaluation if he passes all the test cases   a grade of 100 is generated.This status we have changed as accepted state or rejected state. We wanted to add multiple questions in VPL , So we customized those things in dodo to add as many questions based on our requirement. Since it acts as an individual entity , We wanted to take reports on Individual's performance. We shall soon upload the code in GIT and give you a link. We are giving dodo as an open source to every university in India to conduct their academic lab. We always look forward to help you.",

          "Text": "Hello Deepa, I have not done a load testing on jail servers. But I share with you our experience. Our university (ULPGC) has 20,000 students and use Moodle for all courses. Our Moodle has installed VPL and the tool does not cause a significant burden on Moodle. In our case Moodle is supported with a cluster of servers with load balancing. We use five jail servers with 4Gb and execution 4CPUs each. The load on the jail servers is related to the number of users who perform execution actions simultaneously at VPL and the type of activity performed. Do not require the same resources a console program written in C that a GUI program written in Java. Our experience is that it is possible to perform examinations of activities that required write, execute and evaluate programs in Java (without graphical interface) for 100 students simultaneously with only one server running with 4Gb and 4 CPUs. Note that the requirements of jail servers scale linearly. I think it is preferable to increase the number of jail servers that increase the power of one server. Remember that the system allows you to add and remove jail servers hot. Note that if you use 64-bit OS memory requirements will be much higher than the 32-bit OS to support the same load. In any case, if you reach the jail servers resource limits the only bad thing is that students must retry the action. The last month has been posted a master's thesis (not related with me) that has studied the memory and CPU load on jail servers. Information on this topic is from page 76, but unfortunately it is in Spanish. http://bibdigital.epn.edu.ec/bitstream/15000/11589/1/CD-6512.pdf I hope this information helps. Best regards.",

The algorithm used to balancing the load first ask the selected server if it can run a the new task (test if can give the needed memory to the task). If no server can run the task the system say \"no server available\". If you retry the action the system will retry the test. Answer b) I think that the best way to use a good server is using virtualization software. VMware technologie (vSphere) may be a good solution. Answer c) Currently VPL has a unique load balancing politic. Try reducing the max memory for the tasks you use. The problem you describe are related to VPL not to Moodle, I think that the solution is increase your jail servers (power or number). You also can try increasing the swap area in your jail servers to support more number of task simultaneously, but this can have an bad effect in the performance. Think about the resources needed to run 300 task simultaneously. Best regards. Juan Carlos",

If teste.sh modify \"vpl_evalaute.sh\" (after the move vpl_execute) it will not have effect in the current execution. Answer 2) Every run, debug, evaluate are independent and all files created in the jail servers are removed. Your modified vpl_evaluate.sh would look like this \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ncat >vpl_execution <<END_SCRIPT\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\n. ./teste.sh  1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null\n\n\nif [ $output = \"teste\" ]\n\n\nthen\n\n\n    echo \"Grade :=>>100\"\n\n\nelse\n\n\n    echo \"Grade :=>>0\"\n\n\nfi\n\n\nEND_SCRIPT\n\n\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n Best regards.

But if you want to show a file in the requested files that the student can change we use this workaround: 1) We add the file (e.g. Tools.java) to the requested files, and add a comment that say something like \"the modifications in this file will not have effect\". Notice that the students can modify this file 2) We add the same file (Tools.java) to the execution files. When the system prepares an execution the last files taken are the execution files, replacing any file with the same name, then it will always uses the one in the execution files. Best regards.",

Trying to answer your question: A1) There is no need to be in a concrete programming language. Just one that runs in VPL and that can do what you need. A2) I don't know if the default VPL method that uses I/O test cases is easy for you. If you are trying to test web programs written in php this method may be very bad for you, I think that there is no easy solution to your needs. I am going to give you a good present for your needs. Use the attached \"php_run.sh\" file as execution file \"vpl_run.php\" and you will get an environment to run php web programs inside VPL. Use index.php as start page. Best regards.",

Currently the system don't support binary files then you must convert it to base64 and add \".b64\" extension to the file. The default script will decode the base64. Eg: deepa.jar must be encoded to base64 and renamed to deepa.jar.b64 Best regards. P.D.: The 3.2 version will remove this problem.",

When I tried using sql scripts it open ups sql lite prompt , I would prefer my sql .\" Short answer 1) No, VPL don't come with a script to use mysql with no configuration. Long answer 1) The philosophy of task execution in VPL is that each task must leave no trace on the server where it is running and must not interfere with other possible tasks running on the same or another server. Most database servers are ready to run as a single instance on the machine where they are installed, assuming all its users interact with it. This configuration conflicts with the philosophy of ejecucuión task in VPL. If you can isolate the execution of each task using a single database server you have solved the problem. Furthermore, although VPL don't come with a script to use mysql with no configuration, you can craft a MySQL version that runs in user space, staring and stoping a MySQL server for each user task. Question 2) \"are graphical results grad-able ?\" Answer 2) If you can test graphical results outside of VPL then it is very possible that you can make the same in VPL. You only need to adapt the output to the way VPL gets comments and grades. I can help you adapting the output. Best regards.",

The start and stop process may be slow. Every MySql instance can waste resources, especially memory. Really, at this moment, I don't see an good and easy solution. Best regards.",

But when I use only the local exec. server, I end up in the problem that I mentioned (the files are copied and executed, but the status shows connection fail). With this, I believe that the settings in Moodle may be correct and there may be something that is going wrong in my local exec. server setting. I am using firewall=0.

Somebody move the jail-directory from / to another folder: \"/data„. In „/data“ another partition is mounted. It’s not possible to delete the directory „/data/jail\" because it include itself tons of other partitions which are mounted read only. # rm -rf /data/jail ... cannot remove »jail/usr/share/racket/collects/teachpack/htdp/scribblings/hangman.scrbl“ file system ro mounted ... all the partitions under /data/jail/ are include in the \"/etc/mtab“ and can be shown with \"mount\" command. # mount … /bin on /data/jail/bin type none (ro,nosuid,bind) /usr on /data/jail/usr type none (ro,nosuid,bind) /lib on /data/jail/lib type none (ro,nosuid,bind) ... Even if I remount it read/write I can’t delete the directories. The reason I think is because system folders are linked here. Of course it is possible to simply umount /data/jail/bin /data/jail/usr … I don’t know wether that is dangerous … and besides it is a lot of  manual work. Can you get me started how to delete the „jail“ ? In order to re -install it later on ... Thanks! Sonja",

In case that you are changing (or moving) the jail directory, do not change the config file before stopping the service. If you do a hot change of the JAILPATH, the stop process will not do correctly its work. If you want to change the path of the jail directory, follow this steps: 1) Stop the service (if it is running) sudo service vpl-jail-system stop 2) Edit the file /etc/vpl/vpl-jailsyste.conf changing JAILPATH var to your new directory (the directory must exist) 3) Restart the service with sudo service vpl-jail-system start If you miss the first step then you can go back going to step 2), set the old JAILPATH and restart the service, now you can replay the change process (steps 1, 2 and 3) Best regards.",

The sample r program is as follows x <- 1:10 plot(x) locator(1) q() ============ if the program produces textual output x <- 1:10 x you can even attach the test cases to it case = 1 output = / [1-10] / Jaun , you have created a wonderful piece for education.

I have been experimenting with the demo site and it seems to be just what we need in the CS Dept at the University of Brighton, UK. I want to use VPL to evaluate Java programming assignments but I'm new to moodle as well as to VPL . Using the documentation on your site [1] I've installed the latest moodle, VPL and Jail server, and I'm able to create a VPL activity. Student users can upload files, and Teacher users can see what's been uploaded. Can you point me to a step-by-step explanation of how to set up a VPL Java-based activity, such that I can define some tests for the uploaded files and assign marks automatically? [EDIT] Reading another reply of yours in the forum helped a bit, and I found the Execution Options menu item that looks promising! The \"Based On\" drop down is empty however -- is there where I would specify that this is a Java assignment? [1] http://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/support",

As a work around to your needs you can use the files below. You must go to \"Advanced settings>Execution files\", modify  vpl_run.sh and add CommandArgs.java. The first file \"vpl_run.sh\" changes the default behavior of running the first main procedure found, to running CommandArgs.main. The CommandArgs does the interface from the test framework with the student's program. CommandArgs reads the numbers from the standard input and calls the student's Test.main procedure with the numbers as args. Notice that the code needs that the student's class be called \"Test\". I recomend go to \"Resquested files\" and set there a blank file called \"Test.java\". This prevent that the students write the file name. Best regards.

You can find this format at http://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/support \"Automatic evaluation\" section ----------------------- When an automatic evaluation is done, the output (standard output) of the execution is processed to obtain the comments and proposed grade. The comment format is as follows: A comment line would be a line starting with ' Comment: = >>' . A block comment would be contained between a line containing only '< | -' and other with '- | >' . The proposed grade is taken from the last line that begins with ' Grade: = >>' . If the automatic assessment is set then the proposed grade becomes the final. ----------------------- You must postprocess the Junit output to adapt the results to this format. To get this, you must add code to your \"vpl_execution\". The output of this code could look like this: ----------------------- <|- -Junit result Sumary -|> Grade: = >> 7.3 ----------------------- This approach, of postprocessing the test output, is generic, with JUnit you also can write your own Report and replace the standard one.

I think most would agree that programming is (at least part of the time and for many programmers) a social activity and the better learners get at sharing code, talking about ideas and approaches (i.e. the better they get at plagiarism!), the faster they will learn. The ones who \"cheat\" by teaching their fellows learn especially quickly. But if you set an individual assignment you need to know who did the work... Something that has helped us is an oral test to make sure students can explain their own work. You need to follow through on it and flunk anyone who can't explain what they did... If they know this is coming they make sure they understand what they're doing.",

The evaluate process will not generate a grade due to the lack of \"Maximum points\" field. 2) If you select \"Grade type\" to \"Point\", \"Evaluate\" to \"Yes\" and \"Automatic grade\" to \"No\" VPL will generate a Grade book item and the Evaluate process will propose a grade that will not be moved automatically to the grade book.

The current HTML5 editor in VPL is much better than Java version, HTML5 avoids the annoying difficulties with Java! I am using VPL versions 2.0.3 and 3.1.4, and this year I realized an small error (from one student experience). The problem appears whenever the student try to use space in his file's name, e.g., naming a file as \"even or odd.c\".\n\nTo help you to debug the problem, I copy the messages from both versions (file's name \"even or odd.c\" and click on button \"Evaluate\"): \n```text\n 2.0.9.: Java editor\n  \"Compilation vpl_environment.sh: line 11: export: odd.c': not a valid identifier Error need file 'vpl_evaluate.cases' to make an evaluation\"\n\n 3.1.4: HTML5 editor\n  even or odd.c\n  \"gcc: error: even: No such file or directory\n   gcc: error: or: No such file or directory\n   gcc: error: odd.c: No such file or directory\"\n```\n Probably, the error occurs at the \"Jail server\", since in Linux it is necessary \"\\\" in command line (or \"even\\ or\\ odd.c\"). So, perhaps a simple solution is to use a filter to avoid special characters (when communicating with the Jail server). Best regards, Leônidas http://www.matematica.br http://www.usp.br/line",

The problem are at the scripts that handle the compilation and execution of the program in the execution servers. These bash scripts processes lists of files and the problem is that they use spaces as separators. Other scripts, like the one that compile C, use this list of files as argument to the compiler. The error that you have found is of the second type. To resolve this type of error, I have rewritten the function get_source_files in the  file vpl/jail/default_scripts/common_script.sh. This change solves the second problem, but I still need time to give a complete solution. \n```text\nfunction get_source_files {\n  SOURCE_FILES=\"\"\n  for ext in \"$@\"\n  do\n    source_files_ext=\"$(find . -name \"*.$ext\" -printf \"%f?\" | sed 's/^.\\///g' | sed 's/ /\\\\ /g' | sed 's/\\?/ /g')\"\n    SOURCE_FILES=\"$SOURCE_FILES $source_files_ext\"\n  done\n}\n```\n Note this change is valid for both versions of VPL.

I can't reproduce your problem, but you can try this: 1) Try removing all the vpl_run.sh file content, to grant using the stock vpl_run.sh for Octave/MATLAB. 2) Change the content of vpl_run.sh by this https://github.com/jcrodriguez-dis/moodle-mod_vpl/blob/master/jail/default_scripts/matlab_run.sh 3) You also can send me the activity with the problem (all the execution files, or better an activity backup ) to try to reproduce the problem. Best regards, Juan Carlos P.D.: Knowing that VPL is useful and help to teach programming is great for me.",

I got around the problem by forcing VPL to use the WSS protocol always but it seems when I try run a Graphical script VPL goes back to using the WS protocol which is blocked by Squid. Could it be that when vpl_wexecution is used that VPL isn't honouring the selected Websocket_protocol value (in my case always using WSS)? Best Regards, Philip",

The book is a snapshot as we were working last September. It shows some very different classes being taught using the tool for support. It is indicated for those who are starting with the tool now, as well as those who want to understand a bit more about the inner of the tool. We are already grabbing material for a second version of the book. We already have working examples of how to grade code documentation, to penalize memory leaks, etc. We want feedback and suggestions to see what more can be brought to future versions of the book.

From your post I guess that you have a public IP and you have access to your Moodle server from internet using nat to your local machine. The same way that you have gave access to your moodle server you can give access to your jail servers. You can use the same public IP for your jail servers. The easy way is to setting a different pair of port number to each jail server. Example: Suppose that you have: 1) The have public IP: 193.145.147.130 name mymoodle.site 2) The private moodle server at 10.10.10.10 3) The private jailserver1 at 10.10.11.100 and jailserver2 at 10.10.11.101 Configuration I guess that you have added port forwarding from 193.145.147.130: ports 80 and 443 to 10.10.10.10 ports 80 and 443 then your moodle server is reachable from internet as \"mymoodle.site\" (Configure your Moodle server to use this name) You must configure your jail server to use other ports (e.g.) 10.10.11.100 ports 1000 and 1001 10.10.11.101 ports 1002 and 1003 see PORT and SECUREPORT at http://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/support/2014-09-27-15-06-22/66-execution-server-configuration Add port forwarding from 193.145.147.130: ports 1000 and 1001 to 10.10.10.100 ports 1000 and 1001 and ports 1002 and 1003 to 10.10.10.101 ports 1002 and 1003 then your jail servers will be reachable from internet as \"mymoodle.site:1000\" and \"mymoodle.site:1002\" Now, you must configure your vpl plugin (at the moodle server) to use the jail servers http://mymoodle.site:1000 http://mymoodle.site:1002 It may seems complex to do, but it should work.

To add you new language, by translating your language to one already implemented, you must: 1) Add a new file type/class to the class vpl_filetype in similarity_factory.class.php. Example: 'mylang' filename extension to type 'mylang' 2) Add a new file class called \"similarity_mylang.class.php\" with a class called \"vpl_similarity_mylang\" derive this new class from e.g. vpl_similarity_cpp and replace the init method to translate the $data param, in 'mylang' to C++, and call the replaced method with the new $data.

I have hundreds of vpl exercises and updating each due date is very tedious. I was hoping to change the duedate directly using the interactive mysql shell. Each week, students are paired together in a grouping for that week and the duedate is the same for each grouping. So, the process would be quite trivial if I could find how to associate a particular vpl with a particular grouping . Unfortunately, the only thing I have been able to find is that when a vpl exercise is in group mode, then the worktype field of mdl_vpl is changed. I have looked through the code but cannot spot where grouping is been associated with the vpl event. The thought occurred to me that you might know it off the top of your head and I am hoping you could tell me. Details: Moodle 3.1+ (Build: 20160701) VPL: 3.1.4 Thank you, Charlie",

Every instance of activity save their definition in a record in their own table ( mdl_vpl for VPL) but common information (managed by Moodle) about activities are save in the table mdl_course_modules . This table has a record associate to each activity instance. Fields of this table are: module : Id of the type of activity (associate to mdl_modules.id) instance : Id of the activity instance (associate to mdl_vpl.id for VPL) groupingid : Id of the grouping associate with the activity, Supposed that you only want to assign a grouping to a VPL instance, then you must change the field \"groupingid\" at the record of the table mdl_course_modules associate to the VPL activity that you want to change. The selection of the row to change must be aware of the fields \"module\" and \"instance\" (may be rows with the same value in the instance field). Moodle database schema I hope that this helps.

I can not say when it'll be developed, but I consider it as \"High priority\". A2) Yes. You can follow this steps for every VPL activity: 1. Before students submission period. Go to \"Execution options\" and select No at each option (Run, Debug, Evaluate, Evaluate just on submission, Automatic grade). The students can save its source files. 2. After the submission period. Go to \"Edit settings\" and select the appropriate \"Grade->  Maximum grade\". E.g. to 10 3. Optionally if you want that the evaluation result will be the final grade (without teacher intervention) you can go to \"Execution options\" and select \"Automatic grade\" ->Yes. 4. Go to to \"Submissions list\" and select \"Evaluate -> All\" Notice that you can change the tests and rerun the evaluation as many times as you wish. If you wish to change a particular automatic grade, go to the submission view (click on submission date) and then on \"grade\". If you wish to test the evaluation before show the report to the student set the activity as hidden. I hope that this helps Best regards.",

Similar to how quizzes display feedback in gradebook, would it be possible to display the overall mark from a VPL activity and accompanying comments from teachers in the main gradebook view.  The title of the VPL assignment could then hyperlink to a page that contains the feedback from VPL (expected input/output, etc.) and the specific results of running their code. How does this sound to you?",

Notice that the matching is done ignoring the same chars in the program output. - If the output definition does not match with the cases above, then the type \"text\" is used. Notice that the match is done ignoring not alpha and number chars. In the case that you shown, the matching selected is \"only numbers\" and the separators \",\", \"*\", and \"|\" are ignored.

Also from github moodle-mod_vpl / jail / default_scripts / default_evaluate.sh moodle-mod_vpl / jail / default_scripts / vpl_evaluate.cpp To avoid replicate this process for every activity, it is recommend to use the \"based on\" feature in \"execution options\". I have add to the TODO list for the VPL 3.3 add a feature to facilitate this procedure. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

I feel a little stupid that we went through all this and I've only now discovered a problem I should have foreseen:  Because the results are randomized, the evaluation varies.  In my example above: we test a number between 0-20, and if it's greater than 10 the program outputs, \"$num is greater than 10\", if we omit the other 1/2 of the program which says \"$num is less than 10\"  (meaning it should only give a mark of 50% each time it's run), the rand function is inconsistent in my experience, the evaluation of the student's program varies wildly up to 25% (marks between 36% & 66%/100) even when I generate 100 test cases I imagine students simply re-submitting their code many times and, even though they can't figure out how to get 100%, just submitting their code over and over again till they get the best mark that the rand() function will allow... Any thoughts on my predicament here?  I'm too tired to think more...",

Using a Windows 10 host OS, I have setup Moodle 3.1 on virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 OS and VPL Jail Server on another virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 OS also. For the networking part, I have configured Adapter 1 as Bridged Network and Adapter 2 as Internal Network. The host and 2 Ubuntu machines can talk to each other.  I've tested that through the ping command.  I am able to access also the Moodle from any of the 3 machines (host and 2 guests). For the VPL Jail Server, I believe it is running because when I access the site http://192.168.1.40:8080/OK , the output is also OK. From the Moodle, I also setup the execution server which is http://192.168.1.40:8080/jailserver , where /jailserver is the one I typed in the jail server URL path. The problem: When I run for example a C or Java program, I always get the message \"No execution server found\"  (something like that). Is the design that I am currently implementing is really doable or possible? If yes, what could be the solution? If no, what alternative you would suggest? Thank you very much.",

Then -The report is information for teachers\nbut never must be used as a verdict. - ALWAYS must be one or more teachers\nwhom judge the case. - The teacher must have proofs based\nmainly on the code and not on VPL report. The\nparameter \"Maximum output by similarity\" is used to optimize (mem and\nCPU) the search. It sets a cut point for the report and haves no other\ninfluence. If I set \"Maximum output by similarity\" to 40 and then I\nset it to 45 the new report must be the same but with 5-15 new pairs with less\nsimilarity.

If you write new ones with the same name, the last are taken, except for the predefined scripting files (vpl_run.sh, ...) in this case the new are concatenated. Take the description, but if you write new description then they are concatenated. Take the limits for the execution resources and the file size.

Follow this steps (suppouse the target language is Java): 1) Create a VPL activity named \"Base Java\". This activity is not to be used for student, keep it always hidden. 2) Copy the default java run script from mod/vpl/jail/default_scripts into the vpl_run.sh at the \"execution files\" in \"advance features\". This activity is the base for new customized activities for Java. 3) Create the activity that you want to control (e.g. \"Java1\"). Use the \"based on\" option to derivate from the \"Base Java\" activity. At this moment this activity has the same behaivour than the default action when not customized activities detec Java files. 4) Customize the \"Java1\" activity adding code to the \"vpl_run.sh\" file. For example you want to avoid the exection and evaluation of the student code if the code contents \"customize\". Use this code: #!/bin/bash if [ -f vpl_execution ] ; then grep \"customize\" $SOURCE_FILES > /dev/null if [ \"$?\" == \"0\" ] ; then echo \"message\" rm vpl_execute fi fi Best regards, Juan Carlos",

I installed jail server, MySQL and oracle 11g  onto ubuntu 15.04LTS. Installed oracle XE following this link. http://askubuntu.com/questions/566734/how-to-install-oracle-11gr2-on-ubuntu-14-04 . I managed to connect to MYSQL using vpl_run.sh to execute user queries. But the same was not possible with oracle. It always says sqlplus: command not found . Oracle installation directory /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/ Jail server directory where OS like simulation is made: /home/jail/ But sqlplus command works as expected when logged in as any normal user from shell directly since i've set all oracle related path in /etc/profile. I got the same error even after exporting all oracle related path in vpl_run.sh. When i said /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/sqlplus USERNAME/PASSWORD in vpl_run.sh instead of just sqlplus, vpl reported sqlplus file not found.

All functionalities of VPL work normal when i connect from home or personal internet. But, run and evaluate doesn't work when connected from office network. I also experienced the same issue when trying to connect behind various firewalled networks. I even tried the demo link, but the same problem persisted. The strange thins is that, when i type <URL>/OK in browser even from office network, i get OK response but cannot connect run or evaluate Can you explain why is this happening. Is XML-RPC the cause of problem? Because, my jail server is running in port 80 and my office allows all inbound and outbound connections to port 80 for all URL's except social sites. Is there any workaround for this issue without doing anything with the firewall? It would greatly help me if you could give me your suggestions. I use VPL 3.2.2 with Jail server 2.2.1 and moodle 3.1.

VPL uses common http to connect to the jail server from Moodle (used to get the OK reponse) but uses Websocket protocol (a http extension) to connect the browser with the jail server and is known that some old proxy servers interfere with the Websocket protocol. I think that you must review your proxy configuration to spot the problem. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

We are trying to use it with Sqlite and, after reading some forum, there are no problems. However we want to use it with more data (3 tables with 4000 tuples) and in this case it takes a long time to evaluate, since in each execution/evaluation, the create database script runs. So, we are trying to include the database file (vlp.db not .sql) in the execution files (\"Files to keep when running\") and not to delete it since students will only execute select queries.  Is it possible?  We tried this, but in this case VPL told us \"file is encrypted or is not a database\". We enclose our vpl_run.sh file. Thank you very much, Luis",

The problem here may be the configuration of vpl_evaluate.cases, notice that you can use different types of output test, see \"Creating automated tests\" at http://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/index.php/support For example, if you use numbers only type your test can be flexibles, your students can introduce free text around the numbers. If you want a fixed test you can used exact text using \"exact text\" or *\"exact text\". You also can use a flexible test using regular expresions with /regexp/.

Notice that the execution process takes different steps and require different network connections that need to be stablished with the same server in the cluster. For example, the evaluation process takes this steps. 1) A user launches an evaluate process. e.g. the user clicks evaluate button. 2) The browser sends a request ( AJAX / JSON ) to the Moodle server. 3) The Moodle server select an execution server (with retries) and send the task to an execution server (HTTP/XMLRPC). The execution server generates different security tokens as response to de request. The task start. 4) The Moodle server respond to the Browser request with information with the \"execution server URL\" and the security tokens. 5) The browser connects with the execution server using the URL+security token and the \"WebSocket\" protocol to monitor the task. 6) When the task end, the monitor sends a request (AJAX/JSON) to the Moodle server to retrieve the task report/result. 8) The Moodle server request to the \"execution server\" the task result (HTTP/XMLRPC) with the security token, save it and return the result to the browser. 9) The browser shows the result. In case of interactive execution, the steps 6-9 are replaced with another WebSocket connection to the input/output of the task running in the server showing results/getting keyboard input in the browser. If you get running the load balance system, please let we know. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

For example, if you update VPL you must clear the browser's cache, if not you may have odd behaivour until the browser read the updates files. We will take into account your report, but is dificult to say more if the bug can not be replayed. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Everytime the user data fails to store into vpl_data-->vpl_id-->userdata-->user_id-->submissionid, the submissionid directory is created as usual, but the submittedfiles.lst doesn't seem to contain the appropriate user_submitted_filename like the usual scenario. Instead, it's just empty Also, the entire issue becomes a huge problem particularly when we have drag and drop disabled as the user just gets stuck with the problem with no other option to solve it.",

The buttons has been added to the \"submission list\" There are other features not fully implemented, but these features do not interfere or affect the others. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

In each week, I have a few simple programming exercises for students (between 4-8 small problems). Right now, I'm using one assignment per week (students upload multiple files). I'm considering switching to VPL, but I'm wondering if there is a way to group multiple problem statements into a single VPL activity. Some reasons for doing this are: -  to have the problems for each week grouped into a single \"unit\" so that they are not all showed in the course page; - to have one grade per week (instead of having grades for each problem). I believe I might be able to get this done via vpl_execution script, but I'm wondering if someone did this already. Or maybe you can suggest an alternative to have the VPL assignments for each week grouped into a single \"unit\" (something like pages in a book resource). Thanks.",

For instance, the line: print(1, 2, 3) would print: 1, 2, 3 on desktop, but prints (1, 2, 3) on VPL. Also, when entering something via console, it isn't treated as a String by default.

I changed the course view (under course settings) so that there was one topic per page. Now, I might have 20 VPL  exercises per topic but now it is more manageable as students can see just one topic. Each topic is usually split into 4 sections : lecture, quiz, lab and resources. The lecture contains notes and possibly a video. The quiz uses an activequiz module to cover lecture topics. The lab is where I store the VPL exercises and resources are just for any external resources which might be interesting. As for grades, I use Moodle grade categories and create a category for each week and all VPL exercises go into that category so that students can see the mark for each week. Charlie",

To do that, for each lab class I create a lab \"quiz\" which has 5-6 fixed CodeRunner questions (they are the assignment for that week). I disable question shuffling, enable regular page blocks, and allow students to test the solutions any number of times before submitting. I can add descriptive texts between questions with guidelines for what's next, I can mix programming assignments with other type of questions, and I can display all questions in one page, or grouped questions by categories (eg. introductory, lab work, homework), or one question per page. The disadvantage of CodeRunner is that it has less features and allows less customizations than VPL (it doesn't allow custom evaluation scripts, doesn't have similarity test, etc). This is also an advantage, as I found it easier to setup and work with. I also like it because I can then use same tool for exams (in which case I'll use random questions and shuffling).",

At this moment with VPL 3.3 and Execution Server 2.2.2 on Ubuntu you can: 1)    SWIFT language. The editor can do the syntactic highlighting of the code. To run basic Swift programs, you must install the compiler https://swift.org/download/ and write the script vpl_run.sh to compile and prepare the run of the program 2)    Android. I guess that you are referring to java, I suppose (I really don’t know) that in this case you need to install the compiler, libraries and an emulator for android that allow to run multiple instances simultaneously. 3)    KOTLIN. the next release of VPL will do the syntactic highlighting of the code. You must install the compiler and write the script vpl_run.sh to compile and prepare the run of the program for the chosen target platform. Summarized: VPL, out of the box, can do very few with these programming languages . If you manage to resolve this issues, please share your code and experience. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Thanks in advance, Amir",

Q1) Would there be a way to enter teacher's comments & grades other than writing in the same boxes where the automatic evaluation comments & grades are shown?  I would like to keep them separate. A1) No. At this moment the only place to write evaluation comments is with the automatic evaluation. Q2) There is a technical problem with the comments & grades page (what I reach when I click on the grade in the submission list: the url is .../mod/vpl/forms/gradesubmission.php?id=...&userid=...&inpopup=1).  The page shows a textbox which keeps expanding until it moves entirely out of the screen area.  This happens both on Chrome and IE. A2) I need details of your installation (versions of software) and configuration (language used etc.) to replay the situation and resolve the problem. Q3) I would appreciate an option to download all submissions, in the same way it's done with an ordinary assignment activity. A3) Lasts versions of VPL give you this feature. Better the last version. Go to the \"submission list\" and select the appropriate link/button. Q4) Is it possible to install auxiliary programs on jail server, that my run/evaluate scripts can invoke? A4) Yes, you can install auxiliary programs into the jail servers and use it in the evaluation process. You must customize the evaluation by modifying the vpl_evaluation.sh to use these tools. see details at the \"Advanced settings =>Execution files\" help. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

Re (A3) - the \"download all submissions\" option appears, strangely enough, only after I click \"Similarity\".  Perhaps this is version-dependent, then ignore it. Re (A4) - does it mean that all auxiliary programs have to be included via the \"execution files\" interface?  I have read in an earlier post that this only allows for printable files, so one should use uuencode or something like that in order to install program.  Installing complex programs with several files seems difficult that way.

          "Text": "Here's what I found out about customizing the jail server. When it gets a valid request from moodle, it: forks a new process (still running as root) uses \"chroot\" on the configured JAILPATH (usually /jail) creates a new user & their HOME in the chrooted environment uses \"su\" to switch execution mode to that user creates the files it got in the request (submission and things like vpl_evaluate.sh) inside the new user's HOME runs by default either \" vpl_run.sh \" or \" vpl_evaluate.sh \" then runs \" vpl_execution \" that the previous steps should create cleanup, etc. From this flow, the important step for you is the \"chroot\" & \"su\" one. If you want to make extra files visible to the execution environment, you need to put them in either: JAILPATH and make them world readable(/executable); that way, each execution will see the file \" $JAILPATH/myfile \" inside the execution env. as \" /myfile \" due to chroot, and will have read permissions or in \" /bin \" or \" /sbin \", as these are mounted as read/execute-only inside JAILPATH, so things in them will naturally be visible (and also be in PATH) the submission files themselves, but this is annoying and unnecessary In either case, it would help to customize the vpl_run.sh for your specific type of task, so it symlinks or copies the \" /myfile \" to \" $HOME/myfile \" (will be cleaned up with the whole HOME) for the time of the execution if it is necessary to have it in the same directory or to be able to write it as well. You can do that by putting your own \" ${your_language_with_dashes}_run.sh \" (eg. \" python-with-tkinter_run.sh \") file in this folder on moodle: \" $MOODLEPATH/mod/vpl/jail/default_scripts \" ( repo examples ). Then you will get your own flavor of python from the \"Run script\" dropdown in \"Execution options\" in a moodle VPL activity.",

(2) Regarding the \"plagiarism/similarity detector\", I understand that its function is to generate a similarity report to the teacher.  I have been hesitating about turning this on because I wanted to be sure that results would not be visible to students.  I understand that your intention is that the tool will not \"denounce fraud\" by itself, but I wanted to be sure.  Can you confirm this?   It would be nice to have a little guide to this feature somewhere (not the theory - just usage, what the teacher sees, what the student sees).

A2) Yes, I confirm that this feature is predefined to be used by teachers and the students don't see anything about this report. The standard Moodle archetypes that by default are allowed to use this feature are: 'teacher', 'editingteacher', 'coursecreator' and 'manager'. But notice that a user with enough privileges can grant this capability to any user or archetype. I think that the use of the similarity feature must follows this advices: 1) The similarity report is NOT criteria to assure that a copy was happened. 2) The only trustable report about the possibility of a prohibited copy is the generated by a teacher, based in his own criteria. 3) The similarity report can help the teacher to select what pair of submissions must be compared in detail. Notice that the report can give \"false positives\". 4) The report orders the output from more to less similar. After the ordered pairs, the report shows clusters of similar submissions. 5) The system tries to help the teacher to compare pairs of files by showing it side by side and adding blank lines to try to align similar lines of code. You must click in the similarity rate of a pair of files to get this feature. 6) A common way to study the report is review the pairs from most to less similar and stop reviewing when you found three of four adjacent \"false positives\".

I don't know the detailed format of the test case of Hustoj. Each pair of files is a test case or is a set of test case for a problem? I guess that the reason to use files as input of test case are: 1) The size/number of the files is too large to use one common file of cases. 2) The files have a binary content 3) Your test cases are legacy and has this format Notice that VPL was not intended as a judge system. It (the execution system) does not collect information about the resources used by the tested program. In the future VPL might collect this information to be used as grade source. If Each pair of files is a test case, the way to adapt the format from Hustoj data is generating a vpl_evaluate.cases with exact match test (double quote output definition) and this content -------------------- Case = 1 input=content of the 1.in file, don't use quotes as in output output=\"content of the 1.out file in double quotes \" Case = 2 input =content of the 2.in file, don't use quotes as in output output= \"content of the 2.out file in double quotes \" Case = 3 input =content of the 3.in file, don't use quotes as in output output= \"content of the 3.out file in double quotes \" -------------------- Notice that the generation of the vpl_evaluate.cases file from the “*.in” and “*.out” files may be automated.

Thanks for working on the software! -- Brian P.S. Is there somewhere else besides these forums that can submit bug/etc if I find them?",

          "Text": "Hello José Luis, I assume that you have resolved your previous problem installing the plugin on Moodle. - The answer to the first question Based on your screenshot, I guess you are using the Clean theme. This theme shows a side administration menu. The VPL administration options at the site level are the one at the first part of the screenshot you show. A site administrator can use these options. When a user with teachediting privileges selects a VPL activity, the options at activity level appear at the administration menu. If you use the Boost theme the administration options at activity level will appear at the top-right corner as a gear icon. The current public version of VPL has a bug that makes this action menu disappears at some conditions e.g when you select an advanced menu option. This bug has not been resolved for VPL 3.3.x due to the existence of a simple workaround: selecting again the activity at the breadcrumbs. Nevertheless, this problem has already been resolved for the next VPL 3.4 version. - The answer to the second question This message is saying that you are using an old GCC version < 4.9. You have different options to resolve this problem: 1) Upgrade your GCC to a version >= 4.9 2) Upgrade your O.S. to a Linux distribution with a default GCC version >= 4.9 3) Modify vpl/mod/jail/default_scripts/cpp_run.sh removing the option. 4) Other ways: Se the discussion about a similar problem at https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=154988&parent=1269705 Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

The plug-in worked as advertised, connecting to your jail server. Then I installed a minimum Debian Stretch on VirtualBox and got the jail server compiled without trouble. It needed very few developer tools. The installation also went smoothly, but this time a ton of Debian packages were downloaed in the process. Altogether a surprisingly simple affair. And this is something I was searching for. Few beginner's questions though (I was not too inclined to peruse the 1+ kPosts above): - Can the students too run their programs within the VPL, like what teachers do when they correct the programs? - Rather than uploading source files, can the students type the program into the VPL and run them, like working in an IDE?",

I realized that even SSH server gets blocked locking me out of the headless box. Interestingly if I had a SSH connection open when I start the jail server that connection remains. That is why I didn't notice it earlier. The setup is Raspbian latest (2018-10-09). The installation script runs through any hiccup whatsoever. The only noticeable thing is the long time it needs to get a full collection of Debian packages downloaded. So the question is: Can I get a jail server to run headless?",

So the summary of my various posts last week is, - in Debian 9, Raspbian or MoodleBox, the installation is as simple as running 'install-vpl.sh' as root. - Start, stop, restart the service with the usual 'systemctl start|stop|restart vpl-jail-system' Points to be careful: - if you want the jail server to use a different port than 80 add \"PORT=portnr\" to /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf. - if you don't want the firewall, add FIREWALL=0 to vpl-jail-system.conf. This is only a proof-of-concept. I have no idea how a Raspberry Pi will behave under multiple or big compilations. Thanks for the great work and unbelievably fast support!

It works perfectly in the LAN which is on a private IP address range. My question is whether I can reach it from WAN by through a port-forwarding router? I have set the router so that requests on ports 1-8080 coming from WAN to be forwarded to the same ports of the (internal) IP of the Moodle + VPL + jail server box. I can reach Moodle from the WAN. My problem is, what will be the jail server address for the VPL plug-in? It can't be http://privateip:8080 because the WAN also needs to reach the box. But if I give http://externalip:8080 the initial connection from Moodle does not find the jail server (which is itself). Do you know a solution to this?",

          "Text": "Hello, Regular Moodle assignments have some useful message options for notification to teachers and students when things happen (e.g. the assignment is submitted).  In particular, if you edit the assignment settings, you will see things like \"Notifications -> Notify graders about submissions\". Those notifications are guided by the default site settings (Site Admin->Plugins->Message Outputs->Default Message Outputs->\"Assignment Notifications\").  Messages can go to \"web\", \"email\", \"online/offline\", etc depending on the system configuration.  Individual users can then further customize those default preferences in their own notification area. When editing the settings of a VPL activity, the entire \"Notifications\" configuration cluster is absent, and there does not appear to be any way to configure any type of notifications.  Perhaps I missed it, can anyone provide guidance?  I see an \"emailteachers\" column in the _vpl table but not certain if/how that is used. Usage-wise, it is important that at least teachers get notifications when students submit VPL activities.  Depending on the VPL activity settings, those assignments may or may not be auto-graded, so there is a concrete step teachers may need to take after submission to approve the proposed grade and store it in the gradebook.  Without notifications, it seems that teachers are stuck manually clicking on every VPL activity in the course every day to scan for new submissions.  Hopefully, that is not the desired usage pattern? It would be great if VPL just participated in the existing assignment-notification scheme (using the existing global \"Assignment Notification\" flags and individual user overrides).  Can anyone comment on if this is possible, or the level of difficulty involved with making it happen? I am willing to make some VPL code changes and share the results, if someone can nudge me in the right direction.",

To have the script available at testing time. 2) Add to the start of the vpl_evaluate.cases file the following case. Notice that the case must be the first for avoiding cheating. \n```text\nCase = Test if using function\n\n\nGrade reduction = 100%\n\n\nFail message = Your are using a not allowed function\n\n\nProgram to run = ./checkFunction.sh\n\n\nProgram arguments = functionName fileName\n\n\noutput = \"OK\"\n```\n Change functionName and fileName to the function name and file name to check. With this solution, the VPL default test case system and the shell script do the work. The problem here is that other cases will be also checked. Notice that this type of checks can give false positives. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

With updated security policies, the program execution part of the VPL plugin no longer works. Digging a bit deep, I found that our office security team has blocked all socket connections. Hence, client browser & Jail server communication which happens through WSS ( In our case ) failed. As a result, all programming executions stop with a connection error. I tried convincing my office security team to allow socket connection with no success. I just want to know if there is any possibility of VPL working without a web socket connection ( I read that the earlier versions of VPL did not user web socket.). If yes, what are the changes that would be needed to make it happen? I've been working with Moodle and PHP for a few years now. Hence I have a fair understanding of how things work internally in Moodle. Please suggest the approaches to be taken in VPL and Jail server to accomplish program execution without the need for web socket connections. Adding below my Server details just in case. Moodle 3.4 hosted in AWS ( No option of hosting in local servers ) VPL 3.3 Jail 3.2.2 hosted in AWS DB - PostgreSQL 9.6 hosted in AWS RDS Communication between the web server, client and jail server all happens using valid CA signed SSL certificates.

But protects the systems by removing functionalities when secure alternatives exists seems to not be a good polity. If you are using in all communications point to point secure connections with valid CA-signed SSL certificates, I think (I am not an expert) the communications cannot be filtered stopping only WebSocket connections. Please, check that the configuration of the VPL plugin is properly set to use secure connections: 1. All URL to jail servers must be https://... 2. Configure the plugin to use always WSS (WebSocket Secure). 3. Use standards ports (https 443). Others port may be closed. Some time ago our institution installed a \"smart\" firewall.  This \"smart\" firewall started complaining about VPL communications, it thought that the code that goes inside the connection was some type of attack. The easy solution was to switch to secure connections. Please, let us know if do you manage to resolve the problem. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

We tried installing the new VPL Jail system (vpl-jail-system-2.3.1.0 -- clean install -- used install-vpl-sh) and it ends with \"Error mountig jail dir\" -- the service does not run. Attempts to restart the service all end with the aforementioned error. When checking the /jail directory, it is empty. We reverted to an older version (2.2.2 -- clean install) and that runs fine. When checking the /jail directory, we see that it has several directories (and files) in it such as bin, dev, etc, home, lib, lib64, proc, tmp, usr, and var. Did we miss something when trying to install version 2.3.1.0--What should we do so that we can make the version 2.3.1.0 work?",

The 2.3 VPL-Jail-System uses/requires OverlayFS to replicate the root file system and CentOS/RedHat 6 does not support OverlayFS. Notice that OverlayFS is available from kernel 3.18 (2014). I think that you have two main options: - Keep using VPL-Jail-System 2.2.x and do not install 2.3.1 - Upgrade your system to CentOS 7 (or, I think better, Debian 9 or Ubuntu 18.04) If you really really need VPL-Jail-System 2.3.1 on CentOS 6 you can take the \"vpl-jail-system.initd\" file from 2.2.3 and replace it at 2.3.1 and reinstall 2.3.1 Apologies for the inconveniences.

We noticed that the /jail/home mounted directory got full soon enough (we have around 250+ members submitting). From the config, it seems like by default the tmpfs is used for this mount, and the /jail/home uses 30% of the system memory (which is 4 GB). My questions are: 1. since currently there are many temporary directories created in /jail/home, is it Ok to just clear them? Will it impact any previous or in progress submissions by the users? i.e. are these directories all temporary and can be cleared periodically (the older ones) 2.if we change the config to not use tmpfs and restart the service, will it impact anything? Am asking this as it is a live system and users should not be impacted. thanks for your time. -Vardhan",

About your first question : I don't know from where to where are you transferring the scripts and the cause of the problem you describe. Notice that Moodle and VPL information is based on a DB. In any case, If you want to transfer files (scripts or other types) from an external source to VPL the easy way is going to the execution files and drop it there. If you are working with scripts notice that you may need the use of \"files to keep when running\" option. If you are working with multiple VPL activities that use common scripts or other files the use of the \"based on\" at \"Execution options\" can easily your work. About your second question : I think that you are referring to the installation of packages on your execution server (jail-server). From version 2.3 of the Vpl-jail-system, it is not strictly necessary to restart the service after installing or updating any packages, but in some case, it may be needed to restart the vpl-jail-system to update the change into the jail. In any case, you don't need to restart the machine. \n```text\nsystemctl restart vpl-jail-system\n```\n Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

The issue is with copying files onto the vpl jail server from a local machine. For example, assessment scripts, to be called by vpl_evaluate.sh from Moodle. We save these on the execution server in the directory /usr/share/vplscripts. However, if a file is edited locally and then copied onto the server again, the change does not propagate into /jail/usr/share/vplscripts unless the system is restarted. Is there a way to get overlayfs to update the files in /jail automatically, or whenever it detects a change, or periodically? The second question is similar, we are not seeing new packages added under /jail after they are installed. You said in your reply \"but in some case, it may be needed to restart the vpl-jail-system to update the change into the jail.\" Can you elaborate on which cases it may be necessary please?

This behaviour affects especially to the content of the files and internally to the permissions of files. The tests show that if the content or the access mode of a file in the underlying file system change after been accessed by the overlayFS, overlayFS still show the previous content. This behaviour seems to no effect on new files. The problem can be resolved without restarting the server or the service, but paying a temporal performance cost. The solution is using the file /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. After changing files in the underlying file system (installing/updating packages or modifying files), as root, you may use the following command to do the overlyFS be aware of the changes sync; echo 7 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches This will do the kernel to drop the caches. For a while, the file system will be slower until the system recaches common used data. For more details see https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt . About the effect on the jail of installing packages in the host and with this tested behaviour, I must change my previous affirmation saying that always is better to restart the service or drop caches.

My first steps are done but now i need some help because of a problem running the VPL-Jail- Server with apache as a virtual host . My first approach was running the VPL-Jail-Server with port-forwarding (ports 81 and 444) and it was working fine but because of restrictions of the firewall rules in my school, i need to run the Jail-Server with the standard ports 80 and 443. So i decided to run the VPL-Jail-Server as a virtual host. The URL of the VPL-Jail-Server is \"hnk-code.dynv6.net\" and the browser tests are working properly ( http://hnk-code.dynv6.net:80/ok and https://hnk-code.dynv6.net:443/ok ). I configured the Jail-Server in the VPL-Plugin and i think´ve done it right ( https://hnk-code.dynv6.net:443/the-secret ). But when running a programm there appears this error message: \"You are using an encrypted connection. To use an encrypted connection with the execution servers it is required you accept its certificates. If you have problems with this process, you can try to use a http (unencrypted) connection or other browser. Please, click on the following links (server #) and accept the offered certificate. Server 10\" The certificate for the domain \"hnk-code.dynv6.net\" are on both machines (the moodle-machine with apache and the VPL-Jail-machine). Do you know how i can make it run? Here ist the apache config for port 80 ServerName hnk-code.dynv6.net ProxyPass / http://192.168.0.214/ ProxyPassReverse / http://192.168.0.214/ And this is the apache config for port 443 ServerName hnk-code.dynv6.net SSLProxyEngine On ProxyPass / http://192.168.0.214/ ProxyPassReverse / https://192.168.0.214/ SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/hnk-code.dynv6.net/fullchain.pem SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/hnk-code.dynv6.net/privkey.pem Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf Thank you very much and best regards, Axel",

Activate the Apache Module mod_proxy_wstunnel. 2. Rewrite the URL when the connection is WebSocket. The rewrite must be based on HTTP headers RewriteEngine on RewriteCond ${HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC] RewriteCond ${HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC] RewriteRule .* \"ws://192.168.0.214/$1\" [P,L] As you are using a local connexion I think you don't need to proxy to a secure (SSL) connection (https/Wss).

This problem can be resolved by using a point to point cyphered connection. Https avoids that the firewall can examine the traffic content. Another solution may be that VPL incorporates and internal cipher method to prevent the firewall from thinking that the SQL code is an attack. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

          "Text": "Hi, I am facing an issue since the past few days which I am unable to resolve. My configuration: Moodle 3.7, VPL 2.3.1. When evaluating a submission there is often a server error saying that there was a problem in creating prisoner directory in /tmp. I suspected disk full, but / is at 67% (see the df output below). I usually restart the vpl-jail-system service and it seems to work. However I noticed the following: in /var/vpl-jail-system a lot of temporary user directories (p*) are being created at a time. I have configured MIN/MAX_PRISONER_UGID to 10000 and 20000, and I see that almost 10000 temporary directories are created in short duration, most of (all?) which are empty. (Note: earlier I had set the loglevel to 8 but I read that with loglevel 8 the temporary directories may not be deleted (ever?) so I reset it to level 6 now. Also I have set USETMPFS to false as we have only 4 GB RAM.) I created a cron job to just delete all temporary directories (p*) periodically, but the issue seems to persist. I don't understand where the problem of creating a sub-directory in /tmp comes up. Are there other locations where VPL may be creating such excess resources which we need to monitor? Our system is being used by not more than 30-40 students each day.

I am seeing this error at the line where the input() function is called: 'EOFError: EOF when reading a line'. I am able to take user inputs when I am not using turtle functions in my code and I don't have Tkinter as a comment in the code. I am also able to use the turtle module without taking user inputs and I am able to see turtle output on the GUI. It is just that when I combine both (input from console and turtle output on GUI) that I see this error. In order to get the turtle output on the GUI, I have added #Tkinter as a comment. I also tried moving the input() function before and after the turtle function call and I see the same error in both scenarios. I wanted to find out if there is a script that I need to add to enable taking user inputs for turtle module in Python. Would greatly appreciate your help and inputs. Best regards Smita Shrivastava",

Is there a restriction on the image format that could be used in VPL? I also had a question on Input for Java programs - 5) I am doing a similar exercise in Java where I am taking user input and using it on the UI. For this I am currently using javax.swing.JOptionPane to take user inputs. Is there a similar script that I can use to take user inputs via console and use it for output on the UI?

Once the assessments are over, we will change the test cases, go to submissions tab and evaluate all the submissions. Now the problem is that,  while we evaluate the assessment programs, students can simultaneously work other practice programs. Hence when any user evaluates his program at the same time we evaluate his submission, either one of the evaluation stops midway. Many times this had lead to confusions in assessment grades too.. We tried to dig the code and it looks like the function cancelprocess() gets invoked which cancels the previously executing program of a user. We thought we will comment run() function invoking cancelprocess(), but we do not know the implications of it. I would like to understand the best way to handle this scenario. Can we remove invocation of cancelprocess() in run() method and have a reasonable max execution time limit at the jail server? Or is there any better approaches..? Please help Regards, Prakash Raju",

In this case, the message \"connection fail: error\" comes from a PHP Fatal error due to memory exhausted. To avoid that one PHP script uses too much memory (taking memory needed for other scripts) the memory used by each script is limited by configuration (php.ini). The solution to this problem is to increase the PHP memory limit. Notice that binary files are coded as b64 to be sent in JSON . Due this question, I added \"showing a verbose message for this problem\" on the TODO list. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

          "Text": "Dear Osvaldo, The problem is that the program \"portugol-console\" uses the \"/tmp\" directory in a way that VPL does not allow to use. The solution is to indicate to the program \"portugol-console\" that use another temporary directory. After different\ntries, I managed to run \"portugol-console\" on VPL. I have made the following changes to \"portugol-console\" to get it running on VPL. 1) I have changed the \"caminho*\" vars due to the need to locate the script in another place. Notice that now\nthe location of the Portugol-studio installation is fixed at \"/usr/bin/portugol-studio\". 2) I have modified the launch of the portugol-console.jar to indicate the new tmpdir location using \"-Djava.io.tmpdir=$TMPDIR\" Finally, I have changed\nyour \"vpl_run.sh\" to create the temporal directory and define the TMPDIR var. Also, I added the common_script.sh and replaced your fixed file name for $VPL_SUBFILE0, the first filename submitted. I attached the \"vpl_run.sh\" content. Remember\nto use the  VPL feature \"based on\" to simplify the creation of activities that use Portugol. Best regards, Juan Carlos. \n```text\n#! /bin/bash\n# vpl_run.sh\n. common_script.sh\n\n# Creates local tmp dir\nTMPDIR=/home/$USER/.tmp\nmkdir -p $TMPDIR\n\nVPLportugol=./vplportugol-console\n\ncat >$VPLportugol << 'ENDSCRIPT'\n#!/bin/sh\ncaminho_portugol=/usr/local/portugol-studio\ncaminho_aplicacao=\"$caminho_portugol/aplicacao\"\ncaminho_java=\"$caminho_portugol/java/java-linux/bin/java\"\n\nnumero_parametros=$#\n\ncomando=\"'$caminho_java' -jar -server -Xms32m -Xmx256m -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Djava.io.tmpdir=$TMPDIR -Dvisualvm.display.name=Portugol-Studio portugol-console.jar\"\n\nif [ $numero_parametros -gt 0 ]; then\n    if [ -f \"$1\" ]; then\n        arquivo=$(readlink -f \"$1\")\n    else\n        arquivo=\"$1\"\n    fi\n    shift\n    comando=\"$comando '$arquivo' $@\"\nfi\n\ncd \"$caminho_aplicacao\"\nsh -c \"$comando\"\nENDSCRIPT\n\nchmod +x $VPLportugol\n\necho \"#! /bin/bash\" > vpl_execution\necho \"export TMPDIR=$TMPDIR\" >> vpl_execution\necho \"$VPLportugol $VPL_SUBFILE0\">> vpl_execution\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```",

This change will resolve your problem of endless evaluation, but you still need to resolve other issues. Notice also that if the student's program has an infinite loop your evaluation will not end.

Only files like customEval.py, vpl_run.sh, vpl_evaluate.sh, etc. Are those student submission files located somewhere else in the server? If so, where? What other directory? How can I get to this other directory? Would I have to use the grep command in the code, or the Python equivalent of that? If the student submission files are in there somewhere, I could type in code to copy them over to the temporary directory for the evaluation process.",

Some of the files defined in the VPL Activity do not get packaged for use in evaluation (such as example submission files that can be used for testing purposes), which is what I am trying to do. So far I had to use a separate student account to test it, and the test worked, but now I need to know how to get more new files in besides the main ones and other ones that do get in. 2. Follow up of question 1, it seems like when a student submits a file, and a file of the exact same name is defined in VPL activity, the student's file(s) that are in VPL activity are not packaged for the evaluation and seem to be ignored. Why is this? This test was even done with both files (student's and in the VPL) have the same contents., so is this supposed to be some sort of anti-plagiarism measure? 3. Under what privileges do the scripts execute and the submissions get evaluated? A student can run the evaluation script to auto check their submissions' output, but that student should not be able to do anything that compromises security, such as have access to the execution files in VPL activity.",

Instructor: * Instructor defines a programming homework in the VPL. * Instructor defines a number of files (about 10) that will be used for testing the homework. These files can be packaged in a zip file, or can be uploaded individually. * Instructors loads these files in VPL using \"execution files\" upload mechanism. The instructor can see those files. Indeed, when zipped files are uploaded, the VPL automatically unzips them and shows them. Student: * Implements the programming homework * Presses the evaluate button, which should cause the evaluation to occur. What we have found is the following: After the evaluate button is pressed, the evaluation script runs, and: * The student's test programs gets copied. * Only some of the files in the \"execution files\" are copied. N ot all files from execution files are copied * Evaluation fails because not all of the instructor's testing files are there. We checked the directory by running a python script when an evaluation takes place. The script iterates over the files of the home directory. It shows that only some files are copied, and most of the instructor's test files are not. Is there something that we are missing? We truly appreciate your help in this regard. Regards, Raju Pandey",

It seems that pre_vpl_run.sh would run first, deleting the sample files, before the student files are added into the temporary space, then the student files are added in and vpl_run.sh is run, and the sample files do not cancel out the student files because they (sample files) were deleted first.

We decided to move on to using an AI-experience center (AIEC) called Jupyter for students to be able to store their files on that server, with each student/instructor having their own directory there. We want to integrate that server to our VPL LMS-client, and we want students to be able to download the files they work on in Jupyter and then upload them to a VPL for evaluation. One issue we have is the security. When trying to download a file, someone should be presented with an authentication request (username/password). Is it possible to use a client like Putty or WinSCP to SSH into a Jupyter server? If so, what would be the proper credentials? I tried this with WinSCP and failed, possibly because the server may not have FTP /SFTP installed. The thing is, from the VPL I am able to use the wget command with the link to the file to download it onto the temporary drive in the VPL server during the execution. This should fail and/or ask for authentication credentials. We do not want students to be able to see or get files they're not supposed to. How can I implement this kind of security to any of the servers? I believe our main goal is to unify all 3 servers (Jupyter, VPL, LMS)",

For the time being we log in and download them manually, then submit them to Moodle, but we want the execution of the VPL to get the files automatically so that when a student decides to have their files evaluate, the VPL will get them from Jupyter and grade them. I understand what you explained to me about how there's no easy answer, but I came up with another idea based on what I know works, and I explain it below. Since I am capable of using wget to do this, I thought if there was a way, with the use of strings and variables, to run a wget that gets the correct files based on the name of the student on Moodle and the name of the student on Jupyter. I would assume these have to match, but is there a line of code that gets the name of the student running the execution which would be stored as a string during the execution itself? This would help in the creation of the file path for wget, which uses variables and strings to construct it in the program. One last question, I would like to know if and how it's possible for a student to run the VPL's execution without providing their own file manually in Moodle since this would be done automatically by the VPL's execution itself.

There are four types of outputs: only numbers, text, exact text, and regular expressions: Numbers : only numbers are written. Only numbers are checked out, the rest of the text is ignored. The real numbers are checked with tolerance. example: \n```text\noutput \n= 4\n\n\n5 6.8\n```\n Text : Only words are checked, the comparison is case-insensitive and the other characters are ignored. example: \n```text\noutput \n= lemon orange\n\n\napple\n```\n Exact text : The text is enclosed in double-quotes.",

Write a program to input 3 number from the keyboard and check which number is greatest. #include<stdio.h> int main() { int a,b,c; printf(“enter the avlaue of a,b,c); scanf(\"%d%d%d\",&a,&b,&c); if(a>b) { if(a>c) { printf(\"a is great\"); } else { printf(\"c is great\"); } } else { if(b>c) { printf(\"b is great\"); } else { printf(\"c is great\"); } } } When i run this program enter the a value of a,b,c     3 2 1 output =  a is great Evaluate But problem is that when i comapre with test case case1 : case = check gretest number input 3 2 1 output=a is great -------+ |  1  test run/ 0  test passed | +------------------------------+ Test case failed 0/100 case2 : case = check gretest number input 3 2 1 output=b is great -------+ |  1  test run/ 1  test passed | My view To evaluate a program I passed two different test cases. According to me case 1 is correct because its output match with program output. But the moodle gives a result  test case failed. Similarly I passed a second case, which according to me is wrong because it does not match with program output. Thats why i ask that one question. Why its behave strange.",

For each task, the selection of the execution server is as follow 1) If there are servers online then one is preselected randomly. If a server was marked offline 5 or more minutes ago, it's considered already online for this preselection. 1.1) If the preselected server is found offline the server is marked as offline and repeats step 1. If the preselected server is found overloaded repeats step 1. 2) If all online servers have been preselected then all servers, online or not, are sequentially preselected again. 3) If no server can be selected a message is shown to the user. - Notice that after preselecting a server, it is checked to know if it is or not online and if it is overloaded.

Notice that you must use the file extensión \"sh\" to run the code. E.g. Write a test.sh file \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\necho \"¡Hola Lisbeth!\"\n```\n If you want that your students get interactive access to an ANSI terminal using a shared machine (not a virtual machine for each one) with zero configuration, you may use VPL. But notice that, each execution is a new start from scratch, no data is kept in the user environment from a previous execution. To get this use the following code \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nbash\n```\n I think that the best approach may be a mix by launching a new \"bash\" at the end of the code. This will allow to develop and executing a shell script and then show the results and explore new commands. E.g. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\necho \"¡Hola Lisbeth!\"\n\n\nbash\n```\n Notice that your students can not use commands with root sticky bit. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

At step 4, I think that it will be better to use again cerbot command, instead of letsencrypt. Also, you need to stop the service before the certificate renews. Notice that at this moment the vpl-jail-system always tries to open the HTTP port (80 by default). If you change the HTTP port to other e.g. 8080 you will not need to stop the service, you only need to restart it after the renew. The command may be something like certbot renew --pre-hook \"service vpl-jail-system stop\" --post-hook \"service vpl-jail-system start\" if PORT=8080 then certbot renew --post-hook \"service vpl-jail-system restart\" Best regards, Juan Carlos.",
