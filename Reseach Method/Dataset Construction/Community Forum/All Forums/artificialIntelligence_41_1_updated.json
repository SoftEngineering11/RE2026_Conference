          "Title": "How are we supposed to use the AI Subsystem ?",
          "Text": "I have some questions about the AI subsystem. I use AI in a lot of places in my plugins. I route almost all requests to my own servers and completely bypass the AI subsystem. Partly because this process pre-dates the AI subsystem. And partly because I don't think the AI subsystem does what I need (thats what my questions will be about). But I do want to use it, and ideally I could begin the process of allowing users to route AI requests via the subsystem if they preferred to. As a representative example of a use case - in Poodll Wordcards we need pictures for the WordCards. So I wanted to use the subsystem, and I made a placement plugin so we could generate images. That worked. But then I went back to the old way. Question 1) Do we really need a placement plugin for each place we want to generate a image? (clarification: This is not about using the HTML editor.) I mean, do we need one for Poodll WordCards and one for Poodll MiniLesson and one the Moodle repository etc. Is that really the case? If not, cool. Please tell me what to do instead. If however it is the case. I don't mind coding a few lightweight plugins. I kind of mind having to maintain them on the plugins directory and through each Moodle version update. I do mind having to get my users to install new plugins for what are basically features. Perhaps my needs are some sort of edge case and the html editor is fine for most people. But how about: The file manager - of course we need image generation there. Automated generation content - Poodll has an AI lesson builder it takes a few prompts and goes off builds incredible lessons with loads of images and audio. Most mods will have something like that soon. Bulk image generation - making 10 images in series is slow. Making 10 images in parallel is fast. And that is just images. In fact text generation is a bigger issue. Basically most of my plugins will need a companion AI placement plugin. It seems too much. A hook or callback feature seems more appropriate. Question 2) How about all the other AI things we need to do? A few examples: give students feedback on their submission. give students a score on their submission modify previously generated images transcribe speech. Most of this is programmatic use of AI. Trying to know in advance what kind of AI action is required and make it available as a placement, seems like forever playing catch up. Thats partly because we don't know what we don't know. And partly because AI is advancing at such a rate new functionality is arriving regularly. The list could just get really really long. How do we get new actions into the system? I need all of those things now. Is it possible to have a catch all that allows us to effectively use the engines creds and supply our own implementation of the request and response handling? I mean, I am sure we can do that now, but I do want to play by the rules. Is that against the rules?",

          "Text": "This is a *really* interesting question Justin, and one that think many developers are struggling with. I feel that that \"placements\" function is a complex / complicated route to govern where the end-user interaction or initiation of an AI action takes place. This is probably fine in the case of *some* interactions. But I think it overall takes away from the Developer's to make good decisions (or and potentially *bad* decisions) about where and what that initiation looks like. So personally \"I\" don't like this approach... The other aspect is really the back-end consumption of AI \"services\" by a Moodle plugin. This in my mind should not need any sort of \"placement\", it really needs to be a mechanism for the developer to get back some sort of interface that will route their request to a \"relevant\" / appropriate LLM provider instance. This is of itself a complicated question if we're to allow individual system administrators to have the agency to *decide* which LLM provider they want to use, and this could conflict with some developers who don't want to afford sys-admins that flexiblity (say for instance your AI experience relies on a *very* specific model that *you're* hosting). On this front I prefer the approach the By-cs's local_ai_manager plugin has taken, in offering \"purposes\" and \"providers\" so that the systems admin can assert \"this LLM is for this purpose\", and *every* complying AI plugin that wants to \"generate an image\" will use it. It doesn't preclude a developer writing an \"I need a very specific image generation purpose\" and then requiring the admin to wire that purpose up to a very specific LLM instance... (Full disclosure, we've been playing in that very area to look at doing \"RAG\" and \"Text Embedding\" purpose for this plugin, so we sort of know that adding newer more specific purposes can be done here). But in both the Moodle system and the By-CS one there is definitely an \"arms-length-ness\" to calling an LLM, it's by no means \"direct\" (in Moodle you have go via the placement, and in the local_ai_manager you need to go via a purpose)",

The generation that Phillipp mentions will use AI and the guidance you provide into the generator to create Moodle questions, but if you're talking about something which inherently \"knows\" about your cours content, and uses that to \"ground\" the generation in that context / content, then you're starting to get in to the realms of needing some sort of Retrieval Augmented Generation process that can expose the relevant content in your Moodle course. This is basically just accelerating what the generator above does, and changes it so that you're not having to do it \"by hand\". This is something however that I'm working with Phillipp with to make Moodle course content accessible via a RAG process, so that an AI tool (like the generator) could get that context directly from Moodle instead of from \"you\" (manually).

I suspect that is also possible with Gemini (a very nice model), but Gemini is only available directly from Google. My interpretation is that Moodle HQ are focussed on offering a relatively narrow range of options e.g. OpenAI/Azure (the same thing for most purposes) and with Moodle 5 Ollama, support. Other people can create plugins to support other services. For example i created a basic one one for Groq https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle-aiprovider_groq Which should allow you to talk to Deepseek 70b, various versions of LLama from meta or Gemma (a lightweight version of gemini) https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/ But it would be good to step back and work out what you want and expect from these things. One way is to go to the \"playgrounds\" they provide and experiment with some prompts to work out what benefit you might get.

I would good it if there was a way of sharing prompts to reduce the learning required for teachers. We do indeed live in interesting times. One area of interest for me is does OpenAI have a path to profit. According to one commentator OpenAI spends about $2.25 to make $1.

What do you want to use AI with Moodle for, why are you interested in these other models? Remember Moodle HQ makes no financial charge for the software and there are over 440 million user accounts globally so every feature requires extensive testing and maintenance which does have a financial cost. If you have any follow up questions, expand on what you have done so far with Moodle AI and what you are hoping to do with it in the future.",

However, despite everything being correctly configured (including open ports, no firewall, and working API endpoint), we are still facing the \"Something went wrong\" error when trying to use the AI features in Moodle. As a next step, we are planning to set up a clean, production-level environment where Moodle and Ollama will run on separate servers, and we’ll follow all the best practices including secure API configuration and possibly Basic Auth if needed. We’ll report back once we test this new architecture. If you have any other suggestions based on your experience, we’d love to hear them! Thanks again for sharing your expertise.

This plugin is for TinyMCE , and has some free features (citation builder, playback). When connected to the Cursive API/ML server (paid service), it leverages ML to verify authorship for writing within Moodle, ensuring the same author session to session. We're not identifying \"who,\" but rather, we're verifying that the author is consistent over time and that the effort of writing was captured (no matter how much or little; if you want to see \"v\" from a copy-paste... well, we see that too). We've built it to support Forums Online assignments Essays in Quizzes I'm a big believer in the power of writing as an essential skill, the importance of writing skills development, and transparency. While my initial goal was to thwart contract cheating/essay mill usage and promote integrity/verify student effort, we are working hard to leverage the same writing process data to also expose new and helpful data for both teachers and students: time/duration (available) editing amounts (available) pasted text (available) writing playback (available) quality metrics (coming very soon) This isn't an AI Classifier, but we do leverage and intend to provide more AI/machine learning to help writers become better writers, even if/when responsible AI use is allowed or required .

I pay monthly, rather than the basic, free plan, but I think neither your plan nor mine is enough to get it working. I think we need a different, paid account. I can see the icons and summarise button but I also get the same error message.

Assuming it an issue of having the \"right sort of account\", i.e. one you have paid for you might shortcut the whole process by signing up for Groq (note the q at the end, not to be at all confused by a similar sounding thing). Groq is very fast and I have found no way of paying them for their service. I believe you can do that using only core code. If you are willing to improvise you can possibly work out how to do it from these instructions for Ollama https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Ollama I do have a dedicated Groq support plugin which has some tweaks to allow more configuration, e.g. temperature, but you might want to stick with core code. Let me know if you think I could tweak the message output further from the diagnostic tool. The people from HQ are working on more meaningful error messages, the last update to the ticket was 4 days ago. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-83147 I am at this moment (6.55 AM Sundy morning here) working on a thing to monitor \"prompt injection\", a subject people really need to know about with respect to all AI/LLM systems. https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle-qtype_aitext/issues/4 I am not single, which may be because I met my romantic and life partner before I discovered Moodle......

An alternative I use on two of my Moodle sites, but it is a little slower, is I have my own small board computers (3 Raspberry Pi 5's and 1 OrangePi 5 Plus) running Ollama. All the results of my \"conversations\" are private. This works fine for me, as for the most part, I do not have very many active users and doubt that any of them have tried the AI tools on the various development sites I am running. If someone wants to run their own AI server for a Moodle production site, I would suggest running something with a little more power and NVIDIA video cards. My next project is to create an AI cluster and see if I can get a little more rapid response to some of my more detailed requests that typically take minutes, instead of seconds to generate a response.",

If you're a Moodle admin , I’d love feedback on the implementation and how it fits into your workflow. We want to simplify installation and reduce installs that never get tested. If you're a teacher , how do you use Moodle for your courses? How has AI changed your work and your students' learning? We're focused on making AI in Moodle a real Human + AI collaboration - not just another tool, but something that truly supports teachers and learners without taking over. AI should help structure, engage, and adapt learning, but always with a human in control. Thank you in advance for your help. Romain",

          "Text": "Hello, Romain! 😊 It's amazing to see initiatives like the Corolair AI Tutor being developed for Moodle! AI has enormous potential to transform education, but as you mentioned, the challenge is making it a true ally for teachers and students without it feeling like a complex or bureaucratic tool. I understand this well, as I also try to create tools to make teachers' lives easier. I tested the plugin and noticed that installation can still be a sensitive point for many administrators. Moodle is vast, and each environment has its peculiarities, so a guided setup assistant would be a fantastic feature! Something that helps detect permissions, API keys, and necessary configurations automatically, reducing that initial frustration of \"what do I do now?\". For teachers, I see that adapting activities based on student progress would be one of the most powerful uses of AI. If Corolair can, for example, suggest supplementary materials or dynamically adapt quizzes based on student performance, it would be revolutionary! Imagine a quiz that changes questions according to the student's mistakes and successes, creating a unique learning path. That would be a true intelligent tutor! The idea of keeping the teacher in control is essential! AI needs to be a support tool, not a replacement. A dashboard where teachers can view AI suggestions, approve them, or adjust them before they are applied would make usage much safer and more reliable. I'm really curious to see how Corolair evolves, and I'm here to help with whatever you need! 🚀 If you need more testing, feedback, or even help in the community, count on me!

There are a couple of things that have called my attention: The API endpoint: Unless your configuration is special, it should be the base Ollama URL , AKA, without the `/api` (that's automatically added by Moodle). Note that, IMO , it should be the other way, but I've just tried here and what seems to work is to add the base Ollama URL, not the API URL. I've quick looked to the code and, unless I'm wrong, the actions (summaries, explain, ...) are all them using the `/api/generate` entry point, not the `/api/chat` one (because there isn't history to manage around). In the other side, your Curl example above is using the `/api/chat` one. Just guessing if maybe your proxy is not allowing the correct ( `/api/generate` ) to be passed around. And that's what I've been able to imagine with your information, I'd bet that the problem is number 1 above (maybe creating an issue to clarify what's expected there is not a bad thing). Ciao",

For this reason, if you are an Higher Ed teacher/worker from any country and any type of school/uni, I'd love to have a chat with you to understand how you work and how you think AI could have an impact If you are interested to chat, please do not hesitate to book a slot here: https://calendar.app.google/ZjTLE8fAK6GptVcq6 Thanks a lot! All the best,",

Here are some of its key capabilities:` `1. Real-time speech synthesis: MooTyper uses natural-sounding voices to` `read out text in real-time, allowing students to hear their assignments or` `responses being spoken aloud.` `2. Text editing: Users can type or paste text into the MooTyper editor,` `which will then be synthesized into speech as they edit.` `3. Spell checking and grammar correction: The plugin includes built-in` `spell checking and grammar correction tools to help users ensure accuracy` `in their written work.` `4.

Customization options: Administrators can customize the plugin's` `settings, including choosing the voice and speech rate, to suit the needs` `of their users.` `MooTyper is commonly used in educational settings to support students with` `dyslexia, ADHD, or other learning disabilities that may affect reading and` `writing abilities.

I have asked that question a couple of other ways, and it does give the same basic WRONG answer each time. What it does give applies much more with what the Poodle Filter does.

I was puzzled that both of them had almost the exact same verbose results, but I was interrupted further investigations by one of those necessary life events that butted in...had to go grocery shopping! LOL When I got back, it suddenly dawned on me why they were giving me very similar results. The Pi 5's have a new PCI Express Interface ribbon connector on the rear edge of the board. The AI HAT uses that connection for the communicating with the AI HAT, meaning the OS and memory storage all has to go on a Micro SDC memory chip. The other PI with a 1TB SSD, is running the OS and memory storage on the SSD and does not even have a Micro SDC memory chip plugged in. When I got that particular Pi 5, I had to do an initial setup using a Micro SDC memory chip and was amazed how much faster it appeared when I finished moving the OS over to the SSD. I currently have Ollama set up on it using the llama3.2:3b model which granted, is not as fast with it's answers, as those you can get elsewhere, but, as I have mentioned before, no matter how much I ask it, it will not suddenly want to start charging me for access to it. If anyone want to try it out, send me a private message with a desired user name and password so I can set it up. If anyone is interested, note that I have created an AI provider plugin like the two now included in Moodle, and hope to get the settings to work with one of my Pi's, soon. Almost forgot to mention, if you want to try AI on your OWN Raspberry Pi, try to get a 16GB version. Makes a huge difference in which models you can run/use.",

The Moodle generated JSON received the following resopnse: `{` `\"id\": \"chatcmpl-700\",` `\"object\": \"chat.completion\",` `\"created\": 1738909100,` `\"model\": \"llama3.1:8b\",` `\"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_ollama\",` `\"choices\": [` `{` `\"index\": 0,` `\"message\": {` `\"role\": \"assistant\",` `\"content\": \"\"` `},` `\"finish_reason\": \"stop\"` `}` `],` `\"usage\": {` `\"prompt_tokens\": 16,` `\"completion_tokens\": 1,` `\"total_tokens\": 17` `}` `}` Empty \"content\" where the working requests get a whole load of \"response\" data like the ones below: `{\"model\":\"llama3.1:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2025-02-07T06:18:03.267790051Z\",\"response\":\" combination\",\"done\":false}` `{\"model\":\"llama3.1:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2025-02-07T06:18:03.286865819Z\",\"response\":\" of\",\"done\":false}` `{\"model\":\"llama3.1:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2025-02-07T06:18:03.305958078Z\",\"response\":\" machine\",\"done\":false}` `{\"model\":\"llama3.1:8b\",\"created_at\":\"2025-02-07T06:18:03.325020031Z\",\"response\":\" learning\",\"done\":false}` Running the data through curl alone yielded no real improvement in the situation other than I now have a hypothesis that maybe the API endpoint specified is not able to handle data in the structures it was provided by Moodle. This seems a bit strange though as the docs all seem to suggest that Ollama just uses the OpenAI API. Could it be that this is not the case? Or does anyone know of a different endpoint I can set that just miraculously makes everything work? API endpoints tried so far: /v1/chat/completions /api/generate /api/chat",

          "Text": "Hi Adam, I think that you may be mixing APIs here. Ollama supports 2 REST APIS: The Ollama API ( link to docs ) is the native Ollama one, more powerful, but proprietary (only Ollama understands it). It includes endpoint like `/api/generate` , `/api/embed` , ... and many others. The OpenAI API ( link to docs ) is the one providing compatibility with any client able to use that \"de-facto\" standard. It doesn't have all the features that the Ollama one has, but it's the one to use when wanting to connect to it when using an OpenAI-compatible client. It includes endpoints like `/v1/chat/completions` , `/v1/embeddings` , ... and a few others. In the case of Moodle 4.5, it's only able to use the 2nd one, because the available provider is the OpenAI one, that is, Moodle is an OpenAI-compatible client. And that's the one that you should be using. Incoming Moodle 5.x (I don't know the exact details) will come also with a \"native\" Ollama provider, that will use the other API, It's actually being worked on @ MDL-83006 . So, back to the issue, the type of requests that Moodle generates right now are the OpenAI ones, and they are the ones to allow in your reverse proxy or whatever. Apart from that, I cannot imagine any problem, as far as the `curlsecurityblockedhosts` and `curlsecurityallowedport` Moodle settings are ok and the `OLLAMA_HOST` env variable has been set in order to bind to non-loopback/remote interfaces. That's what the Ollama specific article in the docs tries to explain. Feel free to improve it, it's a wiki! I've tried here, right now, with `https://some.host.where.ollama.runs:11434/v1/chat/completions` configured as the end point for summaries in Moodle 4.5, and it's working perfectly. Ciao",

Ollama doesn't require an API Key, in fact. even having an API Key set, it goes completely ignored, but it must be set. OK, I'm off to add this to the Ollama documentation page. Already have seen another post in these forums where someone else was suffering from the same malady as I was. For anyone who is curious about how I found the answer, I was looking over the Ollama documentation about OpenAI compatibility (it's installed in Ollama by default BTW, no additional config required) and saw the highlighted snippet in the OpenAI Python library... It's infuriating just how simple the solution is. Definitely going straight to the docs to add this information.",

          "Text": "There is no single bench mark to address these questions. a) Best Model:It depends. For example if you want to teach languages it might be best to use a model optimised for that. If you want to do Maths you might decide not to use an LLM (inherently unreliable) b) Performance: Probably minimal, the interesting stuff happens outside Moodle c) Risk: There is little that Moodle can do to mitigate risky content but generally it should not compromise security as \"traditionally\" concerning with a system like Moodle. So for example AI use is probably not going to facilitate getting admin access. I have been working on using regular expressions to identify attempted prompt injection attacks but that is more about general warnings than any actual fixes. d) LLM Performance: That is a good question. One approach is to go for big suppliers and have a large amount of contingeny money. I don't mean to be flippant but if AI is really important to you that is a solution. However as someone who is very engaged with Moodle and AI I advise against making AI reliability (in any interpretation) central to your plans at the moment. e) Costs: I have been vigoriously experimenting with AI with Moodle for over 12 months and my total spend has been less than £US50 (all with OpenAI). During that time Open AI has halved its rate per million tokens (someone confirm that for me). I believe the cost of inference will \"fall off a cliff\", due to both hardware and software developments. Inference will always have a financial cost, but possibly in the same way that broadband and internet access will always have a cost.",

We are in an experimental phase, and there is still a long way to go. 🚀 In fact, I have already commented on this in another discussion , but it’s always good to revisit these points to reflect together. When checking the report of unapproved plugins in Moodle , I didn’t find any native AI plugins awaiting approval. This suggests that, so far, Moodle’s architecture is not yet ready or optimized to fully and efficiently embrace AI, encouraging developers to use it. Regarding your concerns about the environmental impact of AI infrastructures, I fully agree that this is an essential debate! We need to move forward responsibly, aligning technological innovations with greater care for our planet. However, let’s remember that Moodle's strength lies in being an open-source platform, granting us the freedom to decide what to integrate and how to use it. Nothing forces us to follow centralized models or depend on large corporations. On your concerns about the environmental impact of AI infrastructures... Moodle itself is already a robust and large platform, consuming significant resources in its operation. For example, there is still a lack of a solid campaign to encourage the use of CDNs , which would significantly help in saving resources and energy. This would allow content to be delivered faster, more efficiently, and with a smaller environmental footprint—something crucial for educational platforms dealing with high traffic volumes. So today, a lot of energy is spent every day to access courses, while campaigns are made to save energy to create the courses...

For Moodle running on a Raspberry Pi with a standard setup, you can expect it to handle well between 5 and 10 simultaneous users, depending on the types of activities being performed on the system (for example, simple navigation through courses). If you're dealing with more demanding activities, such as tests with many students, videos, or large files being accessed, the performance will be impacted more quickly.

It has two key components:\n\n1. AI generation of assessments that can be automatically imported as Moodle Quizzes\n2. AI generation of Rubrics that can be imported as Rubric based assignments into Moodle and then also use AI to grade submissions and import the complete graded rubric and comments back into Moodle.\n\nThe application framework is Flutter/Dart and we have it available for review in Github. No local data storage is used as the system leverages the user's Moodle account and the Moodle data/auth/roles to define what can be done in the app. No personally identifiable information is sent to the AI; only the required prompt and assignment submission/rubric.\n\nTeachers have the ability to override, edit, or otherwise adjust all AI generated content or grading.\n\nThe app can be run as a web app or natively as a Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, or iOS application.\n\nOur goal is to collect teacher data about using AI as a teacher helper tool and if our application has any impact on teachers' attitudes about AI use.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or would like to talk about the details.\n\nThank you,\nScott McGlynn",
