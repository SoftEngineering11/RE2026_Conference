Some of them depended on the conclusion of activities , some of them depended on other badges, some of them were hidden, some of then were issed to students. This year, I asked the admin to copy the course so I could use it again. For some reason, the copy of the badges did not work properly, and now I have (not kidding) 352834 badges. Some of them (I assume most of them, but I didn't check them all) have the warning \"Completo: Emblema com id {$a} não existe\", which translates to \"Complete: Badge with id {$a} does not exist\". So, I was wondering if there is a way that I could delete all the badges, so that I could set them up again. Can anyone help me? Thank you.",

Like, let's say I create a plugin that would add a badge to the mdl_badge table (sticking to that schema, of course and also putting a badge image into to image handling system and linking it correctly) and then add a record to the mdl_badge_issued. The logic under which this particular plugin awarded the badges would be it's own business. To pick a random example, perhaps it awarded a badge if the user logged in on St. Patrick's Day? Would I be correct that you would only need to modify these three (mdl_badge mdl_files mdl_badgeissued) tables to \"issue\" a badge from a plugin?

          "Text": "Hi All! Since taking over as PDM of VLE Badges at the OU, there have been some areas where additional functionality would be useful, and figured I'd run the ideas here before raising trackers for them (a scary prospect having never raised a tracker item on moodle before :D). Idea 1: It would be useful to have a completion criteria option that allowed for \"Any X number of selected activities \" to award a badge. For example, we have a module that would like to have 10 quizzes, and award a badge if any 8 of those quizzes were completed. With the current \"Any\" or \"All\" options, this isn't possible, and though it can be set up against gradebook, it's not straightforward and introduces too many complications. Idea 2: The Description field to allow for better text formatting. Currently, there is no way to format text in the description field, and on the badge information page, the text just appears as a block of text. There are courses that like to list/bullet the skills evidenced to gain the badge, and this is currently not possible. Having a simple text editor that allows for formatting would be extremely useful. Idea 3: As a badge creator, I want to specify an email to receive badge awarded notifications so that a module team member or tutor can be specified instead of the creator of the badge. At present, the only option is to tick for the badge creator to receive notifications when badges are awarded. As in most cases this is not a member of the module team, it is not a useful function for us. The current view is shown below. As such, I propose that we add a custom field that allows you to also enter a desired recipients email to be notified as the badges are awarded. Below is an example of what the proposed new option might look like. Below is the proposed help message text: Below is the proposed frequency menu, copied from the \"Notify badge creator\" option: Idea 4: It would be useful if badges have a unique credential ID internally, and if this ID was shown on the Badges information page when checking the students evidence as shown in the mock up below: Idea 5: Cross course badging would be very useful. We have modules that want to be able to award badges for either other badges on other courses having been earned, or activities completed across multiple courses to trigger one badge. So, it would be useful if: Site badges could trigger of course badges. Site badges could trigger of course activities. Course badges could trigger of other course badges. Course badges could trigger of other course activities. I think that's everything I've been mulling over, does anyone have any thoughts on these? Would they be possible? Anyone else want to see these changes?",

I'm thinking that it would work well for the badge itself to have a counter perhaps, for how often it's been awarded, and a breakdown in the Badge Description page that shows each instance (date/course) that it's been awarded. This could be useful at the OU as well, as we're looking into Sustainability badges where the same badge could be earned across multiple courses. At the moment, we're having to create duplicate badges for each course taking part, but it would be useful to have a Site badge that could trigger of course activity (idea 5) and that could be awarded more than once where desired (your idea 6). There is thought that being able to show you can continuously demonstrate a skill through your studies is beneficial, but student backpacks could quickly become busy if the badge appeared for every instance it was earned.",

However, a competency can only be approved one time and a badge can only be issued one time. It would be useful if we could issue the same badge multiple times. In addition to the other ideas, we have a need to issue a badge based on the criteria of \"awarded badges\" but we have a need to issue a badge based on a certain number or percentage of a set of badges or a certain number of \"awarded badges.\" Right now we have to list all the badges that must be awarded so we would expect the new feature to then allow us to specify the percentage or number of those badges that must be awarded as criteria for the new badge.",

          "Text": "This might sounds like a bit of an odd one, but stick with me. We have a project around Sustainability, and plan to be integrating badged activities into module qualifications. As part of this, we want to have three \"trees\" or focuses where students will complete tasks over the three levels of their qualification, earning a badges that then lead to a top level badge associated to that focus, triggered by the other badges. That's all well and good, and we're trialling a cross-course activity completion plug-in for that purpose. Where it gets tricky is the next part. We also want to be able to offer a more general badge for students that complete 3 or more of the badges from any of the focuses. In the event that there were 3 badges available across the three focuses, for example, this would mean we'd need up to 27 badges (3x3x3) to cover every eventuality. This would obviously be a lot of badges to appear in a students portfolio if they managed to get all of the 9 base badges during the course of their study. So we were wondering if it would be possible/useful do have an option that states \"If 'X' badge has been awarded, hide 'X' and show 'Y' instead\". Alternatively, If badges had a feature in their completion criteria where you could set \"If 'X' number of activities of selected activities is completed, award badge\", then that would cover this with one badge. We could select the 9 base badges as the completion criteria, and have the badge trigger of any 3 of them being completed. I have asked for this before in relation to badges on modules being awarded for a selection of activities, and still believe that this would be a very broadly useful feature.",

          "Text": "Hi All, Unsure if others are having this issue or not. With badges on our system, we can link them fine to eu.badgr.com and then use the evidence link to view the badge on our systems. When we share out from Badgr, the credential URL they use is links back to the assertion.php page, which displays the JSON data in non-readable format: https://www.open.edu/openlearn/badges/assertion.php?b=36693750883dafbaf976dbe53959ca22d416e45e&obversion=2 So when the badge displays on a Linkedin profile, and someone clicks on it, they are sent to that assertion.php page. Now, the link can be manually changed when sharing, but students aren't going to know how to do this, and I think it's going to put them of the experience of badging altogether if they have to be instructed how to \"fix\" their badge when sharing. I was wondering if anyone else had come across this, and whether the issue is from the metadata at our end, or a bug in how Badgr/Canvas are reading it.",

The first checkbox takes effect all the time. With this Im not able to give the champ badge to the actual winner but everyone gets it. It's so weird.

The funny part is that now i created another training, with another badge and that one is also generating the same error... i found this discussion in Tracker: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-69171 So... any light in this matter? should i upgrade to another version? is there a patch or something?

After having applied the patch, we've got a test badgr account in use, and we've got badges created to test with, so we followed these instructions. Go to \"Site administration > Server > OAuth 2 services\". Create an \"Open Badges\" service with the following information: Name: <leave the default value> Service base URL : https://eu.badgr.com Fine up to here, but then we're not sure what these steps mean: Go to the Configure endpoints page for this issuer. Check \"apiBase\" is one of the endpoints displayed. We completed the following below steps anyway, hoping it would work either way. Go to \"Site administration > Badges > Manage backpacks\". Create a new backpack with the following information: Backpack API: https://eu.badgr.com Backpack URL: https://eu.badgr.com API version supported: Open Badges v2.1 OAuth 2 services: Canvas Badges Logout (to guarantee the email is updated properly in the $USER var). I'm able to connect my account from our Moodle instance to eu.badger.com, but when I try to export a badge, I get the following error: So, what we'd like to ask is, regarding the steps we missed, are we the issuer in this case, or would it count as badgr? If it's something we need to check on our end, are there instructions on how to access this page? If possible, a screenshot of what to expect would be very useful. Go to the Configure endpoints page for this issuer. Check \"apiBase\" is one of the endpoints displayed. And would skipping these steps cause the above error, if not, is there something else we're missing that we should look out for? Many thanks in advanced!",

So badge is awarded to whoever submits a feedback. 2- I submitted a feedback, just to be sure. 3- I deleted the feedback activity. 4- I went to de recycle bin and restored the activity. Result: all the badges in the course (not only the one related to the feedback activity) were duplicated. I had 3 badges at the beginning and I end up with 6 badges. I deteled the feedback and restored again. Surprise, I have 12 badges. So everything got duplicated again. I'll keep you posted with more testing. EDIT: First test is on Moodle 3.11.13. Was able to replicate on 4.1.3. EDIT 2: Replicated on qa.moodledemo.net running 4.3 dev. 1- Add a badge to a course. No need to add criteria. 2- Add a resource or activity, delete it and restore from the recycle bin. 3- Go to Manage Badges and count.",

I am seeking clarification about the purpose and contents of the 'Claim URL ' field in the 'Endorsement' tab when managing a badge, in this tab there are two headings: Issuer details Endorser name Email Issuer URL Date issued Claim Claim URL Endorsement comment When adding an endorsement the 'Claim URL' field is mandatory for completion. I understand the logic to have an 'Issuer URL' available so that the endorser's website is attached to the badge. However I do not understand the purpose of the claim URL. Is it to link to another page on the endorser's website with details about the badge being endorsed? Or perhaps something more technical that I am missing. I have been unable to find documentation or guidance about this, so I am hoping someone in the community can assist me. Many thanks in advance for your time.",

          "Text": "Hi Valerie! With very small classes I think it might be sufficient. It's definitely not for large groups. You can't give badges to multiple users using a search function that can select multiple users at once, nor using groups or groupings. You can't export the list of awarded badges to display or rank in your course and motivate students. You can't import a list of students to give a badge to (results of in-class activities for instance). Students can't see which badges they can have so they're not trying to reach for it. They cannot see their progress towards the other students as they would with achievements in games.  You could export the list every week or so of course, but it takes time... There's no automatic support for levels, so if you give a badge for a repeatable action (answering to the class on the table), you'll have to manually create a \"Level 2\" badge, it's quite cumbersome. Just my opinion, of course. The current implementation miss a lot of potential motivational impact because the task is unbearable with large groups and there are no import/export features to script large behavior through excel or else.

So, if you have set this to allow the Teacher role to award the site badge, it will not work because that user is not a Teacher at the site level. In this case, it means that only the Site badge awarder role (and the Manager role) can manually approve site badges. So this will work as expected if you set the Site badge awarder to be the role that can manually award the badge.",

          "Title": "Notification Emails",
          "Text": "Hi folks, Moodle currently (as of 4.x) supports that as soon as a badge is received, that a notification email is sent to the student, that just earned the badge the teacher/admin that created the badge Use case In our use case we have additional requirements for sending a badge notification. If a course is tought by several teachers, all of them should receive a notification when one of their students earns a badge. Notifications should sent out to a custom email address (of a role account in the organization that uses Moodle) to inform that the student earned a badge. This email can be used to trigger an additional automated process by the system that receives this email. Is there someone that has further input in the notification process? Possible solution A possible solution how to address the use case described above would be the following: Sending a badge notification to personel of a certain role is done be adding a new capability. This capability is enabled for teachers and non editing teachers by default. There needs to be an additional field that contains a list of email addresses that can be provided where to send the notification. That could be a database entry like badge.notificationemail. Migration process If it is worth the effort I also would propose to change the current setting and have a migration process during the update. Current setting: The database entry badge.notification contains a number that indicates whether a notification is sent, and in case of yes, at what frequency notifications are sent to the issuer. Proposed new setting: Keep the entry badge.notification, however, change the interpretation to whether send any notification and if so, in what frequency it's send. However the creator get the notification only if he has the capability inherited via the role management. Add a new entry badge.notification_email that contains a list of email addresses where the notifiation is sent to. Add a new capbility \"moodle/badges:getnotification\" During the migration process the following should happen: The new capability should be added and given to the roles Teacher, Non editing teacher. Go over all badges, check if the property/setting (db entry) badge.notification is > 0 (enabled). no -> do nothing yes -> check whether the creator is in a group that has the new cabability to receive notifications. If the creator is in such a group, do nothing. If the creator is not in such a group, take his email and add it to the new db property badge.notificationemail to make sure that he still receives notification after the migration process. Any further input for this proposal is highly appreciated. If you also have notes or suggestions not to the use case itself but the proposed solution, feel free to submit it here as well. Thank you in advance. Stephan",

Let me explain the setup I have: - Moodle internal (don't know if this is called like this) messaging is disabled. - Email notifications are active. I can get notifications, for example, when I ask for password change, so email infrastructure is working. - I have this config in \"Default notification preferences\" : From what I understand, this way I have Badge notifications allowed for email if the user is offline. Is this correct? Why doesn't the student get the email notification? Another situation I don't understand, if I choose to notify the creator of the badge... this works, the creator get's an email when the Badge is issued to the student... Any help would be apreciated.

          "Text": "Hi all I dipped my toes in to badges, but having difficulties - can not award them! The idea is to implement a course, the whole thing is a short self-test. - The course contains two quizzes and one anonymous feedback. - Each quiz contains 10 single-answer questions, chosen randomly from two question categories. - There is no time limit. The candidates have to submit each attempt by going to \"Finish attempt..\"  link. - The candidates can attempt each quiz three times. The highest score counts. - To complete the course the candidates have to score 6 (out of 10) in each quiz and also submit the feedback. - To earn the badge they need to score a total 16 (out of 20) and submit the feedback. My initial tries (with dummy users) weren't successful. The badge never gets awarded. As already said, this is just a quick try, so I must be making common beginner's mistakes. Before I go in to detail, on how I tried, could somebody kindly post a relevant tutorial here? BTW , Moodle rel. 3.9.15.",

My dummy user still hasn't got one. I suspect two things: a) beginner's error in setting up, example the grade, is it 16 (out of 20), because the grade of each quiz is 10, or is in percent? b) The anonymous feedback activity being incompatible. I'll remove the feedback form and try. Also in retrying, I haven't really got the logic of Moodle cleaning the course. I started unenrolling the participant first and then resetting the course. Still the participant can not (re)submit the feedback once I unenroll, reset the course and enroll. Will come back with more details.",

I have seen any number of courses where there are only grades or only completions and not both. Badges should be able to be awarded based on any grade item in the gradebook, either by the passing grade entry or by an different grade set in the badge. For example, you may want to award several badges based on the grade of an item based on a spread of grades: A, B, C or whatever (similar to the way Quizzes have distinct feedback levels based on the grade.) This is important for the use of badges as a motivational tool. These sorts of approaches are especially common in the US in K-12 schools. I've helped build such courses myself. To assume a badge would only be awarded based on only activity completion or only a specific passing grade is not sound pedagogy: there are many situations where you want to motivate students differently based on grades alone.",

In Moodle 3.11 there is a new feature for badges where you can use the badges API itself to connect to backpacks. This makes it possible for an organization to build their own backpack (using custom code of course to build one yourself). You could then use the API to move the badges to the backup from the site that awards them. I can't think of an easier way to do this otherwise.

We're currently looking into a new badging & backpack platform and I think the ability to connect the badge API to a backpack in 3.11 and onwards would really solve this for us. From what I've gathered it doesn't look like we can really do this without a backpack so until we have that sorted I think we'll be a bit out of luck. If anyone else has tried this or has any suggestions that would be much appreciated!",

For activity completion, you could have the badge criteria based on completion of an activity that has an access restriction to a particular group. Just set Restrict access in the Settings of an activity on it to a particular group. This, unfortunately, only works for specific groups. And it still awards the badge individually, not to all members of a group at once. However, if you are using Assignment, you can use the Group submission mode and then all the students in the group can be awarded the grade and activity completion at the same time. Unfortunately, this group submission feature is limited to Assignment. If your course has Separate Groups set and Teachers only see their own students in their particular group, then you could also use the Manual award by role. The Teacher would only be able to award the badge to the students in their group. That is a more work than automatically awarding a badge and the Teacher could award the badge to some of their students, not all of them.

Or to whom they will expire in the next month or so? To be honest I'm struggling in general with rather obvious filtering of participants. Here I would like to invite the students for the course re-participation (I tried earlier without badges but I did not find a way to \"show all students that completed the course between the defined dates\", or \"...in 2021\"). Now, with the badges, there is visual signal that the course need to be retaken. But the student needs to check it on his own and teacher has no chance to find it out. Any hints, please?",

Usually, you would use a label which is hidden until the restrictions are met, maybe with a background colour, and/or a nice image included. But that only shows up on the course page and is certainly not what you have in your mind. Our plugin pulse (which is based upon a label originally) does allow you to send out a notification to the student when it becomes available. We use it for scenarios like drip fed content or congratulation messages or reminders. You can download it here: https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_pulse or test it on our test site labs.bdecent.de We’ll discuss internally if we can add a modal like level up does and let you know here.",

I am aware of the API call core_badges_get_user_badges, but I also need some way to get all badges, site wide and course specific. Is there an API call I am unaware of? If there isn't an existing API call, what would be the best approach to wring a custom API call to achieve this? I have also been entertaining the idea of creating a badge overseer of sorts which would get all existing badges awarded to it and I would use core_badges_get_user_badges on that user to get all existing badges. Then I would compare with the badge on the current user and create the page that way. With this method however I am running into the issue that if a badge has a criteria for course/activity completion, it cannot be manually awarded.

          "Title": "Guide/Documentation of best-practices when setting up badges?",
          "Text": "In trying to set up badges for my site it's been a little mind-bending trying to determine the best way to award the badges I want. Normally I want to add badges under these conditions: a user has completed a course a user has completed all courses in a category a user has interacted with a particular activity (which is usually conditionally restricted by its own set of criteria) a user was enrolled through a particular cohort I'd LIKE to be able to include criteria for filtering badges to users who were created through a given authentication method so I can differentiate between users who were synced through a directory as opposed to users who created themselves in the system (e.g. using the 'auth' field on the user record) but that's not a thing right now. Are badge criteria something than be created using a local plugin or similar, or are they a hard-coded list? My main head-scratcher is whether I want to set up SITE badges or COURSE badges. When I started out with Badges, I created everything as a Site badge because the menus are there in admin and it has a seemingly obvious 'Add a new badge' link right there. When I set up a SITE badge I can manage it through site admin. I can create a badge and set up a criteria that includes completion of a set of courses, but then only specify ONE course. It's pretty easy to see a list of the courses that have badges assigned this way, as the site admin lists them all. But when I want to generate a report of all the badges issued across a course the database is harder to understand. When I set up a COURSE badge I can manage I create the badge and set up a criteria that includes the completion of THE course. This seems to work just as well, I don't have a great way of figuring out which courses HAVE badges set and which ones don't, and if any of the badge endorsements have been set up improperly, and so on. It's a manual process of traversing through each course to take a look. It would be great to list ALL course badges in the site admin area too! I haven't found a way of converting a site badge to a course badge. I had to recreate them all. I use COURSE badges to issue badges based on the completion of one course. But for multiple courses I could either: set up a site badge based on the completion of more than one course (\"set of courses\") set up a site badge using the 'awarded badges' where the badge criteria are those badges issued by each course Is that just personal preference? What's best for performance? What's the easiest to manage across 100 courses? I'd typically go with the first way since it seems easier to visualise why the badge was awarded. The second way could be a badge was awarded by a badge that was awarded by a badge that was awarded by a badge that is awarded by the first badge (with a circular reference accidentally thrown in). Lastly, it wasn't obvious to me that a badge - the picture itself that a user can download - actually contains metadata that identifies the badge and its endorsements and the user that downloaded it, the site URL , and so on. I didn't see that mentioned anywhere in the documentation and it seems pretty important if people think they can just share the image around to other users.",

          "Title": "Award badge for progression",
          "Text": "Hi does anyone know how to award a badge for either completing a set number of activities within a course or for achieving a minimum grade across a number of courses? I have about 30 scorm packages, loaded as activities in one course. Each activity is it's own little course of learning (e.g How to write an email). The idea is as the student completes more and more of these little courses they get a badge. E.g. Complete one activity and get a novice learner badge, complete 3 activities and get an intermediate learner badge, complete 7 activities and get an advanced learner badge... and so on. I don't want to choose which activities the learner must do to earn the badges, there are heaps to choose from so I would like them to choose what is relevant to them on the day. I also don't want to wait for them to complete the entire course, which consists of these 30 scorm activities, because that could take forever and students may lose interest. I have tried to break up the scorm activities to create individual, structured courses but the option to award on course completion is limited to completing all of the courses selected. When I select all of the courses, I cannot simply say when any 3 courses are complete or when a grade of 3 is achieved ie. if every course was worth 1 mark. Any suggestions on how to award badges for progressive effort?",

          "Text": "Hi Allison, That’s something that you can accomplish with our Pulse activity. ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_pulse ) Pulse can be configured to become complete once it’s available. This opens up lots of flexibility because it means that you can use all the availability conditions to decide when something should happen. For example: You have 30 scorm activities You want to award a badge to students that complete at least 3 scorms You create a pulse activity which becomes available once 3 scorms are completed (you can do that by grade, by course progress, by specifying which activities…., all using available conditions) You configure that pulse to become complete when it’s available You award a badge based on this pulse You can do that as many times as you want. Once it’s setup, it’ll work completely automated. Doing it across courses would also be possible I think, but requires a bit more setup. Any questions, please ask! Hope this helps Stefan",

Around 100 user complete the quiz with a passing grade. Afterwards I turn on the completion tracking inside this course, and i add a criteria for that quiz with a required passing grade of 50 : Then I added a badge for the course that required users to complete this quiz with the now set criteria. Around 70~ user should've recieved a badge and the reality that there is 0 recipient. The users will only get their badges if they click on the quiz and then Moodle will realise that the user completed the quiz with a passing grade and assign a badge to his/her account. The main problem is Moodle won't update this automatically, and I don't know how to do it in bulk or how can i initiate that update/refresh. I can't assume people will check back on the quiz and click on it again (many completed the quiz months ago). I've tried to find answers everywhere, and I've tried every workaround I've found but sadly no success.",

It worked quite nicely with simple internal badges given to high-achieving students. Cf. https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Using_badges#Issuer_details Now, in Moodle 3.9 and up that option seems gone, and any badge added to a course only inherits the admin's default. I can no longer specify that, say, the badge is \"mine\" and not my School's.  If we go to https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Using_badges or higher, the subsection \"Issuer details\" is no longer to be found. Why the change ? And it is possible to bring back an editable \"Issuer details\" option to the badge's decription details ? Thanks for any help. Kind regards, Przemek",

The Open University currently issue digital badges to non-formal learners and students via their free learning platform OpenLearn . We would like to hear whether you’re currently using digital badges in your teaching, if so, how, or if not, if you’d like to. We are aware of a range of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the UK and Ireland issuing digital badges to support teaching and to reward ‘soft skills’ needed for employment. However, aside from forums associated with badging technology, there are no formal connections in place to share experiences or coordinate approach from the educators’ perspective. The data from this survey will allow us to discover whether there is an appetite for sharing information and learning about the use of digital badging, both current and desired, and work together to improve the nationwide use of digital credentials in HE. Hence, we would be extremely grateful if you could give 10 minutes of your time to complete this survey. Your responses will help us gauge the appetite for sharing data around the use of digital badges in HE for the benefit of all. The survey closes on 15 October .

We have about 10 levels of courses, and we want to let our students be able to see all the course badges earned so far. Students should be able to see badges for courses that may have ended or archived. Thank you! -David",

You have to choose at least one role, but regardless of which role you choose, any Administrator can manually award the badge anyway without any other bother. I usually pick Non-editing teacher, since it is highly unlikely you have set such a role on the front page of the site. Effectively, it means only Administrators can then award such a badge. (That's the lazy way of course: making a specific site level Badge awarder type role is the better way ;). I don't choose Manager unless I really intend for site Managers to be awarding site badges.

Background:  My development site is on my mac laptop, and I am now running Moodle 3.11.1 on that system (Moodle-on-Mac).  I am setting up a production site on MoodleCloud which is running Moodle 3.10.1 (MoodleCloud).  I copied my course from Moodle-on-Mac to MoodleCloud by means of a course backup from Moodle-on-Mac to MoodleCloud.  There were warnings about restoring from Moodle 3.11 to 3.10, which I noted; however, I do not use many special features and everything seemed to restore into MoodleCloud with few issues.  I created a sample student to test out the course.  I award badges for the completion of quizzes in the course. As the sample student when I completed the first quiz I received a notification message \"Congratulations! You just earned a badge!\" and when I clicked on the View full notification link it displays the message below.  In that message, there is a link to the Manage badges page. When I click that link, the browser attempts to open my Moodle-on-Mac installation; it should be opening the Manage badges page on the MoodleCloud installation. As the sample student , I can access the Manage badges page through the Navigation panel on the left.  So Badges > Issued to me > DATE links to the sample student's badge and Manage badges for this student. I want to change the link to the Manage badges page in the Notification's message to the correct link (the message displayed below).  Is there any way to do that?

What do you think about these changes? Do you like them? Is there anything you miss or think it would be good to consider now or in the future related to this badge page?

Since this is for the external badge page, it will not be obvious to some people who have the badge link what is a course name and what is not: they may not know at all how the courses are named of even that there were courses. I think the current title style, \"Something like a name for something students take course badge\", needs some punctuation or clarifying what the course name is. For example. Badge for course: \"Something like a name for something students take\" or Course level badge: Something like a name for something students take or \"Something like a name for something students take\" course level badge",

Today we had a meeting with Rafa, from the UX team, and as you'll see in the comment that I've just posted in the issue , he has raised several points to improve the styling page. One of the suggestions he has done is to remove this title, leaving the badge name as the main title in the content section and putting the course name in the fields, below the title. That will probably help to avoid confusion as you mentioned because the most important thing about a badge is its title, not the place where it was awarded, no? Cheers, Sara",

You can set the condition for the certificate to be awarded such as completion and passing of a quiz. Additionally, you can even customize the certificate with a custom design. For the badges, personally I have not come across a way to \"dynamically\" add the student's name on the badge design itself - as it is a static image uploaded by the admin. Perhaps, for a bit of customization you can explore the modification of the message that goes out from the moodle platform when the badge criteria is met and has been awarded.",

A teacher can only set up course badges.

Started reviewing available badges. And it hasn't stopped yet. Any thoughts on how I fix it or what is wrong with it? If I could get it to finish I could disable it in the scheduled task thing, but then we would not award badges. I think its failure coincided with the launch of our very first badge.

I can turn debugging on in the Moodle site but that doesn't seem to connect together with a manually started Cron in the command line on the server.

I used the scheduled task part of Moodle and disabled it there and then set the Windows scheduled task going again. That seems to be fine at the minute for the rest of the cron. Still struggling with what to do with that part of the cron to make it work again. One thought is patch Moodle, put a later build of the same version on and see if that magically fixes it. The other is we need to edit that part of the cron so that it gives a useful log file of what is making it stick, but I'm not great at doing that. We have a suspicion about 'has a temp table got corrupted in the database ', but again not good at getting to the bottom of that because of the lack of skill at getting out put from the cron. The other issue of course is this is our live production site which is in heavy use because of the rise in distance learning owing to the pandemic that won't seem to go away, so we can't take it off line too much.

Those badges are still visible if you go to a specific URL , but I get an error when trying to import them on to Badgr (and other badge backpack). The error I get is the following: \"Badge\nimport failed. The given badge failed validation: Unknown Content-Type\n(Not image/png or image/svg+ xml ).

Log in to the Learn Moodle site and go to your backpack settings (via Preferences / Badges) and connect to your Badgr backpack by entering your email address and password for your Badgr account. Go to Manage badges (via Preferences / Badges) and click the icon to add to backpack.

It took a long workaround, but I actually managed to add those two old badges to my new US-based account and to my old European account. I'm posting the process here in case anyone discovers forgotten badges from 2016. 1. I created a US account using another email. 2. I linked my US badgr account to my Moodle Learn profile. 3. I logged in my European account, incognito mode. 4. Preferences / Linked email: I added my other email used on the US badgr account. 5. After validating the process, I added the badges on the US account to the European account using Add badge from URL . Thank you for your help, Helen.

When we tried again later, adding a badge from Moodle to backpack worked fine! As you mention, you do need to check that the backpack settings are valid and that Badgr is correctly configured as the external backpack for the site, as otherwise this is another reason for getting an 'Invalid request' error (as mentioned in MDL-65545 ).",

One small bit of administrivia that would be useful to see who has created any of the badges (for a Course, but I believe this would apply to Site badges too).  This may be a SysAdmin or  Teacher(s) so it would be good to have clarity across each of them - a nice bit of polish in the platform. I've raised an enhancement request here - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46440 - and have proposed that the following fields are added in to the 'Manage Badges' screen so you can see who has created or modified it: 'Created By:' 'Last Modified by:' 'Last Modified:' The direction from the enhancement review was to raise it here to gauge interest across the community but also see if there were some technical wizards who were able to propose a code-snippet.",

Honestly I think that having multiple ways to achieve a course badge should be a default for Moodle. But here's what I came up with. We created a set of Page resources that have access restrictions on them. Depending on what path the learner takes through the course's content a corresponding Page will become available to them. All of these pages are formatted the same. They are titled \"Congratulations on completing the course! Click here to receive your badge.\"  The page contents provide directions to get their badge. Completion tracking on the pages is set to \"View\". So as soon as they click the page, it's marked as \"complete\". Then we have the course set to be complete if ANY of those pages are complete. And the course badge is set to award upon course completion So as soon as they click the page it triggers this chain of events. Page is completed, which completes the course, which awards the badge. It's all looking good in testing. We haven't tested it with a live course yet.",

Based on the fact that each badge has one and just one right 'View external Criteria URL' link, and trying to find a reason of this odd behavior —so a solution—, I was thinking: As far as I understand, badges are related to the user (user id, I think) so, if the related URL from Learn.Moodle is ok —and it is ok—, the thing (mix?) could have been done when the badgr backpack connection is set, for each badge. I really don’t know, I’m just thinking out loud. But that could explain why the badge URL related from Badgr is not the right one. Saludos!",

The Badges code so far looks really good and I appreciate all the time and effort that has brought it up to this point. The work on updating to the Open Badges 2.0 API that was added for 3.6 was a useful start. A list of the big changes that are due to land in Badges for 3.7: 1. Badgr - MDL-63262 Add support for the site backpack to be specified so a Moodle site can communicate with Badgr or Mozilla Backpack Refactoring to move classes (renderables, forms, backpack API) each into their own separate files under the core_badges namespace. Include changes to the coding style to bring it more up to date with https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Coding_style Admin settings to configure the backpack Extending the backpack API class to define the list of functions supported by each backpack and define a mapping for data going into and out of each backpack request New list of exporters that can export data required for a backpack request, or import the data returned from a backpack request New flow for issuing a Badge with the 2.0 API - make separate REST requests to issue the Badge instead of using a client-side JavaScript API 2. Upgrades - also MDL-63262 For existing sites already connected to the Open Badges backpack, no changes will happen until the site backpack is changed to Badgr. After changing the site backpack, each user's Badges already connected to the Open Badges backpack will not change immediately. They will see a warning saying they need to disconnect and reconnect to the backpack which will ask for their Badgr connection details. Once each user is connected to Badgr they will be able to publish Badges to Badgr and list the Badges in their public Badge collections from the Badgr site. 3. Add real support for Moodle competencies - MDL-63876 Rename Badges \"competencies\" to \"external alignments\" (as per the specification) Add support for Moodle competencies as a criterion for a Badge. 4. Improve Badges privacy export - MDL-64702 Extend the privacy export to include the related Badges in a privacy export. There is a demo site that is connected to Badgr.io and is viewable here: https://backpack.moodledemo.net/ The login details are on the front page and this site can be used to award badges and publish them to the backpack. This is a demo site and will be periodically reset. Regards, Damyon Wiese",

In the course there are around 100 students enrolled. The steps followed are: 1) Created a badge with details. description, etc. 2) Selected the criteria so that a manager awards it manually to students. 3) After steps 1 and 2, click on \"Enable\" button so that the badge can be awarded to the corresponding students that the manager should select 4) Right after confirming, 1 random student shows up in the list of awarded students without the manager intervention  but... if I click the \"Award button\" the \"Existing badge recipients list\" is completely empty. 5) If I repeat disabling and enablign the badge, it keeps adding students one by one...without manager action and the recipient list is still empty. I also checked error logs with no aparent hint of failures. Does anybody know if this could be a version bug or weird behaviour fixed in a newer version? Any patch or fix to apply?

Assuming you've enabled Badgr as the active external backpack on your site (as described in the documentation Badges settings ), then any users on your site who have an account on badgr.io can choose to connect to their Badgr backpack and then add any Moodle badges they have earned to their Badgr backpack. If users have earned badges elsewhere and have added them to their Badgr backpack, they can choose to make them public in their backpack and then display them in their Moodle profile. Thus, Badgr is a place for users to save their badges to, then if they wish they can display badges earned elsewhere in their Moodle profile. I don't understand how the badge in Moodle ends up in the student's backpack on badgr. As well as enabling Badgr as the active external backpack on your site, the student needs to connect to their Badgr backpack by entering their Badgr user account email and password (also described in the documentation Badges settings ) and then add (or push) their Moodle badge to their backpack.",

The college has multiple Moodle courses (e.g. course A, course B, course C). Each course may contain different inductions that our students can complete and we would like to award them badges for completing the trainings. However, after testing out several scenarios of badge awarding, it seems that site badges are not able to use course badges as a prerequisite to award the site badge, but course badges are able to use site badges as their prerequisite.  Other than that, badges from different courses are also not able to use each other as prerequisites. This is a problem as we would like to award a site badge once students have completed trainings in both courses A and B. Is there a way to overcome these issues? - Not possible to have 2 way communication between site and course badges. - Not possible for badges between different courses to be related to each other. Any help would be much appreciated.",

See screenshot. I know that if I entered text into the actual Badges profile field, I would be able to download results that way (because when you download users, all their profile fields are included in the download), but I would like to be able to download using the existing data - the site badges.

I've tried using the Latest Badges block in Moodle and while it's great that the user is able to see his badges there, I have a use-case that needs to allow the user to view his Moodle badges from an external site. I have already implemented single sign-on such that the user has a Moodle session automatically created upon logging into the external site. I am exploring the creation of an IFrame within this external site that contains a Moodle page that displays only the user's badges. Ideally there would be such a page within Moodle that already exists or I would be able to create one in Moodle that shows only the badges and nothing else (not even the headers/footers/other blocks/etc).

          "Text": "I thought I would provide an update as I have made my own patch to do this. Essentially I had to configure Moodle via Home / Site administration / Security / HTTP security / Allow frame embedding and set it to enabled. Additionally, I had to edit httpd.conf in Apache and adjust the configuration options related to 'X-Frame-Options' so that they do not default to the \"sameorigin\" settings. Making the above changes and restarting Apache allowed an external site IFrame to load any page from the Moodle instance. The next step was to create a PHP file that would display only the badges. I duplicated the badges/badge.php file and modified it by removing the header/footer output statements. I also duplicated and modified the respective rendering classes in badges/renderer.php so that only the badge icons were displayed. Given that I had already done the single sign-on between the external site system and Moodle, the IFrame had access to the Moodle session and allowed seamless log-in + access to any Moodle pages. Completing the above steps resulted in a patch that now enables display of Moodle badges within the external site IFrame. This should be extensible to any aspect of Moodle e.g. displaying of enrolled course names as long as the corresponding Moodle php has been created. Hope this helps anyone with a similar use-case requirement. I would be glad to help if you have any queries on this.",

          "Text": "Hello Everyone, I have been trying to set up badges for the course I am working on. So far, I have been able to successfully get badges to work when students submit an assignment. However, the badges for the \"Gold - 100%, Silver - 90%, Bronze - 80%) course completion are not triggering. I have read that you have to have \"activity completion\" turned on, but I am confused. This course does not actually contain activities . The students are required to complete the assignments using Google Docs and then submit the work into Moodle via a share link from Google. The teacher then sees that something has been submitted and works through a rubric to grade the assignment. So, the students end up with a mark for each assignment that shows up in the \"Grading\" section, but the badges don't recognize this overall grade and send the badge. I have the criteria set as: Users must complete the course \"Chrome Academy 2018/19\" with minimum grade of 80 ... In addition. Each module - Word processing, Spreadsheets, etc - is locked until the student submits the link from the previous module - which we call \"Chapters\", which then unlocks the next chapter in the story. So, we can't have any criteria that prevents the students from moving on such as requiring the assignment to be marked. I am really confused. I can manually assign the badges based on final grades, but it would be unreasonable to expect a teacher be required to manually assign multiple badges in this way. So, what am I doing wrong that is preventing these badges from seeing the final mark and triggering the badge? Thanks!",

Perhaps it isn't even possible to have Moodle give out course badges when there are no actual activities? Unless I have something set incorrectly, I am not sure how the badge is supposed to know when to look for the final mark. For example, if a student submits the first assignment worth 1 point, they technically have 100% in the course. Only after all the external Google assignments are marked in Moodle's Rubric does the mark end up in it's final state. So, I don't understand how the badge knows the difference between 100% after the first assignment and 100% after all the assignments are marked. Either way, it isn't working. In the \"Course Completion\" section there are checkboxes for the activities, but because this course only has \"Submit\" as the activity, I don't know if the badge even knows there are grades to see. I hesitate to check any of those boxes until I know the consequences. As of right now, I am stuck.",

In the attached image, you can see that there are 8 of these Chapters/modules. Each one contains: - Checklist ( not counted towards marks ) - Submit ( Students are required to submit links from external Google docs ) - Feedback ( not counted towards marks ) - Chapter Script ( not counted towards marks ) - Teacher answer sheet ( hidden ) There are other pages and such for the students, such as \"How to's\" and such, but none of them are assignments. The students copy & share the starting document, then can choose to use the checklist to complete the tasks outlined in the video. Then, they click on the Submit Your Work icon and paste the assignment link in the submit box. The teacher then opens the Google docs assignment in Google and uses the rubric to mark it. The marks that are calculated and shown in \"Grade View\" for all the students. The final mark is calculated as the students submit assignments giving them a course total. - Now it must be noted as can be seen by the image I attached. The \"Course Total\" does not add up to 100%. It starts off as 100% and then becomes less as students flub assignments, so the \"Course Total\" mark must not be used by the badges or they would be getting the 100% badge after the first assignment. I am no expert at Moodle, but it would seem to me that when the other badges work, Moodle understands that when a student presses \"Submit Your Work\" and finalizes that process, that it should send a badge. However, Moodle doesn't seem to recognize when all assignments have been submitted and only then should it look at the final course grade and determine if it meets the criteria for sending the appropriate badge. I can try and create a demo on the site you sent, but I will have to think of a way to do it. Thanks for your help.",

Thanks for the explanation In your case, I would suggest adding also the \"Activity completion\" criteria, and only let the users award the badge when both (\"Activity completion\" and \"Course completion\") will be complete. When you create the \"Activity completion\" criteria, you'll need to mark all the assignments the student needs to complete. Apart from that, you'll also need to configure the activity completion for all the assignments and set the \"Completion tracking\" to \"Show activity as complete when conditions are met\" and mark \"Student must receive a grade to complete this activity\". Hope this helps",

          "Text": "Thanks again, That sounds like a lot of settings and I am a little confused as to where to set them and the potential consequences of doing so during an active course. 1. The image I've attached shows the \"Activity Completion\" setting for each \"submit\" assignment. Currently it is set that the students only need submit the assignment to complete it. My understanding was that this was set this way because it then allows us to lock down the chapters and open them once a student submits work. My understanding was that if it was set that a student needed a grade to complete it, they would be waiting for the teacher to mark the assignment before opening the next chapter? If it turns out this is the setting you're talking about, it seems there are dire consequences for changing this setting. 2. Enable completion tracking is turned on. 3. The only other settings I know about are under Course Completion -> Condition: Activity Completion. Here there are all the \"Activities\" in the course. None are checked because I had no idea what this section actually did - there is no help tooltips. I didn't know what turning these on would do. So, perhaps if you wouldn't mind could you point me in the right direction? Will this mess up the course if I change these settings after students have been graded? Thanks!",

One got gold, and so far they were awarded bronze and gold (not sure if/when silver will be awarded). I suspect this may be a limitation of how it calculates the final grade or something. Meaning that if the student hits 100%, it also says, \"Oh, they've also got 80% and 90%!\" Perhaps there is a way to add additional criteria, but for now at least the badges are working.

          "Text": "OK - well things have changed a little. Thanks to Mary's interjection, I added the \"Course Completion Status Block\" and it said something like \"no completion status for this course\". So I went back into the conditions defined for the completion of the course, where I told you earlier it said \"Course is completed when ALL conditions are met\", and opened up the next twisty, \"Condition: Activity Completion\". I had assumed when I looked at it before that because it said ALL in the first drop down, it meant \"ALL the things listed in the next section\". So instead, I tried selecting them all, to see if that made a difference. Having saved this the \"Course Completion Status Block\" for my user now shows the following:- I don't understand why it has \"Status: In progress\" if everything has been done? If I view the course report that is in the \"Course Completion Status Block\" from the admin user's point of view it shows this for my two test users that have \"completed\" the course. So I guess my question becomes how to get the tick in that final column. I'm assuming the badge assignment is driven off that column rather than the 100% complete of the course. The phone rang at this point and took me away from my screen for 10 minutes. When I came back, and refreshed, the ticks were in the columns and the badge was awarded, so I'm all good! So I guess the pertinent point that I had not grasped is that 100% completion of a course does not equate to \"Course completion\".",

          "Text": "Hi all, I've noticed that there does not appear to be a way to view the full description of the criterion selected as the activity that awards a badge.  Partly this is because the activity's name is very long, but it seems that the \"convenience\" of truncating it for display purposes interferes with the utility of ensuring that I selected the correct activity to begin with.  At every step in the process of creating a badge and setting its criteria to be awarded, the full names of the activities are shortened (I suppose it's to avoid a linebreak?).  This continues even after the badge is created, so there's never a way to view the full name of the activity. For example, in my course I have students turn in an assignment.  If they score a passing grade, they are able to view a label. The label simply instructs them to \"check here\" to receive a badge.  The badge is set up to be awarded automatically to anyone who checks the box (i.e., students with a passing grade).  Since the full text of the label shows up as the \"title\" for this activity, it's impossible for me to check that the label refers to the correct assignment number (See below) Activity completion The following activity has to be completed: \"Label - Click this checkbox to receive a Badge for your pa...\" FWIW we are on Moodle 3.3 at my institution, so this may be something that has been corrected in a more recent version.  Does anyone know of a workaround to ensure that I've set my badges correctly?  I will attach screenshots showing that, as far as I can tell, the activity name is shortened at every possible step in the process of creating/managing badges. My workaround is to ensure that the labels are ordered immediately after their corresponding activities, and hope that the selection list is presenting them in that same order.",

To get this behaviour you can combine \"Restrict access\" and \"Activity completion\" features: You will need to create three different resources (pages, for instance) For each of these resources, you will have to restrict the access depending on the grade of the SCORM activity: one visible only for students with 100% score in SCORM, another for 60-99% and the third one, for lower scores. Besides, for each of these resources, you will have to configure the \"Activity completion\" to \"Student must view this activity to complete it\". After that, you should be able to create three different badges and configure them depending on the resource you've configured for each case. Please, let me know if you need more detailed information to configure it Cheers!",

Let's say I have three potential requirements for a badge (A, B, & C).  The first, A, is required no matter what.  But, B is only required if the user's Department is not X.  While, C, is required if the user's Department is Y. I have a few problems. The badging system does not allow conditions other than ANY or ALL. The badging system does not allow nesting of requirements. I could not find a way to access fields in a user's profile. I guess, I could create a badge for each condition (assuming I could get around problem 3 above).  But, there would be overlaps and I do not want to have multiple instances. So my questions are: How can I access fields in a user profile for badges similar to the method used for creating activity restrictions? How do I make a conditional badge that is not ANY or ALL, but somewhere in between? I am sure I have more, but I do not know enough to ask the correct ones, yet. On a related note, at the site level, I noticed that the course listing does not seem to have any apparent order and makes finding the appropriate course difficult.

Depending on the criterion, you may use the activity restrictions + completion together to get the \"B is only required if the user's Department is not X.  While, C, is required if the user's Department is Y\": you can create an activity visible only for users with Department different from X, and completion criteria with something like \"Student must view this activity to complete it\", and then award the badge when this activity will be completed. For now, it's not possible to combine some mandatory criteria and other optional but if you think it would be great to have this feature, I would suggest you create a new issue: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Tracker_introduction#Reporting_an_issue And for the course order listing, I would also suggest creating another issue, because it seems that nobody has previously requested it in the tracker.moodle.org .

However, as you probably suspect, all those links related to authentication will fail because the original source no longer exists. So it will be impossible for anyone to properly verify the authenticity of the badge issuer or the details of the issuing. It is rather like having a diploma from a university which no longer exists. A possible workaround would be to put up a redirect on the old domain so that any links that would have gone to user badges there will be redirected to a web page you make with information about the move to the new domain.",

A fundamental design concept is that once a badge is earned or \"baked\" with the data, it is fixed and belongs to the recipient. The intent is that the data never changes once a badge is awarded. The practical problem with this is that user identity is based on email and authority identity is based on domain names, which do and will change. Now, identities could  be based on something else, but that's not how Moodle implements them. There is no real world-wide standard for these things, sometimes not even national or industry standards. So, it's an inherent weakness but it can be planned for, more or less. I get the impression it is usually less ;)",

The last commit on GitHub was March 2016: https://github.com/totara/openbadges In addition to Teresa's Moodle server shutdown issue noted above, this is another reason to consider badging outside Moodle via external plugin to a dedicated badging platform, if you're doing badging for other than course gamification, i.e. transferable, lasting recognition value outside Moodle.

That's my impression, from working with both products, anyway. Certainly, a move to OB 2.0 would be good and a plan to keep up with the OB progress good too. I agree with the idea of external sources but there needs to be a lot more. Sooner or later badging will have to move to a solid accrediting validation protocol that is more centralized than the applications that generate badges. Backpacks are a good end user solution, but there needs to be some sort of  authority solution too. I've worked with people in the professional training area who see this as the key issue to get badges recognized at the industry level in the same way certificates are now.",

When you level up, you only have that level up icon until you move to the next level. So in my music class, they use custom icons for the Level Up block -- so when students earn a certain amount of XP, they'll unlock a page that awards them a badge that matches their \"Level\"'s icon... hope that makes sense. The idea of \"level up\" is taking the students through a sort of journey.... the badges (in my mind) are more snapshots of achievements from different moments.",

To verify this the student will submit the work to be validated by the academic. However the student may not complete all 8 hrs all in one go. As an incentive the academic wants to use badging to recognise the students current process. As such i have been asked to create a number of badges showing how much research they have achieved up to this point. i need a system whereby the academic can attribute hours to each student an when they cross each threshold (e.g 2hr, 4hrs, 6hrs, 8hrs) they will be issued a badge. At the end of the year each student will have all four badges.  how do i do this, i want it to be as automated as possible? I have experimented with assignments and linking grade to hours and then using course completion to issue a badge.  e.g course is complete when assignment 1 has been completed. if student has completed the course and got a minimum score of 4 issue them the 4hr badge.  However this only works once as the student can only complete the course once. This means that if they were to submit further evidence the system would not issue any further badges. Thanks in advance.",

          "Text": "Hi all. Can someone please explain the principle behind the way badges are intended to work. We are having a similar challenge in Moodle 3.1 right now. We have a course that repeats with different users every 6 months. The badge is the same but the Moodle course is not. It seems badges are linked to user data, so we haven't been able to backup & restore the badges created in the original Moodle course. We really want the exact same badge reused. Site badges won't work as each badge is linked to completing a separate quiz within the same course. The quizzes copy over fine in subsequent repeats of the course, but we need their completion to be linked to the badges. Current workarounds I am thinking about are: 1. making very similar badges for each course. Lots of work. every six months. 2. Create a meta-linked site that holds the badges and link subsequent courses to it. Complex as I'll need to restrict access to this site for previous cohorts of users, whilst cleaning out unnecessary user data. This way the badges stay at one version. Any other ideas? As previous people have said would be handy if badges (along with criteria) could be \"rolled over\" into future Moodle courses.",

The badges have been set up by a particular lecturer who wants to have them available in all his courses - since we have a very big Moodle site with 10 of 1000s of courses and well over 2000 Teachers I don't think site badges are an option here. What the lecturer wanted was the ability to import his badges as mentioned in the Tracker issue raised earlier in this thread https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-43938 . We appear to have achieved this by restoring with user data and then deleting the user data. I then read that badges cannot be created with the same name and got worried... As you suggest, I think I will ask him to add the course code to the name when enabling the badges just to be on the safe side. Thanks again Heli",

This works well. The course I am creating is intended to be an annual training course, in which employees are required to take once a year. Is there a way to configure the badge settings in that a cumulative list of badges will populate every time an employee completes this course? As far as I can tell, only one badge is issued per course completion. Something to note - I have the plugin Course Recompletion enabled. This automatically resets the course after a specified period of time. The idea is that when a course resets, the employee takes it again, and then begins to collect badges each time that course is complete. Any help / insight would be much appreciated. Thanks.",

I'm doing almost the exact same thing that you're doing, but I've set the badges to expire 365 days from the date of issue.  At any given time I can report on who has valid training and who still needs to complete it.  I'm using this for Forklift Training, Allergen Control training, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) training, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) training.  I have noticed some quirks related to badges though. If I create a badge from within a course it gives me the option to make the badge dependent on Activity completion (i.e. complete post training quiz with passing grade).  But if I create the badge from within the Site Administration module I can only use Course completion as a criteria.  The badges created from within the course work exactly as I wish, but they are not visible in the Site Administration Badge Management screen which is strange.  But if I give it the same name as an existing badge I get an error.  So they're connected somewhat but not correctly.  If I create a badge in the Site Administration Badge Management screen it won't work at all. Somehow I also managed to accidentally assign completion criteria for several courses that requires that multiple courses be complete as a pre-requisite for completing the course the student is working on and there is currently no way to remove that pre-req course once selected.",

Can we modify the site wide badge function? When we create a badge with criteria 'Completing a set of courses’, at 'This criterion is complete when' section we will add a new option that will be 'A number of the selected course is complete'.

I have removed the possibility of seeing Participants and Access to all groups but it doesn't have any impact. Is there any plan to add groups to filter on badges? Or adding a permission for that?

It seems that there is an issue with OpenBadges and sites which are using \"Let's Encrypt\" HTTPS certificates: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/issues/1141 That would explain why it's working on MoodleCloud (which is also over HTTPS) but not in you server. Please, could you confirm us that you're using a \"Let's Encrypt\" HTTPS certificate? If this is true, I would recommend to add some comment to the OpenBadge issue. Do you have any chance for getting another different HTTPS certificate? At the moment it seems it is the only workaround (at least until the issue will be solved). TIA! Sara",

          "Text": "Hi Terry, Just in regards to your first point, that warning message occurs when we ask the backpack baker ( https://backpack.openbadges.org/baker ) to check connection to your site. Basically, if you check your apache(or other webserver) access logs when you hit the \"Manage badges\" page, you should see a request to access something like \".../badges/assertion.php?b=abcd1234567890\". This represents the request being made from the badge baker to your site, in order to confirm its availability. If you're not seeing this, then that could point to a communications problem between openbadges and your site. Hopefully this gives you something of a first step in troubleshooting this particular problem. On the certs issue, I certainly can't comment on how openbadges handles the various certs, but I can say that I use ngrok on my local site, which uses COMODO certs, and this all works fine. This is the setup we would have used for testing this internally also. This note ( https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/issues/1124#issuecomment-287747415 ) on the openbadges-backpack GitHub issue seems to suggest that Let's Encrypt certs do work, but take that with a grain of salt.

As administrator I can see server badge settings and there is nothing special.  I mean all is just the same than moth or two ago, when this worked. Internet connection works OK and from the Backpack I can see my public collections on Moodle page, so I think that the authentication to the Backpack works also. I made the new site level test badge and all went OK. I can award it and student got it OK with email message an all, but he can not add ( upload ) it to Mozilla Backpack. I can not remember if there was any site level work for \"establishing issuer connection\" to the Backpack.  -Somehow it seems \"too simple\" that one just fill the fields on Site administration / ► Badges / ► Badges settings.

I can see also some of the errors you've commented (such as the \"GET https://backpack.openbadges.org/issuer/assertion.badge.image 404 (Not Found)\"). We're so close to get the real error, so let's me try to explain the exact steps you must follow to get the exact error message: Access to https://backpack.openbadges.org/ and login with your user. Using the same browser, access to your Moodle site, go to the badge you want to send to your backpack and click over the button \"Add to backpack\" below the badge image (1). Before continuing, open the \"Inspect\" (you can use \"Control + Shift + I) and access to the \"Network\" tab (2). Click over the \"Send\" button (3). Click over the \"assertion?assertion=xxxxxxxxx\" text in the \"Network\" tab (4). Go to the \"Preview\" tab (5). Copy and paste here the content you'll find there (6).

At the Open University in the UK we are using badges on two websites - OpenLearn and OpenLearn Create. We are aware that the community is working to make Moodle more compliant with this regulation, but haven't seen any details specifically about the badges. Would you please share what the plans for changes are. We have two areas of concern 1. Badges are not currently deleted if delete a user from Moodle 2. The URL baked into an issued badge continues to work even if you delete a user - two issues here. One, currently this shows to a user that their data isn't really deleted. Two, if badges start to be deleted when you delete a user, this URL will stop working and badges can not be validated. So this is a tricky problem, a solution to it could be to store such URLs even after badges are deleted. If someone visits such URL to just tell them that the badge it came from was indeed issued by the site, but not provide anymore details. Thanks, Kamen",

          "Text": "Hi Kamen, Thanks for the question. There are really two pieces of functionality mentioned here; the current 'delete user' function, and new GDPR personal data deletion. The existing 'delete user' functionality in Moodle will be unchanged when the GDPR changes land this release. This was a decision made to reduce risk, as making changes to this routine may have unforeseen consequences. The new functionality, made available through a data privacy tool, is responsible for deletion (or nullification, where required) of all personal data under certain situations, such as when a user requests to be forgotten, or when the institution is obligated to remove all personal data for the user. This works the same for all components, including badges. Each plugin must advertise which areas of it's internal database structure, file systems, etc, store personal data, and each plugin is also responsible for the deletion of said personal data. In the case of badges, any badge issued or manually awarded would be considered personal data of the recipient (awardee), and the personal data would, at a minimum, have to be nullified from any relevant award or backpack records. The problem I foresee here is that, strictly speaking, there is a legal requirement to remove things like the backpack email address of a user who has asked to be forgotten. This means that any badges that user has sent to backpacks (like open badges backpack for example) will no longer successfully validate because the hash in the assertion JSON will have changed when the email is nullified. Having a quick look at this, it seems this hash is generated on-the-fly, based on the backpack email, which will now be null. Nullification will however, stop other users who follow the criteria or evidence links from seeing the user's name and details, and this is a positive.",

          "Text": "Hello Kamen and Jake, Good discussion of a complex issue, and I must state that I am no expert on GDPR, but I wanted to pass along some tidbits from the IMS Global Open Badges workgroup who has been discussing this issue briefly in recent meetings. Would it be possible to give a user who has been issued badges by Moodle a choice? IMS supports an approach that gives the badge recipient an option to choose to have the institution retain the minimum badge-related data necessary to allow the institution to verify the Open Badge. In an Open Badge, the recipient identifier may or may not be hashed. If a hashed recipient identifier is considered personal information and needs to be removed or nullified, then the badge would cease to be valid and verifiable. As mentioned in earlier comments, Open Badges may contain information about the evidence used by the recipient to earn the badge. Evidence may be a URL pointing to information or artifacts hosted elsewhere (like in Moodle). If those artifacts are removed or nullified, the badge itself will not become invalid. In rare cases, evidence may be a text narrative embedded in the badge that potentially contains personally identifiable information. I'm happy to liaison with the workgroup as further questions arise. Jeff Bohrer, IMS Global",

          "Text": "Thanks for posting, Jeff. My apologies for the delayed response - I've been in a self-imposed communications black hole (holiday) the past few weeks. Since my last post, the privacy provider (the class responsible for handling personal data export & deletion) for the badges subsystem has been written and, as I suspected, we're deleting any badge backpack records for the user who requested to be forgotten. The tracker issue can be viewed here if you wish. With regard to the suggestion of this being the user's choice: We don't have the facility to allow a user to ask to be partially forgotten (i.e. leave some of their personal data behind, for cases like badge verification). This isn't to say that such an idea is impossible, it's just that it wasn't part of our MVP. Do you know of other systems using badges that has used this approach? As it stands, approving a 'forget me' request will remove all personal data for the requesting user, and this includes the emails (and hashes) stored in their badge backpack. In fact, we remove all records that a badge was issued to that user at all. After a user is forgotten from the Moodle site, any badges exported elsewhere during their time there will no longer be verifiable. This outcome really comes down to the fact that we have to be strict on what personal data can be kept. So far, there are only one or two cases in which we store personal data, and we do so only to provide evidence for GDPR auditing purposes, which is deemed acceptable. Regards, Jake",

I'm using moodle 3.2 and learners receive the notification alert but they have to click on it to read it. Ideally I'd really like something a little more immediate and a little less subtle. The other element I'd like to avoid is that learners click on the notification alert but then there is no breadcrumb back to the course they were on where they just received the badge. They have to go back to home or course to resume. Thanks Andrew",

Recently I've noticed that many of my students are not even aware that they have earned badges. I think this is because a lot of them are now using the Moodle Mobile app, which doesn't support the Latest Badges block. Looking through the Moodle Tracker , I spotted this issue ( MOBILE-2203 ) which raises the topic being discussed here. The issue mentions something like a pop-up when the badge is first earned as well as a way to display earned badges (or at least some of them) on the new dashboard /course overview page. Although the ideas are being pitched to the Moodle Mobile developers specifically, casting a vote for this issue is probably a good way of bringing this concern to the attention of Moodle HQ.",

Our hosting service alerted us that our server was nearing capacity, and recommended that we back-up courses and store .mbz files to a Google drive. We did intend to back up user data and course badges on the restore, and in most cases were successful. We then deleted the classes from our Moodle drive. This was poor advice on many levels, mostly because we realized we lost course history from the students' profiles. We restored the .mbz files to Moodle, but the Badge information did not restore with all of them -- likely because the box was not checked in those cases. Interestingly, the badges restored to the individuals' profiles - image and name of the course -- they even link back to a badge.php?hash=  page, which names the badge, but is otherwise blank About 100 individuals in 3 courses are in this situation - badge image is noted on their profile, but no criteria or award history. We have that information; we don't know if it is possible to restore or recreate it for these individuals without giving them a 2nd badge. I should say this is V. 2.9.6, so we are unable to delete the badge. Robin",

          "Text": "Hi Kevin: Good news that Moodle now supports the Backpack again. The Backpack is an example of the kind of free badge storing and display platform that needs to exist beyond the LMS for sustainability of issued badges. Others include Open Badge Passport (and CanCred Passport in Canada) and Credly and Badgr, which permit importing badges as part of their integrated badge issuing/sharing infrastrucuture. The student would normally share badges from the permanent badge storage platform to social media because otherwise: what happens when the student leaves the course or program? How long should the Moodle course preserve this record of their learning? what happens if the course is deleted and the information about issuing is lost? Badge rot is real... of course, decent shelf life is really only important for \"resume worthy\" badges with transferable value that employers might recognize. Otherwise, who cares: show off your badge to your friends for as long as it lasts. (though it does make it harder to take \"resume worthy\" badges more seriously...). Plugins to specialized badge issuing platforms are available for those who need to maintain badges outside an LMS, whether for sustainability or maybe because they also badge outside the LMS. The other aspect to consider is that Moodle, as an open source community-driven platform with many demands on it, may be reluctant to chase after the APIs and business models of for-profit platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a good example: it updated its API earlier this year, which broke automated publishing of badges to Certifications for all badge sharing platforms. The broader Open Badge community still trying to get that one fixed - the problem is not only technical.",

However in such case, if the student receives a score which is less than 8, say, 4, he would notice that the activity is not completed, since the completion criteria is set to be a higher-than-8-score criteria. However he used his only one attempt.. In case i further set the completion criteria to \"or all attempts used\" this would mean, that the activity is completed (win), however the badges would be given to anyone who completed the test (loose). I wonder if there is a way to both have the test shown as completed (if the only one attempt was taken) and to give badges for exampary result (80% or higher).. In my understanding that is impossible, so that i have to choose which is more important to me as a tutor In my case i have a group of 30 students and the normal distribution tells me that i should expect some 4-5 students to be granted with the badge. In this case the manual issuing would be acceptable. However i look forward the fall semster where we have a course for some 300 students, and i am looking for some automation. I think that both completion graphs and badges are useful, so that i need a method to satisfy both. Many thanks once again!",

When it is complete, then the badge is awarded. This is a workaround, but it will achieve what you want to do. For example: Create a Page with Name such as \"Click me to get the excellence badge\" and add Content such as \"Congratulations. You've earned a badge for your 80% on the quiz.\" Set the access restrictions for the Page to Grade, pick the Quiz you want, set the Grade to must be >= %80. Set the Activity completion for the Page to Require view. Then, set the Badge completion criteria to the Page instead of the Quiz. When a student gets a passing grade on the quiz, it will be marked complete, as usual. If they also get 80% or better, it will make the Page available or visible, and when the student clicks the Page to read it, they will be awarded the badge. - Randy",

So here is my dilemma, I would like to do two things, one is probably entirely pie-in-the-sky, but I'll ask anyway. 1.  I have 3 related courses and I'd like to be able to create a badge that requires the user to complete all three and then get a badge.  You might say, hey, that's easy!...here's the hard part:  My site has 12 locations providing training, each location uses their own category area & structure as well as a centralized area for 5000+ users. The site has been running courses for 4 years, each year we copy the current courses to new categories.  We have a 5-6 category deep structure, sometimes more.  Some of the categories have ridiculously long titles.  There are more than 8400 courses on my site.  I go to the chooser to select required courses for the badge and I can't see my course titles because it wants to show the structure leading to the course.  And it sorts by id number, putting the oldest (generally) courses at the top.  I can't see my course titles because all it shows is the category location trails. Is there any way to change this chooser?  Maybe a way to enter course ids? That would make more sense for me. 2.  This is the Ha! Not likely one.  We code topics...because each of our 12 locations has its own way of doing things, Ethics training isn't the same everywhere, but all of them have a course idnumber which indicates it is ethics.  I'd like to be able to say...badges can be awarded if staff complete a course with this course idnumber (first four anyway, the number is our code plus the course id). Certainly not possible as far as I can see, but...I can dream, right?",

In that case, turn on Developer level debugging in Site admin > Development > Debugging and then load the page again and see what kind of error messages you get. See: https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Debugging for more.",

But it is not here now (afaik). Persona is working today but it may not be tomorrow. How this will affect the Moodle badges implementation depends on what emerges and how up to date the maintainers will keep it. The code comes originally from the Totara project, so I think that Simon or someone at HQ who may be taking over the badge code would need to speak to that.",

Students can obtain ten badges; most are automatically awarded but three have to be manually awarded because they are not Moodle-based activities (e.g. attend a mock interview). Once they students have completed all ten badges we would like to award the a Job Ready badge.  Because of the three manually awarded badges I can't think of a way to know if a student has got all ten badges without the tutor looking through all ten badge-recipients lists to see if the student is in there. I am thinking of setting up the assignment activities that the tutor can add grades (but students don't submit to)  for the interview and instead award the badge that way rather than  manually.  It would be about the same amount of work but would allow a master badge which includes all the criteria of all the individual badges. (I hope this makes sense). Has anyone else created or tried to create a master badge? How did you do it? Did it work well?

There are a number of other benefits of managing your badges outside the LMS: centralized management, better reports, less \"badge rot\", easier recycling, blended badging, etc. The downside is that there is a cost for the subscription, but it's not expensive. They have a webinar recording explaining it and the plugin itself is downloadable off their Integrations page, or on GitHub.",

You're right that it's no more work for the tutor -- and in fact, gives you better data since it is in the grade book and in the Activity completion report too, whereas there is no record of the manually awarded badge except in the badge area. So this method results in a better overview of student work.

It's a distinct act of achievement to fulfill the same criteria again at a late date after the first expiration. That's just the way that Open Badges see things. Think of it like a sports trophy, like a Super Bowl ring or an Olympic medal: you earn it and you will always have earned it, and you are the champ, that time.

A common way to do this is to choose different activities requiring completion for different badges in the same course. And since activity access restrictions can have dates on them, you can use this to help control activity completion by date, so you can do this over time too. The long answer is it sounds like the underlying problem you are trying to solve is how best to build the completion for recurring content over time. The most common solution is to make a separate version of the course. But, there's no one right answer to that; which approach is best depends a great deal on the details of your site and situation.",

          "Text": "I've been playing with badges for a short while now and there are a few things I'd like to see implemented, if possible, that I think would probably be of use to others as well. 1. Upgradable badges - students can earn different, upgraded versions of the same badge. The new version will replace the old one. 2. More badge criteria - at the moment badges are awarded on completion of certain activities or awarded manually. I would like to see badges which were awarded automatically based on scoring a particular percentage on a quiz, or even getting one particular question right (though this might be a little more challenging to implement well). 3. Badge Award Pop-ups - something a little triumphant to tell you you've won a badge instantly rather than waiting for the email. 4. Be awarded the same badge multiple times - like a gold star for excellent work. You can then measure progress against others by how many gold stars you manage to collect. There could even be another badge for 5, 10, 20 etc. gold stars. For example. I've been reading a few of the other posts as well and I realise that some features are difficult to implement due to the Mozilla Open Badges integration with regard to the rules placed on the badges by Mozilla. I'd like to suggest that an option be added to remove Mozilla integration. Now I know that the entire point of the badge system seems to be to make them transferable but I would argue that for many many Moodle users this is a superfluous feature that they, or their students, simply will not use. I speak from the point of view of a UK high school teacher who runs a number of Moodle courses and I can't see any reasons why my students would want to save their badges, export them to Mozilla and be able to add them to CVs (which is what I understand the Open Badges system is actually for), except bragging rights. When I invent a badge to be awarded to my students the reason is motivational; they will want to collect them and this will inspire them to complete more of the work and to complete it to a higher standard. Pupils love xBox Live achievements and the badge system mimics this for them, which is an absolutely brilliant thing to do. This means I will invent a lot of badges for some seemingly quite trivial things such as being good at a particular topic, handing in work on time etc. The English department has one for 'using 5 semi-colons'. My point is that an employer need not know about these and they need not be exported. Allowing a badge to be 'unexportable' might allow many more, desirable, badge options to be included which would increase student motivation ever more, which is the main reason I use them whether or not it was the intended outcome.",

This is almost working on my test server . The login would allow things like log in for 5 consecutive days, once a week for 4 consecutive weeks etc... The problem is (that as far as I can tell) the badges in Moodle do not easily allow extra criteria to be added easily. There does not appear to be a mechanism in place to detect new criteria being added, like if you add a new block, filter or questiontype. I have the quiz one mostly working but it requires modifications to 2 core files (3 to do it correctly with language strings) to make it usable.

I don't think removing open badges support is necessary to make those changes. For example, with upgradable badges the badge within Moodle could replace the previous one, independent of if it has been uploaded to a backpack. The user would end up with two badges in their backpack if they are using it but that wouldn't impact the internal Moodle behaviour. Since using the open badges format shouldn't impact on Moodle features, I'd prefer to keep that functionality, unless there is a very clear case where it is undesirable (rather than just not needed). Although you might not expect your students set up a backpack or to export them, some of them might want to (even for trivial badges), for example if they are leaving the school/institution where they earned them. The whole point of the Mozilla system is that the user has control over the badges that they have earned, and having that control should, if anything, increase motivation further. Simon",

          "Text": "Hi Chris, I don't know what your programming experience is but if you have none then I would recommend starting with getting to know basic programming concepts.  logic, looping, variables, functions, objects and classes. These are similar in most languages and transferable. Have a look for MOOCs running Computer Science 101 as these courses seem to cover that area. If you are wanting to do programming for Moodle then you will need to look at the PHP programming language in more detail. There are many books and sites that have this area covered. For me my first experience with PHP was Moodle itself, but I had programmed in several other languages before. I learned by getting familiar with what something does from a user perspective and then looking at the code and trying to deduce how it does what it does. I started by looking at blocks and comparing the code in two or three different blocks, you notice common traits. Then I copied a block that was already close to what I wanted to achieve and changed what I needed to. The code in Moodle is pretty well documented through comments and uses sensible names for variables and functions which helps to make it quite easy to work out what is going on. Even if programming is not for you then suggesting ideas in Moodle forums is a fantastic help for programmers. Producing wishlists of requirements can help provide inspiration or a challenge for a developer. If there is a sound reasoning behind a request and it will help benefit many Moodle users then there is a possibility that someone might rise to the challenge.",

Badges management also says \"There is no public collection in your backpack\" (or somthing like that - I have it in french) but Mozilla Backpack interface doesn't allow to create a collection, just to upload badges one at a time. Manually uploading a Moodle badge leads to \"could not get assertion: invalid http response\" error. Could this be because of access settings on my Moodle install ? Edit : figured out that yes, the \"could not get assertion: invalid http response\" and the \"We have encountered the following problem: Tried to get undefined file at undefined and got an HTTP undefined\" errors were indeed due to an access restriction on my Moodle installation - seems pretty obvious afterwards. The fact is, it's only after you have uploaded one badge to Mozilla Backpack, either manually or through the Moodle interface, that Backpack allows you to create collections (ie. you cannot create empty collections). Checking \"public\" on a collection then makes it available in Moodle interface, and makes the \"\" message disappear. I might have missed something but the documentation was not clear about that, whether it is from Moodle's side or Mozilla's side. Glad it works now, and hope this testimony helps. Cheers, Mathias",

Some of our badges have an expiring date and after that the students need to take the course again.  Problem is that not all of the badges are awarded straight after the course is completed. In this way the expiration date gains more time than what actually should be. (example: course is held in April 2016 and expiration of the badge is April 2017. The badges are awarded in June 2016 so the expiration date is June 2017 and students have two months of \"grace period\".) It would be great if we could create different badges, but with the same name, and give to them different expiration dates I hope I made myself clear! Thanks!",

I started setting up badges for all of my courses, and ran into a problem with issuing a Badge for a Quiz activity.  I'm fairly certain I've set the criteria correctly (having done so for the quizzes in 2 other courses), but no badges have been issued. To summarize: Badge Criteria tab - Activity completion checked off as quiz 1 - 'This criterion is complete when' radio button selected to All of the selected activities are complete Edit Settings of Quiz 1 - 'Grade category' is Uncategorized (same as the other courses I've set badges for) - 'Grade to pass' is set to 65 - 'Activity Completion' is checked as 'Require passing grade' When I enable access for the Badge, nothing happens (0 recipients).  I've tried re-calculating the grades, switching the Badge criteria to something else and back to Quiz 1 again, and I've run cron through URL for general clean up. I'm stumped, and would really like to get past this.  Any suggestions would be welcome. Thanks, Travis",

I do wish I knew why Moodle did not correctly assign completion in the first place, though.  Any thoughts?",

For example, stacked Milestone badges, increased issuing flexibility, better reporting, etc. simply swapping plugins when you change LMS platforms (assuming your new LMS also has a plugin or you can get one developed) Your sustainability cost would then be maintaining an account in Open Badge Factory vs. maintaining a rump Moodle server. Apologies if this seems like an advertisement. There may be other badging platforms that connect to Moodle, but I only know about the Open Badge Factory one.",

Is there any way to automatically only issue badges to students with a passing grade?

Essentially what I did was to set up a \"Label\" with the criteria that the student could only see the label if they achieved a certain score in the assignment. Then, as part of the label, I have activity tracking where the student is directed to \"tick this box for your grade and feedback\". When they tick the box, the badge gets issued. So, it's all about setting the access criteria for the label. You can set this up so that the label only becomes visible if the student scores within a certain range. And then the activity completion can be set on that label to trigger when the student manually ticks the box to say they've \"completed\" reading the label. Then, the badge issuing criteria can be set up to issue the badge when that particular label activity is complete. Have a look at the two screen shots to see what I am on about: http://goo.gl/Og55Gn http://goo.gl/Op19hg It works well, but as I said it is a bit cumbersome. In my particular case, I have 4 badges for each assessment (ranging from a 1-star version for a D grade up to a 4-star version for an A grade), so I have 4 labels for each assessment. The students only see one label, though, depending on their grade. Hope that helps!",

Only one badge was issued (to myself, when I tested the assignment) when everyone in the group had completed the assignment by the deadline. Now, can anyone confirm that the probable cause of this is that when you set a badge issue date on the badge mangement system (i.e. 20th May) the activity has to be done BEFORE  that deadline (in this case, by midnight May 19th)? Is this where I am going wrong? Can anyone help? Mark.",

If you go to Site administration > Appearance > Theme > Your theme ... If you click on the name of the theme you are using, there may be a box for custom css where you can put the CSS rule. If not, you can find the style-sheet in your themes style folder... It may be called custom.css, master.css, layout.css, etc... You may need to use the !important statement on the width and height attributes of that CSS rule to override the original rule. Using a webkit based browser (Safari, Chrome) right-click on the badge and select \"inspect element\" or using FireFox I would recommend inspecting with FireBug ( http://getfirebug.com/ ). That should give you dimensions the badge is being displayed at. If it's higher than 90x90 then that is why the image is blurry and why you would want to create the CSS rule to set it to the size you want. Some themes I've run into have the base size of badges set to 90x90 and some other at 100x100. If it's not that then I'm not really sure why the images are coming out blurry for you. I'm assuming the badge is a vector based since it was created with illustrator. Are you saving optimized for the web? Perhaps whatever compression method you are using? Do you preview the image after export before uploading into Moodle and everything looks fine? Could you put the image into just a plain HTML page and view it to see if it looks alright?

          "Text": "I have a Moodle 2.5 site that works with the Spanish language packages (es & es_mx) and I recently enabled the badge functionality and awarded the first badge. The problem was that the participant couldn't send her badge to the Mozilla Backpack. A particular thing that made this issue frustrating, was that I first made certain that I had a clear picture and all the correct steps by testing the process at a local copy of the site with my own registered email at the backpack, and the whole process went without problems. However, when my site's participant did the same, the process failed. After asking her for her passwords I tried both, sending the badge from Moodle itself and uploading it directly, and in both cases I efectively received either a cryptic message, a \"connection problem\", a \"badge not belonging to the earner\" or a \"could not get assertion: invalid http response\" error message. In despair, I made a full site backup, awarded a badge to a test student (with my registered email at the backpack) and when I tried to send the badge... the process went without issues! So I have the same Moodle live site and the same badge being awarded, and the only difference seemed to have been in that one user has been previously awarded (at other sites) and the other has not (it is her first badge ever). The solution came after noticing that at the Moodle Backpack Settings page (\"Configuraciones de mochila\", in Spanish), the URL text said, \" http ://backpack...\", which led me into looking into the Spanish language packages. As strange as it may sound, after I changed all the \"http\" references, everything worked fine \n```text\nAt moodledata/lang/\nes\n/\nbadges.php\n\n\nsearch for: \nhttp://backpack.openbadges.org\n\n\nreplace with: \nhttps://backpack.openbadges.org\n\n\n// lines: 86, 208, 227, 344\n```\n \n```text\nAt moodledata/lang/\nes_mx\n/\nbadges.php\n\n\nsearch for: \nhttp://backpack.openbadges.org\n\n\nreplace with: \nhttps://backpack.openbadges.org\n\n\n// lines: 82, 202, 221, 321\n```\n Cheers!",

But tell me if our use case is covered by this. We repeat certain titles throughout the year (such as Intro to Widgets), and award a badge for course completion with a minimum score. We would like to be able to select the \"Widget Badge\" from a library when we create a new iteration of this course. As Ann describes in her question, the course level badge must be created as \"New,\" and the name must be unique. This means we have to create a new course badge for Intro to Widgets Fall 2015, Intro to Widgets Winter 2016, etc. We must then copy the description and image, and reset the criteria. This seems like an opportunity for error. But if I am reading this thread correctly, it sounds like this is the intentional design.  Is that correct? thanks for your help.  Robin Sitten - Perkins eLearning",

Some organizations create a separate course in English and a separate in French, Spanish, Portuguese etc. However, this creates an administrative nightmare for reporting, automating enrolment, etc. I've taken the route of making a single course, and using writing the course in multiple languages using the MultiLang Second plugin. In the course, you use {mlang} tags to separate each language's content. The MultiLang Second plugin works with almost all areas of moodle. The exception is the badges pages, which don't invoke the right methods for the filters to work. So users see a mess like the following: So the options I see are: Only use a single language in the LMS (this isn't actually an option) Raise the bug ( which I've done but it's receiving pushback) Change all of our courses to be monolingual, and change all our reporting processes to make the reporting teams add up multiple language variants (this is a ton of work, especially when you're making exceptions reports) Don't use the badges functionality (this is the most likely outcome I'm seeing, but would be highly disappointing) Are there any other ways I could accomplish what I need? What are people doing in other multilingual environments to incorporate badges?",

Yet, timely resolution or formal communication on what is being done is expected at this site of high repute. I'm surprised that no official (except for the response and feedback from Ms. Mary) from Moodle.org acknowledged/responded positively on how to resolve the issue that I have been raising for a week now. From the operational point of view, it looks very simple and straight forward at the Mozilla backpage site. I followed the guidelines to port my 3 badges easily from Mozilla backpack domain to Open Badge Passport domain; it works just fine without any hassles. ======= To import badges from Backpack, badges have to be placed to a public Collection (group). If your badges are not in a public Collection, please follow these instructions: Please login to your Mozilla Backpack. Go to Collections page and drag the badges you want to import under any of the collections. Check \"public\" checkbox for the collection. Click \"Import badges from Mozilla Backpack\" button below. Your imported badges will appear at My badges page. You can delete unwanted badges at My badges page in badge Settings. ======= Not only that, with relative ease, I could port my badges to my LinkedIn profile too! In the light of the above, in my view, there is some serious issue here at Moodle developer domain requiring fixing of related non/dysfunctional plug-in. I would appreciate an early fix and feedback at this column. Thanks and regards, Dr. R. Murugesan",

(So do I, although I like to peruse the forums.) In terms of how soon things get fixed, this depends on the complexity and gravity of the issue and the workload of the developer dealing with it. Of course, Moodle being open source is a wonderful advantage because it means any developer can volunteer a 'fix' for a problem and offer it to Moodle. Such welcome 'fixes' then need to be tested by HQ to ensure they will work correctly and then they can be added to the  next versions of Moodle.

I want to have three course badges for one course with all the same criteria except for the grade criteria. This is so that our students can get a specific badge (Basic User, Advanced User, or Power User badge) depending on their grades. This is how we are envisioning it: 70-79% = Basic badge 80-89% = Advanced badge 90-100% = Power badge However, this is how it runs: 70%&<= Basic badge 80 %&<= Basic and Advanced badge 90 %&<= Basic, Advanced, and Power badge Is there any way to create ranges in the grade criteria so that when a student gets a 90% right off the bat, they don't automatically get the Basic and Advanced badges as well?",

I'm not able to reproduce the same issue on my Moodle Cloud account (though I don't have access to IE to test). So at this stage I think my advice of contacting Mozilla is still the best course of action. Any other information you can provide may help though, for example: Exact version of moodle, and server details such as database , server type Whether the issue happens for you in other browsers Debugging information on network activity during the connection attempt. This will require opening the developer tools and looking for errors on the console and finding and exporting information about requests. I'm not familiar with how to do that in IE so can't really advise further. Simon",

I am writing to ask you about the possibility of taking back badges manually, or using an automatic condition or requirements. The idea is to remember the students no to relax with an specific content  which in a previous test he/she was awarded with a badge. For example if in the first year they had a badge for square roots and in the second year they fail badly another test about square roots, we could take back the first year badge to remind them that is it not just about passing tests but to understand the specific content for live. So in this case they should take again the first year test to regain the badge. I hope this makes sense. Thanks! Mercedes",

What happens in a few courses is that every user enrolled in these courses receives a badge as soon as that badge is enabled.  Users who are added to the course at later date also recieve the badge automatically which seems very odd. I am wondering if others experience this also.The criteria for the badge i: This badge was issued for completing: This badge has to be awarded by a user with the following role: Teacher",

Another badge she enabled later would then be issued to all users also after she opened the 'eye' 3) Other courses don't seem to be affected, at least I can't reproduce it when I start from scratch with a new course. I don't see anything special about these two courses that we know are affected.

          "Text": "Hi Dirk, I am not sure why the exactly problem is happening, but we can think about it together as I explain how backup / restore works. You can backup course badges, but it requires backing up all of the user, role, activity, and completion data. This is done for a reason that when we restore a badge that relies on some specific role, the role won't be restored unless there is a user associated with it. This is how course back up works and I can't do anything about it. Also the point of backup is to be able to restore a course with all the data and get it to the state is was at the backup time. But here is where the problem with badges comes. Due to the nature of badges such as that we cannot issue the same badge to the same person twice we cannot backup already issued badges. What we do instead is we rely on all the information that was backed up with the course to recalculate completed criteria. All restored badges appear in the course inactive and once you enable them they will start calculating if there are any users who have completed badge criteria. Which means that if you restored your course with all the same users and completion records and then enabled your inactive badges, they will be awarded to users who meet the criteria. So, what we need to figure out now is which step fails... With what settings do you back up/restore your courses? Do you re-enrol the same users into the restored course? Do you restore completion data? Yuliya",

However, regarding changing the word 'teacher' to 'tutor', an easier way would be to edit the roles of teacher and non-editing teacher in Administration > Site administration > Users > Permissions > Define roles and change the custom full name there. If you only want to change the word 'teacher' in certain courses, you can do so via the course settings in the section 'Role renaming'.",

How are the following use-cases handled? Administrator wants to see who has a given badge Administrator wants an overview of all available badges and how many people have been awarded each Student wants to see her current progress toward a badge (\"these requirements have been met, these have not\", etc) Mentor wants to see achieved and in-progress badges (with progress as described above) for all mentees Is any of this possible? If not, am I misunderstanding what badges are for, and is there a better alternative? Right now our home-grown mod does all of the above and more, but has no interface for actually defining certifications and their requirements (I have to manually run sql statements in the DB). Writing such an interface would be a pain, hence why I am considering moving to badges, but if what I've got fills a niche that nothing else is filling and would be useful to people, especially people who would be willing to help write that admin interface, I can look into putting it up on GitHub.",

Looking at the tEXt in the PNG, I see a valid URL pointing back to my DEV site that appears to work (valid url and assertion hash). Setting up another Moodle 2.5 DEV site on another network, not SSLed, not load balanced, etc, works without a hitch. My guess is that there's something going on that's preventing the Mozilla Backpack site from properly accessing the assertion.php page.  I'm a bit flabbergasted as the URL 'baked' into the PNGs work, but, the Backpack site won't add the badge.  If I only had access to the Backpack site's logs Any thoughts and ideas are welcome.  Thank you all and have a wonderful day! /mtb",

Firstly, if you strategry for running Moodle means you wipe users and courses(data) each year, then you lose some of the information on badges. A badge is not just for a semester, its for life. So you need to have an ongoing strategy. For example, in 2 years time if someone is to verify that badge - it should still work if it is to have meaning. So perhaps swap to a yearly moodle site  so each year becomes an archive. 2015.mydomain.com for example so the badge/course/students stay working, always.. Or do not issue any public badges through your teaching Moodle at all and use a system outside of your live teaching Moodle that will always exist - for example, if you have a dedicated Moodle site just for issuing badges use the https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=block_badgeawarder Badge awarder plugin to mass issue badges in the dedicated badge site so it never gets reset each year. Of course, there are solutions that can improve how Moodle handles badges the badge issuiong could be not linked to any live course or user data, just a log of the badge issued, so if they course, or user is gone from system it still can show this badges \"archive\" or dataset could be exportable and importable so you can move last years issued badges into the new this years site, or even other systems..

I wonder if a person could not in this case create a mdl_badge_issued_history table and using an SP move all the data into it. When a new entry is added to mdl_badge_issued, the SP creates a copy in mdl_badge_issued_history. The create/tweak the existing badges block to look in the new table for the badges.

We are a K-12 district and students move into different levels each year. We don' want a grade 8 student to be fully enrolled in their previous grade 7 courses for example, and it would be desirable if badges achieved in one year would still be fully functional in another year regardless of current course enrollments. \"A badge is not just for a semester, its for life. So you need to have an ongoing strategy.\" That is exactly what we are trying to achieve but Moodle seems to not let me the way I would expect it to be.

As suggested before, I know Credly is an option, but it requires going to a third party site, which  distorts the education experience immersion. I would like to know if currently there is a plug-in I could add or anything of the like that would facilitate me this feature, and if not, how or where could I start developing one. Has this been attempted before? If yes, what have been the shortcomings/obstacles that have stopped it from being finished; if not, why not? Thank you for your time. --Ren",

Like Facebook or any other social network it will still require registration before users will be able to share their badges. In Badge backpack users can share badges with Google+, Twitter and Facebook, AFAIK . As for your question, I am not aware of any other plugins that would allow direct sharing from Moodle. Feel free to develop one, of course. The question here is whether Moodle would want such feature to be added to core, but that's probably a different discussion... Yuliya",

What I am actually trying to do is to award 'level' badges - ie. Python programing level 1, level 2, etc. I have 6 areas of proficiency, each with 8 levels, and as students move through the courses they gradually earn higher level badges. I don't think there's any easy way to do this though, as badges don't (yet) support multiple levels nor is there the ability for a higher level badges to replace/kill a lower level badge and thus avoid 'clogging up' a pupil's account withobsolete badges...",

One way to describe it is similar to becoming an Eagle Scout.  Not only do you have to earn x number of merit badges to progress through each rank, but there are other activities /requirements of a topic that must be met as well.  Only when all of these topics are satisfied do you receive the next \"rank\" which in this case would be the course level.  Once all of the courses are completed, then the final \"rank\" is awarded.",

What would be nice if their was an inheritance structure based on the context ( site category sub category, course) so that the company/school branding background image could be inherited and overwritten using a badge baking api Mozilla Badges  mentions something called templates which I think does this 2.  Pre-requisites or the Eagle scout case. To become an Eagle/Queen scout you must have achieved a certain number of badges. Suggestion in this thread was if you get all badges in a category. I think this logic is too simple and might need something with custom claim codes or by autocreating a csv file which then uses the https://moodle.org/plugins/view/block_badgeawarder plugin to award the students badges 3. Collapsing badges - If you get 10 of one type of badge you get a you get a Super duper badge . ( I found this one on a django forum) https://github.com/mozilla/django-badger/issues/114 regards Paul",

This could lead to unexpected behaviour and potential security issues. In the latest release, we decided to deliberately clean up any HTML in Moodle badges. I agree that it is an issue, but I believe it should be fixed first on Mozilla side for us to do anything about it in Moodle.

However, when the description is saved and viewed, the carriage return characters are removed resulting in a single paragraph of words separated by a space. This results in a description which would fail most readability standards for anything but a one or two sentence description. From the testing I have done, it appears that any ASCII character in the range of ALT+000 to ALT+031 is removed from the text. Given that characters such as ALT +013 (Carriage return) are part of ASCII, is there a good reason these are being stripped out of the text? The editor happily accepts ALT+0149 (bullet point) which is then displayed when editing and viewing the description, but not the humble CR or TAB characters. Thanks Maurice",

Instead we should have a way of including this level of detail in the criteria page hosted by moodle, which I think is where Mozilla intended it to go. At the moment in Moodle we don't have a way to add text to the Criteria, it's pulled from the settings for who or how the badge is awarded. Could we not have text from a wysiwyg editor and the pulled details of the awarding settings? The wysiwyg text first and the awarding text second combined to make the Criteria?

There two types of badges in Moodle with different criteria: - course level: against activities completion, against other courses completion and issue by role - site level: multiple courses completion, profile completion, issue by role As it is not possible to set up badges in a category by level/badges already awarded I was thinking about set up the curricula in this way: 1. Adding course's badges with the Activity completion criteria (these in the first and basic course, ex. \"How to set up a course\" with the badge \"Newbie teacher\" ) 2. Adding course badges with Other Courses completion criteria (these in the courses that participants will attend after the basic one, ex. \"Improve your teaching methods\" with the badge \"Efficient teacher\" and \"Learn how to engage your students\" with the badge \"Proactive teacher\". Both of the badges can be awarded only after the completion of \"How to set up a course\") 3. Adding a site badge with Set of courses completion criteria (this one as the real Curricula Badge, ex. \"Expert teacher\" badge) What do you think about this setup? How do you use badges in your curricula? I'm waiting for your feedback and ideas.",

          "Text": "Profiles belong to all users of the system, not to teachers or students, who only get those roles inside a course.  So the role which profile badge capabilities affect by default is really Authenticated user. So you need a variant of that role: - Clone Authenticated user into a new role, making it a site level role (i.e. set ' Context types where this role may be assigned' = System when you clone it). Then set the various badges permission to not allowed for that role. - Then assign the students and whoever else should not get badges to that role (in Site admin > Users > Permissions > Assign system roles.) When they log in, they should not see badges in their profile. You may need to experiment a bit to see exactly which badge capabilities to disallow. The ones that seem relevant are badges:earnbadge , badges: manageownbadges , and badges:viewbadges . Also, be aware that there may be some odd side effects from this - in particular you will want to test that badges can not be issued to people with this role in a course either manually or via activity completion. And, if for some reason you want to enable badges for one particular person, simply remove them from that \"no badges\" system level role and they go back to being a base Authenticated user with the normal badge capabilities. You could use this technique to slowly enable badges over a period of time for groups of users. Hope this is useful. - Randy",

However, I am thinking there is a way to do this with jQuery quite easily for all roles... Create a js folder in the root of your theme folder if you don't already have one. Create a new file called hide-elements.js in the js folder of your theme. Add this to your hide-elements.js file: $('span:contains(\"Badges\")'). css (\"display\", \"none\"); $('a:contains(\"Messaging\")').css(\"display\", \"none\"); Reference the hide-elements.js file in the layout files for your theme. Of course you will have to include the jQuery library in the theme as well if you haven't already: <script src=\"<?php echo $CFG-> wwwroot ;?>/theme/yourtheme/js/jquery.js\"></script> <script src=\"<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot;?>/theme/yourtheme/js/hide-elements.js\"></script> The reason I think I would go with this method rather than just CSS is because those menu elements have no unique identifiers to target so I would target the element that contains the menu text via jQuery... I assume you could probably do a renderer over-ride but I still have not completely wrapped my head around that and this is just much quicker and easier for me... Of course, admins would not be able to see the the menu items either... It's not tested and probably will require some tweaking to get it right... For instance... That jQuery code will target every instance of a span containing the \"Badges\" text so the System Admin menu item for badges would be hidden to. You would have to modify the jQuery to only target the first occurrence...",

By \"Not recognizable with Windows explorer\", I mean that I can't view the badge on my computer (e.g. by windows picture viewer etc.) . I think it shows that there should be something wrong with the process of making that badge within Moodle. I attached the badge here if it could help. Thanks again",

I'm not sure at this stage whether it is a (windows specific?) badges bug, server permissions issue or something else. Hopefully Yuliya (the component lead for Badges) will have some time in the next couple of days to take a look. At the very least it looks like the error handling could do with some improvement to explain that something went wrong rather than generating a bad badge file. It would probably make sense to file a bug and include a copy of the badge in the Moodle tracker . Simon",

Therefore it seems to be most likely to be due to a server configuration issue causing readfile() to fail on urls. You should check the ' allow_url_fopen ' setting in your php.ini file. It needs to be enabled for that call to work. I must confess I'm a bit surprised that an external url is being passed to readfile like that. It seems like it would be better to generate a file system path. Either way I still think it would pay to report this as a bug as some code changes are most likely required. Simon",

Do you mean being able to push badges from the uni Moodle to the Mozilla Backpack, i.e. it fails because the Moodle badge issuer can't be validated through the firewall? BTW , it's not just that. External displayers also need to be able to see the issuing platform, the way the system works now. Also, is it just about the firewall or is the fact that Mozilla Backpack is hosted on foreign soil an issue? Also? What about importing and/or displaying badges earned outside inside the uni? These could be from MOOCs like EDx Open for example. Is this significant, or irrelevant? BTW, did do you know about the Australian HE CoP about badges called Assuring Graduate Capabilities? http://boliver.ning.com/ Not sure how many of its members are using Moodle, but it may help on several fronts.",

That depends - I've seen an implementation where individual teachers are allowed to issue their own badges within a course, with no/little formal process BUT they are not allowed to use any of the institution branding on those, while any badges that do bear any of the institution branding do have to follow a more formal process as part of the course development process. 3. Again, in the above instance - the less formal tutor issued badges did not necessarily go through the design team, while the more formal institution issued ones did (essentially they created a base of the badge graphic and then the text around it could be altered easily by them for each badge)",

If a badge is a small scale \"Attaboy\" to students, instructors can be permitted great flexibility.  If the credibility of the institution is included in the value proposition, then the organization should provide oversight and policy guidance to creators. In my own case, I found that perceived value is almost entirely created by the issuer.  There is very little in the inherent advantages of badges that appeals to employers. They are basically unfamiliar with the paradigm of digital mini-credentials (badges and backpacks).  Any value they attach to them is mainly from the reputation of the issuer.  \"If Purdue issues these, they must be good...\" As my published friend like to remind me, there are no rough drafts.  Everything in writing is a first article because it will never stop circulating.  I have already had to revise badges while not being able to retract the old one. Once issued, they are chiseled in stone So I think the issuer must provide guidance and assure quality.  At least, tell the professors not to issue badges for just showing up.  We have enough of that already.

If you don't want to make the content of a badge publically available, then why use a badge in the first place? - the whole point of them is to be distributed and this allows for that to happen via the backpack process. Not to allow this would kill the backpack itself as users would not then be able to use the backpack mechanism to push their badges out to other sites. You will comply with all laws and regulations, including having a\nlegally compliant privacy policy describing your role and interaction\nwith the Mozilla Badge Backpack as well as your collection, use,\nretention or disclosure of information used in badges as well as the\nMozilla Badge Backpack Terms of Use . Put very simply, Moodle provides the ability for 'Earners' to create a link enabling them to push their badges out to the backpack as they wish, it is not an automated process by Moodle, it is entirely in the hands of the user what they share with their backpack. Information is collected and stored within the internal Moodle database in the same way - and is subject to the same data protection regulations - as every other piece of information held on students in Moodle. Your badges will comply with our Content Guidelines . Yes, fine You will get Earner consent prior to sending a Badge to the Mozilla Badge Backpack. Moodle doesn't automatically send them, the user has to upload the badge to their backpack - their action, their consent. You will not send us the information of any user under the age of 13. For more information, see the COPPA FAQ , below. Not applicable in this case - no users under 13 None of your badges will contain content or other information that\ninfringes the rights of any third party (including intellectual\nproperty, privacy or publicity rights); The institution has a copyright office and runs internal training and courses about use of content Badges may only contain the user's email address, the issuer's\nname, the badge name and specific data about what the badge means such\nas the badge description and criteria URL , which is a URL pointing to a\npage hosted by the issuer that details all the criteria required for\nearning the badge. You will minimize any personal information inserted\ninto a badge's description by limiting that information to the\nachievement or accomplishment of skills, attainment of certification or\ncredentials. See the technical specifications about badges for more information. Fine - guidelines on what goes into a badge, but not really sure why you would put anything else anyway If you are an educational institution, the criteria for earning\nbadges may list required grades or minimum grades but the badge itself\nmay not contain any information indicating the actual grade received by\nthat Earner. For more information, see the FERPA FAQ below. Again, fine - Badge content contains its criteria, no personal info about actual grade obtained I can see some of these issues being significant if the system automatically pushed the badges externally, but that's not the case. Users have to set up their backpack, create the link between Moodle and their backpack and then push any badges they receive out to their backpack, so they have control all the way through the process. Possibly someone with more legal experience can tell me that my viewing of this is overly simplistic and we need a 500 page policy and process before we even started piloting this - but I really don't see the major issue here. These privacy guidelines appear to be common sense to me! Badges are intended to be public, otherwise why issue them? Students have the ability to control whether they push them to a publicly viewable location (their backpack and from there anywhere else), its not forced, they can choose not to (well in fact they have to actively choose to push them). And the data related to badges is subject to exactly the same data retention and data protection guidelines as every other piece of student information in the institution - its not like keeping student data electronically is a new issue that has to be dealt with from scratch. Can you clarify what of those guildelines you are struggling with and maybe someone (as I said with more legal experience than me) can enlighten both of us? Richard",

The problem, is recently some people are receiving the confirmation email but the link in the email does not link them to a badge.  They do not appear in the list of participants who successfully completed the course either. This is only happening with only some people, most people do receive the email which successfully links to the badge within Moodle. This is also only a very recent problem. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of issue? Thanks in advance for your thoughts. Ryan The message received is as follows but the 'My Badges' link forwards to Moodle but the message displays: 'there are no badges available'.

I mean, if they are pulled down from Openbadges one of the two next options should happen (correct me if I'm wrong): a.- Or pull them down (on the fly) from Backpack when they need to be displayed, so that they were always updated or, b.- Store them in a safe place, for example, in moodledata or the database to be displayed when a user profile is accessed. I can't understand why are the collections stored in cache? I use APC cache in my site. I shut down APC and the problem persisted so I can' t blame on APC. I also looked into server (apache2) logs and I didn't notice anything strange. How are badges retrieved from cache? Where should I go now to investigate?

          "Text": "Hi Toni, Caching of the external badges was done for performance reasons. Mozilla backpack works in a way that prevents us from getting badges from a bulk of collections. Each collection has to be called separately to retrieve a list of badges. It is quite expensive to cURL Mozilla backpack for every time a user reloads the page. So, pulling the down on the fly doesn't really work for us. Considering that badges in backpack don't change that often we cache them. Storing badges in a some place is exactly what is done by caching. The only difference is that we are not storing any files just because we don't have them. Mozilla backpack gives us a JSON string with all the badges metadata that we can show to a user. However, having said that, we do store some data in database. For example, user backpack setting as well as selected collection are stored in DB. If you want to know how caching is done, have a look at method get_backpack_settings() in lib/badgeslib.php. Also it might be useful to check \" Cache administration\" page. You can find \"External badges for particular user\" in cache definitions and see if there is anything out of the ordinary there. Hope it helps. Let me know if you have any other questions Yuliya",

          "Text": "Hi Yuliya and thanks again for your support. I'm not a programmer but I tried to figure out what was wrong in my issue, following your suggestion and this is what I noticed: a.- After retrieving one of my public collections from Backpack a new file is created in moodledata with all the details of my badges ls -la ./moodledata/cache/cachestore_file/default_application/core_externalbadges/2-2-cache/ total 32 drwxrwxrwx 2 webX client0  4096 dic 31 03:14 . drwxrwxrwx 4 webX client0  4096 dic 31 03:14 .. -rw-rw-rw- 1 webX client0 22386 dic 31 03:14 2-24083d8412ba76da628c6dac60c17916.cache At that moment badges from my external backpack are correctly displayed with my profile. b.- The 2-24083d8412ba76da628c6dac60c17916.cache file is stored in moodle data until I click again on the profile link. A that moment it loses the content of my backpack collection and shows something similar to this: The size of the cache file stored decreases from 22386 to only 146 bytes and the remaining content is: more ./moodledata/cache/cachestore_file/default_application/core_externalbadges/2-9-cache/2-96b88b03916c534ea78d5c8a6b064ef3.cache O:8:\"stdClass\":4:{s:11:\"backpackurl\";s:30:\" http://backpack.openbadges.org \";s:16:\"totalcollections\";i:1;s:11:\"totalbadges\";i:0;s:6:\"badges\";a:0:{ }} All the data related to my backpack vanishes. c.- I had a look to some php files trying to figure out why that is happening. As I said I'm not a programmer but I found that in /moodle/lib/ badgeslib.php we have this: // Try to get badges from cache first. $badgescache = cache::make('core', 'externalbadges'); $out = $badgescache->get($userid); exit(\"Toni: show me the value of badgescache ($badgescache)\"); <-- I added this line to debug If I'm not wrong, $badgescache should be able to pull up the content from 2-96b88b03916c534ea78d5c8a6b064ef3.cache but it fails without an error message . So when I add the line: exit(\"Toni: show me the value of badgescache ($badgescache)\"); .. to debug I get a coding error when I click on My profile (profile.php): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Coding error detected, it must be fixed by a programmer: PHP catchable fatal error More information about this error Debug info: Object of class cache_application could not be converted to string Error code: codingerror Stack trace: line 393 of /lib/setuplib.php: coding_exception thrown line 1063 of /lib/badgeslib.php: call to default_error_handler() line 1163 of /lib/badgeslib.php: call to get_backpack_settings() line 458 of /user/profile.php: call to profile_display_badges() ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- d.- It looks like as the cache can't be retrieved so it will try to connect again (curl) with the backpack and maybe this can cause that the content of the 2-96b88b03916c534ea78d5c8a6b064ef3.cache is rewritten loosing the data from my badges. That's what I was able to investigate. Could it be the cause of my weird issue? Anyway, why if the link to my backpack is still showed as 'connected' badgeslib.php is unable to reconnect and show automatically my collection? Happy 2015 Yuliya! Toni Soto",

          "Text": "Hi. I am having a nightmare time with the above. Is there one document which explains exactly how to issue a badge for completion of an activity? I have set activities , and set completion settings on them, and set up badges for rewarding completing the activity. Sometimes the badge is issued, sometimes not. Do you have to set the activity up first, then the badge? Or is it the opposite way round? Also, for issuing badges by role, why can't we select students by group, rather than individually? All members of a group completed an activity successfully. I would like to award a badge to them as a group. I can't. I have to issue them individually which is very time consuming. Also, in badge settings,when you set notifications to 'daily' in Badge Messages, does this mean that the badges are only going to be issued daily (and the notifications) or the badges are going to be issued immediately, but the notifications daily?

          "Text": "Hello there. First of all you might like to read through the documentation Managing badges and Using badges If you want badges awarded for completing an  activity then you should really make the activity first and set its completion conditions, because then they will appear as options when you create the badge. I'm not sure what you mean by \"issuing badges by role\" - this is when you choose who will be allowed to add badges in the course -eg a teacher or a non-editing teacher and it doesn't affect the students. If you want to award badges to a group of students it might be best to award them based on criteria so they are automatically awarded. However, if you are talking about awarding them manually then in the selection screen you can bulk select students so you don't have to award them one at a time. And for your last question, it means the notifications will come to you daily.",

The problems arise from students who finish the quiz but don't actually \"view\" the certificate.  They keep asking, \"where is their badge?\"  I have to explain over and over to view the certificate to \"get\" their badge.  Despite the written and view explanation (which they don't read or listen to), they still don't get it. The solution would be a completion criteria on the quiz itself that was a grade level that would directly trigger badge award.  Til then, I work with what I've got. Bill",

What I want to know is, when a teacher is importing their course from one to another, something our teachers do every semester, why are the badges they have created not coming over too? Is there a setting that I have missed in editing the teacher role for our institute? I understand that we may not be able to bring over the badge awarding criteria related to it, but thought that maybe the actual badges would come. I know that badges is an option in the backup/restore process, however this doesn't seem to work either (again, maybe due to the limited access our teachers have). Either way, our teachers prefer using import as it is much quicker for them. We are on Moodle 2.6.3 (2.6.4 mid-August). Hope someone can help. Thank you.",

I had originally designed my badges at 128px, and so this oversized image looked awful. Fortunately, I hadn't gotten too far in yet, so I redesigned my existing badges at 256px--that should be plenty big enough, I thought. Created a new test badge, issued it, and sent it to my Backpack . . . 220px image was still pixellated. Then it occurred to me that Moodle itself was perhaps physically resizing badge images--this isn't a CSS thing, they're actually shrunk from the 256px ones I'm uploading. If this is the case, can I stop this from happening? I want to force Moodle to store 256px badge images. I've got admin access, and am not afraid to poke around in code--I'm just not sure where to start poking. Thanks!",

Mozilla doesn't recommend large images since backpack is caching them and it would create a problem on their end. If you want to look around in code, the images are processed in badgesli.php in badges_process_badge_image() function. It would be great if someone could contribute a better solution, as I don't have much time right now to do these kind of changes. Yuliya",

          "Text": "I want to weigh in on the need for larger image, since I stressed about it a lot.  My initial design used 118 badges, so I knew from the beginning that I would not be able to design independent graphics for so many topics. I choose a single graphic with a main topic below and subtopic in the center. See: http://pipingdesignu.com/?page_id=12 As to why I decided to stay with the standard 100 x 100 size, it has to do with collection lots of badges: After two or three, bigger badges will clutter up the page.  If it displays, here is a category description with multiple badges: http://pipe.lms.infoassets.com/course/index.php?categoryid=15 Some topics have 7-8 badges. Eventually, the bigger badges would eat up the page and look out of place. Not to say that the wordy format wasn't a problem: Most graphic packages interlace the inserted text by default so it has to be shut off to remain readable in 8 pt or 7 pt size.  In paint.net, I also used a bold/compact Ariel font to fit in all the words necessary. So, my advice is to make the 100 x 100 size work and don't let Moodle compress it for you.  Every resampling and interlacing will make the image more fuzzy and is better controlled outside of Moodle.",

In that course, topics 1-5 would go over different sections of application A while topics 6-10 go over different sections of application B. I really like the idea of rewarding badges if they complete a specific set of activities . For example, let's say they pass the tests ( SCORM ) for topics 1-5. It would reward them a badge. It would let me choose which activities collectively reward the badge. If there's a way to do this, please let me know. If not, then please evaluate this as a possible enhancement.",

Then a second certificate , \"Completion of Product B\" and make its appearance on finishing parts 6-12. Then I would have two badges awarded on completing (as viewing) Certificate A and on Certificate B. Be sure to tell them they have to VIEW the certificate to get the badge. Don't forget to enable completion for the site. An alternate approach is ti have a meta course for parts 1-5 and another for 6-12 both taking their enrollment from another course if you wish.  Then you can get a badge for finishing each of the meta courses but have a single place of enrollment. I hope this gives you some options. Bill",

It's programmatic, not descriptive. It would be nice to have an ability to annotate those specifically though. Or even connect them to other things like outcomes.

          "Text": "Hi Christa, Badges made in Moodle are completely Mozilla OBI compliant. We embed the information that is required to issue a badge based on Mozilla Assertion specifications. Currently, criteria and evidence are picked up by the system automatically and are not very user specific (they don't contain user details, or details of what user have have done). They are printed as generic information on the badge page. If you have only one criterion for a badge, it will match the evidence information. If you have multiple criteria joined by the rule that any of them have to be completed to earn the badge, then badge page will print only the ones that user has actually completed to earn this badge. There are plans to let badge recipients add some badge evidence information from their portfolio. But it most likely will be done in the future Mahara ePortfolio part of this project. At the moment, if we want to print more information, we need to decide what kind of information we want to show (is it course grade, assignment submitted by a user, activity grade, outcomes ,...?). Also don't forget about visibility around all these items. Badge pages are completely public, we are showing them to everyone. So, everyone will be able to partly see the contents of the courses, or other information that they won't necessarily have access to otherwise. I can imagine adding an option to attach files or write some comments to an issued badge. But the idea of the badges is to be automatically generated, so that teachers don't have to go an issue each badge manually. In this case, I doubt a teacher will go and attach user relevant information to each issued badge if they have 200 students in a course who complate all badge criteria. Another problem is, who is allowed to add this information? If badge is issued based on some criteria, there is no really a person who awarded the badge. These are just some thoughts and any more ideas are always welcome Yuliya",

Perhaps ideally the badges to be issued are agreed across a whole school/curriculum area, badges that are set up could then have the appropriate criteria embedded already when the badge is issued and everyone knows where they are and what they can issue badges for. Officially agreed badges can then be said to being awarded by the learning provider via the school/faculty and issued by the teacher.",

From following the discussions in the Mozilla OpenBadges community group, it seems a lot of people would like to see (or are trying to build) something to mark a badge as \"institutionally approved\" vs \"teacher issued\" and/or \"official\" vs. \"casual.\"  So they want to be able to align badges with existing institutional credibility, but still allow more informal uses than certificates and grades have. Right now, Moodle badges are teacher created and issued with no real indicator of institutional or other status for a badge. So it is hard to judge as an outsider how much \"weight\" to grant to an awarded badge. Maybe if badges just had categories, so an admin could mark them with some sort of standard verbiage such as Approved, Provisional, Discretionary, or whatever; akin to having your own custom grades scales or outcomes.",

          "Text": "I agree with Christa's concern. We've just issued badges for the first time (for a conference attendance) and we immediately got questions about the criteria and evidence fields. I understand that the contents of these fields are in compliance with Mozilla Open Badges, but the wording here is confusing. The \"Criteria\" section says \"Users are awarded this badge when they complete the following requirement,\" but the requirement just says the badge has to be issued by a user with the specified role. The Criteria text sets the expectation that the criteria for the authorized user awarding the badge will be given. The \"Evidence\" section has the same problem. It states, \"This badge was issued for completing:\", but then duplicates the statement about the role required to issue the badge. Possibly it's a wording problem, or just the way the information is presented. If the \"Description\" was listed below the criteria, it would be easier to understand how the pieces fit together. It seems to me that when the badge is awarded manually by role like this, the criteria intended for the badge ought to be listed as part of the badge, and a checkbox should allow the issuer to affirm that the recipient has met the criteria. Then these criteria could be included as part of the badge. Additionally, a way to include a URL or text entry for \"Evidence\" would help make that part of the badge metadata more useful. For example, if I award a badge for attending a conference, it would be nice to be able to include a link to the conference URL, and/or a list of attendees, so someone wanting to check the evidence could see that yes, the recipient of the badge is listed in the conference directory. Meanwhile, I'll probably have to figure out how to reissue the badges I just sent out two days ago so I can make the description specific enough to give viewers (and even recipients) a clue as to what they're about.",

          "Text": "All, I confronted this issue when I approached the Texas State Board of Professional Engineers about accepting badges for continuing education. They rejected them, mostly, because there were too many moving parts for them to audit them.  I even prepared a draft policy but I fear, it confused them more. I've generalized the policy and posted it here as a public service: http://pipingdesignu.com/?page_id=187 The first finding was that badges do not carry all of the information need by TSPE for auditing the CE.  For example, there is no indication of \"contact hours\", credit hours, or equivalent metric of time. The PE must then translate this metric to Professional Development Hours according the scheme published by TSPE in the PE's \"Log\".  This interpretation is what the ePortfolio will have to do. There is other data needed as well.  I am going to handle this in the \"description\" section of the badge.  It's my understanding that there is work underway to add badge \"extensions\" but that's all I know about it. Another issue is that moodle cannot use quiz completion directly as evidence because it is possible to complete a quiz but fail it. (I'm really not clear on what moodle does here.)  I used another activity, certificate, to be viewed to get their badge, then set the visibility dependent of a quiz grade. Clumsy, but it works. Finally, it is NOT my policy to disclose grades and, gladly, badges do not. (They are on the certificates, which it is up to the learner to send on.)  What I will do is publish a policy on issuing badges that requires students to score 80% on a quiz covering all objectives to get a badge. That plus the quiz (which I will NOT disclose) will serve as my criterion but I will also have to place that in another location as well. I've seen a lot of crappy badges that would never pass muster with a licensing body.  It's up to the issuer to exercise discipline in their badges until these features are automated. I need to get this feature into production, so I can't wait for all the bells and whistles to be in place.  Just having it will be a plus.  I think badges will be a killer app someday, particularly for Continuing Ed in licensing.

It's a bare URL, rather than a link, because this is a plain text field, rather than HTML formatted text. A summary of the event is also included in the Description field: I don't normally feel that attendance or seat time are good criteria for badges, but I was asked by our administration to construct this badge and issue it based on these criteria. I would prefer to issue badges based on evidence of competency. But badges are, by design, non-prescriptive in their use and criteria, so badges based on attendance are likely to be fairly common. Given that, it seems that using something like the \"attendance\" module in Moodle provides the clearest and most accurate explanation of the criteria used to issue the badge.",

The scenario: we created a course (2A) with badges and we import this course into some other (2B, 2C, 2D), because they are parallel courses. Badges work perfect under course 2A, 2B and 2C. But not with course 2D: badges are not issued because most of the activities are no longer available (this is what on the badges' overview list appears): But there is no access restrictions and under Timing there aren't any settings: The students can access the activities, too. I know we can solve it by re-editing each of the concerned badges, but this is not the ideal solution. Why is this so? Should we take care about something special on the next importing? Can we fix it automatically, I mean without changing manually the criteria for the affected badges? Thanks for your help. It is quite annoying becasue we need all the students enrolled in this courses to do the same work. Regards, Beatriz.",

On one hand, we are keen to avoid reimplementing every feature of course and activity completion in badge criteria - if people want more criteria relating to activities or courses it makes sense for them to be added to completion rather than badges. So in this case fixing MDL-40495 would solve the problem. On the other hand, as Yuliya says in MDL-40755 , you may want to issue badges for slightly different criteria to the \"completion\" criteria. Her example is a good one, maybe the course grade to complete is 50%, but you want to award a \"distinction\" badge for a grade of 80% or more. Personally I'm not sure the best way forward with this, interested to hear what people think! Simon",

If they try again and get the pass grade then the activity completion icon changes to a green tick/check and it unlocks the badge.",

          "Text": "I am a l colleague of John's who was part of the same Moodle course. I don't have access to Moodle Tracker so will add my comments here. This is only intended to give you some insight into why this is a big issue for some people. If my tone is a bit strident, please take it in that spirit. Online privacy is a big issue for all people no matter what their age. I believe that forcing Moodle participants to display email addresses deterred participants from claiming badges in the course John was talking about and would also prevent them from using this feature of the Moodle LMS with their students. I feel compelled when using badges in Moodle for online professional development events to post a prominent privacy alert warning people that Moodle does not give them control over whether this personal information will be displayed or not. Using an email address to connect Moodle and Mozilla backpack makes sense to me. However, I've read the MZ privacy statement and it says: \"Each badge you push to the Mozilla Badge Backpack contains your Persona username and data about what the badge means and who issued it.\"  It does not say your Persona email address will be published in order to ensure you are who you say you are. The decision to include earner emails in badge assertions has been made at the Moodle end. Other badge management organizations (eg. Credly) do not automatically do that. Moodle seems to be working from the assumption that an email address is like a social insurance number --- that we have a unique email address for all learning experiences and that it will stay with us forever and ever. Only if that were true would an email address differentiate one 'john smith' from another. The first John Smith may have many email addresses across his learning lifetime and also at any one period in his life. ( I have at least 10 of them right now.) His portfolio might display badges earned at different stages of his life from different organizations and under different email addresses. Having all those different email addresses revealed in his portfolio would not create a story of continuity and would not be a way for an outside observer to be sure that the same John Smith was recipient of all those badges. If he changed service providers, his email address would change. if he earned badges through employment training and used his work email address for that purpose, when he changed jobs, that email would become completely defunct. Email addresses don't offer a great way to legitimize badge earners from my point of view. There will be unscrupulous people trying to cobble together portfolios using other people's badges. That is going to happen. The greater worry, I think, is that someone can find my email address on a Moodle badge displayed publicly, misrepresent him/herself as me using that information, and hack my email address (which those who know me trust to come from me). if you've ever been hacked in that way, you'll know how much trouble it is to notify everyone not to open emails that look like they're from you and to change all your accounts to a new email address. I think what's missing from Moodle & other assertions is a statement from the badge earner about how the evidence he/she provided was a good demonstration of the learning or accomplishment embodied in the badge. Potential employers would be able to question candidates about these experiences or ask to see the artifacts in order to ensure false claims were not being made. (They have to take some responsibility and do their due diligence to vet digital claims.) Taken together, these recipient statements would tell an interesting story of learning, skill development, and achievement that is missing in open badges at this point. Those are my thoughts. Thanks for listening. Sue Hellman ('email withheld' -LOL)",

I don't think that their privacy statement is very clear about this, but a \"persona username\" is an email address (see here - it says \"usually\" but I'm not sure how it could be anything else). You can also see in their terms of use: Badges may only contain the user’s email address , the issuer’s name, the badge name and specific data about what the badge means such as the badge description and criteria URL , which is a URL pointing to a page hosted by the issuer that details all the criteria required for earning the badge. However despite this, I agree that at the very least we should give the user a choice about if their email is displayed, and ideally avoid displaying it all together. The only reason I'm giving any push back at all is that we also want badges to be verifiable. To be clear, given a choice between good privacy and verifiable badges I would still choose good privacy, but what I'm wondering is, is there a way for us to have our cake and eat it too. Unfortunately as of right now I can't think of another way, and ultimately this is a problem that needs to be solved by the badges infrastructure rather than us. If anyone has any thoughts then please share! that we have a unique email address for all learning experiences and that it will stay with us forever and ever Again I agree this is definitely not the case. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the current badges infrastructure. I have already been involved in the discussions with Mozilla about this issue here: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/issues/42 Unfortunately there hasn't been any progress on this issue, and we've done just about all we can to mitigate it in moodle by allowing users to at least pick which email they connect with. Anyway, I will discuss some more with Yuliya and we will try to do something soon. Simon",

When you say replace the email address with a serial number, what would the serial number be? How would it help the user to prove that they earnt the badge? To give an example, here are a couple of badges I earnt recently for presenting at a Mahara Conference: http://backpack.openbadges.org/share/102d9e69f989168a46e3ff52c3100c7b/ If you follow that link you will notice that nowhere on that page is my name mentioned. In fact you would have to follow the evidence link: https://maharahui.org.nz/badges/badge.php?hash=f2042d6b666bcae453f822fbe6e6e1d78341c21b To see that the badge was actually issued to Yuliya (I never presented at the conference, she did). If people want to use badges as digital certificates, this is actually quite a serious problem (in my view it is more a problem with the open badges system than its implementation in moodle). Now what I'm saying is, by removing the email address we will make it harder to verify that the person claiming the badge did in fact earn it, as all you are left with is the users name (which is much less unique than an email, particularly in some parts of the world). As I said before, given the choice I agree that privacy should trump verifiability, but can we have both ? I'd like to hear more about your serial number idea and how that could help with verification. Simon",

          "Text": "Hi Simon, When Badges first appeared in Moodle, the learners Moodle email address was used as the auth for Persona, that changed when we put a preference into the back pack config. Within Moodle a learner/user can change any part of there profile. Moodle in order to keep some sanity especially in the grade book, provides each user with a unique UID, that UID can not be changed. It follows you through any changes in your profile. Badges as with any award system, needs to be able to identify the recipient, this is done by Name and Email address, great if they don't change. Replacing the email with serial which is always tagged to the UID by default, provides a better verification of the badge. The advantages of leaving the email visible, a viewer can contact the recipient direct. Not so good if the recipient is a child. If a viewer wishes to contact the recipient then the Contact link in the badge becomes the way in/filter. A example, Female student enrols using what will become her maiden name, has badges awarded. Student marries and the last name changes, she also changes her email address. She now as a married women seeks RPL using awards in her maiden name, issued by Moodle. The details on the badge have no relevance now. If a serial was used then the award can be verified irrespective of the User details, the serial is truly unique, the student only has to verify maiden name, usually included on the marriage certificate. Sorry about the poor example. John",

Unfortunately until the backpack supports multiple email addresses there isn't really anything we can do to handle that as the email is baked into the badge at the time of issue. I wouldn't say using the moodle user id number provides better verification of the badge because it is specific to the moodle site that awarded the badge, which may not even be accessible to the person attempting to verify a badge. In the end we have decided to take two steps: 1. Remove the email address from the badge award page. This will be treated as a bug and backported to older stable releases too. 2. Create a new improvement bug to add a form to the badge page. A user can insert an email address and the page will tell them if the badge was awarded to that email address or not. That way someone who knows the email can still verify it, but they can't discover the email unless they already know it. This will be a new feature in a subsequent release when we have time to implement it. Hopefully that will provide an acceptable balance between privacy and accountability.

Just substituting another image behind the scenes has implications as there is hidden metadata added into the image data to connect it the original issuer.

My understanding is that if you bypass the regular upload process, the image will be missing this. That may not matter in casual contexts but matters very much for accreditation, professional, and business contexts. There may be some ways around this such that the security data could be stamped on download /email. Or a badge could have \"versions\" of itself all recognized as the \"same badge\" (like paper certificates). The ultimate answer will be some sort of ping-back security method so a badge out in the wild can find the original issuer and verify/update/replace itself.

          "Text": "This does make sense. It would be unusual for an organisation to recall printed certificates to amend them after issue - and this is the same. If a badge needs to be updated then a current badge can be withdrawn (without any effect on existing badge recipients) and a new replacement badge can be created. However the message that is displayed when you click \"Enable access\" doesn't make it clear that the image can't be edited or updated later. So perhaps this could be improved? i.e at the moment it says: Changes in Badge Access This will make your badge visible to users and allow them to start earning it. It is possible that some users already meet this badge's criteria and will be issued this badge immediately after you enable it. Once a badge has been issued it will be locked - certain settings including the criteria and expiry settings can no longer be changed. Are you sure you want to enable access to the badge <badge_name>?

Whether that is possible or not depends on what issues or changes are required by HQ. The feature freeze, we have just found out, has moved forward by three weeks to 1st April which makes it a bit less likely now but we will try. If it doesn't make it in 2.5 obviously we would go for 2.6 instead. Yes maintaining a moodle based on our github would be a problem, which is why I'd suggest treating the code as alpha (testing only) until we manage to get it into core. If you absolutely can't wait, probably the best approach would be to squash all the open badges commits into a single patch, then create a branch off the moodle repo and merge it into that. Of course you'd have to deal with any merge conflicts yourself but you would be able to control updates from upstream too. Simon",

At first we were looking at the possibility of building our own by modifying the activity tracker to display different badge images instead of the check-marks that appear on completion of an activity... But this looks a lot more promising and robust... Unfortunately, the deadline for this current project doesn't afford us the time of an official integration into 2.5 or 2.6 we need to have this badge system presentable (not necissarily 100% finished) to the client in a stable version of moodle in one months time. So now, me and the rest of the development team are faced with the question of, 'Do we forge ahead and build upon the openbadges approach that has already been started here: https://github.com/totara/openbadges/ or should we go with our original idea of building our own custom activity tracker and morph it into a custom badge system?' I'd like to get the communities opinion on what would be the more time effective approach. Can moodle openbadges, as it is so far, be brought into the stable 2.4 version? If so, what steps would one need to take to do that? Any help is greatly appreciated!",

You could then apply that against a stable Moodle release (fixing any conflicts due to changes to Moodle between 2.4 and 2.5). I don't think it would be too hard since most of the badges code is independent from Moodle. The advantage of backporting is that you would avoid having to build something for yourself, and would get any ongoing updates and bug fixes for free. You could also contribute back any bug fixes or improvements you make. On the down side, if we have to make any significant changes to get our code into Moodle you may have some work to merge your branch with the new version when it eventually makes it into Moodle.

But when you do get some time, please remember that many schools stdents don't have email, so using email as the only notification method is not good. As I think about it, would it be possible for admins or teachers to have a default message that can be created and sent out through ALL message channels in Moodle? For example, if a student earns a badge, then every communicatoin method Moodle uses (messaging, Email, etc.) would pick us this default message and send it out. I was envisioning something like: \"Hello (variable to hold student name) You have achieved (variable to hold what achievements are possible, like grade percent or letter grade, or maybe even x numbe rof forum posts, or time spent in an activity) I am proud of you, and you are awarded the (variable to describe badge) badge\" Perhaps this message could be contained in a teacher configured field so that the teacher could insert a variable name within custom text? But the most important thing is of course to just have notification capability beyond email. Thanks again for helping the community.",

Course badges will appear in the course badges link in a course but only in that course. - So, i intended to make Badges for each topic completion and when you complete a course, you get a Badge(Belt Image) for course completion. Is there a way or a workaround to make the previous badges earned throughout the course to not be visible at some area. The profile page shows all badges earned, regardless of the course. I was hoping first to make Course Completion badges on Site Home, so you can see only the course completion badges i.e the Belt on the 'My Latest Badges' block on the My Home Page or at the 'Profile'. And the badges block made inside the course, will only show Badges earned inside the course. i.e 'Course Badges'. But it aint the case, as the My Latest Badges block shows all course badges even on the 'My Home Page', when it should only show 'Site Badges' at this point? Or am i missing something. Thanks.",

I THOUGHT that I could create a badge under Site Administration and then the badge would show up in every course. But that isn't happening for me. Is that my issue, or Moodle's? If mine, then how should I create a new badge that will be visible in every course? It seems clunky to have to create badges in every course. Also, when I do create a badge in one course and award it, the badge shows up on the Front Page \"My Latest Badges\" block, and also shows up in the course where I created it, but any secondary courses the student might be enrolled in it does not show  the awarded badges that appear on the front page and the first course.

I am interested in letting the students \"brag\" about what badges they have, and isn't that self-defeating to hide badges in their personal profile page? I want any badges the students receive to be front and center. In the graphics in inserted, that is what want the student to see. But I think you are saying that in order for others to see their badges, they have to navigate purposely to the profile page of a student, right? Basically, I want it to work just like it does here at these forums. I can see all your badges right below your picture. Can't I do that too? Maybe I shouldn't use the badges block?

As you said, Badges you make as a site admin will appear in the user's profile but not in the course as they are not course badges. Course badges will appear in the course badges link in a course but only in that course. - So, i intended to make Badges for each topic completion and when you complete a course, you get a Badge(Belt Image) for course completion. Is there a way or a workaround to make the previous badges earned throughout the course to not be visible at some area. The profile page shows all badges earned, regardless of the course. I was hoping first to make Course Completion badges on Site Home, so you can see only the course completion badges i.e the Belt on the 'My Latest Badges' block on the My Home Page or at the 'Profile'. And the badges block made inside the course, will only show Badges earned inside the course. i.e 'Course Badges'. But it aint the case, as the My Latest Badges block shows all course badges even on the 'My Home Page', when it should only show 'Site Badges' at this point? Or am i missing something. Thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Joshua, There are several reasons for that. First of all some badge criteria can include roles. Backup is designed the way that doesn't allow backing up/restoring roles without backing up users. Another reason is that we cannot backup/restore issued badges as that would involve baking badge images during restore which can be time/resource consuming. So, after badges are restored, all issued ones can be issued again to all the users who previously had them on the next cron run. Maybe there can be some kind of an additional setting that would allow to specify not to restore user badges. That would remove one of the constraints. But I am still not sure what to do with roles that depend on enrolled users... Please let me know if you have any suggestions or further questions. There is always room for improvements ;) Yuliya",

Do you think there should be some kind of visual indicator on a badge page (like this page https://moodle.org/badges/badge.php?hash=889e023f7e9b8e5e209b63bf9f9337d5513e81de ) that current recipient doesn't exist any more? To be clear, we don't want to delete badges when user is deleted. It's important to keep them because if a user has added their badges to the Mozilla backpack already, there is a link in badge details that goes back to Moodle site to show more information about this badge and the recipient.

Teachers can not see badges in courses other than ones they teach (just like anything else.) A Non-editing teacher in a course can see all the details of awards in Manage badges, but they don't have the ability to create, edit, or delete badges. By default they can not award manual badges, either. A Manager has the same abilities as a Teacher in the categories and courses they can manage.

For instance, you could create a special site- wide role that can see all courses and badges and also the site badges. You could do this by cloning the non-editing teacher role, making it a system level role, then setting badges:viewawarded to Allow. Assign someone that role at the site level and they should be able to see the badges in every course and also the site level. In my screenshot, I did this to the Authenticated user role, actually, instead of Non-editing teacher, just to prove it works. In a live site, you would want to refine such a role to just the capabilities you want them to have. My example just serves as to illustrate how you can go about doing it.",

          "Text": "Dear all, how are you doing? Does anyone else also experience problem to download the \" Learn Moodle participant 2013 \" badge from Moodle MOOC? I tried to use Firefox and Chrome to download the badge from http://learn.moodle.net/badges/badge.php , the \"download\" button would not work. If I use mouse right click and just download the badge as an image (f1.png), then upload it into backpack.openbadges.org, it will say \"Image does not have any baked in data.\" This seems to be consistent with what this blog has reported. However, if I go to the http://learn.moodle.net/badges/mybadges.php and click on the \" Download all \" button, then downloading the .zip file and unzip it. I can then use this unzipped image file (Learn_Moodle_participant_2013_12_Sep_2013_020b8668) to upload into backpack.openbadges.org successfully. Is this a known bug? Should I file a bug report on Moodle bug tracker? Also, once you have the \"Learn Moodle participant\" badge on backpack.openbadges.org and setup your moodle.org profile to sync with backpack.openbadges.org, it still doesn't seem to display the badge correctly. Any idea what's wrong and how to fix this? Thanks!",

Mozilla's Backpack (the only one currently supported in Moodle) requires you to use Persona, their identity mechanism, which in turn is linked to an email account that it has validated. All the external backpacks I have seen so far require some sort of email address. You can of course still issue badges to students in Moodle which will live on their Moodle profile in the Badges area without putting them in an external backpack at all. I presume you are using some sort of made-up email for the Moodle accounts of students who have no real email address? If so, be aware that when you issue a badge that it is valid only for that email address. Currently, Mozilla's Backpack will only allow you to upload a badge that was issued with the same email address as you are using for the backpack. By default, Moodle uses the user's Moodle email address for a badge. But, if the user has connected their external backpack to Moodle (in Administration > My profile settings> Badges > My backpack settings > Email address) with a different address, it will use that one instead as the badge recipient.",

The good news is that the recipient email address is added to the badge only at the moment of \"baking,\" that is, downloading or copying to the backpack.

As an experiment, I made a badge with an expiry of one day and watched what happened. It puts a bar across the badge. But just a thought, perhaps if, since we can't delete earned badges, maybe the bar across badges that are revoked could say \"REVOKED\"? Wouldn't that in effect invalidate an earned badge and do the same thing as deleting them? Perhaps adding options in the badge creation where several \"bar\" otions coud be added, like \"REVOKED, EXPIRED, INVALID\", or maybe a custom message could be put on badges.  Just an idea. Do you have a tracker number where I can watch the development? I would like to know when these issues have been fixed. Thank you again.",

That's if you want the image file with the data in it. However, the data is always available in the database , so you can get all the information about an issued badge from there. Currently, Moodle only supports the Open Badges backpack for direct integation, but in the future it will probably support others. Some people in the corporate world are adding backpack capability to internal systems for collection. You might check out the OB Community site for more info: http://community.openbadges.org/",

For example on the Site badges page you could do something like this to hide the 'criteria' column: #page-badges-view .collection .criteria { display: none;} To hide other columns just change .criteria for one of the following: badgeimage name description awards If you wanted to shrink the badge image size you could do: #page-badges-view .collection .badgeimage img { width: 50px; height: 50px;} To shrink to half the current size. Not sure where you would want to apply a scrollbar but that can be done by setting the container height then using overflow: scroll; Simon",

          "Text": "Kat, For now, in a site with no internet access, assuming Moodle is already up and running, then for badges there are two considerations: 1) You should be able to make and issue badges without any problem even if Moodle is not connected to the net. But students will be able to download badges they have been awarded and possibly then use them elsewhere on the internet. In a sense badges are just image files with special data in them. So, like any file, they can be emailed or facebooked, etc. There is currently not a way in Moodle to prevent such downloading. 2) Each badge is given a unique 40 digit identifying number inside of it. If the badge is downloaded and saved by the student to their Open Badges backpack and the badge made public, then this number can be used in a URL that can be clicked on to take someone to the information page on your site about that badge. Here's one of mine: http://2013.imoot.org/badges/badge.php?hash=68f147136711f857deccbd5e74d689a72b1da8a9 If your site is not on the internet, of course, they won't be able to actually reach your site. But the URL is there to be seen. And if your site ever does show up on the web, then those links would work. One setting I suggest for badges is to turn off 'Site administration > Badges > Badge settings > Enable connection to external backpacks', since without an internet connection it won't work at all.",

In theory, I suppose any number would work as long as it was unique in your site for that badge issuance. The most proper way would be to make the number the same way as the code (in /lib/badgeslib.php) uniquehash = sha1(rand() . $userid . $this->id . $now) where $this->id is the badge id and $now is time(). You can use a site like http://www.sha1-lookup.com/ to generate the number if you have the time() and copy/paste in the id numbers to do this manually. I have not tried this at home ;) Randy",

First, when a user clicks on the badge or is awarded a new badge, there is a \" Download \" button. What's the purpose of this? How is it to be used? Secondly, I noticed that when I delete a badge from Moodle, it continues to show up for students. Is it possible to award a badge, then delete them? For example, if a teacher had mistakenly awarded one, or, if a student committed fraud that was later discovered... Can you check and see if this happens for you? Thirdly, I am wondering if I have to create all badges myself? I know that Mozilla has backpacks, but seeing as I am not using emails to award badges, where can I get a collection of badges? If I get them is the best place to put them in the repository? Thank you both for the quick response.",

          "Text": "Doug You might want to check out this http://openbadges.learningassistant.com/ from Mozilla on Open Badges. It will explain most of the background to answer your questions. Badges are not something created by or for Moodle, but an implementation in Moodle of Open Badges, which is an open source project made by Mozilla, already in use by lots of software in many industries besides education. To address your specific items: 1) Badges are downloadable since the whole idea is they belong to the person issued to, the recipient.  The recipient can download them to save to a badges collection known as the \"backpack\" - which is theirs and has nothing in particular to do with Moodle at all. 2) This is on purpose: badge templates deleted at the system or course level are archived, not truly deleted. This follows the Open Badges principle that once awarded, a badge belongs to the recipient, not the issuer. So badge once issued exist on its own, regardless of the status of the original badge template it came from. (My old junior high school exists no more, but I still have my diploma.) An issued badge has a unique URL that goes back to your Moodle site to allow validation. It needs to find information such as issuer, criteria, and other evidence of its validity somewhere. While the original template badge may not be active anymore, that data is required for reference (\"evidence\"). Currently, badges issued in error (for whatever reason) don't yet have a method of \"revocation.\" Mozilla is very aware and working on how to do that. 3) You don't have to make the images, as Mary noted, but you do have to make each badge. That is, you have to create each badge in Moodle with its criteria and so forth. A badge is the image file + the metadata associated with its recipient, issuer, criteria, a unique identifier, and so forth, and this metadata is 'baked' into it when it is awarded and issue to a user. Basically, once awarded, a badge is on its own out in the world, property of its recipient. Revocation will arrive one day, but as always ... Award wisely ;)",

Philosophically, I see badges as an exciting prospect to create permanent \"digital transcript\" of work as large as degrees and as small as small a tutorial or brief workshop. I sat through a demo of badges implementation in Moodle 2.5 at a Moot in Montana, USA last week and have also explored BadgePress in WordPress and also LearningDash/Credly systems. Here is a question I think we need to come up with an answer to this: badges seem somewhat universally tied to an email address. That makes sense as one of the few personally identifying pieces of data we have. That said... if you are using this framework in a University or K-12 infrastructure, the Moodle account is usually associated with an assigned K-12 or university address email address. It seems to me that those addresses are temporary and fleeting. We need to build functionality into this implementation of badges that allows students to direct their badge to a personal backback so that they can keep their records over time. Do I understand the issue correctly? Thanks, Jason",

          "Text": "That's right, the email address you use for your backpack can be any email address you like. However there are a few issues here: When you import a badge into a backpack the email address assigned to the badge must match. To get around this in Moodle we use the email address used to connect to your backpack when baking the badge, or fall back to your moodle email if that isn't set. This ensures badges exported from Moodle can be imported if you have connected to your backpack. The problem is, if you are issued several badges which are tied to your Moodle email, and then you manually download them and try to add them to a backpack that uses your personal email it won't let you (because the emails don't match). I think this can be solved by allowing a user to validate multiple email accounts within their backpack. That way a user could maintain control over a personal backpack but still import badges baked using their \"work/school\" email. There is an open badges issue about it here where I've posted my thoughts but it hasn't really progressed unfortunately: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/issues/42 A second way to interpret your comment is that you'd prefer badges not to be tied to any email address. I know Mozilla have designed their spec to support other identity \"types\" other than email, but email is the only one supported at the moment. Hope that helps, Simon",

          "Text": "\"this can be solved by allowing a user to validate multiple email accounts within their backpack.\" Agree, and I hope this could be solved using the Persona ability to associate multiple emails with your Persona identity. Seems to me an obvious solution would be, on upload of the badge to the backpack, if the email does not match, query Persona whether that email is an already validated alternate one. (That may cross the 'authentication vs. authorization' line for them, but if so, I'd say then there's no point in using Persona for applications like backpacks then.) Personally, I consider this a blocker for using Moz Backpack until addressed. I can imagine all the privacy/policy issues trying to collect the email address for someone's backpack in Moodle. If someone has connected a backpack, that's one thing, but people should not be required to put that info in Moodle (or any other application) in order to be issued valid badges.",

Any trademark or copyright infringement would be the issuer's problem, not Mozilla's. One thing I'd suggest right away is that the \"badge issuer\" email should be carefully considered. I'd suggest creating a distinct one for this purpose at the site level and seriously consider whether to tell teachers at the course level that they can use their own email or not as Issuer. Next, since there is no method yet of revocation, I'd suggest telling course badge issuers to use expiration dates, especially for test badges. Until there's a way to have a sitewide collection of badges to pull from, a good practice would be to put all \"official\" images somewhere for teachers to use as blanks. Many schools have some sort of official policy already on copyrighted material use by faculty. The language probably covers images used in badges already, but it might be good to make that explicit.

It will depend on how your gradebook calculates: if you are using simple weighted mean of grades, the number would be the percentage (e.g. 80); if using points (sum of grades) then you'd put the number of points to pass. The purpose of a badge using grade criteria is to allow you to award a badge for a grade in the course that might be different from the course completion criteria grade. For example, course completion might be set at 80% to pass (which could earn a badge) but you could have a badge for 100% for a perfect score too. Or if someone did not complete the course at 80%, you could still award a badge for 'participation' set at a lower number, like 50 or 60, for example. Or, your course completion criteria might not have any grade requirement at all, only activity completion. A person could complete the course but not get a badge for that, but could get a badge for the score with this setting. Be aware there are still some issues with this MDL-40755 being worked out though.",

What I meant to say was \" I disabled course badges AND THEN followed the suggestion in the FAQ document ....\" I was looking into how Moodle might be used to award badges based on an organisational badge scheme/pathway. For that approach, badge creation would need to be centralised (confined to Admin or Manager) but teachers should be able to award them to students. I'm not saying that's what should happen, teachers having the freedom to make their own badges is a great motivator, but I was wondering if it were possible to combine a course and an organisational badge system within Moodle. After following the FAQ instructions it seems teachers can see site badges but a) don't seem to be able to award them and b) they still have the ability to create badges even though the course badge permission was disabled.

During analysing badges feature we found some issues that should be solved.  If we haven't found some existing features or settings. Most organization will start work with badges in test courses. The badges users get from this courses can't be deleted. This should be possible. If a students gets a quiz result and therefor a badge, but afterwords the teachers finds that the student cheated during the quiz, normally he would delete the quiz attempt and results. It should be possible to delete such badges by anybody inthe system. Its clear that there is no influence if the student exported the badge in between. There are lots or workers council contracts that personal data about performance data. Most of the time its not allowed to hold such data endless in databases. They have to be deleted fully if a students gets from the school/univesity, the employee leaves the company of time based after some years. Its  a little bit similar to log data that have to be deleted after weeks or months. We didn't found an option to really delete such data in the database fully. Our suggestion: Add system settings: - delete user badge data if the account is deleted - delete badges after x month, x years fully. Ralf Hilgenstock German Moodle Partner",

To do that securely will require cross network and application communication standards (yet to be decided on or built) and a ping back mechanism from the badge or backpack to the original issuer. That's not a trivial problem. Until all that happens, the best an application can do is add some features to better handle the badges at the local level - like marking a badge as \"test\" etc. - knowing that once the badge is downloaded by the user, it it an independent entity.",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm very pleased to announce that Totara Learning Solutions (the distributors of the corporate distro of Moodle called TotaraLMS) will be developing an Open Badges solution for Moodle and Mahara . The \"Moodle as Issuer, Mahara as Displayer\" project will integrate Mozilla's \"Open Badges\" software to issue, manage and display digital badges in Moodle and 3rd party sites such as social media and also eportfolio systems - we'll develop a solutions for Mahara. We will use Moodle.or to collaborate and get feedback on the specs and of course all the new software will be released as open source to Moodle (ideally integrated into core) . All users of Moodle, in all the different contexts, stand to benefit from this initiative. As some folk know, I've been involved in a number of significant Moodle based projects over the years including MyMoodle and Moodle Networks (Mnet) and I lead the Mahara project, and also Totara Learning Solutions so it's great to be doing this project. We're strong believers in the transformative nature of open source infrastructure and open badges has some amazing potential. Although, the architecture has yet to be finalised, the high level thinking goes as follows at this stage. Please bear in mind that we will work closely with Moodle HQ and Catalyst also, as we have historically done. On this occasion we will also be working with Mozilla. Issuing badges will leverage Moodle’s Activity and Course completion functionality. We are the maintainers of Course completion. It is likely we will develop a significantly updated and modified version of the Certificate module, that will dispense Open Badge PNGs instead of PDF files. Badges will be stored in Moodle and can also be downloadable by users once they have earned them. A web service (open to all, no authentication needed) will be provided to help displayers verify the authenticity of badges issued by a specific Moodle site. On the display side, we will create a new block for Moodle that users will be able to place on their profile page. It will be a similar version to the Mahara block and will use the same underlying library for interacting with the Open Badges API. We will use the Moodle Portfolio API to push badges automatically to Mahara. About Open Badges Learning today happens everywhere but it's often difficult to get recognition for skills and achievements gained outside of formal education and training contexts. Mozilla's Open Badges project is working to solve that problem, making it easy for any organization or learning community to issue, earn and display badges across the web. The result: recognizing 21st century skills, unlocking career and educational opportunities, and helping learners everywhere level up in their life and work. The Badges for Lifelong Learning Competition brought together Web developers, designers and technologists with educators, online learning innovators and collaborators that range from NASA, the U.S. Department of Education and the Girl Scouts of America to Intel, Disney-Pixar and Motorola. The goal: explore how digital badges can provide learners of all ages new ways to gain 21st century skills, harness the full educational power of the Internet, and unlock career and learning opportunities in the real world.

Many Moodle systems are not integrated with Mahara and some Mahara systems may use another LMS. Personally, I think institutionally hosted portfolios aren't the best approach as learners should have ownership and control over their own materials and CV/resume. Some learners use blogging software or other popular CMS' to organise their online portfolios so that they can keep it with them no matter where or what they study, either in accredited institutions or informally. This is particularly true of programmers, writers, musicians, actors/performers and artists.",

Also o n the display side, we will create a new block for Moodle that users will be able to place on their profile page - at least that's the thinking at the moment.   We'll write up the spec for comment anyway. The Moodle block will be a similar version to the Mahara block and will use the same underlying library for interacting with the Open Badges API. This code could be used in any app e.g. Drupal.

I have a course I'm building in Moodle this year in which I'd like to award badges.  I've been chatting to the people in badge.us (which I may use to issue badges if I don't have an option within Moodle) and they tell me that they will be building an API - should we be thinking of linking Moodle to an open-source project such as badge.us ? Is anyone is planning to go to ALT-C conference in the UK ( http://www.alt.ac.uk/altc2012/ )? I have had a presentation accepted on Open Badges.  It is very much from the user's perspective and as I can't say that I am an expert on Open Badges, I hope to make it a fast presentation and concentrate on generating a discussion, and I hope I can get a few interested people to come along and contribute.

This is the easiest to implement but it does mean that users must set up a Mozilla Persona account or equivalent and actively manage their badge backpack. As for option 2, we haven't fully investigated the portfolio API so I can't really answer your question on if other portfolios would also be supported, but we will be look into it. It depends on if each portfolio type needs its own code to receive the badges, or if we can push the data in a generic way and let each portfolio decide how to handle it. Simon",

On the other hand being able to delegate badge creation and assignment to course creators is clearly really important and having it as an activity makes that really easy. Simon",

When someone clicks on a badge (inside or outside the organisation, i.e. also when in the backpack) they see a link to an evidence page. What are your plans for what appers on this page? Are you thinking that this is the same as your \"CriteriaMet\" field? For a manually-issued badge, I think that the issuer should just be able to add some (learner-specific) text. And possibly upload a file or at least some basic html? For automatically-issued badges, i.e. those issued on course completion, what should be visible? I guess some information about the course/s (title, description, category??) and what activities were completed in order to complete the course/s? I know there's a balance here between giving the badge-viewer enough information, and keeping the details of a course secret to the issuing organisation. And one minor thing - I think that the OBI spec calls for a badge version number, so do you need to add this to the \"add/edit badge\" pages? Best wishes, Tim Newham [Think Associates]",

The concept of evidence is not quite clear to me yet, and we have lots of discussion in our team about what kind of information should be included into evidence. Because evidence is an optional field according to the badge metadata spec, we will try to get it to be automatically generated in first implementations, and will think about more complex solution later. At the moment, what we think we can do is to include the list of specific criteria that were met to earn the badge if there were multiple criteria, or the name of the issuer if it was awarded manually. I would imagine evidence to be a url link to some kind of public page available to assessors (or other interested parties). Also, I really like your idea to include some information about the courses if they were among criteria, just enough to understand what earner had to learn/do to get the badge. We are having a call with OBI developers on Friday and will discuss this kind of questions with them to make sure we are on the right track. I will keep this thread updated on any news. About version, as far as I know it is not actually version of the badge but rather a version of the specification the badge manifest is compatible with ( https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Assertions ).

This may be implicit in the 'Completing an activity or set of several activities (viewing an activity as a part of it)' point I see in the draft spec, but I'd like to see a finer control than just 'completion/non-completion'. I'd like to see a UI where I can set a minimum grade, etc, for a badge to be awarded. For example, I can see wanting to award a 'particularly helpful forum member' badge to a student that gets a minimum X number of 'Very Cool' ratings from their fellow students on their posts. This would be similar but distinct to setting of criteria in the current completion and conditional activities functionality. I may want to have different criteria for the 'completion' of an activity and the awarding of a badge relating to that activity. Thanks for your work! Martin",

Then the learner can move to the next course for 16 hours. Like this we propose three courses, if someone completes only two, they get a different badge with different graphic;; if they do all three, they will have a different graphic in the badge Does this make sense?  We will be ready to offer the courses at no cost to teachers across the globe at no cost in June 2013 but would love to pilot this in March.  Will you have the Moodle plug-in by March 2013?",

The code is available on github here: https://github.com/totara/openbadges You can install your own site, or you can try out our test site here: http://openbadgestotara.elearning.catalyst.net.nz/ We've disabled the external backpack connections and admin access on the test site but you can play around as a teacher (to create badges) or a student (to earn them). Here are the login credentials: username: teacher password: teacher username: student password student Some caveats: 1. Please don't use this code on a production yet. We are still fixing bugs and may need to make some breaking changes which will prevent you upgrading to a stable release. 2. This first release provides a basic (non- javascript ) UI which we need for accessibility . We are planning on adding some more interactivity but wanted to get the basics working first. So please understand if you find some areas of the UI a little slow to use (particularly setting up criteria). 3. We haven't yet finished the full set of unit tests. We are working on that now. 4. We are also working on user documentation. For now, the specs give a reasonable description of the functionality: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/openbadges https://github.com/totara/openbadges-docs 5. We will be updating the github repository regularly and in order to keep the code organised and up to date with master we'll be rebasing and pushing forced updates so if you clone the repository you'll probably need to do hard reset when you want to update your local repository (you won't be able to just do a pull). Aside from those issues, we would welcome any feedback, bug reports, etc. Once we've got the last few issues resolved we'll be pushing the code for integration review so if you'd like to see this in Moodle I'd encourage you to vote on the bug in the tracker: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-35073 Thanks, Simon",

          "Text": "Well I'm using Moodle as a bit of a pilot for my school, I'm running the whole thing alone and only I'm using it, but I like to play with the new toys I get given when they arrive so I've been messing with badges too. I've been playing with awarding them for various things but it's exam season now and no pupils are actually doing any Moodle work so feedback is quite hard to come by. I'll give you my ideas though: I've set every activity to award a badge on completion. My completion settings are set to only allow activity completion if the student scores above a certain grade, and attempts is set to 'unlimited'. The idea is to encourage pupils to do activities over and over until they get a good grade, thus learning the material much better. This is of limited usefulness with multiple choice questions as they tend to just click submit before attempting the quiz, get all the answers, write them down and input them. Fortunately I teach physics and this can't be done with a calculated question, so I use those extensively. I also award a course completion badge. Since the completion settings for each activity are set to only allow completion on receipt of a high enough grade this is aimed at encouraging pupils to complete every quiz in the course to a high standard to fill any gaps in their knowledge or understanding. I've dabbled with giving out badges to teachers who try out Moodle, but they are far less bothered by them than the pupils. In the future I'd like to award badges based on scores so I could give gold, silver and bronze badges for the same task with the very strong students striving for a complete set of gold badges (along with the big course completion badge) and lower ability pupils aiming for the lower badges but still being rewarded for completing activities. This isn't possible with the badge system at the moment though. I'll give you a bit more feedback about how this has worked when I actually see some pupils, which is likely to be around September now as we're off on Summer holidays in the not too distant future. Hope this helps.",

          "Text": "Dear All, I've created a forum in Moodle where every month one of our managers posts a questions and other managers respond to this question by sharing their suggestions, advice etc. Every question is treated as a separate topic. I would like now the manager who posts the question (manager A) to be able to indicate which / whose response s/he found most useful. Which of the options do you think is the most suitable for this purpose? a) Badges? - I created a Peer Helper badge, but I realised manager A (in trainer's role) can only assign the badge once to manager B. If in the following month manager A posts a question again and again manager B submits the best response, manager A will not be able to issue another badge to manager B. b) Scales / Rating drop down in the forum? - in which case what would be the best way for tracking who collected how many points / stars in total (I tried to use the grader report, but for some reason I am not getting the results I want - I would like to be able to quickly track who collected e.g. 10 points in total and assign then to that person a badge manually). c) Facebook type \"likes\"? Does such a plug-in (with no connection to FB website) exist? d) your suggestions? I would welcome your thoughts and recommendations. Thank you and regards, Diana",

Awesome work and a huge congrats to all who worked on it.= ) Thought I would start a tread on a feature request I am thinking of to see if there is enough traction. If so, I'll add it to the tracker for voting. I do like the My page implementation to display badges awarded. But I think for many this seperates the awarding to far from the implementation itself in the course. I am suggesting a course orientated block that will show all badges currently awarded in the current course only . It would also provide a link to the main My Badges page for the bigger picture. This way a teacher could choose to add a block allowing students to see an up to date snapshot of awards they have received for their current course. I have attached a basic mockup of my idea. I think it would be realtively simple to implement. Thoughts? Ideas? Improvements? Don't keep them to yourself. Post here and let's get the discussion moving.",

They should be prevalent when the pupil logs in, maybe on their my moodle page rather than hidden behind a few clicks on a 'my badges' page, or at least the most recent 5 or so could be displayed there along with a link to the my badges page so they can manage them and gaze upon the wonder of their collection.

It's definitely something that we'd like to do though and it should be fairly straightforward as criteria are designed to be extended. You could definitely create a feature bug in the tracker for that one. The second part (removing the earlier badges when the later ones are achieved) would be more work. I know Mozilla have some plans around badges that \"fill up\" as you progress so that might meet your needs. Currently that's scheduled to be implemented by Mozilla in version 1.5 (third quarter of this year): https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Open-Badge-Infrastructure-Roadmap The only info I can find on the open badges wiki is here: https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges/wiki/Discussion:-Composite-and-Ranked-(or-Leveled)-badges./afa0e86bace1fe8e042eafb241f6743aea0ff08e but it's an old discussion from their wiki that has since been deleted.

In particular, I would like to enable users who have earned a particular badge to be able to rate posts in a forum, grade a specific activity, etc. With these two features, it would be possible to set up a system in which those who earn badges can then review and award that same badge to others. Ideally, it could be possible to set an activity to require multiple grades (or \"nominations\") by peers to set completion status and grant a badge.

          "Text": "Hi Mary, Yes you are right there is a bit of an issue here. If you set up an external backpack connection you are able to say which badges you want to display in Moodle. Since you are explicitly choosing to share those badges they appear on your profile automatically. On the other hand we originally didn't want to automatically push badges earnt on the site straight to the profile, in order to give the user control over what was shared. So as of right now new \"internal\" badges are hidden from the profile by default, and must be explicitly shared to be visible. We have subsequently realised what you say (about it requiring an extra step that people may not remember to do), so as part of some improvements to the backpack connection we've added a user setting - \" Automatically show badges I earn on my profile page \" which we've enabled by default. That means that: New badges earned from the site will appear on a user's profile by default They can still choose to hide individually badges (on their My Badges) page If they want they can have new badges default to hidden, and only show the ones the want to (by making them visible on their My Badges page). Hopefully that addresses your point but still gives the users control over their how they show their badges. The patch that includes this change is awaiting review here: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/ MDL-39063 We are hopeful it will make it into 2.5.0, if not it will be in 2.5.1. Simon",

On the other hand, I can see Open Badges' benefit for ongoing in service professional development, which can be difficult to give its proper credit in current traditional systems. I could also see them being used as an electronic diploma system alongside existing paper diplomas at some institutions, i.e. attach badges to your CV/resume for job applications, immigration, etc. I think, as with traditional paper diplomas, what matters more than anything is the public reputation of the issuer. If it's a government, a public education institution, or even a training department of a well known company. NGO, or other agency, then Open Badges would be a convenient way of answering a lot of particular questions that often get asked at the interview stage about the exact nature of the training/education cited on your CV/resume. I think some employers would like to get that information from an independent 3rd party while their short-listing candidates, and it could be as persuasive as professional references.

          "Text": "I don't think your ex-Boss is right Mary.  After all 'badges' take all shapes, forms and meanings.  It could be argued that a degree certificate from a University is a 'badge', it's just Open Badges are proposing a new way of displaying, collecting and managing 'skill set achievement statements'. Look at the badges that Moodle has on the left.  These have to be earnt and have true non-trivial value in an entity outside of school age participants. Whilst teaching I found that my A-Level students (16-19) liked badges / stickers (did I ever give you a sticker Claire? ) and those outside of teaching would criticise and say that the students 'should' have grown out of them.  But they worked and were a true incentive for achievement. The kudos comes from the 'value' of the skill and credibility of the validator.  So as long as badges are not trivialised and issued for anything then they will hold value.  Is there / should there be a badge level?  Like in the UK, GCSE's are Level 2, A-Levels - 3, Degrees 4-6, Masters - 7 and PHd - 8 (I think). I also particularly like the idea of transferrability and the potential as a CV saving entity to reduce the administration effort in the job application process / consultant credibility.

As someone who was heavily involved in NOF ICT training for teachers many moons ago this is something I would have jumped at. Using badges as evidence of standards that have credence and value outside of your organisation works for me. It do think there needs to be some sort of hierarchical structure or maturation model where badges have a limited lifespan and have to be renewed/re-evidenced. Need to be careful that badges have meaning and worth at all levels/ages/establishments. At my school I see them having multiple purposes eg validating, rewarding and motivating -something I think many others teachers may agree with. My worry is that for many, open badges are seen as the digital/21stC equivalent of guides/scouts/cubs/brownies. This perception needs to be countered fairly quickly.",

          "Text": "I think badges will be created with a wide range of perceived values, from the trival to (hopefully) very significant - for example, a univerisity degree from a top institution. I don't think the fact that trivial badges exist will undermine the value of more significant badges - A \"Top 1% of students\" badge from Stanford University will hold more weight than \"XBox game achievement\" badge, and that's fine. Users have the ability to control who they show which badges to via the backpack, so they can choose which badges they think have \"credibility\" will display them to a particular audience. It is up to the user's audience to judge for themselves if they consider them valuable. The critical thing is they can confirm that the person did actually receive that badge from the issuing institution. On a related note there is some interesting work going on with LRMI (Learning Resource Metadata Initiative) and badges: http://hastac.org/blogs/ross-higashi/2012/11/01/lrmi-badgers-and-why-issuers-cant-ignore-it The idea being a badge could include LRMI metadata on the criteria badge which provides a common standard for intepreting the \"meaning\" of that particular badge. That allows you to compare badges across issuing institutions (is the badge assessing the same thing), but as the blog post explains it doesn't have anything to say on the subject of \"credibility\" of the issuer (do I trust that the issuer has correctly assessed them).

Now I understand how useful this can be. It's nice that the whole assigning of badges is automated by Moodle without intervention by the Teacher (except for setting up the badges and criteria). IMHO , for small classes (5 to 20 students) and for more manual control over issuance of stamps, the teacher might also want to try out the Stamp Collection module (erm ... the multistamp variant ) . However, for large classes (>20 to 300 students) and an over-worked teacher for whom time is the essence, Open Badges really comes into its own. A real-time saver. Very, very nice. Looking forward to more functionality and enhancements to the UI as you mentioned. Two things. Firstly, as the teacher role, I was trying to add the Badges block to the test site so that the student could just glance at the site and see how many badges he or she earned so far, but I couldn't find a way to add such a Block. Did I miss something? Secondly, in http://openbadgestotara.elearning.catalyst.net.nz/badges/index.php?type=2&id=2 I added a pic for a badge which I later tried to change to another pic. Couldn't (not allowed to be changed) do it. So, as ateacher role in the test site, how can I change the current image? Regards Frankie Kam",

          "Text": "Hi Frankie, 1. I think the page you are looking for is My Profile > My Badges. This is where a user goes to see all of their badges and control the visibility of them to others. If a user makes some of their badges public they will appear on the user's profile. There is also a \"My Badges\" block which users can add to the \"My Home\" section. 2. The problem seems to be that the badge is \"Active\", and active badges are locked down to prevent changes. If you deactivate the badge (button at the bottom of the overview page or green dot from the index) you should be able to change the image (as long as it hasn't yet been earned by anyone). Here's what the help says: Badge status determines its behaviour in the system: ACTIVE – Active badge means that this badge can we earned by users, but it has not been issued yet. When a badge is active, its criteria cannot be changed. INACTIVE – Inactive badge means that this badge is not available to users and cannot be earned. Criteria of an inactive badge can be changed. ACTIVE AND LOCKED – Badges with such status can be earned by users, but they have been issued in the past. Therefore, their criteria are locked and cannot be changed. INACTIVE AND LOCKED – Inactive badges cannot be earned by users and their criteria cannot be updated. Badges are set to locked automatically once they have been issued to at least one user. Unlike active or inactive, this property cannot be manually changed. If you need to modify details or criteria of a locked badge, you can duplicate this badge and make all the required changes. Why do we lock badges? We want to make sure that all users complete the same requirements to earn a badge. Currently, it is not possible to revoke badges. If we allowed badges requirements to be modified all the time, we would most likely end up with users having the same badge for meeting completely different requirements. That's the reasoning behind it, but I think this has highlighted a bit of a usability issue that we need to give some more thought to. We have just sent this work off for external usability review so I'll make sure we discuss this if it doesn't come up in their findings. Simon",

But because most of our current criteria use activities that don't broadcast any events (for example, activities inside the course), it will most likely be email notification. Users who get a badge will be also notified by email anyway, so that we can include downloadable version of their badge. Notification to Teachers (or rather badge creators) will be optional, and if this option is selected, a message will be send automatically when a badge is awarded. At the moment we think about templates as just design templates. School, university, or any organisation might want to have all badges in the same/similar design with just minor differences. I don't think there will be any problems if you would like to switch to templates instead of static PNG files later. A really exciting thing we are looking forward to is a new development from Mozilla OB project that uses SVG instead of 90x90 pixels PNG files for badges. It might give us more options around badges, like dynamically adding user's name to badges when a badge is awarded, or any other custom setting... Not sure if you know, but currently OB project is still in beta, and they have lots of interesting things we would like to use that are on their roadmap Thank you for feedback, Ian!

          "Text": "I've enjoyed this discussion and am excited to follow and contribute to development. For the purposes of brainstorming, I wanted to share the techniques we've used to badge Moodle. This may need to be split to a different discussion, since it isn't a suggestion for the Totara module; I just thought it would be falling on the right ears in this thread. At the Chester County IU in Pennsylvania, USA, I've used Moodle's conditional activity settings to help users unlock graphical badges during a course. Your solution will be much more portable and extendable; this just gives our participants a Moodle experience of earning badges, which can be implemented by any Moodle teacher interested in the concepts of serious games for learning. Attached is a screenshot (sorry for the small size - limited to 50KB! Will create a full-size gallery if there's interest). What we've done: Moodle sections are \"levels\" in our course, and using conditional sections, users \"level up\" (reveal the next section) when they earn required badges; Labels are created with the badge name, icon, required or not, approximate time to earn, bonus points if any, and some other \"flavor\" indicators (such as whether the badge is peer-nominated or instructor-approved). Hovering on a badge icon reveals details about what you'll accomplish in earning the badge. Conditional activities are configured, so that the badge is \"unlocked\", or becomes visible, only when conditions are met in other related quests, or activities. Lang files are edited so that the \"Restricted\" message on a conditional activity instead references \"unlocking\" the badge when activities are completed. Gradebook terminology has been changed to Points - a minor and perhaps superficial change, but the gradebook becomes a bank instead of a measure of performance. Only extra, bonus items are worth points. Everything else is worth badges, so your badges-earned list is what you seek to build up. The Checklist module and block are also used in this course, to provide a visual indicator of progress through badges and activities. We are considering overriding the perms in this module to allow all participants to see everyone's progress and badges, which is more supportive of a game mentality. I hope this is helpful and/or inspiring in some ways! Again, I look forward to closely following the new wiki and contributing in any way I can.

A couple of observations then: Would I be right in thinking there will be a continued need for the Certificate module in addition to the Badge Manager/Admin.? I assume there will still be institutions/users who will have need of 'paper'-based evidence of completion. If so, I'd reiterate Gavin's observation and ask can(should) a single Certificate/Badge module administer and manage both Certificates and Badges? Can(should?) the metadata associated with a Badge be repurposed/reused to provide data to populate fields used to construct a Certificate? From an end user's PoV, I can see advantages to having either separate or integrated modules. Where teachers/instructors are just issuing either Certificate or Badge, separate modules might be better just for simplicity's sake; if they're potentially issuing both, then an integrated module would probably be preferred. Similarly, Admins might prefer to have functionality separated (for resilience) or integrated (easy of implementation/upgrade). Until Moodle HQ or the certificate module maintainer indicate what their preference is, I guess things are moot? And with that, I guess I'll remain unhelpfully on the fence.",

We'll add a section to the wiki page with some pros and cons. For 2, given that the activity creator would be choosing between creating a badge or a certificate, any metadata that is available for creating the badge is also available for the certificate.

Jokes aside, I love the idea about integrating open badges with Moodle. Regarding the certificate module, I am currently re-writing how the certificate module works. With the ability to add as many text/image items as you want to the certificate, as well as specifying the position from within the actual certificate settings. I am getting rid of the need for the user to FTP to the mod directory and create a new type/upload more images etc. You can keep checking https://github.com/markn86/moodle-mod_certificate for updates. Once I have finished these changes that will get rid of a lot of the bloat on the settings page with the unnecessary fields, whether or not this provides enough room for the badges settings without the activity settings page becoming too bloated I am not sure without looking into more detail about what would be needed. So, from a technical perspective it is possible, but whether or not it makes sense is a different question. Would a teacher automatically assume the certificate module would be capable of issuing badges as well? What happens when they do not want a PDF to be generated, but just the badge(s)? Do those settings remain blank or are they hidden? If a teacher did want to generate a PDF and create badges would creating two activities the user had to click on too much? Should it all be combined into one? I have a lot of questions and no real definite answer. Would be good to know what you all think.",

Although at first glance they have similarities it seems that the bulk of the actual code in certificate module is generating the certificates themselves, and that code would all need to be different because of the PNG requirement for badges. The other area where I saw some overlap was the criteria for assigning badges/criteria, but since 2.x the certificate module seems to just use activity completion anyway, so again there's no real benefit in combining them to save code duplication.

          "Text": "I must apologise for what may be random, incoherent mumblings, but here are a few thoughts that popped into my head ... and as such are influenced by our local circumstances and may not therefore apply universally. A badge conveys a message about the holder, intended for an audience or audiences. If Moodle acts as  \"displayer\" and a \"issuer\" of badges, there at least two sets of audience: internal to the organisation and external. Assuming for a moment that a Badge recipient will wish to display to both sets, then we in our school need to ensure that the badge can 'get out.' Not being familiar with the mechanics(electronics?!) of how that might occur, I'm more than aware that data pathways in and out of our organisation aren't always ... free-flowing ... for valid reasons! Ports, proxies, protocols and IP addresses are just a few of the terms with which I have just sufficient knowledge to know they might be significant. If Moodle is to 'push' Badges to an external backpack, can anyone tell me whether whatever is implemented is likely to be able negotiate a communication pathway between a typical(?) school internal Moodle implementation, to an external backpack provider? Or is the 3rd option suggested (\"Don't implement the external backpack...\") likely to be more effective, whilst clearly not providing the same degree of seamless experience for the Badge recipient as we might like? Thinking also about the ' Assertions ' and specifically \"...hosting a public key at a well known, public URL .\" In the case of a local Moodle behind a an educational Gateway, is this possible? Or will the 'key' be held externally from the school Moodle? Will it be taken care of during the Module design process? Or (as is likely!), is my understanding currently too limited? On a separate, but related theme, if Badges are to carry 'weight' or have some degree of credence in more formal settings, it is likely that the 'audience' in those circumstances might want to inspect evidence of achievement - one of the 'optional' badge fields. Would I be right in thinking that this is where Mahara naturally sits? And if we don't have Mahara, we need to find an alternative way of surfacing the evidence produced en route to satisying the Badge criteria? OK, brain starting to hurt.",

For getting the badges out, ideally it would be possible to \"push\" then to your backpack automatically, but there is at least a manual fallback - the badges are PNG image files with all the metadata built into the image so the user could just download their badge and upload it into the backpack. As for verifying badges received from a moodle site behind a firewall, that's a very good question! I'm in discussions with the open badges folks at the moment so I'll ask them how this situation is handled - I'm sure it's something that must have come up before now. We hadn't put much thought into how to handle evidence yet - but as you said badges do support it - we'll add a couple of user stories to capture the ideas but it will have a lower priority than getting an initial implementation out there.
