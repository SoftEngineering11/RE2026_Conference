          "Text": "Hello, In the \"Workshop\" tool it is possible to upload a document as the initial submission. Is it also possible for the reviewer to upload documents in the assessment phase? To clarify my question I will describe what we plan to do: In our course, we want the students to peer-review their essays. We plan to use the \"Workshop\" tool. Instead of writing a feedback statement, we want the students to leave comments directly in the text document. So the workflow would be: Student upload their essay reviewer is assigned by the tool student downloads and reviews the assigned paper student uploads the reviewed paper reviewed essay can be downloaded by the initial author I am unsure if step 4 and 5 are possible with this tool and the moodle tutorials could not really help me to answer these question. Has anyone experience with this or a suggestion for a workaround? Thank you, Melina",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, We're experiencing a problem with the workshop module in our Moodle 4.1 production instance. When submitting example files under \"Example submissions\" in a workshop, no errors appear, but the files are not displayed nor saved. Specifically: After submission, there is no record of the file in `mdl_files` with `component='mod_workshop'` and `filearea='submission_attachment'` . An entry is created in `mdl_workshop_submissions` , but the `attachment` field remains empty. I noticed the file is instead stored in `mdl_files` with `component='user'` and `filearea='draft'` , suggesting it’s not moving from draft to the workshop submission area. The same setup works without issue in a local Moodle 4.1 and on a similar test environment (but without load balancing). Other file uploads work fine across the site. Permissions, `moodledata` directory access all seem correct. No errors are logged nor displayes not even when setting debugging on Programmer level. Any insights on what could be causing the issue? Thanks in advance! susana PS: Moodle 4.1, PHP 8.0, PostgreSQL 15.4, Load balancer 2 nodes, Red Hat",

          "Text": "I've spent some time listening to feedback from staff about Workshop -- there's so much 'stuff' there that it needs a lot of decluttering. I'm posting what I've done so far, and invite feedback or ideas on what you may have done or thought about doing. Phase 1: Setup I hate to have done this, but we decided to hide the details of each phase. Though it contains important information and useful, we've decided to hide it entirely so the students just see the phase they are on and can rely on the existing \"Description\" area to get all the info they need to start (though it doesn't remain there as the phases progress). We also debated showing all 4 dates (both open and both close) but decided the 2 \"close\" is the more important dates to show. Phase 2: Submission We moved the \" Add Submission \" button down below the Your Submission section to help better connect the two things. Once a student submits, their name was clickable - we removed that hyperlink so the only important link is a link back to their submission. We're debating if we want to break the links for the two toggle sections ... Phase 3: Assessment Here's where I got overwhelmed and not sure of the best approach. By default, there are 8 different links a student can click on when the Assessment phase begins. My goal is to only have 2 clickable links. So far, I have removed the 2 links  for the student's \"Name\" in the image below. 3 links are actually Toggles. My plan is to make the Toggles black, hide the icon, and give it a pointer-event of \"None\" so they cannot close it, I just don't know if that will make issues with keyboard navigation. Then that would leave 3 more links - the submission file name, the assigned assessment file name, and the Assess button. My next though is to guide the student to that Assess button by breaking the link to the assigned assignment file name, but I don't know what the difference is between the file title and the button. My guess is after they provide their assessment, maybe that file name link is their only way back to see their the assessment they provided. Interested in thoughts or if you have done anything similar you wish to share. Thanks,",

As it is, the teacher doesn't really know what will happen, and neither do the students in the submit phase. The interface should be very clear about what the anonymity will be, both in the reviewing as in the post-review phase. The interface is complicated by the fact that there are two anonymities involved: that of the author (important in the reviewing phase) and that of the reviewer (important in the conclusion phase). An additional minor feature would be some kind of reminder to the students in the submit phase to not leave identifying information in the submission, depending on the configuration.",

          "Text": "Gotcha! First, by default the total score for submission of an assignment is 80, and assessment of other students is 20. This can be adjusted in settings. How is the submission score calculated? If Person A assesses a submission with a score of 50/100, the score is calculated as 50 * 0.8 = 40 points. In other words 80% of 50 = 40 points. If Person B gives a score of 75/100, the score would be 60 points. If those are the only two scores, the average is 50 points, resulting in a submission score of 50/80. That's the simple answer. Weighting of individual scores adds another element, but I won't go into it unless you'd like to hear about it. How is the assessment score calculated? This is how well (accurate and fair) the student assessed a given submission. How is this determined, you may ask. If a student’s grading is very close to the group average, they get a higher assessment grade. If their grading is very different, their assessment grade is lower. The teacher can then adjust how strictly this can be enforced via the Comparison of Assessments dropdown menu (very lax - very strict). The total score for this is 20 by default. That's the simple answer. Once again, weighting and overriding of scores are additional factors.",

As a possible workaround, I have used the following procedure: Create a \"Student folder\" activity, setting Required Teacher approval and Automatic Student approval in \"Publication settings\". Setup the Workshop activity to accept only \"online text\" in the submission types. Instruct students to submit work on the student folder, copy the link to their submission there, and paste it as their submission on the workshop activity.  They only submit text (the link) on the workshop. When submission phase ends, press the \"Give approval\" button on the Student folder activity, to publish all submissions.  This makes them accessible to all students.  Also, move the Workshop to Assessment phase. On the workshop assessment instructions, tell students to follow the links their peers submitted in order to download their work. Then assess as usual. The student folder activity is similar to assignment activity, but also allows publishing of the submissions to all users.  Unlike workshop It allows downloading all submissions easily. This scheme is somewhat complex and this will lead to misinterpretation and human error.  A few students will submit on the student folder and forget to submit on the workshop.  Or they'll paste an invalid link, such as as link to a personal cloud folder, on the workshop. Hope this helps.",

So I am not worried about not having students to participate in the workshop activity. Is there a way around the phasing and submission deadlines?

          "Text": "Good day! I set up a Workshop for (credit-bearing) peer assessment. One of levels for one ciriterion in the rubric was entered incorrectly. Instead of levels 1,2 and 3 - the highest level was entered as 100. This mistake was only picked up after the students had already started assessing. The mistake meant that the marks given by students who graded their peers less than the highest mark (100 - which should have been 3) - were suddently extremely low (out of 60). What are my options to even out/correct the marks? There are 1500 students in this group - it is near impossible to override individual marks. It has been suggested that i can remove that criterion from the rubric - and then see what happens. I would really like some advice/guidance. Please see the attached screenshot indicating the difference in marks. Thank you! Dr Marenet Jordaan",

          "Text": "Dear community, first of all, thank you very much for your excellent work and extraordinary educational tool. I have a question about the difference between \"per submission\" and \"per reviewer\" of the random allocation option of Workshop. I have looked for some information, and the potentially closest discussion is in this link: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=216305#p942023 Unfortunately, I have not been able to ask my question there. The thing is that, to my understanding, it should be possible, and not very difficult, to make the random allocator to assign as many reviewers per submission as submissions per reviewer; so, if students that did not submit their work are not allowed to review other submissions, the option X reviews per submission or per reviewer could be ignored. My idea is to generate X (from \"X reviewes per...\") permutations of the submissions (easy with the numpy library, for instance). Then, for each permutation, reviewers are assigned to the submissions according to the generated permutation. Since the number of submissions is equal to the number of reviewers, because just submitters are allowed to review, and permutations are bijective functions, each submission is assigned to one reviewer and each reviewer is associated to one submission. This procedure is repeated for the X-1 remaining permutations. There is still a possibility of assigning the same submission more than once to the same reviewer, or even a submission to its submitter. However, with enough submissions (and thus, reviewers), I think that this is not very probable and the random allocator could replace problematic permutations with new randomly generated ones (within a while loop and a maximum number of draws). In case non-submitters were allowed to review, then this solution should be fixed, but in any case, you could use your current allocator in this case. That is all. I just wanted to share this possibility with you. My apologies in case I had missed any relevant piece of information that makes my solution invalid. Best wishes!",

For example, I evaluated an assignment with: 9; 5; 3; 5; 5 (a total of 27/ 30). Yet, moodle calculates a total score of 30 at the end of page (sorry, it's in German). Other evaluations differ even more drastically. There is one with a score of 22 and a \"grading\" of 27.1, for example. 2) When I check all evaluations in the evaluation phase, I get this overview: The scores shown on the right side, \"grade for assessment\", are wrong as well. I thought this was the average score participant 1 to 5 got from all evaluators. But as participant 1 shows, even though he received 3 gradings (and graded none of the others), his score is \"-\". So I thought, maybe that score on the right shows the average score each of the participants gave to others. But that's not true either. Participant 5 made 2 evaluations with a score of 22 points each (moodle's calculation is wrong here, too), so their average can't be 25.7. Participant 4's (wrongly calculated) score of \"30,0\" and \"30,0\" is shown as \"28.1\". Participant 4's real scores are 30 and 27. I know that moodle normalizes all grades, but this is too far off the mark. So, what does that score on the right actually mean? And why won't moodle simply calculate and show the average scores of all raters for each participant? How can I get the correct scores - in the gradebook, too. Since everything is weird within the workshop module, all grades in the gradebook are wrong, too (and participant 1's are missing). I'd really appreciate your help.",

And checking participant 2's received and given grades, I confirmed that the grade for assessment is closer to the evaluation they gave to others (the normal average is 29) than what they got from the others (normal average: 24). And the same grades are shown in the grade book. So if \"grade for assessment\" really shows what each participant _gave_ others, the score in the grade book also is the average of how they evaluated all of their classmates, not the evaluation they _received_ from everyone else.

In essence, closer you are to the mean, better your grade will be. If your people love maths this para is a good starting point: The workshop picks one of the assessments as the best one - that is closest to the mean of all assessments - and gives it a grade of 100%. Then it measures the 'distance' of all other assessments from this best one and gives them lower grades depending on how different they are from the best assessment (given that the best one represents a consensus of the majority of assessors). The parameter of the calculation is how strict we should be, that is how quickly the grades fall down if they differ from the best one. Or if they are more attracted to voodoo, this would suffice: This grade (also known as grading grade) is calculated by the artificial intelligence hidden within the Workshop module... More seriously, https://docs.moodle.org/en/Using_Workshop#See_also has a link to \" Moodle Workshop activities support peer review in Year 1 Science: present and future by Julian M Cox, John Paul Posada and Russell Waldron\", which is broken.

But a problem I have faced is that the workshop activity does not accept submissions in .py (python scripts) or .ipynb (ipython notebooks) formats. So the students have to add the .txt extension, submit the file, and then the peer will have to download the file, remove the .txt extension, and then evaluate. Although it is a simple process , it is cumbersome and adds some unedeed complexity that makes them do it wrong.  Is there a way to add more file types/extensions to the submission options?

Without automatically changing the phase, the scheduled allocation works fine and without any problems.

Thanks to the documentation and the forum, I realize I had misunderstood the principle of the accumulate grading system. I wanted to give: 3 points for aspects 1&4 ; 2 points for aspects 2, 3, 5, 6; and 6 points for aspect 7. But I gave the same weight to each aspect. Therefore the marks are not calculated the way I want them to be. I am currently in the grading evaluation phase. I tried modifying my initial assessment form and change the weight of each aspect, but it doesn't seem to work, even when I hit the recalculate button. I reopened the assessment phase but it doesn't change anything either. I have the feeling that only reopening the setup phase would work. But I'm afraid I may erase all the submissions! Do you confirm that it's too late to modify the assessment form, and nothing can be done at this stage? Thank you!",

For the grading settings, I have selected the \"Accumulative grading\" strategy with 95% weight for submissions and 5% weight for the assessments. Students are able to complete the workshops and receive grades for assessment and submission after the workshop is closed. However, I cannot see workshop grades on the grade book. In fact, no grading category is created in the grade book when I add a workshop module in my Moodle. I am wondering if there is any specific configuration that I am missing along the way that causes no grading item to be populated on the grade book. Moreover, I am not able to assign \"Course Mark Weight\" for the workshop activities, i.g. I would like to give 2% course weight for each workshop activity. I'd appreciate it if you could help me fix the issue. Thanks!",

And she/he received grade for assessment 5.0 out of 5.0. What you overrode is that second grade. To affect both grades you as a teacher better go and provide your own evaluation of their work (using the same evaluation form). In this particular case, you will probably want to fill all rubric fields with lowest quality descriptions. And you will also want to set higher weight of your own assessment. That way, your assessment will have much bigger impact on both grades calculations. Yet another option to override the grades calculated by the module is in the course gradebook.",

For this particular case where only he is the only person for himself this worked fine - so it did for other students where he was not the only person grading others. Overwriting in the gradebook is problematic imho, as you actually overwrite all other students \"grades\" for a single students work - instead of just correcting that grade of one student.

Now the problem is that after\nsetting everything up, if one student assesses another text and answers no to one of the assertions, the system will show his assessment as 10 instead of\n40 out of 50. Basically, I don’t see any assessment scores other than 10 or\n50.  The only way I have managed to\nremedy this was by overriding student assessments, but it’s an enormous amount\nof work.

At my centre we tend to grade everything out of 10 and use the \"weighted mean\" aggregation in the gradebook to adjust weightings. This system makes the gradebook more easily comprehensible to students, in my view, since good and bad grades for individual items are plain to see. With this in mind, we tend to encourage teachers to change the 80/20 maximum grades in the Workshop to 10/10 and then they can weight the grades in the gradebook, if desired. My question: As a system admin. can I change the 80/20 default setting for all users? Are these values hard-coded? If I have to hack the Workshop module to change these values, where are they? I am guessing that I just have to change this in settings.php. Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hello, I have been reading discussions about possibilities for mixing worshop and groups. I learned it is possible to use group mode in different ways. Imagine we have 4 groups : Group A, Group B, Group C, Group D. \"Separate groups\" group mode enables teacher force attributions within groups; this means membres of Group A will only review productions of Group A; \"Visible groups\" group mode with option \"Prevent reviews by peers from the same group\" enables teacher to force attribution in another group; this means membres of Group A will review productions of groups B, C, D with random attribution among production of these groups; it can arise that one student in Group A has to review productions all coming from Group B. Could you please first confirm I clearly understood the group mode impact on worshop activity ? I read that a lot of people hope the worshop module to work with group productions reviewed by groups but this is not a simple development. The teacher in my institution also dream about it But it would already be great to add an option that helps to have better attribution mixing with groups, that would work so : \"Visible groups\" group mode with option \"Force reviews in different groups as much as possible\"; this would mean that if members of group A have 3 reviews to be assigned; they would have one review in Group B, one review in Group C and one review in group D. I know this option will be a puzzle to implement when the number of reviews does not match exactly the numer of groups minus 1; but it would already be great to implement it only for the case when this condition is matched ... The option could be called \"Force reviews in different groups\" and appear only in that case. That is an idea that arises while playing with the workshop module with some teachers in my institution ... With big thanks for this very powerfull plugin. Kisses Zabelle",

Imagine we have 4 groups : Group A, Group B, Group C, Group D. \"Separate groups\" group mode enables teacher force attributions within groups; this means membres of Group A will only review productions of Group A; \"Visible groups\" group mode enables teacher to force attributions as much as possible to different groups; if a Group A member has to do 5 reviews, he will receive at least 1 review of each group A, B , C , D; it may arise that the mixing rule is not fully respected because the algorithm tries each production to have the same amount of reviews; the best situation for the mixing algorithm is to have groups that have the same number of members; \"Visible groups\" group mode with option \"Prevent reviews by peers from the same group\" enables teacher  to force attributions as much as possible to different groups but avoids attribution in the same group; if a Group A member has 5 reviews to do, he will receive at least 1 review of each group B, C, D and no review of group A; the same limit on the mixing rule may also be noticed as in the previous case.

The reason I'm asking is that I've read a number of threads and articles about this and the information is either not quite clear or conflicting. For example, one thread from this very forum ( Moodle in English: Random allocation for separate groups ) says that even in \"separate groups\" students get submissions to review from other groups if random allocation is used. The thread is closed now but it seems the issue didn't get resolved. Or this manual Microsoft Word - Manage Workshop Quick Guide.docx (uow.edu.au) specifically says: \" There is no option available in Workshop to manage submission and review of an individual’s allocated work within a\ngroup. Students can be excluded from the same group reviewing each other’s work but they can't be prevented from\nreviewing the work of students in other groups.\" (page 13) Some of the suggestions are to create multiple workshops, which is highly impractical in my case. I really only need Group A students reviewing submissions of other Group A students.",

I see that this has been under discussion since at least 2012. I have found an imperfect but useful workaround, which is to combine a Group Assignment with Workshop, wherein the group secretary submits the written assignment in both elements, one after the other, with the grade given to the group's submission by Workshop participants being manually input by the teacher into the Group Assignment for grading all members of each group. The Workshop submission's grade is left uncategorized, but the peer-assessment grade is categorized and appears in the gradebook. This facilitates giving a grade to each member of the group for their joint assignment, while allowing the members of other groups to grade the joint assignments (taking that option in the Workbook allocation setting). However, it would be much better for Workshop to include this functionality natively. We found a plug-in whose description appears to provide precisely the kind of group functionality we are looking for, but we don´t know if it will be supported in Spanish or work on our university system without a hitch. We are looking into it, but I wonder whether there might be any advice about it. Congratulations in general on this fine piece of educational technology. It has helped us enormously during the pandemic and we will continue to benefit from it long afterwards.",

When setting up an workshop you can check self evaluation in 2 different places. first, when setting up the assignment there is the option of self evaluation (red arrow in print screen). The question mark states that checking this makes it possible for a student to get his own work to evaluate, but this is not guaranteed to happen. Later on, when setting it up so the workshop will automatically assign things to students after the uploading-of-work-by=-students phase, you can check elf evaluation again (green arrow in print screen). Now the questions: does checking the self evaluation at the green arrow make it mandatory for students to self evaluate (i'd like that) if you set the assignment so that students have to give 2 peer reviews per student, is a self evaluation one of the 2, or is that extra?",

I thought maybe I might be able to provide the example submission under the Edit assessment form  page, accessed via the Administration block.  But there is nothing there to do it. So, I'm at a loss for how I add my sample submission.  I'm having the students submit pdfs.  So I've got a pdf prepared as an example.  But I can't figure out how to upload it.  It's not super-critical.  The workshop is sufficiently simple that they should be able to do it without an example.  But I'd like to figure out how to do this for future workshops that I use.

Many of our students have asked to see how other students assessed the submissions they were assigned to assess. This makes sense to me. We were previously using the Calibrated Peer Review system which gave students a side by side comparison of how all peer reviewers of a text answered the rubric questions. This made it easy for students to compare how they were marking submissions and often cleared up perceptions of unfairness (usually because they'd see they were outnumbered, read the comments from the other peer reviewers and realize they'd missed something). Is there an option to enable this somewhere and I'm missing it?",

We use workshops extensively and they all move automatically from submission to assessment phase at the same time. Scheduled allocation of 3 peers is then triggered. It has been happening since forever, but in more extreme form lately, that instead of allocating three peers per submission, people are allocated 6, 9, 15, 19 and even 21 peers! There is some kind of bug that re-triggers the running of the allocating task. Have you had this experience? This is not like allocating 4 instead of 3, or 2 instead of three, which is sometimes caused for lack of peers in the group. This is an actual bug that occurs now in every course every week for us.

          "Text": "Hello, I set a workshop to require 100 students to produce questions of  the multichoice-single/multi answer type after being randomly assigned a set of topics selected form a pool of n topics. Each student has to write 8 questions and will review work from 3peers following a grid of criteria and scores (a rubric actually, but provided separately, not as a workshop rubric) Questions are filled into a pre-set excel file, submitted as an a  attached file, and I assume (never done this before...) each will receive 3 attachments to be downloaded for assessment. In the assessment form I initially set this up so that each \"aspect\" corresponds to one question so they are expected to grade every single question separately which will equally weigh into the final grade. What I didn't understand is how workshop calculates the best assessor to compare with to calculate grades for assessment. If the comparison is made on aspect1 for all 100 students this is obviously not going to be fair as the initial topics are randomly selected and they are not comparable. However, having each student three assessors, if the comparison is made between aspect1 of those three assessors only then the comparison is legitimate. I would be grateful if anyone who could please clarify this. Thanks Adriano",

When I did my own assessment of each workshop, THOSE grades were factored in, but the assessments that had already been saved did not change. I did see (in another thread, I think?) the recommendation to use the \"Clear assessments\" tool from the Evaluation phase. However, I did not try that because I was not 100% confident it wouldn't erase how the forms were filled out, and I didn't want to ask the students to go back in and re-save. They were already frustrated and I just didn't want to add any more stress. I ended up just using my own assessments to determine submission scores. The assessment scores seemed to calculate as expected, so I did factor them in to the students' final workshop scores. I see that this has been an issue for a while. Do you think this activity will ever be \"friendly\" enough to actually use? I had planned to present it to our faculty tech team as a possible alternative to traditional discussion forums in online classes, but as it stands now, I don't think the advantages are worth the complex setup and potential problems that may be encountered.",

If your REALLY want to show the description during the submission phase, you will need to copy some code from the, case workshop::PHASE_SETUP: and then add it into the case workshop::PHASE_SUBMISSION:. Of course, if you do this, you will need to remember to do it any time there is an update to the Workshop activity plugin. Assuming you are using Moodle 3.7.2+ with Workshop version 2019052000, open the workshop/view.php file. Assuming line 110 is:  case workshop::PHASE_SETUP: Copy lines 111-115 Assuming line 137 is: case workshop::PHASE_SUBMISSION: Paste your copied lines in as 138-142. Save the file and go to submission phase of your activity and you should see the, Description, added right above the, Instructions for submission. NOTE: Doing it this way permanently adds the Description to the Submission phase of EVERY Workshop you have on your whole site. It DOES NOT appear/disappear by changing the checkmark used to display it on the course page.",

I am not using groups and i have had a student complete an activity to ensure there was something to work with.

          "Title": "Distribute 100 points among your group mates",
          "Text": "Hi there, We're trying to bring to Moodle the peer-assessment and rubrics currently carried out on paper and spreadsheets, and found this case scenario: once a group task is finished, a peer assessment is done where each group member has to give credit to their team mates' work distributing 100 points among them (the better work a mate did he/she should receive more points). It makes sense because making them divide the points avoids the temptation of inflating each others' grades. My first thought was to use the workshop to accomplish this, but I haven't found an easy way to do that. I can make groups, create a workshop, allocate group mates to each group member and give just one criterion up to 100 points, but I can't control that all the points shared make 100. On the other hand, when assessing, the students can't see all the group members at the same time, so it's also more difficult for them to check that they are doing it right. So my questions is basically this: is there any better way to do this with the workshop module or somewhere else in Moodle (even with plugins)? I guess this could be partially achieved with a specific workshop evaluation plugin, but that kind of development is out of scope for us. Cheers.",

The grading strategy for the Workshop is 'comments only' - no numerical grades are needed. We are currently in the Grading Evaluation Phase - the students have submitted original work, their peers have reviewed it and they have reviewed their peers. What I'd like to know is, can the teacher provide overall feedback for an original submission that is visible by the student who submitted it and all of the reviewers? I can see that teachers can assess an original submission using the 'assess' button: And they can also give 'overall feedback' via the author section: However when I login as one of the reviewers I can't see the overall feedback, nor the feedback via the 'assess' button. I also understand that reviewers can get individual feedback from a teacher, but we would like some kind of overall feedback to be viewed by 4 students - 1 who originally submitted and 3 reviewers. Am I completely missing a setting somewhere? Or should I be doing this via the Permissions route perhaps? Any advice would be greatly apprecatied. Many thanks Catherine",

During analysis of the practical presentation element, research was carried out with previous HNC Vet Nursing students and had found the lack of communication, collaboration, team dynamics, and the fear of presenting publicly, where is some cases lowering the student's individual grades. Therefore, we had the idea of digitally video recording the six Graded Unit teams 'prototype' presentations, uploading to the team's YouTube channel as Unlisted and having an allocated student member within their team submit to the Workshop module within Moodle. Working collaboratively and using the guidelines and criterion set within the workshop module, a student (who originally submitted their team's video presentation) accessed their allocated Graded Unit team's video presentation will all team members present providing supportive feedback and constructive criticism within the Workshop activity. See screenshots below. The lecturer analysed the team’s peer review feedback and reinforced the peer reviewer’s valuable guidance. Once the feedback was released to the teams and within their Moodle discussion forums, the teams quickly advanced in self-assessing their own presentation performance utilising the criterion and favourably integrating the recommendations within their regular rehearsals leading up to their public presentations. The peer assessment phase considerably increased the student’s confidence and the quality of their public presentations where 30 out of the 36 students received an A-grade for their individual presentation performance. Positive feedback from the students included: “The peer feedback gave me an extra boost to my confidence and due to this, when I actually carried out the presentation on the day, I felt quite calm.” A full online report on the project will be available in July.",

I appreciate that we can set this weight manually, in the grading phase. But in our case we have some 300 submissions, and that's a lot of clicks... I also appreciate that the current default of having a weight = 1 for the self-assessment is reasonable. But in some cases, especially when the number of peers is low (we want to use only 1 or 2 peers, + self-assessment), we think it would not be appropriate to give the self-assessment a weight. What do you think, is there an easy way to not have to do 300*3 clicks, or would this be an interesting feature request?",

Having done a workshop with my class now, I'm eager to understand more about how it works, so that I can explain this to my students. There can be some bizarre behavior, and this erodes the credibility of this system in the students' eyes. I can understand how a \"best\" paper is identified, and this is assigned 100%. I can also understand that the settings of strictness determines how the grades fall from that. Is there a way to understand how this strictness works? I had students grading a number of errors strategy with 10 components (pretty much equal weighting). For those who aligned perfectly with my grading (and I weighted mine higher), they got 100. But if others deviated just a small amount, some of them got zeros. I don't understand how this happens. The documentation is clear on how it assigns 100%. But I don't understand how it assigns a zero - I suppose a theoretical terrible response is one that is completely opposite of how the average is graded. Say I graded a paper with only 1 other student, but I weighed my paper 10 times the weight. It seems that only mine can be assigned a grade of 100, and this student will have a lower grade. If he grades completely opposite from me (as far as determining the binary decision of whether or not an error in the assertion is marked), then I suppose that is a theoretical zero. But How else does the algorithm determine how low to grade this student? There must be a logic of how strictness is tied to the lowest grade possible among the bunch.

The graphic showing strict through very lax suggests that the assessment for the grade using a lax setting will be zero when the \"difference\" from the best assessment is 80. 80%? On what basis? What number of errors is considered 80% different?  It seems from this that the math needs to determine what the most different is, that is, what is defined as 100% different. I'm puzzled, since for very small deviations from the \"best grade\", I did get some students receiving 0s on that graded paper.",

There is no a single formula for this grade. Yet the process is deterministic. Roughly, the grade is \"100 - distance from the referential (best) assessment\" where this distance is calculated in the method assessments_distance() . Maybe you could put actual data for one submission (i.e. how did students assess it) into an spreadsheet (we neither need to know student names nor text of assessment criteria) and attach it here. We could then go through the data in the shield and illustrate how they are worked with to compute the grading grade. Eventually you could see if such an output format is suitable for the purpose so that it could be implemented as an inbuilt-one. Also please know, there are some other methods of calculating this grade available as plugins at https://moodle.org/plugins/?q=type:workshopeval The \"Participation credit\" has been found much easier to understand and work with in many cases.",

          "Text": "btw, just quickly glancing at this code, the variance drives the delta. I'm wondering if this variance in the answers is driven by other respondants (and this would explain some of my surprising grades). If variance matters across graders, then if *everyone* (say 20 people) grades a paper in the same way (say the mark 9 of the first 10 number of error criteria bad and the last \"good\"), and one person deviates from this just a little bit, given the small variance, just a little bit of deviation from the \"best grade\" could yield a very high reldelta, and thus a very low grade. This is not, I think, what is described in the description of how grading works, right? It is supposed to measure how far off a standard the grade is (the standard being the closest grade). It is not supposed to be based on how far you are off, but conditional on how far off everyone else was, right? If the accuracy of everyone else, that is, the variance in their responses, affects the grade of a single person apart from determining the \"best grade\", then it would be helpful to describe how the grading works differently from the way it is. This would make grading on grades based on the n of graders a lot, apart from what gets determined as the \"best\" grade (from which to judge the other grades). thanks! Eric",

Over the years I've tried using this activity with my students, and I've found that the grading is just not that good for high school students. If all of the students are lousy graders, and then one student grades well, that student is punished according to the workshop plugin. Since the way workshop grades is cryptic to students... The students all grade based off a rubric and have to provide feedback why they graded the way they did. I ignore the grades that the workshop supplies, and I replace them with a completeness grade - this consists of they grading 5 other papers, and I grade the quality of their comments. I grade the actual assignments myself, and that is the grade they get -- not the one from the workshop. I think the workshop grades are an interesting talking point (why is Lisa's grading too easy, why is Bobby's grading too strict), but there's no way I could justify using them my gradebook. The value for me, is that the students grading is distributed randomly and evenly.  I used to use the forum for this, but I noticed that it was always the same people grading their friends work.  The workshop forces a student to grade a student that they might not normally interact with.

I shows them how their grading (relative to mine) improved, albeit not that much after some practice.

I actually concluded as well that what the teacher really needs to know and have highlighted are cases when peer-reviews do not fully match. If there was a simple value for each submission, something like \"peer-assessment's similarity index\", the teacher could focus on those cases where some reviewer is significantly off the mean, and intervene eventually.",

I usually ask the students to upload just an assignment per group, doing a manual allocation, and finally copying the received grading to the other menbers of the groups. With many students, this is going to be coumbersome and error prone. I just don't get why the activity cannot support group submissions. BTW what do you mean by \"officially support\"? Is there a way of getting an \"unofficial support\"? Best, --sergio",

I set the settings for Example Submissions to \"Examples must be assessed before own submission\" but some students did not complete the example assessment, so they couldn't submit before the deadline, and now they cannot submit at all. Can I change the setting to \"Examples are available after own submission and must be assessed before peer assessment\" without it making all the students who have already completed the example assessment go back and re-do the example assessment before they are allowed to complete the peer assessments they have been assigned? 2. I did a scheduled allocation and did 3 per submission, not realizing this would just make sure everyone got 3 reviews back. Instead I want everyone to complete 3 peer reviews. I know I can manually assign peers for the students who only have 2 reviews to complete, but can I change it to 3 per reviewer without it deleting the assessments already completed by a few students? I think that's it for now. I really hope you can answer my questions. Thanks in advance",

There is a field to adjust this, and next to it, is a column of numbers that looks like a \"straight-line\" allocation of weighting. So, if you have 3 assertions, and weighted them all 1, then the weighted number of errors mapping for 0, 1, 2, 3 errors would be 100, 66, 33, 0%. There is a field where this can be adjusted. Say, if I set it at 100, 66, 66, 66, then it should be the case that if you had one error, you'd drop to a 66%, but if you had more than that number of errors, you'd just stay at 66%. I noticed, that the column of hard coded numbers does not change, even when I manually make adjustments. When I look at the grade calculations, it continues to use the straight line method, with the weighting still at 100, 66, 33, 0% (the default). Is there some way to change this? thanks!",

Before the change, the workshop module was literally called \"workshop\" which was understood here more as a type of session / event than a method of collaborating. So, we had the need to find a better translation but didn't mainly want to get rid of the term \"workshop\". There was some discussion among the german translators and some german key users in the community and in the end we agreed on the german term \"gegenseitige Beurteilung\" which is more or less \"peer review\" in german, but nevertheless is a german term because we didn't want to exchange an english term to another english term. During this discussion, we were also talking to David if I remember correctly to evaluate a global change of the term \"workshop\" for the english language pack, but I think his arguments were the same back then and it was ok for us.

I believe I have already put my opinion before, but I can't find it now. I do not think we should rename it, this has my -1 for now. I do understand and respect the reasoning for proposing this change. But any module name will always be just a simplified label representing the wide range of features and pedagogical scenarios that a module can support. Some modules have more self-descriptive names, some are less obvious. If we rename Workshop, what should come next? Lesson ? Hotpot? PoodLL? URL ? SCORM ? Dozens others from the plugins directory? I actually always liked the word Workshop for this. I have imagined it as a place where students are encouraged to create / craft something useful for the others, share it with the others, and get feedback from the others. It has always strongly resonated with the social constructivism pedagogy in my mind. I would actually prefer to improve the module so it feels even more like a real workshop with all the tools that can be used to actively produce awesome things, rather than renaming it to something that facilitates just the assessment part of it. What I agree with is that all module names could and should be de-emphasized from the students UI. Students should not need to be aware what \"Workshop\" or \"Foobar\" module does. The name of the particular activity instance should be the primary guideline for them and the UI combined with the provided descriptions and instructions should be just intuitive. Let's work on that, no need to repaint this bike shed IMHO .",

Another expected consequence will be the loss of the rich history of the Workshop as a method of teaching writing. The Workshop method of teaching writing is an outgrowth of the work of Donald Murray and many others. Murray did the most writing about the process, but that process or workshop method has been used by many others before and after Murray, including my mentor Frederick Manfred . The Workshop method/process is a revered staple of T he Loft and many other writing schools and guilds. One of the most famous is the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop. The concept of a writer's workshop includes peer assessment, but the term peer assessment does not include workshop. In other words, Workshop is a bigger, richer, more inclusive term than peer assessment. There will be other unintended and unnecessary consequences by changing the name of this very powerful Moodle tool, too. The biggest problem with the Workshop Module is its complexity. We still don't have enough written about how to use it in all of the possible ways that it can be used. I'd rather spend our collective energy on making the wonders of the Workshop Module more accessible to more teachers and students.

The workshop offers the key benefit of peer assessment, that should be reflected in the name. \"Students should not need to be aware what \"Workshop\" or \"Foobar\" module does.\" I think it would be fairly useful if they did, but enormously useful if Teachers did. At the moment there are probably tens of thousands of teachers who think it would be useful if Moodle included some kind of peer assessment tool but are unaware that Workshop offers this (to the very determined and patient who are willing to learn an rather complex tool)",

          "Text": "Hello, I have a simple question related to Moodle workshop: is there any way to increase workshop submission max grade from 100 to 1000? 10000? MAXINT? And, if so, is there any way to increase rubric scores to more than 100? I guess these are hardcoded values, so if it's possible to change them on a single place in the source code, that doesn't sound very bad. Why? Well, if it matters: What I need is detailed exported data about every student's answer on every rubric question for his every assessment of assigned submissions. Workshop currently doesn't have very extensive export options so at the moment, I can't do what I want. But I can get exported data about every student's final submission grade given to/received from every other student (python code available on request). If I could reconstruct every answer on every rubric question from that single final score, it would solve my problem. And that is mathematically very possible, but I'd need rubric scores beyond 100. 10000 would probably do. How exactly? Again, if it matters: Lets say I have only 2 rubric questions, each with 3 possible answers: Yes, Mostly, and No. In the first question, I assign 0, 1 and 2 to the possible answers respectively. In the second question, I assign 0, 3 and 6 to the possible answers respectively. And as the result, from any final score I can reconstruct answers to each of the questions. For example, if the final score was 5, that means I have to write number 5 using base 3, which is 5=1*3^1+2*3^0 => 12, and those (1 and 2) are the answers (their scores) selected in grading. Of course, in that case the received score students get won't be understandable to them, not without additional explanations, but that's not a problem in my case. Thanks in advance! Juraj",

          "Text": "Hi, I normally use workshop activity as a synchronous task where all students are in the same page: first they upload , then they grade their peers and finally they see the results. Sometimes I've got a student that could not deliver on time, when the workshop is already closed. Normally what I do is activate \"late submissions\", change the state to grading phase and evaluate the task, then I recalculate grades and change the state again to closed. But there are some pain points doing this, compared to the task activity: - I miss having a reminder as a teacher in workshop activity to know which students needs grading, like the task activity has in the course overview block. - Changing state between closed and grading evaluation phase is cumbersome. Sometimes students have to remind me to change state if they can't submit, and other times they want to know their grade and I've got to change state again to closed. So I propose these two features: - add grading reminders in the course overview block for ungraded tasks. - merge closed and grading evaluation phase. Is someone else interested in this? I could add the issues in the tracker if they make sense. Cheers, Ruben.",

As an idea that we have and before the students go public with their presentations, we wish for each group to video record their presentations. I know that the Workshop activity does not cater for group peer review processes at the moment, but our thinking (at the moment) is that a team leader within the group would submit the video to a Workshop activity where another group peer review their performance etc. My initial thinking was to allocate a team leader to another team leader, they make their comments for the submission and then the lecturer would analyse their peer review and then provide the peer review and the remaining group members with the same grade. We are not looking to grade the submissions but wish to grade the assessments, for all group members. Here is what we are looking to achieve: Submission Phase; Peer Review Phase; Grading Evaluation Phase; OK, here are my questions...probably out of reach at the moment, but here it goes: 1. I gather that each student needs to be allocated to an individual student to be graded for assessment? 2. We only wish for the peer review to have a comments facility. Is there a way we can provide the lecturer with Rubrics for the assessment only? Any help would be appreciated. Cheers, Ali.",

          "Text": "In our institution we got a lot of request about a tool for doing self-assessment/peer review. W e found the workshop activity, which seems to cover many user\nstories. We have decided to use the workshop activity and made some improvement on it. https://invis.io/ZGB1A6CDE#/225769743_en-A1_Parametres-De-Base https://invis.io/ZGB1A6CDE#/229014113_S_With-Sub_1 We think that\nthis activity got a lot of potential but the learning curve and the usability issue for the teacher work against it. We got a lot of request for this kind of\nneeds but there is not a lot a people that use the workshop. So a lot of\nour effort is targeting the learning curve issue. 1- Wizard We want to\nguide the teacher in the configuration of this activity. We also want to put\nthe many parameters into context . With that we think that a teacher that do not\nknow how to use workshop could give it a try in a couple of minutes with the\nhelp of the wizard instead of giving up because he need a lot of time to figure\nout what to do with all the parameters. 2- Assignment\nof peers instead of submissions During our\nbrainstorming, we found it complicated to wait for the submission phase to\nassociate the works. In addition, the interface was very confusing. We found it\nsimpler to make these configurations from the beginning when the teacher\ncreates the activity. This has greatly simplified the interface. In addition,\nthis opens new possibilities as you will see further. 3- Allow\nassessment directly after submission We found this\ntracker : -\nWorkshop only allows one phase at a time - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-27238 We apply some\nprinciples of this task into the sketch. 4- Allow\nassessment without submission We found this\ntracker : -\nAllow Workshop to assess without submission - https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-52191 We apply some\nprinciples of this task into the sketch. 5- Use the\nevaluation methods of assign To reduce the\nlearning curve of the teacher we will add the evaluation methods of assign into\nworkshop. - Add a\nconfig to hide grading methods - In\nthe sketch, we have hide comments and number of errors - Rename\naccumulating grading for simple direct gradings - Change the\nworkshop to get the possibility of use advanced grading method of assign - Migration\nscript from rubric of workshop to rubric of advanced grading methods - Delete\nrubric strategy of workshop After that we\nwill have that in workshop - simple\ndirect gradings (legacy workshop accumulating grading) - Marking\nguide (of advanced grading method) - Rubric (of\nadvanced grading method) 6-\nAnonymization of reviewer and reviewee We found it\nmuch simpler to put it in the interface than use the Advanced role override. Also, we are\nthinking about other features : - UX of the\nstudent What do you\nthink of that ?",

Students often do not read that which they were assigned to assess, and rarely give long enough useful comments. They just auto mark with a high grade and move on without doing any real assessment at all. The current grading method actually seems to allow assessors to do this, as they are not punished for short comments or dishonest grading practices. Is there a way to improve the grading method for specifically the assessors to encourage them to actually leave good comments and do the work? Are there any improvement plugins or can I somehow for comment length (or grade them for it?) Cheers",

That is what example submissions and assessments were supposed to be used for - to show examples of a good assessment and examples of a bad/insufficient assessment. How does it help to have a minimum required length for comments if students do not really feel like motivated to provide meaningful feedback? There is nothing that will prevent them to fill it with non-sense ballast to make the stupid system happy. Life - and laziness - finds a way.

Any Chinese educator would reply in a different way. The question of academic dishonesty, as well as the virtues of education itself, are seen quite differently here. I am not in a position to change a culture, and that is what you are asking me to do. This may seem like I am painting with a broad brush, but that truly isn't the case. Even the best students would be too afraid to give others low marks, as it costs them \"face\". The weaker students are simply there before they know the Chinese education system requires presence, not participation and will only do what is \"hard coded and tangibly required\" in order to squeak by. That means more than half of the class will only give two word comments. I'm not going to get in to the post-maoist refugee syndrome of every man for himself that is present here enlarge, but I will say that no amount of communication will convince more than half the class to leave reasonable criticism without some reward/punishment system in place. This makes it sound like I am at a terrible school, but I am actually teaching at one of the top universities of foreign languages in country. It is a cultural phenomenon that I must adapt to, not a pedagogical problem that I will be able to overcome as my superiors and colleagues are also of the culture in question and see it as a norm.",

I am not that naive to expect everybody happy about what we demand from them in schools. In fact, active participation and engagement of 50% of the class would look like the teacher's success to me - anywhere in the world. I guess I did not express my thoughts well.

My primary concern is making things fair for everyone in my lectures, and the student who really give it their all is being knocked down by students who simply don't care. Imagine leaving several paragraphs in assessment, really going out of your way to help someone, and then receive two words in return: this is way too common. The fact is that China, despite it's many attempts to emulate the progression of other countries in the fields of academics, is still left in a sort of limbo. This is because culture itself is coming in to direct conflict with systems developed elsewhere. While China is trying to find her middle ground, there is still a state of general confusion and the university level students are of a generation where only fools don't exploit the system when given an opportunity. I sympathize, to some extent, I really do. As an outsider looking in, it is easy to see that much of this is asymptomatic of deeper cultural facets that are not up to me to judge. My wish is to navigate the system as best that I can with the best tools at my disposal. Moodle meets every need I have, save for this small problem. You're right when you say that it is fascinating from a pedagogical sense, but with the semester starting next week, my attention is on the practical application at the moment. :P",

It is important that teachers understand this behaviour and are able to interpret the calculated values correctly (and eventually intervene by setting weights or by adding own weighted assessment or so).

How you use them for real-life activities is totally up to you. If you indeed mean a real-life workshop that you organize and want to use Moodle for online activities, you should set up a Moodle course and use any of the modules available to set up tasks and chores for your participants. The module (activity) names are meant to give you an idea what each does, but many people use them quite creatively for variety of things.",

Peer assessment is turned on in the workshop, and students have been divided into two groups.  They submit writing examples which are reviewed by their peers using a provided rubric with scores and comments. How does the student see the assessment or feedback on his writing? Sorry if this is a basic question, but I must just be missing something here. Thanks for any help, Dan",

Was something missed in setting up the peer assessment or grading process?  I also think it's odd that the student has to wait until all grades have been given to all students and the workshop is closed before being able to see the results of the peer assessment.",

A student can see feedback from all peer-reviewers who were assessing his/her submission in the Workshop activity itself, once it is closed. Results of peer-assessment can not be available during the Assessment phase because the received assessment could bias the giving assessment. And the results can not be published during the Grading evaluation phase too as they are not final. The teacher can override them yet, change weights etc. It would be confusing for students if the given grade would change several times.",

We're wondering if, when workshop is closed, is there any way for students to see (perhaps anonymously) the various assessments received for their work, including probably the teacher's one. It would be great to be able to see them, as they often contain valuable information about how your peers see your work (grading and feedback for each \"dimension\" or aspect, not just the aggregate) As far as we can see, once workshop is closed the student can only see the assessments she made, not the ones she received.

However, I was saddened by the fact if a student got a low score, there's no way to pull up these comments, nor the specific scores. This is what the official help says: Accumulative grading: Comments and a grade are given regarding the aspects of the workshop specified. The comments from their peers will point out the weakness of their work, which is generally difficult to find out by themselves. Well, when my students click on the closed workshop, they can't see any comments. I would like my students to be able to dispute the scores and see why they got the score they did. How can students find the values of the comments field? Is this stored in the database ? CORRECTION:  The students have to not only click once on the gradebook, but they have to click their Submission Title to see the list of comments.  That wasn't clear in the instructions.",

The Moodle workshop module offers two possibilities to switch from submission to assessment phase: you switch manually you specify the availability of submission and assessment phase in the workshop settings and tick \"Switch to next phase after submission deadline\" If you chose the second option as I did it is still possible to switch phases manually. I did this to shortly test whether in the assessment phase I could see the assessment form  as a student. I could not. The reason is that the settings from option 2 override the manual switch (option 1). So when I was testing, the assessment phase was not yet available for students - and therefore I as a student could not see the assessment form. As soon as the assessment phase was available for students, I could also see the assessment form.",

So my students were able to submit comments, they were not able to submit grades. This HAS to have been someone else's problem before mine.

The instructor would simply skip the submission phase and switch directly to assessment once they had specified the schem for assessment (which is quite nice) and allocate the students for assessment however they want.

However, he has now send us a screenshot of the submission documents of his peers on his computer, with the time and date stamp of when he downloaded the documents to his computer. On Moodle we can see that he accessed the course and the Workshop activity a minute before the first file was saved on this computer, but the report does not contain any logs indicating that he opened the submissions of his peers. (The report below is for the course, for the specific student and for the whole of the day in question and all activities and actions; these two entries below are the only actions/ activities done (and logged) by the student on the specific day) . This now opens a whole can of worms, because if he was able to download the documents without Moodle having a log for it, then he can argue that he did in fact do the peer-assessments for each student, even though Moodle has no log or activity history/grade of this. Can the report logs be wrong? It is possible that the student did in fact perform an action that is not in Moodle's logs? Could the data be stored elsewhere as well? (I.e. can I do an ad-hoc database query and locate more detailed logging details of the student's activities, and if so, what is the SQL query to do this?)",

          "Text": "if he was able to download the documents without Moodle having a log for it I just checked the code and it can easily happen actually. There is an event logged for every time when a particular submission is displayed via the submission.php script (that is clicking the submission title). Such an event is then logged as \"Submission viewed\": \n```text\nThe user with id 'X' viewed the submission with id 'Y' for the workshop with course module id 'Z'.\n```\n But, during the assessment phase, students typically end on the assessment.php page where the very same submission is displayed as well - together with the attachments - without leaving the event logged. That is a bug and it will help if you can report it in the Moodle Tracker . So yes, the student could read the submission and download the attachment. However, if the student provided the assessment via the workshop interface (that is, if he actually filled and submitted the assessment form), there would be another event \"Submission assessed\" logged: \n```text\nThe user with id 'X' assessed the submission with id 'Y' for the user with id 'Z' in the workshop with course module id 'W'.\n```\n So maybe the student just did not understand that he was supposed to actually fill the assessment form via the web and submit it? (assuming the Workshop was really used like this). Generally, let me discourage you from making any decision based on the absence of the event in Moodle logs (not only in Workshop).",

We can see the \"Submission assessed\" log for all other students in the course, so assumed it not being logged for this student meant that they did not complete it.

However, the wording in Logs does indicate submission, and also assessment, for real (not example) submissions. In the process of being a hypothetical student, doing assessments, I kept looking for a link at the bottom of the page, to leave the event . I would not have known to use that wording. I simply wanted to move on. In summary, after assessing the work, I click on save and close. That gets me to the page with the assessment that I just did. And then, I expected to see a button, Done, or Go back to the course, or something like that. Not there!  Pure trial and error! Now, back to the assessment of example submissions: Why can't the programmers program the same wording for the event for assessments of both the example and real submissions?!? In addition, when I download the logs, the header words surprised me. I can see that Event context is the label for the learning activity. The Component is what? The key work or type of learning activity? The Event name makes a little sense for the assessment of real submissions, but no sense at all for the example submissions. After seeing your wording in the blue box, the words  under the Description make sense for assessment of the real submissions, not for the assessment of examples.

          "Text": "It sounds as if Dan has just described the same issue I am having and was hoping for some clarification on. I just finished class. I had set the submission deadline for 12:00, the beginning of classtime (I had announced several times that everybody needed to submit SOMETHING by the deadline, or they would not be assigned a draft to review). Of course, one student had not submitted. It was ok because we're doing peer review for the first time and it's early in the semester--so I'm still training them how to follow my directions. However, another student asked after class if he could resubmit his draft--he had made some changes during class and wanted an updated copy available before people started to review them. I had moved it to Assessment, and he could not. I then moved it back to Submission, and he still could not. After reading others' comments, I think the problem was that--even though I had moved it back to Submission, I had NOT extended or cancelled the deadline. So even though it was in Submission, it wasn't available (and, yes, I had enabled late submission). So I guess the answer--if you want students to be able to have some greater flexibility--is not to use Workshop to enforce the deadline: leave it open but announce your own deadline and then enforce it as you wish. Even without activating a submission deadline, Workshop still timestamps everything, so you can see if something is late or not. Of course, the above method does require you to move the Workshop into the Assessment phase manually, which is not ideal if you like the automatic switching feature. To clarify what others have said, I believe th",

In a future version, these things should be more flexible (and easier to set up) as every student will be controlled by his/her own workflow.

Or are the 4 assessments averaged together instead of all 5? I'm not sure how that works. Any light shed on the subject would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure it's a simple answer, but I'd rather be on the safe side of asking than assuming. Cheers!",

But what I'd really like best is to run my own one from beginning to end, from the student perspective and the teacher perspective, to see how it works and to spot any glitches.

You can switch the phase to the assessment one repeatedly as needed. Each iteration can even have different grading strategy selected. For example, you can gather initial feedback via the Comments grading strategy for the first round, let authors submit new versions of submission based on the feedback, and then assess it again with more formal accumulative or rubric strategy. It is an advance feature though and is recommended for teachers familiar with the Workshop workflow and features.",

Hope this provides some more test cases for the developers to check for. ----- I am currently experiencing this in a large-scale offering (Close to 4000 registered learners). I tried it twice to see whether there are some variations The common workshop settings were for \"Separate Groups\" , Grouping : Custom Grouping that we had enabled for this group,  Enable Scheduled Allocation : Ticked, Number of Reviews : 4,  The number of members in individual group varies. [This was a Teacher Professional Development programme for Use of ICT and hence contained teachers from different domains] The following was what I tried different: For W1, when the switch was made to assessment phase there were people who got 16-20 assignments for review. There were 3 unallocated submissions. For W2, when the switch was made initially there were 10-16 assignments per person and there were 5 unallocated submission. Now I changed the workshop back to Submission phase. Kept it open for some time (3 hours) and \"Remove current allocations: Ticked\". Now I observed that  \"To be allocated: 0\" and saw that many have received 25-34 submissions. Based on the experience of W1, we had specified that each one need to review only 4 more. But even then we have received queries from several confused participants. I have yet another workshop (W3) that I will release in few hours. The submission for this is due in 5 days. I will try to update this post if I experience a completely different behaviour. Regards Jk",

I am thinking of moving from using the online assignment where I had students submit their written work three times (without peer review). The workflow has been that the students make their first submission, and I do quick look to see if they reached a set word count, have followed the formatting instructions and made use of the spell checking feature. I give them a preliminary grade which triggers the completion tracking and restrict access rules I set up to allow them to see a page of common errors for  the assignment. Looking at the common errors they then do a rewrite and submit the assignment again. I look at the new submission and give more detailed feedback and at the beginning of the next class they correct their submission using my more detailed feedback. I found this discussion ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=270877 ) and  I think I should be able to transfer this workflow to the workshop module. I was thinking of using using the number of errors for the first assessment and then possibly the Accumulative grading or a rubric for the 2nd. I guess my question for the more experienced users of this module is do you think it will work? Are there any points I should watch out for when trying this?",

It makes the peer-assessment easier to cope with (for reviewers and reviewees, too) as it can focus on more formal aspects of the work. In the second round, more detailed peer-assessment can be provided via Rubric or Accumulative grading strategy. With regards to number of instances (single Workshop versus two Workshops), it will be best to actually experiment and try both. I can see pros and cons of either way. It may depend on how you plan to do the peer-reviews allocations. If the submitted work should be reviewed by the same peers in both rounds, then it is definitely much easier to have single Workshop. Just change the grading strategy after switching back to the Submission phase, leaving the existing allocations in place. If you want to keep a record of how the submitted work looked like after the first round, it may be easier to have two Workshops. Good luck, and please do not forget to share your teaching experience with the Workshop. It may take a while to learn all its features and bugs (sometimes hardly distinct ).",

I don't think that is possible, but you could get half way there by taking the route Paula suggested but asking them to also complete a Workshop activity for which you create new Moodle groups comprising students from the different original groups, if that makes sense. Each student  would then submit the work they originally submitted as a group. Each would make an individual assessment of another piece of group work. To make the assessments visible to all, you could change the View permissions for students, and also make time for the original groups to come back together and discuss the various feedback they received on the piece of work they have in common, and any insights they gained from their wide exposure to other groups' submissions. It's a bit convoluted and may not meet your needs - it depends whether the feedback itself is more important than the group process you may have in mind for groups negotiating what feedback to give. If the latter is more important then to the best of my knowledge, it probably needs to happen outside Workshop. Best, Mira",

It is possible to override one or more assessment scores individually . I n regards to “Grade for submission”, Moodle does not allow to override the scores individually . Only option is to override the final score. So these two functionalities (computing grade for assessment vs submission) are in odds with each other.  I would have really liked the ability to just override one of the received grades (for computing the grade of submission) but Moodle does not allow that!",

          "Text": "Thanks Gurman for opening this topic. Let me try and explain the reasoning for the current behaviour (I am the author of the Workshop 2.x code). As a teacher, you have several options to affect the grades given to students in the Workshop (in their role both as authors and as peer-reviewers). You can provide your own assessment, eventually with higher weight than peers have, so it will have bigger impact on the calculations. Your assessment is considered as another peer-assessment so it affects both the assessed submission's grade, and also the assessment grades of all others who assessed the submission, too. You can override the final grade for each submission, e.g. because you are the only one who know about some author's disabilities that led to receiving lower grade. So even if you accept all the peer-assessments, you still want to set the different grade. This way, you amend just the submission's grade without affecting reviewers' assessment grades. You can override the individual grade for assessment. That is the grade that is calculated by the grading evaluation plugin in use. The typical use case is when reviewers get lower grades from the \"comparison with the best assessment\" evaluation method just because their review is not \"in line\" with all others assessments of the same submission. Yet you realize that even if the reviewer was sole in their assessment, they were actually right. Maybe they were the only one who spotted a mistake or so. So you want to fix this particular mis-calculation. As a last resort, you can still override both final grades for submission and grade for assessment for each student in the gradebook once the grade is pushed there (which currently happens only when you are closing the workshop, this will be improved in the future). My reasoning was that when teachers are overriding a grade in the Workshop, they should have particular reason for that. So they re-grade particular submission (because this and that in this submission is good/wrong), or particular assessment (because this and that in this assessment is good/wrong). There should be a clear evidence that a particular grade has been overridden and for what reason. What you would like to have is the ability to override the submission grade coming from a single reviewer. But that grade is calculated by the selected grading strategy and is based on how the assessment form (e.g. rubric) has been filled. Imagine there are three reviewers of a submission. They all fill the assessment form (say a rubric) same. I believe it is reasonable to expect that same filled rubric should lead to same grade. Why would you want to override one of it? In my mind, it just goes against the whole idea of using multi-criterial assessment forms to achieve more objective assessment. That is what led me to implementing the current behaviour. I generally love the feedback from teachers working with the Workshop and I'll be happy to hear your use-cases / reasoning for your feature request. Thanks in advance!",

However, I am probably still missing your point on having multiple reviewers provide the same grade because they are using the same rubric. I am using Workshop for students to do code review (among other things) of their peers. Based on the rubric, sometimes they are asked to identify a particular feature. Due to their own lack of knowledge or otherwise, they are unable to identify the feature in their peer's code even if it is there. As a result, they give a low grade. The contrasting situation can also occur: due to their lack of understanding the code/output or lack of applying the rubric correctly, they give higher grade than the peer deserves. For both these situations, I wanted to correct that reviewer's grade and thus, wanted to only change individual reviewer's grade. Does this make sense? It is possible I am not providing/using the rubric correctly or not understanding the philosophy behind the Workshop submissions - so any more light on this would be appreciated!",

No. The reviews are internally allocated per submission, not per user. So you need the submission first.

Is there a way to assign a Participant a set of students as reviewee's before the Participant has made that submittal? Well, yes. As long as those being-reviewed students themselves have submitted something. The reviewers themselves do not need to submit anything. set up the Workshop Participants with five students that will review them and five students that can be reviewed by them As said above, this is not easy, if possible, to set up. You would need to temporarily switch the workshop (which might be hidden yet from regular students) to the submission phase, log in as each participant, submit an empty draft submission and then allocate it for assessment. Once that is done, you can show the workshop to students. As long as the workshop remains in the submission phase, they can edit the pre-created submission records.",

In this particular case, the actual calculation is `(6/6 + 4/4 + 1/2) / 3 * 12 = 10.0` Shortly, in the accumulative grading strategy, it does not matter if the max grade for the aspect is 6, 4 or 2. If you want to make some of them more important, increase their weights. I agree this may look counter-intuitive at the first sight.

My students often get confused about when the completion check mark is going to appear. They don't see it after submission, and they don't see it after assessment either!

I think I can set up the anonymity by altering the mod/workshop:viewreviewernames permissions for the student role. The trouble is Workshop doesn't function in the described way when it comes to groups. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to put together this workflow for a group? We're a Moodlerooms school, and don't have much access to back-end code. Sidenote: I recognize the setup may seem inflexible, but the instructor is attempting to model the peer review model for scientific journal articles. Current Idea: My workaround idea is to have one student submit from each group, then enter the assessment phase and have every student review every paper (they'd write \"This is my paper\" when they get the assessment for their own). This still seems a bit clunky.",

Also - how will each student know what to submit, or will they be allowed to choose? There is not an easy place to give individual instructions to each student in a workshop. The other difficulty is how they are going to draw the shapes - I don't know how you can do this in the standard Moodle editor, so I will hope someone else will give you  reply for that",

Here is the main problem. If I give a task: coordinates of a circle ( 1,1 ), of a rectangle ( 2,3 ), of a triangle ( 5,7 ). And a line goes from the origin by the angle of 30 degrees. I need to give another student the same task with some changes: coordinates of a circle ( 5,7 ), of a rectangle ( 1,1 ), of a triangle ( 2,3 ). And a line goes from the origin by the angle of 60 degrees. And I don't know how to give it in a such way. Further, in order to check other work a student B needs to know the task of the student A. May be I can attach a list with 150 tasks. How I can allocate the task №138 to the student A, and the task №123 to the student B? And how the student B knows that the student A has the task №138? The tasks are not individualized for the students. Only some conditions are. But it doesn't change, nor the main task, nor the instructions for grading.

Given though, that Tatiana's response to Mary is to have students making a drawing on paper and upload an image of that drawing, (assuming that students are using their phones to take the image which can also be an exercise in positive use of personal technology) does it really matter if the instructions, (questions) are given via a Workshop, a single question quiz, or a small, three or four question quiz?",

But, when we are getting the student to upload a file, can we have a restriction of which file types. E.g. requring an image. Or requiring a .doc document? Automatically allocate late submissions You can re-allocate late submissions, but only by fiddling around with the phases. It would be nice to automate it with a schedule task. This would require MDL-47798 . MDL-27238 asks for even more than this, but we don't need to go that far. Need a clear list of non-submitters that respects group mode If you are using separate groups, then that makes the list of people who have submitted easy to work with in big courses. However, there is no easy way to see a list of people in one group who have not submitted, and we would like that so tutors can monitor the students in their own group. Custom activity completion conditions: Submitted and Assessment complete It would be nice to add a couple of automatic completion conditions for the activity completion system. One that lets you automatically mark the activity complete when you have done your submission, and one that marks it complete when you have done your assessment. (Presumably most of the time you would want to turn on both options, if you were turning this on at all, but probably best to leave them as separate settings.",

At the moment, the current version of the Workshop has been designed so that allocating for peer-assessment can be done only after there are some students work submitted. To make that happen, you have to switch the workshop phase from the setup phase to the submitting phase and let your student submit their work. Once that happens, other options (such as those pull-down menus etc) will appear. Also note, the Workshop does not support the \"set up and forget\" approach. In its current versions, continuous intervention of the teachers is needed (there are plans to have it slightly less dependent on them in the future but it is a long way to go there). So at at the end, maybe the Workshop will not be the best tool for your faculty's needs.",

For example, 70 students with 2 reviews each is 140 \"set and forget\" reviews. If 20 students do not submit you need to look up the reviewees and reallocate those who submitted and keep the allocation balanced.

Today I realized a strange behavior: If a student has to grade two other submissions, but only grades one of them, she/he is still able to get the top grade. Example: Students have to grade two submissions each. The workshop activity is configured to award up to 80.0 points for the submission and up to 20.0 points for the assessment. Student A grades only one submission and forgets about the second one. Exprected behavior: each graded submission should count as 10 points or less. Two grades per student makes a total of 2x10=20 points. What happens: Student A is able to get 20.0 points, despite grading only one submission. Occurs in: Moodle 2.8.5+ (Build: 20150313) and Moodle 2.6.1+ (Build: 20140213) Is this a bug or am I missing an important setting? Simon",

I know with only one reviewer the \"Grading grade\" will always be full value, but I expected the submission grade to reflect the errors selected by the reviewer. Is there a known bug? I tried to search, but couldn't find one. What would you need from me to diagnose this? Thanks!",

Here, you have to define the mapping table - that is what number of errors leads to what grade (in percents). The numbers displayed beside the drop-down menus are a hint. If you use them (select them manually in drop-down menus), you will have linear conversion. This user interface, besides many others in the Workshop, deservers some usability improvement to make it more intuitive, for sure. Hope this helps.",

As the number of assertions in the form may vary with every save, you can't just generate some initial mapping on the first save and keep it. If another assertion was added, the mapping would not correspond any more. And we can't decide whether the previously saved mapping was the default linear one or an intentional one. Hmm, actually we can. Instead of the whole mapping form, there could be just a single checkbox \"Use default linear errors/grades mapping\", checked by default. Only after the teacher unchecks it, the mapping form would be displayed and the teacher would become responsible for providing the mapping table. I expect most of teachers use the default mapping anyway. Thanks for rising this!",

Yeah, unfortunately there is no simple way to let Moodle to recalculate the grades. The thing is, individual grades from peers are calculated and stored at the moment when the assessment form is saved by the student. The only thing you can do now once you have fixed the mapping table is Have the workshop in the Evaluation phase Use the \"Clear assessments\" tool. It will mark all submissions as not assessed - yet it does not remove the allocation (who is assessing who) and how the assessment forms were filled Switch the workshop back to the Assessment phase Let students to re-save the assessments forms (or you, as a teacher/admin, have to go and log in as every student and do that on behalf of them. I am really sorry about this, I am aware it's an important usability issue and should have been fixed ages ago.",

Any further suggestions based on your experience would be much appreciated. The major insight for us was the importance of the instructions - understanding how and when the description, instructions for submission, and instructions for assessment display to students, and using the News Forum to remind students about what to do any when - this latter required the tutors to write diary notes to send out those Forum posts (Moodle Events may help us here in future). The change to Workshop we would most appreciate is allocation on demand, allowing tutors to set a softer deadline without having to manually allocate late work. We've reached a high level of satisfaction now with both students and staff - thank you David and all for a really helpful activity. First iteration: http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2015/02/13/peer-review-with-the-moodle-workshop-activity-a-close-look/ Second iteration: http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ele/2015/03/18/a-good-peer-review-experience-with-moodle-workshop/ All the best, Mira - University College London",

We don't necessarily have solutions. Ability to add information/instructions 'Overall assessment' There is an option 'Overal feedback mode' that gives the\nstudent to box in which to type and overall comment, after completing the rest of the grading form. However, there is no way to give instructions next to that box, like\nthere is for the other aspects of the grading method. Inconsistent editors when assessing On the assessment form, the input box for each of the Apsects is a plain textarea, but the input for the 'Overall assessment' is a HTML editor. I think we would like them to all be HTML editors. Students get confused by the intructions when reviewing their submission Even after the end of the submission phase, when a student reviews their submission (e.g. http://school.demo.moodle.net/mod/workshop/submission.php?cmid=651&id=48 ) the \"Instructions for submission\" are shown first, and are often written imperatively (\"Write three sentences ...\"). Apparently some students got confused by this, because when you are reviewing, you can't do that! I wonder if a solution to this is as simple as collapsing the instructions for submission by default when reviewing. (They are already in a collapsible region.) The link to review a submission is not easy to find The link to review your own submission is just the title of that submission. This was not obvious to all students. It might be better to change it to be a separate 'Review submission' link. Save and continue does not work well with requried fields The assessment form has a 'Save and continue editing' button. Students assuemd they could use this to stop half way through assessing, and come back later. However, since all the fields on the assessment form are required, you can't acutally do that. You have to fill in all the boxes (if only with junk) before you can save. If you do fill all the boxes with junk, you have not way of being reminded that you have not actually finished assessing. The ability to save partially complete assessments, to finish later, would be good (but a pain to implement). Option to display reviews by aspect, not reviewer At the moment, you see the review given by each user, and\nfor each user, and each review comments on a number of aspects. In this case it\nwould be good if there was the option to have the display grouped by aspect, and under each aspect, you\nsaw all the comments from each reviewer.",

However, if it seemed too \"distant\" for your testers, I can imagine specific instructions for this field to be displayed just next to it. Opinion: Why not. Re: Inconsistent editors when assessing Any particular reason for rich text formatting here? I would say that plain text for answers to individual aspects is enough as I do not expect them to be too long and structured. I intentionally wanted to keep HTML formatting limited. I do not think that \"it should be HTML because the overall assessment is\" is strong enough argument for me. The reasoning for HTML editor support in the overall feedback was the ability to embed and attach files (such as corrected version of the submission). And I do not like HTML editors enabled without the files support. Opinion: I'm not a huge fan . Re: Students get confused by the intructions when reviewing their submission Good point and a nice suggestion. Opinion: +1 Re: The link to review a submission is not easy to find Yes, good point. There are quite a few places in the Workshop where adding an explicit button for the expected action would help. This is probably one of the cases related to MDL-46396 . Opinion: +1 Re: Save and continue does not work well with required fields Right. What about being a bit more pragmatic here. Instead of implementing the whole workflow / state machinery for assessments, let us just reword the button to something like Save this assessment and show next or so. Re: Option to display reviews by aspect, not reviewer Oh that's a really nice and useful idea! Indeed it is something that each grading strategy subplugin has under its own control but such different views of the assessment should be possible. Opinion: Yes!",

It does not really belong in any of these threads, but I will put it here: After each course is finished, we switch users from the standard Student role, to a Read-only student role. Our Read-only student role does not have mod/workshop:submit. Unfortunately, this means that when students get made read-only all the submissions disappear from the workshop UI. Is there a good way around that, or does this lead to a new feature request: split mod/workshop:submit into mod/workshop:submit and mod/workshop:viewmysubmission?",

The student received \"16/16\" from the three students who actually assessed her submission, but two of the students assigned to assess her work did not complete the assessment phase. The system counts those as \"0\" and gives the student a submission score 9.6/16. I would expect her to get 16/16. The students that did not complete the peer grading should be ignored.

When students do not provide the assessment - meaning that they did not attempt to assess it at all - the screenshot should show the received grade like \"- (-)\" - that is null, no grade. In which case, such assessment would be ignored.\nIf the \"0.0\" is there, it means that students actually did assess the submission. But I agree that leaving the assessment form untouched should not lead to zero grade received. If that is what happens, then we have an usability bug here.\nTo fix this situation for now, you can either remove those allocated assessments (via the manual allocation tool) or set the weight of such assessments to 0 which effectively ignores them then.",

As a results of this we have a list of changes we think would be a good idea, or at least that we would like to discuss. I will probably post about then in a few separate threads, where I will group the changes by topic. If people agree with our proposals, I will make tracker issues for them. This first set should be relatively un-controversial. There are some accessibility issues we have spotted: The current phase is only indicated by hilighting one row in the table. You cannot show something with colour alone. Therefore, there needs to be some extra text to indicate the current Phase, possibly with class=\"accesshide\". Alternatively, MDL-44010 might be a solution, but I don't think so. We are using the \"Comments\" grading method, but this probably applies to \"Accumulative\" too, and perhaps some others. When students are grading, the description of each aspect is not properly linked to the corresponding input box using <label> tags, or aria-labelledby, so screen-reader users find it difficult to complete the grading form. Various parts of the interface had insufficient contrast , which would make it hard for partially sighted users. We should tweak the CSS to increase the contrast. (Actually, I think this issue related to the file-picker, not the Workshop.) Any objections before I make tracker issue for these?",

The points 2. and 3. above are clear bugs and should be fixed. I'll be happy to discuss with your accessibility experts and follow their suggestions on this. With regards to the point 1., it indeed is a clear bug too. I've had a plan to replace the current \"workshop planner\" (the table with phases) for a long time but did not manage to find time for it yet. The current solution has multiple issues - most notably for mobile and small screen devices. Firstly, setting that widget's width to less than 100% all the time is suboptimal. It is not responsive. And overall, it is a table which it should not be. If we agree that displaying a \"wizard-like\" element that displays all the past, current and future tasks the user is going through in the workshop, I would really like to reimplement it into more appropriate HTML structure (list, or maybe definition list) and style it as horizontally aligned blocks. In any case, the current phase (or just the current individual's state in the future) will have to be clearly identified from the accessibility point of view. So, definitely my +10 on all these.",

The problem is that the platform does not calculate the evaluation score that gave the couple , but it will automatically registers 20 , this being false, because there the percentage that participants give their peers actually recorded . The other problem is that you can not hide the couple's name being evaluated and that can be a big problem among students.

In short: course completion on minimum grade to pass the activity set (in Gradebook, evaluation item \"Submission\") other than zero students that have submitted their work get a red X (failed) in activity completion, and their grade for the submission is zero. I may have made some mistake, but the system simply should not assign a grade to students while in the submission phase, right? I am a bit puzzled... any idea? Thanks.",

          "Text": "David, thanks for your answer. The correct Moodle version is 2.7.1 (sorry). ...in the meantime, I run some other tests (on demo. moodle.net ), where I verified almost the same behavior and possibly found an answer (sort of). While I was setting up the activity, I switched briefly to the closing phase and took some screenshots for tutorial purposes. That, as you might put it, \"pushed the grades into the gradebook\" . Ok, that could explain why students got a grade, still... Problems (on both versions): Grades for submission are assigned for all submitted work, no matter if\nthey were graded (by peers) or not at all (in the latter case, NULL is\nconverted to \"zero\"). I figure the rationale here is: \"OK, they submitted something, no one assessed them, if teachers do not override the grade Moodle should assign a grade, so their activity is marked complete , at least\". Makes sense... still, teachers could use some sort of warning for submission that were not graded at all by peers Assigned grades do not get blanked (i.e. back to NULL) once the activity is switched back to submission or even setup phase. (OK, so I will not go back and forth through the phases. Ever. ) On my version: All of the students got grades for submission (i.e. NULL converted to \"zero\"), even if they had not submitted anything at all. Note: on both versions, no one got any grade for assessment (i.e. NULL stayed NULL), and that's OK, because no one assessed anything. Thanks again, - Paolo",

You as the teacher are supposed to switch the workshop to the Grading evaluation phase and let it calculate (and aggregate) the grades. If you are happy with them, close the workshop (by switching it to the last stage). The grades as well as received assessments are displayed to your students in the Closed phase only. Should I have used that strategy instead? It really depends on what you want. As you are using rubric, you probably want some grade for submission to be received. You can't achieve that with the comments strategy, it purely for getting feedback with no grade.",

Hopefully the bulleted list below will make it clear what we are trying to achieve and apologies if this has been covered previously; The HNC group are the students who will be submitting their Word documents to be anonymously (created a specific role for this, see permission setting below if it helps others) peer assessed by the HND group of students. We don't want the HND student group to make submissions, they are there purely as peer reviewers for the HNC students. The HND students will be provided with rubric grading criteria (Level Grade: 0 - 4) and a comments text box for additional feedback. The lecturer will only be there to oversee that the HND students are using the Level Grades and comments facility appropriately, not over riding the HND students grades. What we are looking for is the Grade for Submission (which the HND students will provide to the HNC students) only without the requirement of the Grade for Assessment. What the HND students provide the HNC students during the Grade for Submission is the grade they should receive. Specific Peer Assessment Role Permissions for HND Students: Following settings carried out within newly created student based role for anonymously viewing Workshop authors: mod/workshop:submit - Prevent mod/workshop:viewauthornames - Prevent mod/workshop:viewauthorpublished - Prevent moodle/grade:view - Prevent (These HND students don't need to have a grade) Hope the above is clear.

Bad things might happen if - for example - some student were not given a submission to assess. The workshop activity would continue with this student left behind and no-one would spot anything wrong. So there must always be a human who confirms that the workshop can continue to the next phase.

I find the new version easier to understand and set up while providing the best tool imaginable for peer assessment. The development of the new Workshop module has been a very open process with lot of opportunities for feedback, comments, feature requests, etc. (see here and here for example).

I am just saying that it should be an option to have the workshop's switch phases automatically - I can see where it won't be the default -- But an option.

I used the workshop module in 1.9 often and trained others on how to use it and am in the process of using the workshop in 2.0 with students for the first time now. In the new workshop, the phase switching and lack of automation tripped me up. Even when I thought I understood it, I didn't get it right--I had manually allocated all of the submissions to be assessed and thought I was good. It wasn't until a student pointed out that they couldn't see anything to assess that I realized I also had to click the light bulb for the assessment phase too. It would be great to have options for automated or manual processes. In the automated version, I would see fields designed to set dates for different phases to begin and end with the option for the transition to be manual or automatic at each stage. For instance, I might want the allocation process and the move from allocation to assessment to be automatic, but may want to review the scores before making them available in the final phase. A bonus would be to have options to open and close phases based on specific events. It would be very cool to be able to tell the workshop to move automatically into assessment phase when all student submissions had been received and/or allocated. The workshop is a great tool but it is vastly underutlized due to its complexity.  We've made progress in 2.0, but by removing the option for automation, we've put up a roadblock to adoption by making the workshop more complex than it needs to be. Teachers have so many more important things to do and contributions to make--they don't need to be \"tied to the software merely to click a button.\"",

I have to say that I 'expected' it to automatically switch from the Set up phase to the Submission phase as soon as I had completed (all the boxes were checked) the Setup phase.  I didn't expect to be able to go back and edit the Setup phase, but found myself going back again and again to see if I missed a setting or forgot to set permissions because it just wouldn't switch to the next phase.  I have literally spent hours searching for how this works and actually thought it was broken. No where in any of the documentation for Workshop does is say: \"to switch from one phase to the next, click on the lightbulb icon\" This is not intuitive at all as even after I found out that I needed to manually switch phases (through reading the forums), I couldn't see where to do that.  I was looking for something on the Setup screen or under the Settings menu.  Perhaps the icon for that needs to be more representative of what it does.  I realize that the lightbulb allows you to go back and edit the phase again or switch to the next phase but perhaps some text would be more helpful. \"Edit/Switch Phase\" I do agree with the previous posts that it should automatically switch between at least the first few phases once milestones have been achieved (ie. Setup is complete; submissions have been received and reviewers have been allocated) and leave the grading section to be done manually. It is always a challenge to please all of the people all of the time and I believe that if you can automate what people expect to have automated and allow control over the phases they need to control you will be providing a useful tool.",

Regarding the support for automatic or scheduled phase switching. I can see a demand for it. Even though I see many potential issues, too, I believe it will be possible to come with a solution of this. I can imagine a side block called Workshop events/scheduler manager or so. That would be capable of executing various jobs based on time and/or conditions. For example, this block would be able to notify the teacher about new submissions and assessments (similarly to what forum does when you are subscribed). One of the supported actions would be \"Switch the Workshop into ... phase\". The block would inform the teacher whether the scheduled switching was successful or not. Yes, such a tool would be interesting... Let us see!",

I've used earlier a system, where I set the timetable of submissions and peer reviews for the whole course when the course starts. It was very important feature in that system. I have 10 exercises in the course, and the students are informed in the beginning of the course when the deadline for each of the submissions and their assement will be. If I have to open and close each submissions and then open and close the assessment for each submissions there are bound to be delays and even mistakes, which then confuse the students and cause problems. There is the possibility to set schedule for access control, I don't quite get why that can't be used automatically to control switching from a phase to another... It would by no means be doing unexpected, silent things in the background. On the contrary, it would ensure a very exact, easy and timely control for the whole process. I hope this will be added to the system, so that we don't have to try and deal with ackward and cumbersum dirty fixes to get this done.",

I ran hundreds of assignments through the process and it was never an issue. As I implemented it, there was a human touch: the student. The students are deeply concerned about their grades and if there was ever a problem with the grade, I was sure to be contacted by them. They look at the gradebook. Out of hundreds of assignments, I did have one real problem come up. Through the luck of the draw, one student got 3 reviewers who did not do the reviews. So, the system gave the student a 0. It was a purely random occurance. The student contacted me and I graded the assignment. This happened in version 2.2 and I did not catch it when I clicked the button to grade the assignments. May I suggest that the \"human touch\" of advancing the phases manually is a false security. I have 2 dozen workshops to advance each week, so I simply open them all at once in tabs and click through them. There is nothing inherent about me manually clicking them that requires me to review each student's grade to ensure that it is accurate. And there is nothing in the interface that would help me to know a bad grade just by looking at it. May I suggest that complete automation be added as a plugin behavior to the workshop. It need not be there by default, but those that would benefit by it greatly could install it. I appreciate you keeping an open mind about this and keeping the dialoge going. I feel like we can be creative and come up with a solution that meets everyone's interests.",

          "Text": "Thanks for your input Jared. You raised interesting points. I agree that forcing the user to proceed just a formal approval without any actual review is useless. Just to clarify - I am not concerned about grades for submission in workshop. Their calculation is simple (weighted mean of all received assessments) and there is really not much to do and check. What keeps me reserved from the whole idea of automatic phase switching is the grade for assessment. Its value is actually a sign for the teacher to check the reliability of assessments. Teachers were expected to evaluate those cases where the calculated grade for assessment is pretty low and make sure that such assessment does not bias the calculated grade for submission much. Do you use grade for assessments and if so, what typical value do you set? (compared to the grade for submission, is the portion like 50/50 or 80/20 or what?) Thinking about this issue more, I actually came to another out-of-this-topic idea. There might be a column in the Grading evaluation report that would display something like \"reliability index\" for each submission. Such an index might be defined as the lowest grade for assessment that some reviewer got. So if there is a submission assessed by three reviewers and the one of the reviewers got grade for assessment, say, 40%, the reliability index for that submission would be 0.4. It would help teacher to easily identify \"malicious\" submissions they should pay attention to. The other case that happened to you (a submission with no assessment) could be better handled by Workshop, too - I agree. Eg. to highlight submissions with no assessment in a special section at the grading evaluation screen.",

          "Text": "Regarding the computed grade for assessment, I personally don't find it too useful. I set it to Very Lax and it still causes frustration for my students. They get very irritatated that if they don't agree with the other two reviewer they loose points. So they then get in the position of trying to guess what the other reviewers will do so they won't loose points. To me, I wish I could just give them a standard 5pts for giving the review scores, no matter what. My rubric is simple, 0 points for 0 work, 4 pts for poor work, 8 pts for acceptable work, and 10 pts for amazing work. And my assignments are more like journal entries than research papers. Students don't have trouble giving an accurate score. I do hundreds of workshops a week (I will be doubling it next semester, one of my new classes has 260 students), so I would prefer a system that pushed more of the load to the students, rather than requiring me to look at each response. I rely on the students to give me a reliability check of assessments. It is their grade and they are motivated to look at it. They are looking at just one score, where I would need to look at hundreds. Over the course of a semester each student is evaluated 105 times so I get a nice statistically accurate assessment of their abilities, even though sometimes they are scored too high and sometimes too low.  The reviews and submissions are all anynomous, I don't have any concern with malicious assessments. Over the course of the semester, the class average of all assessments is always about 8.2/10 or so, indicating the the system works. If anything, scores are a bit inflated. I do give a grade for the submission and the assessment: 10 for submission/5 for assessment, or 15 points total. In the gradebook I use the calculated row function to merge the two scores back into one score again so the students can see how they did. More important than the computed grade for assessment, what I wish the system did was require comments. Handing out points is easy, but I want students to be required to form sentences around their praise and objections for the paper they are reviewing. This improves the quality of the review and gives the writer feedback she can use to improve. I often wish there was a simple check on the comments box in the review section that prevented the assessment submission if there is no comment. Right now I can't easily measure it so I just encourage my students to do it. Another feature I sometimes (but only sometimes) think would be helpful is a method for the writer to report a bad review. Perhaps a simple button that sends an email. Right now, I just have students send me an email if they feel that the average of 3 scores is unfair. They have to feel robbed enough to do the work to send me the email. In this case, I toss out the scores and grade the paper myself, for better or worse. Of course, if this was too easy then it would create unnecessary work for me. WARNING ** TANGENT** While I am thinking about it, I wish I could set how big the text box is. Is there a way to set it's size for all workshops? Or perhaps a character or word count. I want it to be easy for my students to know when they have written the appropriate amount of material, not to much and not too little. **END TANGENT** Wow, that was a long winded response. But I care a lot about the Workshop and use it a ton. If it were not for workshop, I would probably not be using Moodle. Most of the rest of what I use Moodle for can be done in my school's LMS. I have my own server so that I can employ workshop in my classes. It allows me to have higher learning assignments where work load would have made it impractical otherwise. Thanks for your hard work! This is by far the best peer review tool I have found.",

          "Text": "Just been badly burned by this one as set the final stage to change I thought automatically - now looking for an alternative tool after a series of serious issues with workshop requiring changes to grading and the activity. The idea was simple: submit a draft assignment before the deadline, random allocation to a peer, write comments as a review, receive comments after deadline. No automation meant it didn't switch over as advertised - setting dates for phase changes didn't work. However more problematic was that no comments were shared even after manual phase change intervention. Specifically set it to grading strategy: comments. However comments were judged by the system as incomplete/insufficient and not shared even after manual intervention to change phase as they weren't complete as there was no criteria. That was the point - no grade, just comments! Retrofitting a pass/fail and asking people to pass led to some comments being lost, others making it etc. and a lot have gone missing and we've had to fall back on email. So can you not have text only reviewing/comments but MUST rank or grade your peers? Or was there some other setting that caused the issue here? What was it? Grading would have completely defeated the purpose of the exercise. Retrofitting it was problematic and I don't think anyone's going to support using this tool again - pity, good idea just pretty incomprehensible and unexpected and unclear in its implementation and documentation. Problematic - anyone know of another tool to use that does do automatic allocation and switch of stages + written reviews only without having to give a grade? PeerMark?",

I would like to have students upload the activity (an oral speech) and immediately after to be able to assess themselves with the rubric. I mean, I do not want them to wait until the assessment phase. I would like asessment phase to be activated when a student have completed the submission. I think it is more flexible becasue as a learner, I would like to correct my task immediately after I have submitted it and not one week later. I have tried to do this by changing/overlapping the phases dates but it doesn't work. Has anyone an idea which settings do I have to set to make it possible? Thanks, Beatriz.",

          "Text": "Hi All, I am using Workshop Activity within various modules where I teach (thanks David Mudrak for this gift ). I am however adding a twist to it as to allow for a 360° peer-assessment. This gives the\nchance to students to assess the feedback received, which encourages students to do a\ngood feedback and reasure students that the feedback given by peers\nwill be properly done. It would be great if the Workshop Activity could accomodate this, perhaps by simply adding the option for students to rate each of the received feedbacks by means of a rate scale and a comment to justify it as suggested by David. Marks will then be reviewed and moderated by the tutor before they are made available to students. I have suggested this addition in the Moodle Tracker and it would be great to get your votes! https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-46726 Unfortunately I do not have a patch for this, which might delay a bit the process, and so if anyone would like to give it a try it would be great! Perhaps it is an idea for a new developers project? I would like to hear that you think of this modification. Cheers!",

So now we have some well-calculated grades (using the correct weight) along with some bad-calculated grades. So, is there any means to tell Moodle to recalculate all grades of submitted assessments? We found that if we \"enter as\" some student with a bad-calculated assessment and we re-assess the affected submissions without changing anything, moodle recalculates the final grade, but, as you would agree, this is a very annoying and time consuming task...

Looking at the code in mod/workshop/form/accumulative/lib.php there's a method \"calculate_peer_grade\" that is probably the one tha does the job. I've no PHP experience, but I've some knowledge of MySQL and Python, and fortunately I've access to the moodle database so I wrote a little Python script that did the job. I want to share this solution in case others are in the same situation, so find attached this script at the end of the message. However, In the workshop toolbox there's already a button to do some recalculations. I think it would be extremely easy to call there the \"calculate_peer_grade\" method to do a complete recalc, as the code is already there (perhaps it's only necessary to put this call into a loop).

          "Text": "In this issue: MDL-27238 the suggestion is made to allow more flexibility of which phase students are in. David has suggested: What is doable is to introduce a new phase covering both submission and assessment phase. I still resist to allow any on-the-fly calculation of the final grades because they rely on all submissions are available. Still, there are many open questions that must be answered prior any actual development can start. Most notably: How should submissions allocation behave? I can imagine a new allocator type (\"instant\" for example) that would automatically allocate the submission immediately after it is saved and marked as final by the student. Note this automatically enforces that a submission can be reviewed by a student that has not submitted anything yet (otherwise, the first submission could not get any reviewer). How to improve the submission workflow and keep it still easy to understand for students. The author has to mark (tag) the submission as \"ready for assessment\". But then, maybe on the initial feedback from the reviewers, the student has to have an option to switch the status back to \"work in progress\" (when no other assessment is possible) and then submit it for assessment again. Do we expect that the submission is re-allocated in this case? In other words, I believe it is possible to allow submission + assessment phase overlapping. But to calculate the grades, both submitting and assessing must be finished. Most significantly, the allocation of submissions seems to be a tricky one: When the first student submits their work, there is nothing else to be allocated to them for assessment. When the second student submits their work, there is only one work to be allocated. Should it be allocated or not? Students might easily abuse this behaviour to \"choose\" their own reviewer, instead of having them assigned randomly. As other students are submitting their work, the pool of submission is getting bigger and bigger and the allocation may seem to work. Still we have pretty unbalanced situation as early submissions are already assigned for assessments and hence are unlikely to be assessed by students who submit their own work later. At the end of this time scale there is another problem emerging. The very last submission must be allocated to someone. But by that time those students may think that their task was already done. In other words, students never know if there is some submission to be allocated for them yet or not. Until the phase is closed, they never know the expected amount of work to do (\"Mr Boerman, I already did all assigned peer-reviews last week. I did not know that a new submission can appear\"). I will follow with a post with my suggestions. David asks that we work through these issues in this forum to make sure the needs of the community are taken into account.",

          "Text": "Here are some of my suggestions regarding David's questions: As David suggests, set a lower limit for starting the review allocation process. For example, require at least 3 submissions before allocating any reviewers. Prior to that point, display \"Insufficient submissions to start allocation process\" to students, instead of a grade. This deals with several points of concern that David raised. This limit should not affect self-assessment, which should take place immediately upon submission, with an opportunity for the student to update their own work before allocation to others. If students are going to self-assess, it should be done as quickly as possible so they can have the material fresh in their minds, and they should be able to correct errors before letting the process go further. I would be reluctant to allow the student to continue to revise between this point and the completion of the required number of peer reviews. An option to restrict allocation to those students who have been given a grade of at least n for that assignment would be helpful. The instructor would assess the first couple of students, then they would be able to assess others. This allows a \"snowball\" effect of more and more potential assessors. This addresses another of David's key points. Yes, later submitters will be allocated to other later submitters for assessment, but the assessors are validated in this process, so there should be less of an impact on the quality of assessment. Set a lower limit of number of peer assessments before displaying a grade. If there have not been enough peer reviews yet, display \"grading incomplete\" or similar message to the student, rather than a grade for the assignment. Obviously, this number could be set to 0 for teacher-only assessments or 1 if the student should be able to see partial grades. Set the number of required assessments per student, and display to each student the number of assessments they have completed whenever they check the Workshop (or even better, in the student view after the link to the workshop). Allow the instructor to set a due date after which no more student assessments will be allocated (the instructor will have to decide whether to assess stragglers at that point). This addresses David's last point. Finally, there is an ongoing discussion of how to handle resubmissions within the Assignment module [ MDL-36804 ]. Ultimately, I think it would be helpful to merge Assignment and Workshop modules, but in the meantime, some kind of audit trail of submissions needs to be maintained, and possibly multiple rounds of resubmission and peer review should be supported in Workshop, with an instructor option to maintain reviewers in consistent groups (probably using the Groups feature) or re-allocating in each round of revisions. This is consistent with supporting good writing process by encouraging multiple drafts of major works with review and revision between each draft (i.e. what I usually think of as the \"workshop\" process.)",

          "Text": "We are using a moodle course for handling submission and assessment of the degree dissertations in our Faculty. We are dealing with 450 dissertations per year and 300-400 tutors grading them (some of them reviewing 2-3 dissertations). In Moodle 1.9 we used the activity \"assignment\" but  this implied that tutors should have teacher/editor permissions and they could have a look at all dissertations and assessments with no privacy for the student-tutor relation. Later we used a \" database \" with impossible requirements for visualisation, so that tutors (a modified student role) could only see their own contribution to the database. This year we are trying to use the workshop. The idea is that students submit their dissertations to the workshop. Tutors (a copy of the student role with another name) are allocated manually to review their corresponding students. And results will be easily obtained by giving a 100% value to the peer review scores (=tutors' grading). In such a situation, in which dissertation submissions are not synchronous, it would be interesting to have both phases -submission & assessment- opened at the same time. A related problem is that you cannot allocate students-tutors unless students have made a submission. This is logical for automatic allocations, but for manual allocations it would not be necessary. It would be practical to make manual allocations even when the students have not made any submission (yet). More flexibility among phases (allocation, submission, assessment), particularly in combination with manual allocation would be welcome.",

Referees are other students in the same group, does not depend whether they have submitted their works or not. The student will have to do improvements in his work according to his reviewers and only after that \"phase\" the teacher would grade his work (and referees for their judgement as well).

          "Text": "I have very strong feelings about this and have proposed different solutions from time to time. I am experimenting with a peer review tool called SWoRD out of University of Pittsburgh. They have a feature called soft deadlines. The way it works is you set the submission due date in the past. When a student submits a paper, the system then allows them to request a paper to review. There is an algorithm that selects the paper that has been waiting longest with the fewest number of reviewers. After one review is complete, the reviewer can then request more papers to review. In my dream world, this is how workshop would work. Rather than being driven by dates, it could be driven by events. Event one: paper submission Result: student can request papers to review (if none are available, or if there are too few in the system to prevent collusion or ensure anonymity, the user may need to come back later) Event two: the student has reviewed all required papers and their paper has been reviewed the required number of times Result: a grade is generated Some possible ideas additional ideas include: Allow people to request additional papers to review for extra experience, and possibly extra points This could help ameliorate the problem of some students not doing their reviews Dates could still play a role as a soft \"best if done by\" deadline to help keep the class on roughly the same pace I would assign a small amount of bonus or penalty point for doing the assignment early or late, but let the students manage their own time. The interface would allow students to petition grades and request instructor comment I imagine using this in large university classes where it would be too difficult to assign and grade numerous large writing assignments without peer review. In this system I get the best of both worlds. The students get quality writing assignments and detailed feedback from peers using a rubric and comments. If they are unhappy with their grade or would like an \"expert\" opinion on their writing, they have complete access to the instructor's feedback. I use this on assignments where there are no real right answers, it is just graded on completeness and polish. I envision a day where I create a MOOC with thousands of students in it, all starting and finishing the class at different times, having a rich and engaging experience that would be impossible otherwise.",

The Workshop has been designed so that the assessment allocation is a relation between a reviewer and a submission, not between two users. I can see two possible approaches to your use case though. First, try to use the scheduled allocation combined with the automatic assessment phase switch. Set the submission deadline at Sunday 6 pm, let submissions allocated randomly by the scheduled allocator and let the Workshop to be switched to the assessment phase automatically. That way, the teacher does not need to be involved and students can spend their Sunday evening by doing assessments. The other option would be a custom allocation plugin that would have to be developed. The teacher would preset required allocations in advance and then, the allocator would try to actually assign them, if possible (i.e. if the submission actually exists). So it would work similarly to the scheduled allocation method, but using the predefined relations between authors and reviewers. Obviously, the first alternative can be used immediately, the second one requires custom development.",

So the second option is really what I'm looking for.  Maybe I'll look into what it would take to write this.  It would be useful for us, for sure.",

I have students in remote locations and we use Phone conversations to test and quiz users for certain topics where an online test is not suitable. I use the workshop module to get the student to request a telephone conversation, but due to the lack of email notifications, the teacher has to be sent a separate email by the student to let them know that they have requested an assessment. If the email is not sent then the teacher is not aware that the student has requested the assessment and so delays occur. Apart from that, it suits the needs to assess via telephone.",

          "Text": "Right. The link to the docs page is http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Data_manipulation_API . Their current code \n```text\n$sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM {$CFG->prefix}plagiarism_crot_files WHERE path ='$path' AND courseid = $course AND cm = $cmid ORDER BY file_id DESC LIMIT 1\";\n```\n violates the expected API usage at least in the following areas: If possible, methods like get_records() or get_records_select() etc should be used instead of providing the full SQL. This makes the code more cross-database compliant. Specifying full query should be used only if there is no other way. In Moodle 2.x, we do not use {$CFG->prefix} any more in SQL queries. The table name itself should be wrapped by curly braces as in {plagiarism_crot_files} and the $DB automatically prepends the prefix if needed. Variables expansion in SQL queries (i.e. having $path, $course, $cmid there) is a very bad practise as it makes the query potentially vulnerable to SQL injections. Correct way is to use placeholders, either named (e.g. :courseid) or unnamed (via question marks). Specifying LIMIT at the end is not generally cross-database compatible (even if in this simple case it might be) and $DB methods provide explicit parameters for that. So basically, this particular code could (and probably should) be achieved by something like \n```text\n$files = $DB->get_records('plagiarism_crot_files', array('path' => $path, 'courseid' => $cid, 'cm' => $cmid), 'file_id DESC', 0, 1);\n$file = reset($files);\n```\n or, if they really insisted on having the full query explicit: \n```text\n$sql = \"SELECT * FROM {plagiarism_crot_files} WHERE path = ? AND courseid = ? AND cm = ? ORDER BY file_id DESC\";\n$params = array($path, $cid, $cmid);\n$files = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, $params, 0, 1);\n$file = reset($files);\n```",

When you click \"Re-calculate grades\" during the Grading evaluation phase, the Workshop recalculates final received grades for all submissions, as well as final grading grades for all reviewers. if I understand your view correctly, then yes. These calculations happen in clusters. In that mean that every final grade for submission is calculated from all reviews/assessments for the given submission (so if a submission was assessed by 5 reviewers, these 5 assessments form the final grade for that submission). every reviewer's final grading grade is calculated as a mean of all individual grading grades that the reviewer got. So, if Alice's submission was peer-assessed by Barbara, Cindy and Dona and Alan's submission was peer-assessed by Barbara, Charles and Dan, then Barbara's grading grade is calculated as a mean of two grading grades (because she did two reviews). The first of these grades is calculated by comparing Barbara's assessment with Cindy's and Dona's one. The second grading grade is calculated by comparing Barbara's assessment with Charles' and Dan's one.

Through trial and error, I discovered that I was able to switch back and forth between phases, so that I could allocate early submitters to review each other's work and so that the work would be accessible. I was fearful of damaging the data in the Workshop, but ignored my fear. The support forum and Moodle docs are just too piecemeal, and even after huge amount of time delving into these documents, only bits and pieces of info can be found. Alas, I do not remember which Workshop phase lets students see the others' work. But I do remember that once I switched to that phase for the 'early birds' then students who tried to submit work could not do so. So I had to switch back to the submission phase. I emailed students through campus email, not Moodle email, to email me ( not via Moodle email), when they were ready to submit, so that I could switch phase for about 1-2 hours. I have only one course with a Workshop, and only 19 students in that course, so it was possible to do this, even with my other non-online courses as part of my workload. With many students and multiple online courses, this approach may become impossible. My priority has been to learn to what Moodle is doing within Workshop and to accommodate working students (12 hours shifts, multiples days of work) so that when they are ready to deal with course assignments they are able to proceed. Ongoing concern: I don't know the consequences of switching back and forth between phases, and what kind of glitches may happen.",

This simple grading evaluation method gives credit to peer-reviewers just for their participation in the activity without comparing their assessment with the others. There are three modes of how grades for assessment are calculated by this method. All or nothing - The reviewer must assess all allocated submissions in order to obtain the maximum grade; otherwise they receive a grade of zero. Proportional - The grade obtained is proportional to the number of assessments. If all allocated submissions are assessed, the reviewer will obtain the maximum grade; if half of the allocated submissions are assessed, the reviewer will obtain 50% of the maximum grade. At least one - The reviewer must assess at least one allocated submission in order to obtain the maximum grade. See MDL-37603 and https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=workshopeval_credit",

This feature was introduced exactly for this case so that the whole class does not need to wait for a couple of peers. Note there is no need to switch the workshop back to the Submission phase to be able to allocate submissions. You can allocate submissions any time (even though the planner tool suggests to do it at the end of the submission phase). There should be no issue with missing submissions and/or missing assessments during the Grading evaluation phase. The evaluator just uses actual assessments that are available. If there is a submission left that was not assessed, there is no grade for it calculated. If there is a reviewer who did not actually assess anything, no grade for assessment is calculated to them. It's up to the teacher to interpret the situation (eg set the grade manually to zero, exclude the activity for the student in the Gradebook etc.)",

I don't know if anything changes for students outside of those particular clusters. Also, when I went back in to either override or add myself as an assessor, there were grade changes within the clusters of  grades given, grades received when I inserted my self (or multiple selves, depending on weight assigned). I think students may be satisfied if their individual grades go up, and not down. I realize that there may be settings in the grade book to block visibility of the evolving grades. That is a juggling act, as I have not wanted to delay grade visibility for the majority of students who completed work early or on time.",

So I emailed some of the very early 'early birds' to ask if they would agree to reviewing an extra student, so that all persons who wanted to complete the assignment ahead of time would be able to do so. I am teaching RN-BSN, and the course is totally online. Most of the students work 12 hour shifts, in clusters of days, so when they get to course work, I like for them to be able to move on with the work, instead of having to wait. Next, not sure if I understood properly, but if you have had 12 Workshops, how are you dealing with the Assessment grade (grading grade)? I also have set Workshop for each student to grade 3 other students. I have 2 cases where the grader was correct, but the other two graders in the cluster gave inflated grades and failed to recognize poor work. So the correct grader got severely penalized (possibly a letter grade, not sure yet, but looks like it could be), while the incorrect graders got nice, high assessment grades! So I went through trials and tribulations, added myself as grader and overweighted my self (a lot, to count myself as 8 or 12 persons)!, and/or overrode the low grader's correct grade to an incorrect, but fairer, high grade. For this, my 1st Workshop, I did not override the incorrect high grader's grade to a correct lower grade, in fear of appeals and law suits, given that Moodle does not provide a formula/specification/algorithm that can be explained to colleagues, students, lawyers, etc.",

We find the possibilities of this module very impressive especifically the possibility to grade the grading process. We had a search about the grading algorithms because we wanna give explanations about it to students. We wanna use the accumulative evaluation that is described by the following formula : http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Workshop_2.0_specification#Accumulative In this formula, the grade is computed based on a ratio composed of - the grade given by the student for one criteria as numerator; - the maximum grade given by all students for that criteria as denominator. We think such ratio will encourage students to give high scores (while giving 100% to all peers ensures them to have 100% as evaluators). Intuitively, we would prefer de denominator to be the mean or median grade among all students given grades. What do you think about it ? Is there a scientific justification for the choice of the maximum value ? Are there other options for this formula based on scientific argumentation ? Finally, if we wanna tune the formula, in which file do we have to make the change ? Thanks in advance for answer, Zabelle",

Firstly, the Accumulative grading strategy (with up-to-date docs available at http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Workshop_grading_strategies#Accumulative_grading_strategy ) determines how the grade for submission is calculated. It has nothing to do with the grade for assessment. The formula describes how the grade for submission is calculated from the filled assessment form. It is a standard formula for weighted mean. The denominator is the sum of weights of all aspects in the form (or, if they all have the same weight equal to 1, their count), not a maximum grade given by all students, as you say. Also, I can't agree with your conclusion that students are encouraged to give high scores. The grading evaluation method \"Comparison with the best assessment\" (documented at http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Using_Workshop#Grade_for_assessment ) gives high grade for those assessments that are closer to a \"common sense\" which itself is determined as the mean of all received assessments. In any case, you are free to implement your own grading evaluation method in as a subplugin and use it in your courses. The Moodle plugins directory already contains one such alternative. For the reference, let me point you to another thread in this forum where the calculation of grades for assessments was discussed.",

Mostly, I had each student grade three other students, due to information from hours, days, weeks and months of searching in Moodle, eventually to find that's what Moodle demands in order to calculate an assessment grade. So, within each correct student's set of co-graders, the other two graders graded higher, but not as well. But the incorrect graders' scores clustered together, such that whatver Moodle is doing with these grades, the correct grader was outdistanced, and got a harsh 'grading grade'. Due to the extreme difficulty of finding answers, and the trial and error nature of implementing Workshop, I am now resorting to additional trial and error, to add my own assessment, give it a substantial weight, such as 8 or 12, making me equivalent to 8 or 12 persons! And/or overriding the assessment grade, such that the resulting grading grade is incorrect for the criteria, but such that the correct student grader's assessment grade is near to the an appropriate numeric value.  I have NOT yet tried to override the poor graders' assessment grades downward, because there are more of them, and I would be incoherrent in a court of law, trying to explain how these grades were determined by Moodle. Actually, I would be able to explain what I did, but I doubt that irate students and/or their parents and lawyers would acquiesce. At this point in time, I have 2/19 students with this issue. One of those had an additional issue, with correct grading of one Aspect of the assignment, but incorrectly harsh grading of the other Aspect of the assignment. So I had lots of trial and error, added my own assessment, and overweighted my own assessment, until the harsly graded student's grade came up to a better numerical value. Hmm, have there been any law suits involving faculty, universities, and Moodle due to Moodle computation of Workshop assessment grades? Is there any specification, algorithm, or, in my words, formula or set of formulas, since 2009, for Moodle 2.4.4?",

IMHO the Workshop has a great educational potential and when the UI is improved (made more usable, intuitive), it will not be more difficult to use than the other modules. Regarding the attached comment: the branch is about \"bias\" and \"reliability\" settings as described in Using Moodle, chapter 6. The sentence says that that these settings actually make the calculation masked. So the goal is to rethink their meaning and value. AFAIK these two settings were already modified (merged?) since 1.6.

          "Text": "Dear David, thank you for taking on this task. I have always found the workshop quite interesting and there is still no other CMS that has a comparable feature. But to be quite frank, I gave up using it after two or three tries because I found it too complicated. This was quite a while ago, so I can only tell you in an abstract way what I found so hard back then. First, I remember that I found it hard to tell the different phases of a workshop apart and set an appropriate time frame. Maybe a first step would be to not force teachers to set all the due dates in the first menu. I would tend to just write the basic objectives an some meta data on the 2st page (Title, description etc.) and then think about all the due dates as I am setting up the exercise and the criteria. Secondly, as others have mentioned, the grading was not really transparent to me. I am pretty sure an easy-to-use graphical representation of the way a grade is calculated on the basis of the current setting would be great (for example a pie chart that changes as soon as you change settings?). The third problem may be something that just may not be something that can be solved or that maybe even I did not get, so bear with me if I am writing nonsense now: I got the impression that the workshop module needs a sort of critical mass of students in order to function properly. If you have really small classes of, say, 6 students, the workshop module does not have all the functions I would need. One example: In a small class, for example, it makes more sense to me if the teacher says who assesses what rather than refer this task to an algorithm. In a way, this would be a simplification because the teacher makes simple decisions just like he would in a groupwork situation in a classroom. But again, maybe the module does things which I did not get. Sorry for this lack of precision in my comments but I guess I can put this all in a nutshell by saying: I would put much more work into the user interface than into functionality. Most of the teachers I know are fascinated by the workshop module but quickly give up once they see all the options and the way that settings and results are displayed. Good luck for your programming efforts, if you need a look at a prototype by an interested user, let me know. By the way, where do I find the mind map that Ray is talking about? Best regards Peter",

Let me quickly reply. > because I found it too complicated Well, the module is quite advanced and it is intended for teachers with at least minimal experience with the Assignment module and Gradebook. I'll try to do my best to prepare the UI as intuitive as possible. But the complexity is a tax for the power of Workshop. It is something similar to the Quiz module. There are lot of settings, too. However, after some time (and thanks to Olli's and Tim's good job!) teachers become quite familiar with it, right? > set an appropriate time frame The default behaviour will be manually switching phases - see the mockup of the mod_form in spec. Workshop will notice teacher something like \"All students have submitted their work, you can now move to the assessment phase\". There is an advance setting for more experienced teachers to move to the next phase automatically based on the scheduled deadlines. > grading was not really transparent to me There are some great proposals in this thread how to make the calculation clear. Still, however, automatic calculation of a grade for assessment is non-trivial. Please see the spec in the wiki to read more about it and tell me if it makes sense to you. > small classess IMO the problem is not with the number of students in a course. I had quite succesful workshop with 12 students. To reveal the real potential of the Workshop, you just need to have enough peer-assessments per submission to get the relevant grade for assessment calculated. But still, you can switch peer assessment off (to use just the grading forms) or to increase the weight of teacher's assessments so it supplies the quantity of peers (for example, set the weight of teacher's assessment to 2 and having 1 peer assessment per submission gives you 3 grades per work. Teacher's ones are considered as a reference assessment in this case. Again, see the spec for details). And also, the manual allocation of submissions for review and adjustments to random allocation will be possible.",

The rest should be pretty clear as the final grade is just a sum of grade for submission (which in turn is the average from all peer assessments) and grade for assessments (the average of all grades for assessments). Weight of teacher assessment can be easily understood - just imagine there are several reviewers giving the same grade (so weight 2 causes that the assessment is counted twice). I am not going to change how the grade for assessment (also known as grading grade) is calculated. I'll try, however, to describe and visualise it somehow so teacher can possibly explain it to students (or, at least they can pretend they actually understand it kidding). If anybody reading this thread would find a minute to read the spec part regarding the calculation , it would help. TIA",

          "Text": "This above posting was 2009, over 4 years ago! I have spent days and hours, trying to find answers related to the Moodle Workshop. By trial and error, I have implemented Workshop in real courses, with aggregated grading. The assignment (a poster, with two aspects): 1) the poster itself worth 20 points, and 2) Citations, worth 5 points. I finally understand that each 'aspect' grade is converted to %/100. The aspects had equal weights, I eventually was able to track and tally how Moodle calculated the submission grade. However, there is no sensible explanation for how Moodle calculates the assessment grade, and I certainly can not find a coherrent explanation to share with colleagues or students. Indeed, I have found nothing later than 2009 in this matter. Well, perhaps a few bits and pieces, but from links to tech support at various universities, such that the tech support is possible only for insiders at the specific universities. It took about two months to get hypothetical students in a hypothetical course so that I could attempt Workshop before implementing it in a real course. The main priority for me is the calcualtion of the assessment grade (grading grade).  I have found this page http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Workshop_2.0_specification . However the html text formatting and syntax of the formulas for the assessment grade need more punctuation to set of the hierarchy steps, what goes with what, for me. For example, please translate: $ sumdiffs = 0 ; $ sumweights = 0 ; for each assessment dimension $sumdiffs   += ((bestgrade - peergrade) * dimensionweight / maxpossiblescore) ^ 2; $sumweights += dimensionweight; Please explain $... and +, In addition, the inconsistency of Moodle language is a huge, time-consuming, nuisance. For example,  (by the way, I deplore the slopply formatting within this html or google.doc style of word processing, which adds extra spacing for line breaks - I would prefer a visually pleasing and logical formatting in an uploaded document, oh I see, a box below this box, for attachments...) What is the syntax and meaning for symbols in the excerpt below. WHAT IS DIMENSION below?  Do you mean Aspects, in Workshop? Or something else? $variance = 0 for each assessment dimension if stdev > 0.05 then $variance += ((mean - grade) * (weight / stdev))^ 2 The file I want to attach below is too big. What I need to see can not likely fit in one of these boxes.  Is there a course, or place to get answers for 2.4.4. This box refers to 2.0! Maybe I'll try another post, with pasted excerpts, but then, when I paste them into this type of box, the formatting is lost to tml or whatever is formatting within this box, such that it is extremely visually unappealing.",

Once you have all of them completed (as are those three in the attached picture), switch the workshop into the next phase as Mary suggests. Students will be able to submit their work. And once all of them have their work submitted, you can allocate them and switch the workshop into the next phase again. In other words, as long as you have the workshop in the initial Setup phase, don't try to have tasks from other phases completed. I can see what confused you as the Allocate submissions was the only not completed task in this workshop. But that is just a coincidence. It seems there are no real users enrolled into the course yet (expected: 0) and so the Workshop considers all tasks done even if nothing was actually done yet (eg. in the Grading evaluation phase).",

Each one doing just its job: If automatic phase switching is enabled then the Workshop will switch to the assessment phase automatically after the submission deadline. Just that. If the scheduled allocation is explicitly enabled at the Scheduled allocation method page then it will automatically allocate submissions for assessment after the submission deadline. Just that. So yes, you can set automatic switching only. But then all what happens is that you would find the Workshop in the assessment phase with no submissions allocated. And vice versa. You can enable just the scheduled allocator - so you would find the Workshop still in the submission phase but with submissions allocated. Apparently, using the combination of both features is what you want to do in 99% of cases. Still we follow the general principle \"do one thing and do it well\" when developing subplugins for Workshop so that's why it is done as it is now. HTH",

I log in as teacher, I create 2 groups of students (Group 01: stud01, stud02; Group 02: stud03, stud04), and then I create the workshop activity, with the following main settings: grading settings --> accumulative grading feedback --> disabled example submissions --> use examples and examples must be assessed before own submission common module settings --> visible show; group mode: visible groups. 2. In the \"Setup phase\" I edit the assessment form (I use a customized scoring scale for grading) AND I change this permission from the workshop administration panel: View authors name --> X students (students are disabled). 3. I prepare the example submission, then back again to edit setting from the workshop administration panel and I check Availability to make sure the activity is open for submission and for assessment. 4. I open \"Submission phase\". 5. I log out. 6. I log in as student (stud01) and click \"Assess\" in the \"Example submissions to assess\" box. 7. I assess the example submission and click \"Save and close\". 8. Error! I click \"Continue\" and the system sends me to the main page. As further information, I can say that in the db - with particular reference to the table \"mdl_workshop_assessments\" - I see some data are saved (in particular, some of the fields (such as id, submissionid, reviewerid, weight, timecreated, timemodified, grade) display a value. Here some information about the hosting instance where I run this last test (which is a local host ): OS: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64-bit XAMPP Version: 1.8.1 Apache 2.4.3 MySQL 5.5.27 PHP 5.4.7 A fresh installation of Moodle 2.5.2+ (Build: 20130927) I attach again the screenshot with the error. Hope this help. Thank you very much for your interest.",

If you are happy to upgrade your site without workshops, you can uninstall the whole Workshop module in 1.9 before you start upgrade. Note that it will drop all workshop data, tables etc. Alternatively, please help us to debug this behaviour. Just after you replace Moodle source code files with the new version - but before you actually start the upgrade procedure - please go and edit the file mod/workshop/db/upgrade.php. Find a line near 60 reading \n```text\n//===== end of 1.9.0 upgrade line ======//\n```\n and insert the following code right after it: \n```text\nif ($oldversion &lt; 2007101510) {\n    die('Upgrade procedure halted before mod_workshop turn');\n}\n```\n Now go and run upgrade.

          "Text": "This is not a bug. As it has been described in the docs as well as answered in forums, it's important to realize that in the Accumulative strategy, the actual maximum grade for each aspect does not influence its weight. So both aspects in your setup have the same weight (as both have it set to \"1\"). The final grade is calculated as an arithmetic mean of them. For example in the first assessment, given grades for aspect 1 and aspect 2 are 4/4 and 5/6, respectively.

Let us imagine the following scenario: Alice submits her essay. The essay is allocated to Bob, Cindy and Dan for assessment. All three reviewers fill the assessment form (say a rubric) The teacher switches the workshop into the grading evaluation phase and (which would have to be added to the current workshop code), Alice has a chance to see the reviews and rate them. Now, let us say that Alice fully accepts Bob's assessment, partially agrees with Cindy's assessment and completely disagrees with Dan's review. How would she express this? Using a scale? Or percentage \"acceptance\" level? And then, how exactly would this \"acceptance\" influence grades that Bob, Cindy and Dan get for the assessment? Let us imagine that the teacher uses the \"Comparison with the best assessment\" evaluator. That would calculate grades, for example: Bob 100%, Cindy 100% and Dan 42%. Now, how these grades should get amended? I am asking for some formula or exact description. It sounds like an interesting feature, really. But we need it specified into a deeper details.",

The model we are trying to support here uses a rubric and a 5 point scale for both the peer assessment of submitted work (assessment 1- 50% of the grade) and assessment of feedback ( assessment 2- 50% of the grade) Currently this translates 0-5 into a percent when displaying a final mark. 0 = 0% 1 = 20% 2 = 40% 3 = 60% 4 = 80% 5 = 100% So in your scenario above, Bob would receive 100% from Alice, Cindy would receive maybe 40% from Alice, and Dan would receive 0. These values would have to be calculated back to form part of the Bob, Cindy, and Dan's  assessment 2. If feels so \"almost there\" but maybe I'm just an optimist. Thanks for any further thoughts.

If they could upload their assignments and make them accessible to others in their class, I think students would enjoy this feature for commenting on each other’s work. Any suggestions? I know there is a Workshop activity designed for peer assessment but using uploadpdf would be more interactive and even enjoyable for them. I have used Moodle Forums in the past where students share their assignments in Word format and use Word’s comment feature for annotation but this UploadPDF would be far better. Any suggestions would be great. It would even be more amazing if UploadPDF was usable within the workshop activity but I doubt that is feasible. Any and all feedback on this welcome! Thank you",

I want to know if using the Workshop activity, and a group uploads a submission, can individual students from other groups assess the uploaded submission. E.g. Groups A-E - one person submits on behalf of the group Total people - 20, Total Submissions for activity - 4 So participants #1-4  (in Group A) provides peer assessment on Group B (#1), Group E (#2), Group C (33), Group D (#4) Or do all of Group A have to provide peer assessment on another Group?

You can mimic the behaviour as you say - by having a \"speaker\" in each group that submits their work on behalf of the whole group. You can let either individual members or speakers only to perform the peer-assessment then. The group mode affects how the Random allocation method works. In separate groups mode, reviewers are picked from the same group only. In visible groups mode, the Random allocator tries to pick reviewers from as many groups as possible. And you can always manually amend allocations via the Manual allocation method. HTH",

Also, be ware that you will probably need to pay attention to grades before you close the workshop. During the grading evaluation phase, final grades for submissions will be calculated.

          "Text": "Hi David, Not trying to hijack Ruben's thread, but thought info about Moodle 2.4 would be nice to add. I just recently started using the Workshop module again and just realized from Ruben's question that being able to add audio and video into a workshop would be perfect for what I am trying to teacher right now. So...I was trying it when your suggestion about the Algebra filter hit my inbox. I don't think turning off the filters will fix it...at least it doesn't for me in the Workshop activity for Moodle 2.4.3+ (Build: 20130405). I have tried flv, mp3, and mp4 files and they will all play in the Insert Moodle Media window prior to the actual insert. With my filter on (PoodLL), the player shows, but when clicked, nothing happens. When I turn off all the filters, it shows whichever filename I have inserted, but as soon as you click the filename, the message \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found More information about this error\" along with a continue button, shows up. I have even double-checked all the moodledata folder permission to make sure they were all still set to correctly...they were. I don't have time tonight, but I will compare results in my other Moodle installs tomorrow evening. (2.2, 2.3, and 2.5) Hoping for a quick and easy fix, AL",

          "Text": "Joe, I think that this situation may be the result a common misconception by new moodle system admins. It's tempting to configure Moodle to emulate the roles that individuals have in the school. So a teacher logs in and gets the teacher role and a student the student role, right? But Moodle does not (and cannot) work that way. A Moodle 'teacher' is a user with the 'editingteacher' role within a course -- that user may be a Teacher in the school or she may in fact be a student depending upon circumstances. So once you as a user click on a course your role changes to the role which is assigned to you in that course (teacher, student or whatever). Thus there needs to be a 'neutral' role for any user account (apart from the moodle administrator) before a user enters a course. This role is called 'Authenticated User' and in 99% of all cases should be the default role in the Moodle system. Here's what the Roles Settings documentation says: Default role for all users The default role for all users should normally be set to Authenticated user . If it is set to Student then the result is that all students are enrolled on all courses. Note: The default role for all users should never be set to Guest . Once this has been set site-wide (and the doc link above gives details of how to do this) all your student enrollment problems will go away. It's a bit mind bending at first but as you play with roles you'll find that they are marvellously flexible. Clear as mud? Mark",

          "Text": "I last used Moodle Workshop in version 1.3 and I'm now helping a teacher use it in 2.3 10 years later From what I remember and have read recently, the workshop module is predicated on every student submitting a digital response which is then graded by a random set of other students. But what I (and Paula Clough) need to do is to have all students assess (via a rubric) a class presentation by a single student. This necessitates a different workflow. Student #1 makes 15 minute presentation on subject. 5 mins for questions during this presentation the whole class (including teacher) uses the rubric either interactively in the moodle workshop if network bandwidth permits or on paper. Student #2 makes her 15 min presentation with 5 mins for comments. again, this is assessed anonymously. Teacher wraps up class session. Very soon after the class students who have recorded their assessments on paper enter these into the workshop activity. Teacher gives his assessment and wraps up the grade Grade and feedback available to 2 student presenters I'm thinking that should create a separate Workshop activity for each of these student presentation class sessions otherwise they won't see any results until all the students in the class have made their presentation. Is it possible to configure the Workshop activity to accept just 2 student 'sumbissions' (though they won't actually submit anything) and have the whole class of students evualte these? Any other hints about configuring the Workshop activity that might helpful would be gratefully received.",

          "Text": "Hi Mark, and welcome back to the Workshop users world I believe you will be able to use the Workshop module for your use case. Yes, better to create one Workshop instance per each session. Presenters have to \"submit\" something. Why not to ask them to just put the name of their presentation into the submission title and eventually an outline of it as a submission text (which can be empty though, as you wish). This should happen at the beginning of the session. Once both presenters have submitted their work, switch the workshop into the assessment phase. Now you need to allocate these two submissions to all others to assess. Unfortunately I have not finished the \"Mass allocation\" subplugin yet (that would be easy to do via it). But you can use the Random allocation subplugin for this as well. Just set the number of required assessments per submission high enough so the allocator will actually assign each submission to all students. Just after the Student #2 finishes their presentation, switch the workshop into the Grading evaluation phase. Calculate the grades, check them and close the workshop. Additionally, it might be a good idea to group all these session workshops into a single category in the gradebook. Then set the aggregation for this category in a way that the aggregated grade for the category is the maximum from all grade items (i.e. workshops). This will effectively lead to the state where all students have a grade calculated for this category (so it will appear in a single column in the gradebook) regardless the particular workshop instance they presented their work at. Please let us know how it went!",

The allocator tries hard to produce balanced results but that is not always possible. As Leon suggests, if it is more important for you to have the same amount of work for each student, you may wish to prefer fixed number per reviewer (but then, some submissions may get assessed three times and some just once, for example). It really depends on whether you prefer equal workload for your students or equal amount of feedback per submission. Also note that the group mode affects this. In Visible groups mode, the allocator tries to pick reviewers from as many groups as possible. And that is probably why you get these results if the number of members are not equal across groups.

We (I'm working with another instructor) went with per submission so that the work would be distributed evenly amongst those in a group who submitted a paper to review (so a student who did not submit a paper would not be reviewing any papers). The groups (each group represents a tutorial of about 16 or 17 students; the course is set up in forced separate group mode) are separate to make it easier for the teaching assistants to assign participation marks for the reviews. It's not a problem for a reviewer to get more than two reviews back on an assignment, but it would be a problem for a reviewer to only have one review to do. (Each reviewer submitted only one assignment.) It sounds like everything is working as it should, then. By the way, this is our first term using Workshop - it's a great feature.",

Several classes use the same workshop.  Peer assessment needs to take place within that class.  Classes rarely run back to back.  Students in one class are sometimes absent thus submit/assess late.  In the old system, we just opened up the dates so that 'start submitting' and 'start assessing' were sometime in the 70's and the 'end of submissions' and 'end of assessment' was the lastest possible year (2020 IFAIK).  That meant that anyone could submit any time.  When they did, it was passed straight through to the assessor. We the new version, we find that we are constantly flipping workshops between submit and assess depending on what exact stage that class are at.  Even worse if you do happen to have two classes using the same workshop at the same time, but at different stages. What am I missing here?  Or have I the wrong tool for the job? Thanks, Geedle.",

As I understand your scenario correctly, the peer-assessment takes place within the class only, right? So there is no \"cross-class\" assessment. In that case you may want to consider creating separate instances (copies) of the Workshop for each class. Each Workshop would have its deadlines set individually as needed. You may want to use such a setup together with the group-members-only feature so that students in each class see just their workshop and not the other copies.",

          "Text": "I've been using the Workshop module for a half term now and I'm incredibly confused about how it assigns assessment grades to the pupils. For example: I've assessed a student's submission and assigned my own assessment a weight of 16 so it gets chosen as the best, which it does and I am awarded full marks (50 in this case). 6 other students have also assessed the piece of work. I would expect any student who gave it the same mark as me to score 50, with the marks decreasing the further from my assessment score they went. This does not happen. The list of marks looks like this: 21(50)@16 - me 26(24) - student 1 27(46) - student 2 21(46) - student 3 21(50) - student 4 29(40) - student 5 24(49) - student 6 The Workshop Module awarded this piece of work 22. Students 2 and 3 both awarded 21, but got different assessment scores. Student 2 gave a very different mark compared to all the others and got the second best mark. There seems to be no pattern at all; what on Earth is going on here?",

Therefore the evaluation plugin compares individual criteria rather than the final grade. See https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=153268#p670406 for more details. Also note that it is actually student 4 who got the full mark as well - I would expect that their assessment is the same as yours and therefore they get 50 too. Then student 6 will have a slightly different one, still giving them 49. And so on. Look at the assessment by student 1 in more details. You should realize that even their assessment led to the grade 26 (compared to the grade 21 based on your assessment), it will be probably very different from yours when it comes to comparing individual aspects (dimensions) of the submission.

          "Title": "I'm upgrading the AJAX Marking block: which workshop submissions should be listed as unmarked work?",
          "Text": "Hi all. I'm upgrading the AJAX Marking Block to better support core modules, but I'm not sure under what conditions I should make unmarked workshop submissions show up for the new workshop in 2.x. At the moment it finds any submissions in workshops that are not closed, where you have not assessed them yourself. Is this enough to cover all use cases? Things I need to work out: Are there use cases where you (the teacher) would not do an assessment at all? Do you want to see new submissions during the submission phase so that you can then allocate them to assessors? In the grading evaluation phase, will it be useful to have a single pop-up of some sort per submission (as per all other items in the AJAX marking block), or is it best to just have a link to the main workshop page as happens at the moment. The normal mode of operation for the AJAX MArking block is to remove stuff that needs attention as it's dealt with so that your 'total to mark' gets lower. Is there any indicator (or combination of indicators) for submissions in the grading evaluation phase that would show that you are happy witht the grade? I get the impression that just leaving the automatic grade calculation in place is often the way things are done. If there's no way to tell, I could make a single-submission popup grading interface that would offer the option to mark the automatic submission grade as OK (using a separate DB table) so that it would be removed from the total to mark and you could keep track. Would this be useful? All thoughts and comments appreciated!",

          "Text": "Hi Matt. Thanks for your contribution. I believe that the Real Teachers using Workshop module will provide you with valuable feedback on how they use it in their classes. I'm just adding my point of view here. I would personally expect that only submissions explicitly allocated to the current $USER are displayed in the block. It seems that in most workshops, teachers do not assess all submissions (for various reasons, typically because there are just too many of them). They just pick some of them randomly. Note the list of submissions can become really long - dozens of submissions are not an exception. What about just some stats (number of expected vs number of already submitted) in the same way as the Workshop planner tool provides? Leaving this for others to comment on, no personal opinion here. Correct, there is no \"lock\" feature at the moment where the teacher would mark the calculated grade as correct. The idea is that the teacher evaluates the assessments until they are happy and then they just leave the grades as-is and switch to the Close phase (in which moment, grades are written into the Gradebook). If there was a demand for this feature, I would rather see it implemented natively in the Workshop (eg. via tagging or a flag in mdl_workshop_submissions table). Let us see.",

          "Title": "Using Workshop for repetitive workflows",
          "Text": "I've been using Workshop for a couple of semesters now, but this summer is my first really intensive use of the newly designed module. I'm relatively familiar with the features but have been re-reading the documentation to fine-tune my understanding. In re-reading the section on \"grading strategies,\" I saw in the section on Comments that it talks about using Workshop for repetitive workflows: first draft of a paper just gets comments, for example. Then, as I understand it, I move the workshop back to submission phase, possibly changing the grading strategy to Rubric or Accumulative Grading, and then run the workshop again. Am I understanding this correctly so far? My main question is this: if I wish to \"document\" the work done on an assignment, is it wise to use repetitive workflows? Does resetting things wipe out the prior assessment work done? If students resubmit a revised draft, does that overwrite the previous draft? On the one hand, it would be nice to use one Workshop for an entire assignment, but what I have been doing is to use Workshop for the rough draft stage (using Rubric and Accumulative Grading as my preferred strategies--still deciding which I like best), and then creating a separate Assignment for them to submit their final draft, which only I grade--using a rubric that I've created for that Assignment. This has worked pretty well for me, and I do have a record of both the rough draft they submitted (and its assessments) as well as the final draft of the same paper. I'm curious if anyone has tried combining these steps into a single Workshop, or if anyone has tips on how they've used Workshop in assignment sequences.",

This way, the workshop will be available only to users who are members of the grouping's groups. However, if you want to allow, say, submitting to some groups only (while the other group would do the assessment, for example), there is no easy way to do it. You would need to locally overwrite permissions for all the users who are not in the \"authors\" group and prevent them from submitting. HTH",

The user interface may be a bit unusual at the beginning. However, I think it presents all relevant information in an understandable way once you realize how it works. I have prepared a screencast of the user interface . I would like to hear some feedback from the community. The similar UI layout could be used consistently in the whole module.

The same reasoning applies to \"Allow peer assessment without own submission\".

In the allocator settings mini-form, teacher could set that they want to sort pull-down menus items either by name or by the number of per-user allocation. So, if a teacher is using the tool to manually allocate submissions because she knows that Mary should not assess work by Juana, she would use \"sort by names\" mode. On the other hand, if the teacher needs to find a reviewer(s) with the lowest number of assigned work, she would switch to \"sort by number of allocations\" mode.",

I agree we must be able to produce them somehow so they can be post-processed statistically. However, we must provide a general solution for all types of the grading forms in the Workshop. What I was thinking about was a unified format that would output the filled grading forms data as normalized values. What all grading forms have in common (regardless whether it is Rubric, Accumulative or whatever) is that they all consists of a set of assessment dimensions. The filled assessment is internally converted to a value from 0 to 100%. We could generate such report. So while data for the filled rubric would contain columns with values like 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00 (in case of a rubric with 5 columns), the Number of errors (Error banded in 1.x) would produce just one column with either 0.00 or 1.00 - depending on what the reviewer (grader) said.",

So on Moodle 2.1.1 I gave it a shot with my class of 25 students.  It was a much better experience. Issues: Comparison with the Teacher Assessment Example: I had about six criteria on my rubric.  It was annoying for students to constantly move the scrollbar up and down to compare my marks with theirs.  Would be better if they were put side by side. Workaround: None. Missing the original question. Students wanted to go back and have the original question/problem to refer to, but this is gone once the workshop shifts into the assessment phase. Workaround: Students can be required to copy the original question into their submission. Grading: From a students/parents perspective: What if you had five idiots giving you a low score (when in fact you were correct)?  Then since they all agreed, they would get high marks and you would get low ones.  Basically I need a way to give a final grade to all students and then these idiot peer reviewers get slammed for grading poorly.  Is this possible?",

The solution might be to have a button at the top of the page switching between the horizontal and vertical layout (dynamically via JavaScript + CSS only). Can you please report such a feature request into the tracker so that we do not forget it? re 2: This is intentional. If the original question (ie workshop assignment) is important for assessment, copy it into the instructions for assessment field in the workshop setting. re 3: There are actually several ways how the teacher's input may influence the assessment - see the workshop module doc page for details. Shortly, you can: Modify weights of student's assessment. Eg if you increase the weight of the student who is right in your example, his/her vote will be as strong as the sum of votes of those five idiots. Alternatively you can set their weight to zero to effectively ignore them; Override the total calculated grade within the workshop so it pushes your manually set grade into the gradebook instead the one calculated; Provide your own assessment, possibly with the higher weight set Override the grade pushed into the gradebook p.s. Even if they know those five are idiots, teachers should always think twice why five people agreed versus the only one was right (in the teacher's opinion). Maybe the students did not understand something, instructions were confusing etc. Such situation should always be considered as a valuable feedback for the teacher.",

After using the Workshop several times, I've realized that the most important factor is a well written grading rubric.   \"Was the color of the person green?\" is better than \"Did the person look good?\" The Workshop module is awesome for two reasons: Saves teacher from hours of grading. Forces students to review concepts. Forces students who didn't do well to look at the correct answer over and over again. The only problem now is how to set the due dates.  I have students who miss days of school, so I have to wait a long time before I can set the workshops to assessment mode.",

It might be solvable via a new setting \"Automatically embed attached images\". At the moment, Workshop automatically embeds them (like Forum does). If you think it might be useful for others too, please report it as a new feature request. The alternative solution (which I would actually prefer) is a general in-core (ie not Workshop specific) feature that big images would be automatically scaled to a preview-sized version like eg MediaWiki does. Such a feature might be useful for other places dealing with images (Forum, Assignment). Chances are it is already reported.",

Someone should probably assess late submissions - meaning that they have to be allocated for assessment. But once you allow extra time for submitting, you must allow extra time for assessment. And because we need all assessments done for the calculation of final grades, late submissions effectively block all workshop participants...

          "Text": "This is a request for your comments on a proposal to change how Workshop integrates into the course Gradebook. In the current version, the calculated grade for submission and grade for assessment are summarized and pushed as a single grade into the gradebook (well, it does not work due to a reported bug at the moment, but it does not matter now). Since the time the Workshop appeared, the course Gradebook was improved in many ways. One of its not very well known features is that a module instance can actually push more than one grade items into the gradebook. As far as I know, no module uses this feature (if we do not count outcomes). I propose a change in the behaviour so that workshop publish both grade for submission and grade for assessment as separated grade items in the gradebook (leading to two columns in the report). Such a solution has some significant pros: teachers can choose their own way on how to deal with these two workshop grades - for example, the grade for assessment can be considered as extra credit teachers can calculate things like an average grade for submission across all workshop in the course etc. teachers can easily deal with missing grades in individual cases - it est they can exclude the low grade for submission for a student who was ill and joined the Workshop workflow later in the assessment phase only. The Gradebook already has the logic implemented. The only con I can see at the moment is, if a teacher requires the legacy behaviour (the workshop total grade = grade for submission + grade for assessment), an extra step is needed: a special category in the gradebook must be created containing the two workshop grades, with an aggregation method set to Sum of grades (see the attached screenshot). I plan to release the first testable version of the workshop next week. Your early comments are welcome therefore d.",

For example, forums can be graded in a p2p way but without the capabilities of workshop. And we can remove from the workshop the way the users submit their work and only focus on the way we grade them. The evaluation form is a great think, but why only for workshops? I use forums and wikis, and I like students to rate their colleages, but ... wikis don't allow this and forums have a simple web2.0 tool that allows to rate the best posts... So, First I like your idea that the workshop provides many results and the teacher can manage them in the gradebook and both, teacher and student see in the gradebook the way the final grade is obtained But I also would like to apply the workshop grading capabilities to any of the activities ... any, even maybe new kinds of activities, like blogs.",

Of course, this would be nice to have feature. But currenty, Moodle is pretty weak in the inter-module communication. The overall Moodle design is that it consists of a set of separate plugins. The plugins must work independently and they were never expected to exchange data massively. Anyway, I will keep this idea in mind. Thanks. d.",

The main Workshop setting form is independent on the current phase so you should have all settings available there. There is intentionally no way how to override the aggregated grade for assessment within the workshop. What you can do is to override a partial grade for a single assessment. But the overall grade for assessments is calculated as a mean of grades for all given assessments. Alternatively, you can override the grade in the course Gradebook once the grades are pushed there. There is no way how to publish all assessments at once at the moment. Because Workshop was considered as an advanced variant of the Assignment module, the submission is considered to be private. The publishing feature is there so the teacher can publish the exemplary work by individual students. If you want all submissions to be published, you may use some another module (like a Database or Forum) for submitting and use Workshop for the peer-assessment only (instead of providing full text, your student would submit just a link to their work submitted elsewhere at a public place). p.s. please create separate discussion thread per each issue, it will help to keep track of it.

For example, if someone needs a sophisticated way how to allocate submissions according to overall students' performance so that excellent students assess only other excellent students while poor students assess other students etc, they ccan develop their own allocation subplugin.

For example, you can let Random allocator do some initial random assignments and tweak it using the Manual allocation tool. Or vice versa, define several required allocations (like a teacher really wants to assess John's and Mary's submissions personally) and let all other being allocated randomly. Or, when the grades for assessment are calculated, the teacher is expected to iteratively play with the setting, changing the weights, overriding the calculated values etc. until they are happy with the overall result.

The workshop will have to stay in the Assessment phase however (because of the Workshop 2.0 design, certain actions can be done in certain phases only and the whole system relies on that). But your students will get a clear message that their assessments must be done before a given date while your teachers will be able to continue with assessing even after this deadline.",

That allocation plugin will appear as a third card next to Manual allocation and Random allocation and will be probably called Self allocation. It will allow the current user (that is usually a course teacher) to allocate all submissions to themselves in one click. And they could specify a weight for such assessments. That allocator would be useful for teachers who assess all submissions as a parallel to the peer assessments. So then you will be able to allocate all submissions to yourself with a weight say 4 in one click (instead of going thru the list of all submissions and clicking Assess this submission to create the allocation).",

In details, there are some orphaned grade records in your 1.9 workshop table that are not linked with any assessment. You can fix it by direct access to your database only. You should fix your database before you start the upgrade to 2.0. Of course, I assume it is still your test site and you have full backup of your production environment. Firstly, lauch your favourite MySQL client and run \n```text\nmysql> SELECT * FROM mdl_workshop_grades WHERE assessmentid IS NULL;\n```\n That will probably give you some results - those orphaned grades without the assessment. You can delete them with \n```text\nmysql> DELETE FROM mdl_workshop_grades WHERE assessmentid IS NULL;\n```\n That should not influence your workshops as the orphaned grades are not owned by any user.",

I have analysed your database and there are inconsistencies between workshop_grades and workshop_assessments tables. One of your assessment record was somehow removed but the linked grades remained and that threw the upgrade record. To find those orphaned grades record you can use \n```text\nSELECT g.id, g.assessmentid\nFROM mdl_workshop_grades g\nLEFT JOIN mdl_workshop_assessments a ON g.assessmentid = a.id\nWHERE a.id IS NULL;\n```\n and it will give you eight grade records that refer to a non-existing assessment. I am going to patch the upgrade code in workshop so that it handles this case as well. So either you can remove those grades manually or wait for tomorrow's Moodle 2.0 build to test again with. By the way, I have spotted yet another upgrade problem in MNet thanks to your dump - thank you for it!",

          "Text": "Hi, firstly make sure that you really need old workshops migrated to the 2.0 server . Many sites did not have any real workshops and then it is better to uninstall the workshop module from your 1.9 server before you start the upgrade. Anyway, the thrown problem indicates problems in your database integrity. Particularly, there are some workshop module instances without the corresponding course_module record. This might happen as a result of some problems with restoring a course in the past, for example. To make sure that is your case please run the following query at your 1.9 database (before the upgrade attempt) and let me know the result: \n```text\n    SELECT w.id,w.name,w.course\n      FROM mdl_workshop w\n LEFT JOIN mdl_course_modules cm\n           ON cm.module=(SELECT id FROM mdl_modules WHERE name='workshop') AND cm.instance=w.id\n     WHERE cm.id IS NULL;\n```",

Rather students do 3 to 4 assessments and there is a teacher assessment on student's paper where there is more than a 15 point spread between the highest assessment and the lowest assessment. In that case I do a teacher assessment. It means that when I go to calculate the final grade some students have teacher assessment and others do not. My understanding that the forumla calculating student's submission grade ignores the lack of a teacher assessment and the student grade would be, for example, the average of the 3 student assessments. And where there is a teacher assessment, is the average of the 3 student assessments and the teacher assessment - assuming that the teacher assessment is weighted the same as the student.

          "Text": "Thanks for the clarification. It's my understanding then that the faculty member shouldn't try to design a situation where their assessment is weighted with those of peer reviewers. Rather it seems far simpler to allow student peers to evaluate, and then as faculty to review and over-ride as judged appropriate with comment. This way the faculty member doesn't have to submit an essay or post of the assignment itself and then manually over-ride random allocations to be qualified as a rater for each class member. I can surely live with that! I wonder if there would ever be a way of rigging the system up to allow a manager or faculty member to 'submit' on behalf of students. I'm just thinking how one could use this tool for peer assessment of performance. In this case the trigger is not an essay or post, but something more along the lines of evaluating the person's contribution. If some stock words could comprise the submission, then assessment scales could be devised (support, teamwork, leadership,etc.) for offline performance assessment with all the virtues of considering the peer rating as well as the pattern of ratings.",

          "Text": "Hi Steve, faculty members do not need to submit their own work to be able to assess students' submissions. In Workshop 2.0, the teacher can assign herself as a reviewer of a work. I can even imagine a new allocation method (that is a third card at the Allocation page) that randomly picks N given submissions and allocates them to the current user (or any other given user). This way, workshop with 50 students could run in a classic peer-review mode and the teacher could just randomly pick 5 or 7 submissions to check. Submitting on behalf students is possible with the standard \"login as\" feature. However I think that the teacher can just ask all students to simply upload a very short information (like their team name or even their own name or so) just to register them in the workshop. And yes - you are right - since then, you can actually assess anything, not only the submission itself.",

          "Text": "Hi Caryl, I may have a suspicion what is going on here. In Workshop 1.x, whenever a submission is allocated to be reviewed by a peer (which is done automatically and nobody can control that much), a new assessment record is created in the database and its timecreated flag is set one year into the future to signalize that this assessment has not been completed yet by the peer. That is obviously very strange design. Unfortunately, Workshop 1.x code is full of such things and that is why it was rewritten completely from scratch for Moodle 2.0. Anyway back to your problem. I think that after the year the workshop suddenly finds these assessment records and it considers them as assessed because the time created is not in the future any more. So it sends the email to the author that their submission has been assessed even though nobody even started to assess the work. Can you please confirm that this explanation would fit your case? Can you check the dates to see if it happened one year later after the workshop?",

Then find the lines \n```text\n// Find all workshop notifications that have yet to be mailed out, and mails them\n$cutofftime = $timenow - $CFG-&gt;maxeditingtime;\n```\n near line 181 and add \"return true;\" below them so the code reads \n```text\n// Find all workshop notifications that have yet to be mailed out, and mails them\n$cutofftime = $timenow - $CFG-&gt;maxeditingtime;\nreturn true;\n```\n Be ware - by this way, no emails will be sent by workshop any more - even those that would be correct submission/assessment reminders.",

As I discussed before it is needed so that the post submission assessment form can have more detail in order to assure a \"more accurate\" assessment by the peer. But of course such detail would give away the problem. For the last four years, we have had to modify every workshop assessment form twice. at the beginning of the assignment and before assessment. I can see that has changed in moodle 2.0. If it was not \"fixed\" can you move it high on the agenda for 2.1.",

          "Text": "Oh, I'm sorry Vernellia - I must have missed your post somehow! Yes, I remember this feature request. As I said before, it basically depends on whether you use the same strategy for both forms or not. If you use one strategy for the first form (eg comments) and another strategy for the second form (eg accumulative), you can prepare them in advance already. Workshop supports strategy switching so that you can use one form to assess example submissions and then switch the strategy. If you use the same strategy for both example submissions assessments and peer submissions assessments, you have to modify the assessment form during the workshop run. Workshop can not hold two instances of the same type assessment form at the moment (like one Choice does not support two different sets of selection items). So you have to modify the assessment form after the example submissions are assessed. Alternatively, you could use two workshop instances - one for the pre-submission assessment and the second for the real one. Sorry, I can't promise any specific fix version for your request. But I would like to address it in some future version, for sure. It is clear that workshop will need some better management of assessment forms. At first, export/import functionality is needed (imho) to allow re- usability of assessment forms in other workshops. We may even think of sort of Assessment forms bank like Question bank we have. I hope that would help you with your issue, too.",

I understand that it can do a number of things, including peer-assessment, self-assessment, rubric assessment, often in combination with each other. One application we are hoping to use it for is straight rubric marking, without necessarily involving student assessment. However, when I try to simulate this situation, there seems to be a few screens that are expecting the peer assessment to have been turned on (even though I had it unticked). For instance, there is the 'Override mark' screen, which is really meant to be the teacher overriding the student-assessed mark. However, this shouldn't be visible, as the teacher would only be overriding their own mark in my situation! Also, if I change the assessment split from 80/20 to 100/0, then go through the motions of assessment as a teacher, the grade doesn't seem to flow through to the gradebook - only zeros are given. So, I guess I'm just wondering if I'm misunderstanding something. Is the workshop module flexible enough to NOT utilise the peer/self assessment component and still work? I fully understand the benefits of having the peer assessment component (I'm not saying it is not worth using), I'm just wondering about using the workshop to allow rubric marking - as there doesn't appear to be anything else in Moodle that allows this without implementing something like Lightwork.",

          "Text": "Hi Michael, your request makes perfect sense and using Workshop 2.0 in such situation was one of the use cases I had when designing it. The checkbox \"Use peer-assessment\" is available as a fresh new feature but it is not taken into account too much yet. I mean - user interface does not depend on it (yet) so some irrelevant features (like the overriding you mentioned or the columns in the workshop grades report) are still visible. The plan is that Workshop without peer-assessment feature would behave similarly to the Assignment module while still offering the advanced grading methods like rubrics. The development was focused on mainstream usage of Workshop though so this will not happen in 2.0, sorry. But, I am pretty sure you can use Workshop in 2.0 for your situation:\n* Just set the maximum grade for assessment to zero\n* Set the course gradebook so that it ignores and hides workshop grade for assessment item from your students completely\n* Skip submission allocation - you as the teacher can assess all submissions by default and they are allocated to you automatically once you press the \"Assess\" button, without the need to use allocator.\n* Do not fill instructions for assessments so they are not displayed to your students The reason why I want to wait for wider feedback from the community before I start hiding various bits of UI is that your situation is just one of use cases we must count with. Imagine for example there are hundreds of submissions in the workshop and you have some assistants (non-editing teachers, mentors etc) that help you with assessing. In this case it is not clean peer assessment as normal students just submit their work (authors) while the other group of users (reviewers) assess them. The master teacher could want to calculate grades for assessments for the assistants to see how relevant their assessment is. In this case, you still want to see peer-assessment features (for example the master teacher wants to override the grade given by their assistants) even if students do not go through peer-assessment phase. Sure, you will not probably give feedback to yourself at the bottom of the assessment form. But you may want to use the field for your own notes maybe? And maybe you can run into situation when you do not agree with the grade calculated by the rubric and will want to modify it a bit - for example because the assessed student has some disabilities you as the human can respect while the blindly objective rubric can not. Summary: workshop should be flexible enough for your need if you can live with the fact you may be offered some options you do not want to use at the given scenario. Hope this explains the reasons a bit - looking forward for your comments and thoughts!",

The other problem ...\"List Student submissions: Could not insert workshop assessment\" Is this a timing problem (?) ... when the timeslot between phase 2 and 3 is to short ...but what should I do during a classwork, there we have no long breaks in between?

Workshop B: Didn't work at all, always the error message. But in the teachersview I can see all submissions. Workshop C: identical settings like Workhsop B - and it works without any problems! I tried to ex/ and import, and to backup and restore, but that doesn't work. The workshops were not included at all. And until now, the students could not do their peer-review evaluation, because they only see their own submissions (in Workshop A and C). I don't know why - because of the bug? Or how many submissions or time does it take? Does anybody knows why? Best regards, Hanna Neuhaus",

In Moodle 2.0, submission phase and assessment phase can't overlap any more to prevent some weird situations. So the setting you described in 2. would work for you best and it is closest to this future behaviour.",

If I were you, I would try to analyse what was done wrong during the upgrade. Make and archive the backup of your database and PHP sources. Anyway, your current issue with the workshop should be fixed by downloading the recent 1.9.7+ Moodle files and uploading them to your site (overwriting the current code). Then visit your site administration page to finish the procedure.",

I have prepared a test site with the new version installed for those who can't sleep for the last six months to see this in action Be warned - according to MDL-17827 , there are still some subtasks to finish, most notably the support for training the assessment on the example submissions provided by teacher. Also, some features - like the proper anonymity checking - are not reviewed yet and are pretty well expected not to work at some places at the moment. And of course, there is no help or documentation written yet. Just click as crazy and see what happens Please, in this first round, do not report the 2.0 bugs into the tracker yet but leave them as a reply in this thread instead. The primary goal of this first testing round is to gather initial comments and feelings on the user interface. What I need at the moment are reports like \"if the workshop is in the submission phase, teacher should see the list of all submissions\" . or \"student should be informed on the time left for submitting\" etc. Thanks in advance for your time. p.s. looking for a link to the test site? Try http://test.moodle.org/workshop/ and join our party",

The reason here was that there were actually three rubric criteria defined, not just those two Criterion 1 and Criterion 2. The description of the third criterion (the third row in the rubric table) consisted just of an empty HTML tag containing a space. Because the criterion description was not empty (it contained some HTML code), it was used. But because it contained white-space only and the levels did not contain any description, no radio element was displayed. But workshop required all criteria to be filled so it returned you to the form again and again. The fix was trivial - to make sure the criterion description does not contain any \"hidden\" text. This is likely to repeat in the future, though... The solution might be to have an explicit checkbox at every assessment form element in the assessment form editor. You have to have it checked if you want to use that element (criterion in this case). I will think about - thanks again.",

As this export/import feature is closely related to backup/restore feature, it is not implemented yet. And I can't say if it goes into 2.0 or 2.1.

The students' assessment comments to each other are visible to the students. Good! The teacher's feedback to the students about their assessment is not visible. Checked gradebook.

It is known bug and I will fix it soon together with a bulk of other small changes. Student's comments in assessment forms are intentionally plain textareas, not wysiwyg editors. There were several reasons for such decision. Reviewers should focus on the comment's content, not the formatting. Comments are not expected to be full-formatted HTML, just several sentences describing the reasons for grades. There are technical reasons for that, too. Moodle 2.0 does not allow to provide a stripped version of HTML editors yet. Once there is a way how to replace textareas with a light version of HTML editor, providing just basic set of formatting tools and not all these tables, embedded images, attachments etc, such form element can be used.",

Now, they can't get back into the Workshop module.  I've even tried deleting a student from the class and re-enrolling them.  Same issue. I do not have adminstrative access, but if I had a little more information about what could be done in such a situation. I might feel ok about bothering the adminstrator who is basically a volunteer, at this point. This particular issue pretty much looks like a bug, but I'm too unfamiliar with Moodle to say. Separate issue probably: In my first workshop I think I made a mistake allowing students to assess each others' work.  I did not check \"Make Assessments Agree\", but students are having a hard time seeing my comments on line.  Printing them out is very unsatisfactory too as the page gets cut off.  This relatively annoying glitch (probably of my own creation, somehow) could well be related to other assessment issues. If a student has done a \"Self Assessment\" of their own work and I go in to do the Teacher's Assessment (I am 99.9% sure I am clicking the right link) I often see their assessment with the \"Assessment by _Student Name_\" on top.  If I \"jiggle\" it (Click \"Add Comment\" or go back and click the same link again) I will see the header \"Assessment by _My Name_\" now but often the students own comments are still there.  (I am 99.9% sure that I know the difference between entering my own assessment and \"Grading\" a student's assessment of sample work or their own work.\" Next month I am going to try a workshop with the Peer Assessments  option turned off.  Maybe that will clear up most or all of the assessment issues.   I'm hoping there is a way of avoiding or redressing the workshop_list_teacher_submissions: unable to get submission issue. Or, am I in over my head? Thanks",

I put up the example to assess after the close of the submission but before the opening of assessment period. However, in both cases, a student had done a self- assessment BEFORE the example went.

For every phase, a list of tasks the user is expected to do is provided. So the Workshop planner quickly informs both workshop participants (students) and moderators (teachers) what they are expected to do right now. The planner populates tasks dynamically for every user to provide relevant and up-to-date information about the current state of the whole activity. Using the planner, moderators (teachers) shall easily recognize the progress of participants' work and get a quick overview of how many of them have submitted their work, finished their reviews etc. From the technical point of view, the tool uses the new HTML output machinery. Thanks to that, advanced themers can not only tweak how the planner is CSS-styled but also to change the HTML output completely . See the attached picture for an example of what the planner may display to the Workshop moderator during the Submission phase.",

Therefore, as part of my remit as a Learning Technologist, I've recently been examining use of the Moodle Workshop activity as a means for both self and peer-assessment. With contributions from my colleagues in the e-Learning team, I've put together a Moodle Workshop-focused case study which I'd like to make available to the wider Moodle community. It can be downloaded from: http://people.bath.ac.uk/ma0np/20061218MoodleWorkshopCaseStudy.pdf Please do feel free to get in touch with me, either on or off list, should anyone wish to discuss any part of it further Happy reading, and of course, Merry Christmas!",

          "Text": "I read your case study with interest, as Workshop is my favorite Moodle activity. I have a few comments. (1) An important factor seems to be missing in your \"alternative approach\": teacher assessment. Teacher assessment is essential to a workshop. Students are graded on the QUALITY of their assessments, where quality is a function of the difference between the teacher's assessment and the student's assessment. The teacher's assessment is the normative force that draws participants toward a consensus. (2) I do not see how students can begin work without having at least seen the assessment elements. The purpose of the \"assess one or more examples provided by the teacher\" phase of Workshop (which you omit) is to familiarize students with the assessment elements by having them make one or more practice assessments BEFORE they begin their own work. It's like calibrating a laboratory instrument before you start making measurements. There is no place for subjectivity in a Workshop (it's at the opposite end of the spectrum from Blog ). Workshop is the best tool in Moodle for helping students develop a critical eye toward their own and others' work.",

Something I omitted to mention in my earlier post that my case study is still very much a work in progress and comments, therefore, are very welcome. Teacher assessment, I would say, is preferable to a workshop rather than essential. Whilst it would be desirable to have teacher input into a workshop, I would counter with the view that it is not always possible for a teacher to do this. A teacher may take a view that they would like to use the workshop as more of a peer assessment activity, with little or no teacher contribution(s). In writing the case study, I attempted to give an overview of some of the features that the workshop activity provides rather than give any specifics or any prescribed advice. Therefore, I have left the option of allowing the student to complete a practice assessment up to the teacher. In saying this, I do agree in part with your sentiments. Many thanks once again for your comments. Best Regards, Nitin",

There was supposed to be a new version in September which combined the functionality of Workshop and Exercise, but the deadline has obviously slipped (by how much, no one knows). In anticipation of the new version, bug fixing in the current version was put on hold. The bugs in the current version are serious enough to make Workshop unusable.

I have an AVER media box that captures the VGA signal and sends it to an RCA cable of video output. I then use a rare box i got on ebay that converts the video composite into firewire. So I use computer 2 ( a mac ) to capture the live screen from computer 1. I just export the file as tutorial.mov I will capture a video of me creating a workshop. my moodle is version 1.5.3 This will also help document many of the workshop bugs. I also found that I could not backup and restore my course when I used a workshop. I had to delete that resource. I also had to delete my glossary.

However, these days we do not use thes hardcoded role names any more and we talk about users, participants etc. where possible. In the new Workshop, there is a set of capabilities (granted to the legacy Teacher role by default) that allow things like overriding peer grades, reviewing and assessing any submission, being able to always see all participants' names (if the reviewing process is anonymous for regular peers) etc. I am looking for a good word for such \"power user\". I call then \"supergraders\" meanwhile but maybe (certainly!) you can find a better name. Such word is needed in a situation like this: typically, the teachers will be able to assess any submission they like even it has not been allocated to them. It is possible to increase a weight of such teacher's assessment. How shall we call the setting if we want to avoid strings like \"Weight of teacher's assessment\" in order not to use the word \"teacher\"?",

I have closed the workshop and went back in and now I can't see the tutor example or even access the screen I saw to upload that example! This is very frustrating - is it that its just not working or am I missing a 'way in' to what I have set up and a way to manage the phases please? Thanks Sue",

          "Text": "So, does the workshop module that is available to me in 1.9 (I think) work? I want it to, and have made plans to try to use it this year with my 4th grade (age 9 & 10) students. I want each piece of work that a student submits to be commented on by two other students. I want to be able to choose random assignment of reviews or not. I want to be able to have the marks given by the peer review count toward the final and I want a separate score tally for the quality of the comments, which I will do. Can I do this with the current 1.9? I've already created the assignment, but I haven't shown it to the students yet. I suppose I could try it with a very small group at first to see if works, but this involves quite a bit of work on the part of students, so I don't want to start off on something that isn't going to work, if I can avoid it. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I don't have any resources to put toward fixing design/programming stuff, unfortunately. I do have a group of grad students at the U of Minnesota who have taken on tutoring my students using the online text assignment, and that has been wonderful. It's been a bit cumbersome as far as managing the tutors and the students at the same time, but I think it will be well worth it when we have it running smoothly.",

So count on manually regrading but it is still a good peer assessment tool. A couple of nuts and bolts things too. If you are going to allow document uploads be sure everyone can open whatever you specify. We found it inportant that students undertand thier actual project grade was not based on peer assessment as well.",

Without these, Peer lite can not be considered as a replacement for either Exercise or Workshop. In addition, the grading methodology of Peer Lite is questionable. Below is a summary of comments that I made in the Peer lite forum apropos of the above. Workshops and Exercises emphasize the development of critical thinking skills. By requiring students to self-assess before submitting their work, the work hopefully improves. IMO self-assessment is an essential part of Exercise and Workshop, and should be required of any module that replaces them. The example(s) provided by the teacher give the Workshop a calibration phase. During this phase, teacher and students come to a common understanding of what the criteria mean and how they are to be applied. Practice assessments contribute to the quality of self-assessment and peer assessments. It is not clear that the \"grade for review\" in Peer lite truly measures the quality of the student's assessment, as it does in Workshop and Exercise (in Workshop and Exercise, the quality of a student's assessment is based on a weighted comparison of the student's assessment with the teacher's assessment). Substituting a \"lite\" version of Workshop which simply removes a few troublesome (but essential) features without regard to their pedagogical value is bound to disappoint a lot of users.",

Peer Lite should have an easy to use logic for teacher, who have been \"overloaded\" with functions by the old workshop modul (at the beginning). Exampels by teacher should be possible. Grading is one of the critical points. The workshop modul produced results nobody could declare ... peer lite has an easy to use approach. We included the wishes of the community trough a discusssion process, before Andreas started to develope Peer Lite. What we did is, to devide them into Peer Lite and Peer Advance. There will be an peer advanced with more features then peer lite, and more possibilities then workshop, with a more clear structure. I asked Andreas to post more details for peer lite here. Peter",

But the solution is not \"trivialize and conquer\" but to fix the bugs, improve the user interface and provide better documentation and tutorials. It is fundamentally a good system . If we followed Peter's advice we would throw away Roles and many other features of Moodle that users have a hard time understanding. The Workshop grading policy allows the teacher to base grades for student assessments on the quality of the assessment , rather than the assessment per se . The quality is a function of the difference between the student's assessment and the teacher's assessment. So if the two assessments agree, the student's grade for an assessment will be high. If the two assessments disagree, the student's grade for an assessment will suffer Consider these strategies used by typical high school students and undergraduates: student A assesses his own work as \"perfect\" for every element students A and B conspire to give each other perfect assessments students A and B conspire to give student C a poor assessment (the victim is usually a good student). The Workshop creator can defeat these strategies with a grading policy that gives more weight to the teacher's assessment: If the teacher assesses A's work as poor, A's grade for his self-assessment will suffer If the teacher assesses A's work and B's work as poor, both students' grades for their peer assessments will suffer If the teacher assesses C's work as excellent, then A's and B's grades for the peer assessment will suffer. If C assessed his own work as excellent, then C's grade for his self-assessment will be high. I am trying to understand if Peer Lite's grading policy will allow this.",

The setup page could be improved, but it is not the main source of difficulty in my opinion. In my opinion, the most confusing thing in Workshop -- the thing that needs fixing -- is the presentation of results by mod/workshop/view.php. Results are currently displayed in a single table using special brackets {} Assessment by Student; [] Assessment by Teacher; <> Assessment Dropped; () Automatic grade for assessment; [] Teacher grade for assessment. This table completely sacrifices clarity for the sake of compactness. The headings are confusing and the reader must constantly refer to the legend. Why not replace it by several tables, one for each dimension of the total grade? For example, (1) a table of the assessments done BY each student (2) a table of the assessments OF each student by other students, and (3) a table for the teacher's assessment of the student's work. Since each table would show only one dimension of the total grade, special brackets would be unneeded. I set up a Workshop to demo the scenarios in my last post. It uses the following parameters: Grade for submission = 60 Grade for assessments = 40 Number of examples = 0 Comparison of assessments = Very strict Number of assessments of student submissions = 1 Weight for teacher's assessment = 10 Self assessment = Yes Assessments must be agreed = No I used two students, Perkin and Roscoe. Perkin is an infallible student -- he never makes a mistake. Roscoe is a student with reverse infallibility -- he can do nothing right. The Teacher gives 60 to Perkin's work Perkin gives 40 to his own work Perkin gives 0 to Roscoe's work The Teacher gives 0 to Roscoe's work Roscoe gives 40 to his own work Roscoe gives 0 to Perkin's work You would expect Perkin to get 100 points (60 for work, 40 for assessments) as his total grade and Roscoe to get 0 points (0 for work, 0 for assessments). That is exactly what happens (see screenshot). But try explaining it using the table of results. Ugh!",

Personal background: Still somewhat new to Moodle (only used it for one full semester, preparing for a second semester). Haven't used the workshop module yet. Haven't done team projects in class before. Looking for ways to make the process of in-group peer assessment easier. Teaching Context : This is for a large (170 students) introductory-level course in cultural anthropology at Concordia University, in Montreal. Typically, Concordia students are used to a fair amount of autonomy and don't expect much hand-holding or spoon-feeding. Project: A semester-long ethnography project on a specific social group (music fanclub, hobby group, religious community, etc.). The project has four parts: a project proposal, an observation report, an interview report, and a final paper. Grading: My criteria for grading the assignments include such things as insight, originality, and honesty. All things which are relatively easy to use while grading and quite robust across semesters but pretty difficult to transmit to others. My use of peer assessment would have more to do with factors influencing teamwork. It's easy for me to relate to comments made by Roger Arango about group projects and group grading .",

Two possible ways for your ideas: 1.) Use a forum 1 for small groupe discussion (seperate groups) They have to post their solutions in forum 2 (ask them to structure it in the postings), first seperate groups, then change to visible groups now all may see these postings and may browse through them Let them find differences, new ideas and so on ... If you would like to give them the possibilities to POST, then you have to use the no groups solution. To show the different groups, use nthe possibility to show groupe-pictures. Then they have to continue the discussion in Forum 1 with the new inputs and have to complete their own work (seperate groups) each group has to post ONE solution in a forum 3, which first has seperate groups and then change to no groups Now they may comment and rank they solutions. for this process you may use a WIKI in a groupe-mode to support the writings. Take care - that they show you they process of discussion and not only the solution. this prevents solutions, which may be written in view hours or days befor the end 2. If you would like to use the workshop modul you have to use several workshopmoduls: Each groupe has to post the solution in one of the moduls (ONCE). You have to decide before, which groupe should post in which modul and should do the peers in another modul. Now all Students may peer - assess the uploaded works in predefined workshop moduls and you can be sure, they will not get their own work as a peer. For your situation i would recomand the Nr. 1 Hope that helps Peter",

In the standard workshop module, each individual produces work which is peer-assessed by others in the course; there are no groups. If the criteria for grading are \"pretty difficult to transmit to others,\" then won't the assessment elements also be pretty difficult to transmit (i.e., vague and subjective)?

          "Text": "Apologies for the misunderstandings. Members of each team will work on the team's project, producing one \"assignment\" per team per stage in the project (e.g., each team submits one project plan, one observation report, etc.). Those teams are separate groups in the Moodle class (taken at random, working as a team throughout the semester). As both the instructor and the grader, I'll make the assessment of the team's output (the \"assignments\" themselves) using those difficult-to-transmit criteria that I mentioned. Students will not peer-assess the quality of the assignments (e.g., observation report) submitted for the teams' projects. The peer assessment comes in as a regulatory system to diminish the impact of \"freeriders,\" \"leechers,\" or \"hitchhikers.\" My idea is to have the members of each group assess the degree of participation by their fellow team members based on criteria on which they will agree, as teams. As much as possible, I want to use the averages of those grades to serve as a differentiating factor for the grades of different members of the team in cases where there are noticeable discrepancies in terms of individual participation within the team. So, if a given team receives 41/45 on the project overall but three of the four team members describe the participation of the fourth member as insufficient (giving her, say, an average of 5/10 for participation), I want this fourth member's lack of participation to be represented in her overall project grade (20.5/45 instead of 41/45). The alternative would be to have a separate participation grade, the consequences of which aren't as harsh, but it might not serve as a sufficient regulatory mechanism. I would prefer to have these evaluations made at every step of the process but, if the in-team peer assessment system can't be embedded in the \"assignments\" in Moodle, it will probably not be possible for me to implement such a cumbersome structure on 170 students. The course should not become \"busy work\" for anyone. Reading Peter's answer, I have been thinking about other solutions. I eventually received a reply telling me that I can use a peer-assessment online database system made by a fellow Concordia teacher. It might work better that way. I just thought that the Workshop module could work to add a layer of peer assessment to the existing group structure. Thanks a lot for your kind help!",

Can the workshop module be used for students to only assess members of their separate (not visible) Moodle groups? Can the peer assessment be free-form? Can I receive peer-assessments from all team members about all the other team members? Can those assessments be anonymous for assessors? What is the result of the peer-assessment project within Moodle grades? Hypothetical example: Jane, Isabel, Hawa, and William do a project on the Straight Edge Punk movement in Montreal. They submit their observation report (under Hawa's name). I grade that observation report as 9/10, giving them feedback about the project as a whole. The four of them submit a \"reflection paper\" in which they assess their own participation. Each team member rates the reflection papers by the three others (e.g., Isabel gives Hawa 10/10, William 6/10, and Jane 8/10). For each team member, I get grades that I can average out and then multiply by the grade for the observation report (if Hawa gets an average of 10/10 from fellow team members, she gets the full 9/10, if Isabel gets an average of 8/10 from peer assessment, she gets 7.2/10). If all of this can be done, it might be a relatively good solution as it really engages students in thinking about their team participation. (I also have a two engagement grades for the course as a whole, one of which is self-assessed.) I'm guessing that the identity of the assessors will always be known (e.g., Isabel will know how Hawa assessed her participation). It might not be ideal, but it would still work. Is there a test course where I could try this out? Thanks a lot!",

It seems that the workshop module could work for my needs but I would have needed to learn more about it before using it. Maybe next time. In lieu of the WS module, I'll be using a Concordia-designed peer assessment system meant specifically for teamwork. It already has a team participation structure and useful reporting features. Maybe the WS module itself or another Moodle module could be designed specifically for team projects. The group structure already in place can be very useful and the available modules can be used for group activities , but the connection between pedagogy and technology also implies other issues with which Moodle seems like the perfect tool. Anyhoo, thanks again for all your help.",

On an another note, could both specimen assessment form and the teachers example be something that can be hidden until a specified time. Thanks for workshop - I choose moodle because of the availability of the peer and self-assessment component.",

I've read a lot of the documentation and forum posts regarding workshop. The interface is nightmare-ish to say the least. And I haven't even looked at the code, but I've prepared myself for the worst. So I've read about this transition to Peerlight, but in the meantime, has there been any work done on the module to improve the interface and possibly the rubrics? I saw that there is an Assignment module add-on which allows for reusable rubrics. I think that would be a good thing to incorporate into the workshop, the rubrics pertain to the course, not necessarily just the assignment. That way the rubrics are reusable and modifiable. I don't want to start hacking away at the 1.9 code if some of this stuff has already been worked on for 2.0. I applied for CVS access, but haven't heard back yet. Where should I start?",

However, the disadvantage is that some students will not have their full quota of submissions to assess until AFTER the last student has submitted their work .\" Have all the students submitted their own work? Or are submissions still coming in? Obviously, a submission cannot be peer-assessed until its submission is complete.

We installed 1.8.3 this month and I'm still seeing this (though I haven't created a new Workshop from scratch, I'm just relying on existing Workshops in the course). I want to test this more because I suspect it has something to do with release on the assessments etc. What I've been doing as a work-around is simple: because my scoring of points over the top of the student's scoring of pointsdoes not eliminate their self-assessment points, I simply give them points as usual, but I append my feedback below theirs with my name as signature (e.g. \"Put in more effort next time. --Mr Stein\"). It's sort of clumsy, but it meets my needs for now until a fix comes along.",

Workshop is an individual activity with a very complex feedback system designed to sharpen students' critical faculties. A student can see other students work, but can have no direct effect upon that work, except indirectly by means of their assessment, which is factored into their own grade as well as the grade of the student being assessed. In my opinion, a Workshop without grades would be of no value. Maybe a forum would be more suitable.",

( and i know its just a matter of semantics) I call a wiki as a collaborative learning system In a peer system i ( as a student) learn from what the peers are thinking (and have learned). So to me it is less important to assess (grade) others work, but more important be able to \"read\" and \"comment\" on peers work. This helps me to learn from others work. That is why the emphasis on each seeing other's work. This obviously is different from collaborative or group work. We are doing that separately (and using wiki for that). The disadvantage of forum is that one is not able to track if each assignment is done by each participant - as forum is more for discussion and less for assignments. (I admit above are only MY definations and not necessarily some standard ideas of a peer learning system) Peter wrote: \"For your problem the database modul fits better\" I read this somewhere else also - through I am not very sure how can I use database to do what i have written above. Can you offer me brief guidelines as to how to do so. As of now i have relaised that \"workshop\" is the best way to achieve what i am trying - through i am struggling with the settings. I am repeating my request - is there still some way to allow students to read and comment other's work while they still are able to edit there own work. If i try and give \" Manage settings mod/workshop:manage \" rights to students, somehow they are not able to post their own assignments (which was quite surprising). So either i am able to tweak the settings or please guide me how to use database. thank you",

If you create a forum of type \" Each person posts one discussion \", each student could create a thread (or discussion) within the forum where he would submit his assignment (and updates on it) and receive feedback from others. In this way, it would be easy for you track whether each student has submitted his assignment or not: you would just have to check whether he has initiated his thread in the forum. Moreover, the thread of a student would hold all the versions submitted by that student, so that you could check if his work has improved by taking into account the comments of their peers.

Understanding what made Unix a success is key to understanding why the classic Workshop has failed, and why any attempt to create a \"lite\" version of Workshop by simply removing a few troublesome (but essential!) features, is also bound to fail. The classic Workshop conceptually combines six simple tasks into a monolithic activity: [the assignment] The statement of the work to be done [the assessment form] A form defining the assessment criteria that will be applied to the work when it is submitted [the student submission] Submission of the assigned work by the student",

I went to try and do that but it is no longer a standalone module to be installed as it comes standard with Moodle.

I tested it out, and after submitting an assignment, went back into teach mode, saw the assignment, was able to give my own assessment, but no simple grade for the submission. And for setting the weight of submission and assessment, does 60/40 mean that the original submission gets 60% and the comments I grade get 40%... or does it mean that the submission gets 60% and only comments that the students themselves grade (something I don't want) get 40%?

The thing is that students have a period of time (I think it's 30 minutes) after they post their submission, to edit it or to delete it, in case they want to change something. In my experience, I've noticed that those submissions don't appear anywhere to be assessed in that period (well, in fact those submissions appear if you are the administrator, but the other students can't see it). It can also be something about the cron job, but I think it's more because of what I said earlier. Try leaving a gap of 30 minutes (at least) between the end of submissions deadline and start of assessments. I know it's annoying when you are trying with experimental workshops, but it's the only way to get it working correctly. I hope this helps you Xabi",

One concern I have is that perhaps the Workshop portion of my DB has been corrupted by past problems with this module, but I'm not an experienced DB person so it's hard for me to say.  I keep getting these odd error messages, and then it logs people out and jumps them back to the index page of our Moodle install.  Is that something that's happened to other people?  If so, what might I be looking for in the DB, and how might I fix it (without losing data from last semester's workshops)? Thanks as always - Nic",

I'm green when it comes to Moodle but have done PHP Fusion sites and have them working the way I want to.  I work for an organization that offers classroom instruction to teachers.  That being said I need to find a way to allow Moodle to take registrations for my classes as well as workshops and allow them to be paid for online.  I have put a couple of classes in and came accross the area where you can put in either Paypal or another third party application such as a secured site and certificate.  Has anyone used this for this purpose and what would be my next step? I don't want to have to have the guests log on to be able to sign up for a course and I need to be able to keep track of who is in the courses.  Is this even possible?  Any direction on my next step would be apprecaited.  Thanks.",

          "Text": "This discussion thread is primarily for a module/tool that is called the Workshop. I think that you are primarily interested in how to control enrollment into classes. The newer versions of Moodle allow you to use SSL/shttp and have a variety of enrollment options. I think that Paypal is available as an enrollment option since Moodle 1.6. Your best bet is to go to the Enrollment Plugins discussion and read what has already been posted. Here is a list of the steps you would need to take for Moodle version 1.7 (mostly from memory of setting up the authorize.net enrollment option <-- so some may be wrong) 1) get the certificate for your cite so that SSL will work 2) verify SSl by trying to access a file via https 3) turn on https by going to Administration -> security -> HTTP security and checking the box associated with \"use https for logins\" (If you can not login at this point you had better hope that you have access to the moodle database of your site so that you can reset that checkmark! Information about how to do this IS available in the discussion forums here at moodle.org) 4) Go to Administration ->Courses -> Enrolments (<-yes, for some reason Moodlers spell it with just one \"l\" must be a Southern Hemisphere thing!?!) and then select the enrollment options you want to use and configure them. 5) I haven't used the PayPal enrollment option but I am assuming it is similar to the authorize.net enrollment. If so, go to the actual virtual classroom (or create one and then input the payment information in the settings for the course.) At the end of this list I realize that I do not know if you need SSL/https for paypal - if not then many of the above steps will be un-necessary. Moodle allows you to use multiple enrollment options and so if you want to have some people pay with PayPal, other with VISA/MC/AmEX,etc, and others via passcode that they enter --> you can do it.",

In order for Moodlers to help you they are going to need to know more about what you envision, what you have tried and problems/if any you have run into. In particular we are going to need to know more detail about what you want to do with audio. Are you just wanting to post audio for students or are you wanting to have students be able to post audio also? Is it acceptable to require students to download the audio file (very easy and flexible - just attach the audio files) or do you want the audio to stream from the web page? (not very hard use the multimedia filters). Do you require the audio to be organized into a threaded discussion? If so, check into Gong for Moodle, MoodleSpeex, or Yackpack (not really integrated into Moodle but it can give the appearance of being integrated). Cheers and keep moodling.",

When students try to assess their own work, they see \"Could not insert workshop assessment.\" I have tried some of the fixes on here and they help a bit but it's still buggy. Surely the latest version of workshop would have fixed this? I am on 1.7+ Students cannot see the work of other students. Do they only see these after the submission deadline is passed? Some people mentioned that sufficient time must pass between submission and assessment. Is this true? Does this mean I cannot have students answering a question in class and then marking it in the same hour? I am probably being stupid but I have read Ch6 of the manual and all the help popups but am really stuck. Is there something that I might be doing wrong? I have tried criterion and accumulative grading, 1 comment, no attachments (it is going to be typed in the browser), no resubmissions, fair comparison, 2 student assessments, over allocation = 1.

          "Text": "I also think that adding some sort of peer assessment options to Assignment would be nice, but having looked at the Workshop code some this summer I would be a bit cautious about things like \"moving the peer evaluation portion\" for (at least) two reasons. First, the workshop code is pretty seriously unstructured in places and is arguably in significant need of a re-write.  If one was going to bring this into the Assignment module then that might be a good opportunity to either heavily revise the code or re-write it from scratch. Second, there are serious ( IMHO ) issues about the way that peer assessments are assigned and evaluated that would need to be discussed (again, IMHO) broadly to figure out what the Moodle community wants/needs.  The problem is that if one is going to use the doing of assessments as part of the grade then one needs to assign a balance collection of assignments to assess and that's not at all trivial to do, especially in the face of things like late and missing assignments. The Assignment module is clean and makes sense.  This is not so clearly true for the Workshop module.  I'd hate to see the desire to bring in neat features of the Workshop module muddy up the Assignment waters.",

I think the Moodle community should be able to assemble such a team here in England to develop a peer assessment tool based on the work that we have already done on the workshop module.

Workshop is what I would have aimed to use for most of our projects/assignments but I don't like the way it does grading. Our first use for this would be in our FE courses which are based around Edexcel BTEC - these are criterion based and the way this is setup in the Exercise module is ideal(though I have one thing I don't like about the Exercise module which is that there is no Project description in HTML - it has to be an uploaded document) It may be that in the new plug version of the Assignment module all of my requirements will be answered but I haven't yet seen a version of it or even a list of what it is setting out to do. I think I'll await a proper Beta version of 1.5 before playing too much. Anyway to reiterate - very happy to take part in this project - we are a small private establishment working in partnership with 2 colleges and the University of Plymouth providing courses in music technology, sound engineering and media. See www.deepbluesound.co.uk for more details. Approx 250 - 300 students total. Cheers David",

I could change the times for my classes and so could some of the other staff, but I would prefer not to have the part time staff editing the courses.

I would love to set different times for different groups or even to remove the time options and use the manual option to move through the different stages. At he moment I am looking at using the my files block from humbolt for pupils to upload and share work for peer assessment and for the assessor to use the same method or e-mail to return the assessed work, however this means less structured assessment and no records unless all assessed files are also e-mailed/shared with me. Has anyone else got any other ways of providing peer assessment for groups sharing the same course? Rick.",

I honestly believe this is one of the modules which contributes a lot in making Moodle really a tool making complicated tasks for teachers easy. I'm sorry I can't help on this, other than posting a few notes on what I think is important to keep in mind when continuing the developement of the Workshop module. I think the most important problem I can see, is that teachers find it extremely difficult to use. The bloat of settings (I know it's just that what can make it fit like a good  shoe) is scarying people away.  So I think there is a lot of challenge there to make the setup of a workshop and the workflow more intuitive. Secondly, for this particular module (and excercise), I think it should in time become an assignement, which would bring the assignements up to 5 types off line upload file on line upload file with self evaluation upload file with self and peer evaluation I think that would make the way to give assignements with pear and self evaluation for teachers a lot shorter and more natural to do, instead of using a separate module. For me this step is more natural then e.g. the evolution of journal to on line assignement. Just some early morning thoughts... Thanks a lot for standing up",

Doing that weekly, there should be no reason to fail an examination because half of the examination is done with collaboration work during the semester, by working together, the final examination is therefore not very difficulty.

          "Text": "Peter, thanks for tanking on this role. I hope I am not getting to far ahead posting my wish list already. I like what workshops have allowed my classes to do and learn but we keep turning up problems that are making me look for alternatives for peer assessment. I want to be able to use a workshop with different classes but they may not have compatible time frames, if there is the option for groups there needs to be the option for seperate time frames (but you will still also need to be able to easily set the same conditions for all groups) Teachers able to upload files after the submission date to allow for ilness, technical problems etc Pupils need to be able to return to part done assessments so that they can work more flexibly. Most recently some had to save assessments early when they discovered they did not have the appropriate software at home to complete assessments for some of the submitted files., only to discover that they could not complete the assessment at a later date.(to get around this i had to delete assessments and then they often got re-allocated to a different student for assessment) For quick and easy use in a single lesson the option ofmanual control of the phases would allow me to ensure that all files are uploaded then move on to the next phase. I would also like to be able to use the scales that we have created for use in assignments to give a final grade for workshops. We have specific grading criteria that pupil are familiar with and I would like to use rubrics to give a grade for each section then to give an overall grade for the project using the scales. Control of self assessmentas a separate phase with options for before, with or after peer assessment I find that the peer assessment has a big influence in pupils self assessment. The larger picture makes them more realistic in the self assessment and would like to use this to help them become more objective in their self assessments. Rick.",

If we could modularize the code and move it into a core of some kind that other modules can use... we'd be golden. However, Workshop is already in the standard Moodle install.. so I'm very happy someone's agree to maintain it for a bit longer (and improve it).  Our project module is probably too \"heavy\" for a a little workshop...  and if the workshop gets to a point where we can just embed it - Awesome!

          "Text": "Hi Peter, we have a faculty member who has published on peer review (Dr. Elizabeth Eschenbach: Web Based Forms for Design Team Peer Evaluations ) and had a tool written years ago in java , which no longer functions on our servers . We've started working on a way to provide a peer review tool, based on the one that Virginia Tech wrote as discussed here: http://www.manastungare.com/publications/powell_2006_online.pdf The VT tool has some nice features: the rubric interface works with the quiz question interface, it has a pretty straightforward interface, and is set up to allow reviewing of any activity or resource in the course (though this has to be implemented by extending a class in the code). Anyway, below are my review and design notes, with Dr. Eschenbach's criteria in bullets: Michael Penney LMS Project Manager 3/6/2006 Virginia Tech Moodle Peer Review Module Report & Development Proposal Last\nweek I tested, debugged, and reviewed the Peer Review module from\nVirginia Tech. It had a few bugs that needed recoding and I made one of\nthe interface changes suggested by the original authors. Unfortunately\nit is built to work with a newer version of the assignment module than\nthe one we are using on the current main HSU Moodle installation, so we\nwill not be able to run it on the main installation until we upgrade\nthe assignment module this summer. I set it up on our test\ninstallation, and we could copy the course list and send the students\nover to the new installation if you would like to try using it for a\ncurrent course. The first required change as outlined below would be to Measured against Dr. Eschenbachs criteria, the module meets the criteria below: Peer Review Faculty member builds a questionnaire for each student to complete. The questionnaire has text boxes and/or numerical responses for students to complete. The\ncurrent module allows rubrics to be created which each student can fill\nout when reviewing another students work. These can contain multiple\nchoices, true false, and open-ended questions. Students can also send a file back to the reviewed student, either with or in lieu of the rubric. Each student has to review a subset of students in the class, perhaps including self. The instructor can assign a number of students to review each student's work. Peer review can be anonymous or not. All\npeer reviews of a single student's work are added together randomly and\nanonymously in a single document that is made accessible to the student\nafter faculty review. This requirement is only partly met:\nreviews can be anonymous, and are available to the reviewed students,\nhowever they are available immediately after being reviewed, there is\nnot currently a way for faculty to approve a review before the student\nsees it. There are functions for sending out email notifications after\na review has been graded, so we may be able to use these functions to\nwithhold the reviews from students until after faculty review. It does not meet these two requirements: If\npossible, simple stats of numerical scores are provided and the student\ncan see self assessment separately from peer assessment Students cannot self assess and there are no overall statistics. Faculty can review and edit inappropriate answers This is not supported in the current version, reviews become available as soon as students complete them. Required changes: These are the required changes for this module to meet Dr. Eschenbach original request: 1)\nMake it self contained (remove dependencies on assignment) OR make it\nan assignment plug-in. Making it self contained will make it able to\nrun independent of assignment versions, but more importantly it will\nsimplify the process of creating and using a peer review (as it will\nnot require an assignment be set up first). 2) Add optional ability for instructors to control posting of reviews. 3) Add optional ability for students to self assess. 4) Make module stats available in a single page, anonymous for students and optionally anonymous for instructors. From the VT teams list of changes: a)\nProvide better feedback to instructors for new reviews regarding review\nstatus; provide intra-page navigation links to reviews received. b) Improve email functions c) Better comment code. Currently\nit is not clear which students have been reviewed. This should be part\nof step 2, to show instructors a list of reviews that have been\nsubmitted. Backup and restore code (currently rubrics are not backed up). If folks message me I can send them a demo login.",

If your students can write the sections in separate windows, the Form assignment type might do the trick; it allows you to grade the sections separately (I'm not sure this one works in 1.6.x). For inline corrections and comments in the book reports I would use the online text assignment type (and add to the feedback or to the assignment description my assessment criteria). Rgrds, Paul.",

In brief, I have a workshop set to allow self-assessment , where the submission is worth 90pts and the assessment is worth 10pts.  I assumed that this meant my scoring would be worth 90% and their self-assessing of their work would be worth 10%.  I set the comparison to be lax, and weight for teacher assessments is 1.  I've included a screen shot of my settings at the very bottom for reference. My problems are in the students final scoring: 1. In the following screen shot (increase text size to enlarge) you'll see I circled one student in green who failed to do a self-assessment. I assessed their submission as 86 points, and assumed they would get those points and  not the 10 pts for their assessment. Instead they get zero, presumably because it's trying to add their own score of themselves as the 90pts (being zero) + the 10pts for their assessment (being zero)--this is based on the next problem I saw: 2. The red circles point to instances where the student's self assessments are lower than my assessments. It looks like in these cases the total grade is weighted in the opposite direction for the student's scores rather than for mine. That is, in the first example I assumed the student would get 89 (my 80 + 9 for their assessment). Instead they get 77.9 (their 69 calculated down to 68.9 [!?] + the 9 for the assessment). Am I misunderstanding how this is supposed to work? If so, can someone explain what I need to do to make this work properly? Here are my settings:",

It seems to me that, with the setting you are using, that your student should have received a grade for their SUBMISSION though.  This may be a bug, but since the code base is changing I am loathe to track it down as I fear that it will not get changed.

I finally figured out my misunderstanding, and your post confirmed what I was already suspicious of: My conception was that \"submission\" points were for the teacher and \"assessment\" points were for the student.  I thought that the teacher's assessment of a submission should produce all points of the submission, up to the total points possible for \"submissions\", while student's assessments should only produce all points for the \"assessments\". This is not true : instead, in the case of a self-assessment, if I give the student a 90/90 and the student gives themselves an 80/90 the submission total is 85 /90--if the weight for teacher assessments is a 1 (1 to 1 ratio). If I give that student an 8 /10 for their self-assessment (or if they are scored by Moodle as 8/10), that adds on to the submission totaling 93 /100 points for the workshop. With this understanding, my problem with the Workshops tool is that while one can set the weight of a teacher's assessment of a submission to zero, one can not set the weight of a student's assessment of a submission to zero. Ideally, I would be able to set the \"weight for student assessments (of submissions)\" to zero, which would result in the workshop still giving the students the 10 assessment points for their self-assessment or peer-assessment, BUT without their self-assessment or peer-assessment impacting the submission points; I want that all to come from me. The best I can do with the current version is set my teacher weight to 10.",

So participants don't see from which group member the working paper they have to assess comes and they don't see from which group member the score has come. Secondly there is the possibility to hide the grades before the agreement. So group members only see the written feedback they have got (if you are working with written feedback...). As far as I know it is not possible to hide the scores, as the aim of a peer assessment is to exchange feedback, to reflect on other working papers. Hope you got some new ideas!",

          "Text": "Hey, I think I just barely got my brain wrapped around the workshop tool, and in my workshops I'm looking for a total score of 100 pts, where 90 pts are for a student's workshop submission and 10 pts are for that student's work assessing another student's work. The problem is that if I grade Student X's submission as 90/90 and Student X has also completed a peer assessment (which I score 10/10) BUT no one has assessed Student X's submission, Student X ends up with like 99.6 instead of the full 100 pts I think s/he deserves for doing work.  I know this is because the 90/90 score I give Student X is averaged by the score that Student X's work was peer-assessed at. Looks like if there is no peer assessment it defaults to a ZERO, causing the artifically lower score. Is this just a bug or oversight?",

Some students weren't delivered assessments, and though it may be their problem, I'm unsure. Lots of browser problems, and a hundred students. I've cranked my weighted assessment quite high, set grading to lax, and yet lots of students feel unfairly dealt low scores. I don't see that I'm able to manually edit or adjust scores? I thought.. well maybe I can create an offline assignment for 100 points, and put that into the same grading category, and figure out a way of providing bonus points to get to some fairer point distribution I could arrive at in a spreadsheet.. but I haven't gotten all the way there as a patch either.

Maybe this student will get points for his/her work, but loose all points for peers, if there are no students available... Any Idea? Peter",

I need to mark on two criteria and depending on the module, the allocations vary, but basically, I need to have two numerical scales going at maximum, from 0-15 so they could get 30 as maximum. (also 12+12 and 6+12) I know I can use accumulative grade/rubric and weighting to acieve this, but it's messy and I'd rather not as I am trying to get them to use the exam board markscheme, which basically supplies a rubric for marking. Trouble is, the workshop rubrics only go from 1-5 and I can't seem to define custom scales for accumulative. Does anyone know of a hack I can apply to increase the rubrics from 5 up to 15?

The course has been set up with 'Group mode = separate groups', so will it be the case that 'group A' students will only be able to evaluate the work of 'group A' students, or will they also be given work by 'group B' students to evaluate, and vice-versa?

It was a bit of a pain, but I got it to simulate what I wanted until the proper tools become available.  I think next semester, I 'll look at the \"Team\" Module some people are working on - but that doesn't allow peer assessment, so I'll have to figure something else out. --sea",

          "Title": "Teacher Assessment not being reflected",
          "Text": "I have been using the workshop module since April of this year (2005), and am very impressed with the new version, which is part of moodle 1.5.2. However, I am having a problem understanding the grading system. In particular, it is not clear to me how the 'Teacher Assessment' of a piece of work is reflected in the 'Submission Grade'. At the moment I am having students get into groups of 4 or 5 students. Each group of students has its own username and password. The groups upload work to the workshop, and assess their own work as well as that of other groups using their group IDs. This all works fine: each group grades its own group's work, plus that of 4 or 5 other groups. I then grade each group's work. The settings for the Workshop are as follows: Grade for Assessments: 30 Grade for Submission: 70 Grading Strategy: Accumulative Number of Comments, Assessment Elements, Grade Bands, Criterion Statments or Categories in a Rubric: 18 Number of Attachments expected on Submissions: 0 Allow Resubmissions: No Number of Assessments of Examples from Teacher: 0 Comparison of Assessments: Lax Number of Assessments of Student Submissions: 4 Weight for Teacher Assessments: 4 Over Allocation: 0 Self Assessment: Yes Assessments must be agreed: Yes The problem is that my score (the Teacher Assessment) is not reflected in the 'Submission Grade'. The only part of the grade in which my score is reflected is in the 'Assessment Grade', and therefore to a certain extent in the 'Total Grade'. I know this, because if I change the 'Comparison of Assessments' to, for example 'strict', the change is reflected in the Assessment Grade by a change in the groups' 'Assessment Grade' and 'Total Grade'. I understand that one of the purposes of the 'Teacher Assessment' grade is to provide a 'benchmark' with which to compare students' grades of those of their peers. However, it would also seem to be the case that the 'Teacher Assessement' score should also be part of the 'Submission Grade'. Yet, changes in the 'Weight for Teacher Assessments' do not make any difference what so ever to the 'Submission Grade'. I realise that I could increase the influence of my grade on the 'Total Grade' by increasing the 'Grade for Assessments' and decreasing the 'Grade for Submission', coupled with making the 'Comparison of Assessments' 'Very Strict'. However, I would prefer to make my grade (the Teacher Assessment') have a more direct and transparent effect on the 'Total Grade'. In other words, I want to place more emphasis on the the students' submissions than their ability to assess. I have attached a PDF of the 'League Table of Submitted Work' showing all the grades for the 10 groups that I mentioned above. You'll see, for example, that a 'groups' 'Submission' grade is the average of the 'Peer Assessments' that have been agreed to. The Teacher's Assessment is not reflected in this score at all. I realise that the Workshop module is currently in search of a maintainer, so I may not got an answer to this query. However, I'd welcome any suggestions or comments from other Workshop users, even if it is just to say that you have also experienced this 'problem'. Or, indeed, if it is just to say that I have misunderstood something. Thank you.",

In Moodle a \"group\" is really like a separate section of the same course, so multiple sections can be running in parallel using the same course set up but without (necessarily - it depends on how you set things up) being aware of the other groups.  Within a Moodle group everyone has to do every assignment and there's no support for team projects like (I think) you describe. I do a lot of team projects, and would love to see support added for such things, but at the moment I'm not aware of any.",

          "Text": "As part of a directed study in PHP and MySQL , my professor, Nic McPhee, and I have been looking to solve what is, in our opinion, a bug in the Workshop module that causes some students, generally those who submit later, to never be assigned the proper amount of peer assessments.  This is, in our opinions, an unacceptable flaw in the module.  First off, this bug means that somebody won't get the proper amounts of the reviews that they should get, but most importantly, this means that if you are the student that does not receive enough submissions to do, then your grade will be affected negativity because you couldn't do the proper amount of assessments.  Basically you would be penalized for submitting later that everybody, even though you have submitted to the workshop on-time. After a week of searching, we finally found the code that this takes place.  What we originally considered the bug was a single if statement.  We discovered that if we commented it out, then the proper amount of assessments would appear for all of the students.  However, we soon realized that removing the if statement all together could result in a new and perhaps larger problem. It appeared that the new problem could result in a student who would end up not only having no assessments to assess, but also that nobody would assess their work. Consider a class with five people, the amount of peer assessments have been set to 3, the amount of overassessments has been set to zero (or in our logic, eliminated alltoghether), and also consider that the workshop is set up so that the start of the assessments period is the same as the start of the submissions period (i.e., set so that students can begin to do peer assessments as soon as they have submitted their work).  Students A, B, C, and D are prompt and submit their work as soon as the workshop allows them to and then they continue to promptly do their peer assessments. This chart shows that: Student A assesses B, C, D. Student B assesses A, C, D. Student C assesses A, B, D. Student D assesses A, B, C.",

          "Text": "I am using workshop with a group of the 9th grade students in my mathematics course. Usually I stay in Phase 2 for students to submit their assignments only till all assignments are submitted. Then I switch to Phase 4 for students to assess a number of homework. in this phase, when an assessment is sent out and arrived, the assessed student can view the content of assessment immediately. That is, before the saved assessment is viewed, the student assessor can \"edit\" the content of his assessment, but if the assessment is viewed, the content can only be viewed instead of editing anymore. The problem is, sometimes students just do not finish their evaluation yet and save their assessment, or they want to improve their content or modify some part of the saved assessment. They found they can not edit it anymore cause the assessment has been viewed. They come to me and ask me to let them go on editing. However, I don't have the right to do it but can only tell the student assessor: well, if you made some mistakes in your assessment but you can not modify it any more, please just tell that student directly.\" Is it possible for the teacher to own the right (to press a button or set up a deadline for assessment)  for students to read their assessment? If so, student assessors will have a period of time to articulate what they've assessed and modify it if necessary. Cheers, Laura",

The Workshop interface to the student is similar to uploaded Assignment: a box for browsing a file with a button for uploading.  Try logging in as a student (add a dummy student if you like) and have a look. Also, the Workshop interface has been subtantially modified in 1.5, so that you set begin and end dates for submissions and assessments, rather than selecting tabs. Hope your workshop works out OK.

I initially reported this problem on 26 October and could not identify a workaround so I installed the development (1.5) version of Moodle for a pilot course to test the workshop, which worked though there were some continued minor problems with Workshop, and of course lots of issues with the development version. At this point it has been over three months, I am now back to a stable (1.4.3+ or 2004083132) version of Moodle for an actual course I am running, and the problem persists as the Workshop version installed with 1.4.3+ is unchanged (2004060401). Other threads report the possibility of the latest version of Workshop being backwards-compatible (with at least 1.4.2), but this sounds risky. So what this means to me is that the entire Workshop module is unusable until 1.5 stable comes out (which will be when??), or until someone out there identifies a workaround for 1.4.3+. My students are slated to submit their draft papers via Workshop on 28 February...I will send a bottle of virtual champagne to whoever can solve this for me! There is a larger issue here as well: if I am going to effectively pitch Moodle to my university as a courseware package we need to find ways to fix bugs quicker. Problems such as the above will really affect Moodle's image. Thanks, Jim",

          "Text": "First, let me be real clear:  I really like Moodle and greatly appreciate the work that everyone does to make this tool available to folks like me.  I also really like at least the idea of the Workshop module, but the fact of it has been a much greater struggle than any other Moodle component that I've worked with. To be blunt, the implementation is incredibly fluid and seems pretty flakey at times.  This may be swell if you're able to grab the latest from CVS at a whim, and roll with it when things act up, but it's a bit rough when I've got to go through several layers of admin to get a simple three line edit performed, and am trying to sell this to both students and faculty that are fairly familiar with WebCT and often suspicious of this \"new thing\". I certainly don't want to put a damper on the enthusiastic work going on for this nifty module, but I would like to be able to download a stable version and have some reason to believe that it will work as advertised (and that someone actually knows what \"as advertised\" means and has written it down).  We did our initial install of Moodle in late August, and the only thing that ever needed a patch was the Workshop Module (which, BTW , was delivered by Ray with amazing speed and was greatly appreciated).  We just did an upgrade to 1.4.3, and everything appears to be working fine except for the Workshop, which has a variety of issues ranging from silly cosmetic problems to potentially significant algorithmic errors. Can I be bold and suggest two things that might help? Use branches in CVS to manage the process in a way that will allow for backpatches to fix older versions?  My sense from the discussion and looking at the CVS logs is that work is currently barrelling forth on the main branch and that concrete changes/fixes aren't being committed/managed in a way that would allow them to be applied to older versions.  Better use of branches and tags would allow the Workshop module in version 1.4.4 of Moodle to actually be 1.4.3 + plus some basic bug fixes and tested, stable enhancements instead of whatever happens to be in the main development branch when it is released.  This would create a meaningful notion of a \"stable\" version of the Workshop Module, and allow things like bugfixes on the development branch to be patched back onto the stable branch in a controlled way.  (I apologize if I'm reading this wrong and there's more process here than I've been able to discern.) Come up with some notion of functional and/or unit tests that can be run to help define the desired/correct behavior of the Workshop Module, and to help verify that the \"stable\" version of it is correct before a release.  This module is unusual in that it includes a lot of non-trivial number crunching and very complex interactions.  This makes it very difficult to test (as has been pointed out by several developers in this forum).  The problem, then, is if you don't use it exactly how the main developers do, you're essentially stepping into uncharted waters, but you don't have any way of knowing that, because there's no documentation of what's tested and what isn't.  Note also that there would probably need to be at least slightly different specs for different versions so, for example, you can verify that a patch applied to an old version doesn't break the spec for the behavior of that version. Unfortunately I just don't currently have time to contribute to the coding side of things in a meaningful way, and am not likely to until this summer .  Thus I'm being the bad guy that throws stones and runs away, and for that I apologize.  I would certainly be willing to help, for example, sketch out the specs for the module and suggest some tests that might help operationalize those specs. Again, Moodle rocks, and the Workshop Module has enormous potential.  I just think it would benefit everyone if a little structure was brought into its development process.",

Just a correction on your perception here ... the STABLE branches (for all modules in Moodle) are stable, and only receive bug fixes which are then ported to the development trunk (rarely the other way around). You can see the ages of the workshop files in 1.4.3 - there's almost no new stuff in there. Do you perhaps have a copy of the workshop from 1.5dev by accident? I do agree in general that some sort of more formalised testing regime would be useful, it's just so damn difficult with this fluid web stuff!",

          "Text": "Thanks for the correction and my apologies for having read that wrong.  I'd never seen any indication of people releasing patches relative to the stable branch (e.g., \"If you want to add this feature to 1.4.2 apply this patch\") so wasn't clear to me that things happening in the development branch were being made available as patches to stable branches. I'm pretty sure I don't have a 1.5dev copy of the workshop (it's version 2004060401).  It certainly doesn't have the new UI that Gustav has posted about and which sounds like a significant improvement .  The fact that you ask makes me increasingly worried that the workshop part of my DB is corrupted in some fashion . If I'm right and I'm running 1.4.3, then so far I'm 0 for 2 on having implementations of the workshop module from the stable branches that worked in what I would consider a stable way.  And I've found no bugs in any other module. I realize that testing the web stuff is very hard, and particularly so with a module like Workshop that's being constantly modified.  I wouldn't, for example, suggest testing for all the UI elements, because they're just too unstable and ultimately not crucial to things like grades.  What concerns me a lot is the possibility (probability?) that mistakes are going to creep into the complex calculations that determine students grades and can thus profoundly affect their lives.  I suspect that there is an error that could (depending on the way a particular workshop is configured) cause a student to receive a substantially lower grade than the others even if they did all the work that was assigned them, and did it well.  If I'm right, then that's a major problem.  It's unethical at the very least, and potentially the stuff of lawsuits in extreme cases. As far as I can tell, the workshop module has unique risks in this regard.  Other modules do grade math, but it's typically public and transparent so that students and instructors can double check it if they are feeling nervous.  If I'm concerned about the forum module's averaging of peer ratings, it's pretty easy for me to look at a set of ratings, do the average in my head, and then check that the module did it correctly.  The workshop module is an entirely different beast, however, full of black magic and mystery.  There are no specs (that I'm aware of) on things like the allocation algorithm or the algorithm that decides which evaluations to leave out.  Even after running quite a few workshops I'm still not clear on how exactly the grade on how well a student did their assessments is computed, or how exactly it's factored into the overall workshop grade. My point, though, is not to have someone post these here to make me happy.  My point is that the algorithmic backend of the workshop module is Sufficiently important, Sufficiently complex, and Sufficiently opaque that it really needs to be documented carefully and tested.  I'm not suggesting tests for all of Moodle (although that would be wonderful ), or even for the UI parts of the workshop module.  Just the backend where there are these complex, crucial calculations and mistakes aren't easy to detect.",

Looking through the CVS lots for this module, though, there's very little evidence that work in the main branch is ever brought into the stable branch.  In a fair bit of looking I only found two or three examples of that.  This suggests that the workshop for Moodle versions like 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 are essentially whatever was released in 1.4.0 because bug fixes aren't being patched back in to the stable branch.  Given my perception of its stability, that surprises me.  I am, however, guilty of not always posting/documenting bugs (trying to be better), and certainly haven't taken the time to learn the code and contribute .

However, there is the question of what labels to use on these two items. In the case of Gustav's proposed use of Workshop the editor box would be labelled \"Your Work\" (or similar) and the upload form something like \"Your attachment (if required)\". In the case of my workshops, it's really the other way about, the Editor box would be best labelled \"Your notes\" (or similiar) and the upload form becomes \"Your Work\" (or \"Your Submission\"...). I'm thinking of one assignment I run where the students produce a database (in Access ) and it would be really good to ask them to describe the context and the functionality of their database in an editor box which appears on the same page as the upload form (for the database itself).",

Students are well aware of attachments so the upload form itself could be labeled Attachment. The editor box is then used for whatever purpose is given in the workshop's description. I think that might well work... One change might help clarify the student side. At the moment the submission form appears (magically) at the bottom of the student's page. It may be clearer if a link (\"Submit your work here\") is displayed rather than the editor/upload form. The link shows a page which contains just the Workshop's description, the editor box and the upload form (the attachment). That would look a little more like an email. Just a thought...",

What is really nice now about the html editor too is that I can insert a transliteration font for the students to use (or an alternative other standard font). It's a lot easier for me to correct and for them to use than to make them install one on their own computer.  I can't recall why the wiki doesn't suit my needs exactly, but I seem to recall that it involved several other factors-the fact that it doesn't have the nice interface by which I can see what assignments have been submitted and which I have not corrected yet, and moreover, the fact that it can be edited ad nauseum. I need something where the student submits once, and I return it, and the assignment can then be closed.",

          "Text": "You know, there's a lot of good ideas and features from a variety of modules that it might be nice to see combined. I was playing with the \"new assignment\" module today and noticed it had a feature where students could be allowed to see other students' submissions after they had submitted their own (obviously to prevent cheating), which actually inspired an idea. You see, the traditional classroom method of teaching hieroglyphs is for students to write up their transliteration and translation at home, and then while in class, the teacher calls on each student to read (or write on the chalkboard) a single item from the exercise and to parse the grammar. The teacher then critiques what the student presents. What I was inspired to think of was to modify the new assignment module so that students would not gain access to the original assignment submitted by their classmates, but rather the version commented on by the instructor. This would simulate the classroom experience with added value in that students would be able to see everyone's work, not just the one example as is the case in the classroom. I couldn't figure out how to do that yet though. The big problem I have with assignment/new assignment is the fact that a file needs to be uploaded/downloaded. This would be very time consuming. I think also there is a risk of viruses this way (and while ClamAV might help it still isn't up to the level of risk coverage that commercial software is and so it would be necessary to scan files after download ). I just think of some of the kinds of assignments I had to do when I was in high school, like writing short summaries of newspaper articles that were just a couple paragraphs long every week in certain classes. Then I imagine a poor teacher with 150 students having to download every single one of these files to read them, every week. It would be much easier if the whole process were done in the html editor (or perhaps in a wiki). I'll take another look at wiki, and perhaps I will post something later about this. I'd like to hear what kind of assignment you want to use this for, so as to get some more ideas how it might be structured.",

So, I think my question is... Can I use a workshop to setup rubrics for students to view and for me as a teacher to use as an evaluative tool, or is there a better option? If there is not, do others agree that a 'rubric' tool, whereby teachers could set up the rubric with the different criteria, weights, grading options, and a place for feedback would be valuable?  For me it would be amazing.  All of my evaluation takes place through rubrics of projects.  I would LOVE for students to upload their project or provide a link to their project and then complete a rubric that students can view online (complete with the grade entered, etc.) Any thoughts on this?

          "Text": "This weekend I have had to administer several workshops with 100 students in each and this motivated me to make improvements to the user interface of the workshop module. I have submitted the changes to CVS . The teacher now gets a table with all submissions and assessments straight on the main page of the workshop and by clicking on the table entries can view and mark. The table can be sorted by clicking on the table headings. I believe that the old administration page is no longer needed but I have nevertheless provided a link to it so people can compare. I have also changed some internal workings. For example teacher assessments are now used as soon as they are submitted to recalculate the grades and they also immediately show up in the table. In the old days the teacher had to wait until the end of the editing period before his changes were reflected on the administration page. There are countless little tweaks. For example the assessment page now have a resizable frame at the bottom where one can view the submission that is being assessed. That makes for a lot less scrolling up and down the page. Also after viewing or marking a submission or assessment one is returned to the appropriate place in the grade table rather than to the top. Of course I may have introduced may bugs. The workshop module is rather versatile and therefore it is difficult to test it exhaustively. Please let me know if you notice anything strange.",

          "Text": "I would like to propose a new way of thinking about workshop phases that to me appears more natural: a workshop is divided into phases that are separated by the following special dates: Submission start date Assessment start date Submission end date Assessment end date Publication of grades These 5 dates naturally split the workshop into 6 phases: Set up assignment Allow submission Allow submission and assessment Allow assessment Teacher review of grades Show final grades The teacher should be allowed to choose all these dates when setting up a workshop. Now often the teacher will want dates b and c to coincide so that assessment starts on the submission due date. That would eliminate phase 3. Or the teacher may want the assessment period to start at the same time as the submission period by setting dates a and b equal, thereby eliminating phase 2. The teacher may also feel that he does not need the phase 5 in which case he or she can set dates d and e to coincide. In any case I do not see a reason to handle these dates and phases differently for a workshop that is assessed by the teacher only or by teacher and students. I also do not believe that the teacher should be allowed to switch between phases arbitrarily. Moving between phases should be handled solely by the published dates. Anything else leads to unacceptable uncertainty on the part of the student. Of course the teacher will be able to change these dates at any time, but at least these changes will show up immediately in the Moodle calendar.",

But actually I think it's OK because if the teacher wanted to continue to allow \"malleable\" submissions in the Assessment/Submission phase they can set the \"Allow resubmissions\" flag, then submissions which have one or more assessments can be edited. In that way submissions could stay malleable right up to the end of submissions date. Happy to go for full \"auto-piloting\" via these dates, as you say the teacher can always change the dates. Ray",

All logic however uses the dates rather than the phase. I noticed that there is no security in place to prevent students from going directly to the appropriate URL in order submit or edit when they aren't supposed to. At some point we need to add checks using the above dates in the relevant places. I have not yet changed the documentation because I first wanted to hear whether you are happy with the changes. I believe that this is an improvement especially for new users. I remember that the phases always made the workshop module appear complicated. I'll submit my changes now but please feel free to roll them back if you are not happy with them. I have not yet introduced my proposed date \"Publication of grades\" because I am afraid it will be confusing to have both that and your \"Release teacher grades\". I believe there is value in withholding all grades until a certain dates because students are worrying when the first assessment they get in is a low one. They don't realize that they should wait until all assessments are in before worrying. Do you have an opinion on this subject? One could argue that we need three dates: \"Release grades from teacher assessments\", \"Release grades from student assessments\", \"Release final grades\". But perhaps that makes it too complicated? If we go for so many grades we need some javascript trickery in the setup form so that many of them set themselves to sensible defaults.",

This session I kinda converted those rules into the auto grading of assessments and then ported it into the Workshop module as well. It's a bit experimental (and controversal) but it was introduced to avoid the horrendous grading load I have in my courses. In one I've got 50 students doing 6 assessments in a couple of workshops. In another course I've got 500 students doing 7 assessments in a workshop. Thus the need for some sort of automation. But it's good to make it an option. I did have some code to override the grading grade. I think it's gone now because there were circumstances when the automatic grading routine would just go in later and reset it. Perhaps that facility, if it were made watertight, would be useful. I think the code is still in Exercise (as here two assessments is only compared once) but not in Workshop (as here the same two assessments can be compared many times).",

However, I still can't add feedback using the same special font since instructor is not allowed to use the html editor in making the assessment, nor can I make inline comments to what they submitted. In short, I'm back with the New Assignment module as the best option for me so far, but all the uploading and downloading is a bit of a hassle. I have to admit I'm baffled-is there no one here who when they teach using paper that makes comments/corrections directly in the body of the work that the students submit? Why are the no Moodle modules to date that allow a student to submit their work with the html editor, and for the teacher to be able to directly comment within that work using the html editor? Does everyone just scribble one comment at the top of a student's homework? I don't think I've ever taken a class in my life where the instructor doesn't do this, and it seems strange to me that no one has worked out a way to do such a common task in Moodle.",

(like an assignment that might ask a student to fill in a venn diagram, etc.).. Why don't you and I spend some time brainstorming four or five assignment plug-ins, describing the various fields, etc., plus some mock-up pictures of them so that Martin and his developer have a clear idea of what we'd like to see?  I think developers can often work best when we have a roadmap of clearly articulated features.  Maybe, for example, as you think about your in-line assignment feature, we should talk about glossaries that we could develop so that an in-line keyword will trigger a substantial glossary item on a punctuation, grammar, vocab, or composition error? -Tom",

          "Text": "Tom-Well, I need something fairly simple, but there are ways it could be made more sophisticated. What I need is for students to submit translations via the html editor, and then I want to be able to go in and correct them in the html editor as well. This may consist simply of marking everything correct. But if there are mistakes, I want to be able to cross them out, write the correct answer next to it, maybe insert comments about certain things. Now, this could be done simply with just a new version of the file, or an additional copy with my annotations being saved to the db. However, it could be improved beyond that. For instance, the instructor's insertions and markings could be by default in a different color from the student's, so the teacher doesn't have to change the color each time they insert something-or it could even just have a grey background like the autolinked glossary items do. Or the file that would be saved with the teacher's remarks could be separate from the student's original submission, and the student then could have the option afterward of toggling between viewing their original submission, and the marked submission. As you know, I'm going to be teaching hieroglyphs. There is a French CD-Rom for learning basic hieroglyphs that does some nice things, being a self-tutoring product. Students are supposed to transliterate what they see-and as they type, they get a different sound if what they type is correct or not. And I think it changes color perhaps too when it is an error. This sounds similar to what you describe about automatic pop-ups. But these seem like features more appropriate for lessons, which are more for self-learning, whereas at least to me the assignment is more something that the teacher must review, and anything that would make the teacher's job easier in that respect would be helpful. As for another plug-in, my dream would be to see an Oekaki Poteto plug-in that would allow students to be able to draw things and then submit them. I certainly think something like this would be useful for language teachers who are teaching students a new script. Might have other uses too-rather than just fill in a venn diagram-you could have student draw one from scratch.",

One might be a summary, one might be a translation, one might be an analysis, etc...  ( Differentiated learning ...) As for the automatic pop-ups, I'm proposing a system of shorthand. I, too, spend a great deal of time writing on student papers. Often, I'm saying the same thing in the margins. (e.g. sentence fragment, lack of topic sentence, etc.). If many of those comments were pre-written and articulated in a glossary, an assignment could produce an \"editing palette\" where I just pasted in keywords/shorthand links in the student papers that would link to more elaborate (and standardized ) feedback. In any case, graphic mock-ups of what students and teachers would see in these various screens would help our developers.",

The students have all been asked to review 5 documents, plus their own, out of 88 students who submitted work. However four students have been to see me today. Three of them have only been allocated their own work to mark. Another has just been asked to mark one other assignment, plus his own. I've checked a random sample by logging on as different students and at the moment those are the only four like that I can spot, however there may be more. Is there any reason why this is so, or could it be a bug? Also, is there any easy way to find out which submissions each student has been assigned to review? I have stated in the assignment specification that any student who does not complete all their reviews will not receive any marks. I had thought that this would be as simple as to check that they had all completed six reviews, although with this problem this will not be the case. This is quite a concern, so I'd appreciate any thoughts about what is going on. I asked three of the students when they submitted the work - they all said it was the day before the deadline, which could be coincidence or could mean something? I wonder if it could tally with the time when I moved the assignment from stage 2 to stage 3, say the 30 minute editing period, where some assignments are missed? One unrelated question for next time I run this assignment - can the anonymous marking process be turned off. I need student to know whose work they are marking, since a proportion of the marks are based around students assessing each others contributions to the forums. At present we've been having problems with students who have not put their name in their submission. Two other questions that would make administration much easier. Is there an easy way for me to upload a revised version of a student document, (say to add their name), other than hunting through the files to work out which it is and doing a manual replace? Also, is there an easy way to allow a student to edit a review after they have submitted it, or to edit it for them (say when a factual error has been found)? Thanks, Thomas",

Normally the workshop gives out the submissions in a balanced way, so if each student has three submissions to mark, then each submission is only used three times. This sounds sensible but in practise can cause a bit of a bottleneck in giving work to students who want to mark work (having already given the work to students who don't want to mark work). Setting the Over Allocation to one or two frees up some \"extra\" submissions by allowing the workshop to give out a submission four (or five) times rather than the minimal three (in my example case here). In the case of a large group (as is yours) setting it to 1 should do the trick.

You find that one or two of the submissions you allocated to Tom and Dick should have gone to Harry as poor Harry only has two submissions to access as the \"spare\" submission is his own. And Harry's submission should have gone to Tom or Dick. It probably could be avoided if the allocation process was not \"sticky\", once a submission has been allocated to Tom it stays allocated to Tom. There is a reason for that. In the early days the module used to do the allocation more on the fly and if the work was not assessed the student would see a new set of submissions to assess each time they went into the Workshop. Of course what I was told happened was that students were jumping in seeing if they recognised their mates' work, if not they would jump out and jump back in... Sort of cherry-picking the work they wanted to assess. Fendish these students you know .",

Once those pieces of work have been allocated they stay allocated (for reasons explained above). There is obviously no way of knowing the order in which the students will visit the workshop. When the Overallocation level is zero, I think the potential for gumming up is always present because there is a possibility that the work from the last one or two students to visit the workshop might be amongst the remaining pieces of unallocated work. It's unlikely but nevertheless a real possibility. In that case the students would be allocated 2 pieces rather than 3 to mark. That would be avoided if the overallocation level is set to 1. Our \"last students standing\" would then end up with 3 pieces of work and one or two of the submissions would be marked 4 times and their work only twice. A job for Better Algorithms 'R' Us then. Possibly but I suspect there will always be a degree of unbalance as not all the students will do their full allocation of assessments for all sorts of good and not so good reasons. The current algorithm is robust and it works OK within the limits discussed here and really I'm in no mind to change it. Ray",

          "Text": "<Hobby Horse> Mmm, the submission \"process\" is the one area which I think should be kept as clean as possible. We have awful hassles with Blackboard in this very area. There it's called the Drop Box and students have two options - save and send to upload their submissions. Sounds easy as \"save\" uploads the file into the Student's drop box, and \"send\" uploads the file to the Teacher's drop box. Of course, the subtle difference is understandably lost on many students which means lots of work which was \"submitted\" never gets to the teacher. It's not a disaster as the work can be fished out of the student's area and sent onto the right place, the teacher's area, but, as I say, it's a tremendous hassle which could be very simply avoided - don't give students their own drop boxes and only have one option. Locally they don't need/use their own private Blackboard areas anyway because they've got Network space. It's a case of a \"good\" idea being a nightmare in practise. The designers living and breathing Backboard know there are two areas, teachers after using Blackboard for a year know there are two areas but the poor students who may only submit a few things into Blackboard each term/year can't get their heads round that fact. And why should they? At the end of day it's a bad idea. I would really hate for us to fall into the same trap... I suspect a \"student area\" completely divorced from the submission process would be a much safer way to go. Weren't we going to have one of those with DMS, or son of DMS, or something? </Hobby Horse> Ray",

In a possibly related matter, my workshop now has 6 phases, the last of which is called phase6 and seems to be reall \"show grades\"  the fifth stage which is called \"show grades\" is really \"calculate grades\"",

It's a new version so there are changes to the database , please go in as Admin after download /unpacking to get the extra fields and a new table installed. The new features are In the assessment form the teacher can add frequently used comments to a \"comment bank\". So if you are forever typing in \"Good effort but watch your grammar and spelling...\" that comment is now just one click away . The comments are local to an assessment element , so you see them pretty close to where they are used. The auto grading of assessments has been made much more efficient. It was embarrassing how much work the poor cron routine used to do in this area. Now assessments are regraded only when a new assessment arrives on their \"block\". At Gustav's suggestion I've moved the display of final grades back into all phases of the workshop (except Set up) and changed the title to Display of Current grades. It gives a good snapshot of the current state of the workshop, much better than the Administration page (which is still there). I've added a \"Release teacher grades\" date so that the teacher can start marking work but not release their grades until say the deadline is reached. It will probably need revisiting as in general I think the module needs a few more dates or a rethink about using a roll-on/roll-off approach... Finally, I've removed the rather pointless emails the module was sending out about a student assessment being graded, these were pretty close to spam ...

The teacher's assessment are labelled as the teacher's assessment (it may have the teacher's name either on the assessment itself or the email about the assessment), so the students are able to distinguish between assessments done by peers and those done by the teacher. The teacher gets to see names when doing their assessments so from the point of view of the teacher the grading is not anonymous. The only option is the one to show or hide student names on the list of best work. That's the \"League Table\" which can be shown at the end of a Workshop. I would add that the current situation in this area is a bit arbitrary and possibly could use one or two more options to make the whole workshop totally anonymous or totally \"named\".

          "Text": "I just put a new version of the Workshop Module in CVS . This version represents a bit of a milestone. It nows allows students to submit their work directly into the HTML editor as opposed to forcing them to upload an external file. External files are allowed but they are now optional and there can be more than one file attached to each submission. To give an example, students might be asked to create a presentation on a given subject. Their submission might be a description of the context of the presentation typed into the HTML editor together with one or two attachments. The presentation itself would be one attachment while some students might want to attach a sound track file as well to accompany their presentation. This is now possible with this version of workshop. I've also gone though a lot of the options and worked out the various types of assignments available here (see the attached file). In doing this and testing quite of few, I've come to the conclusion that this version draws together the Workshop and Exercise modules. The Exercise module was useful to develop various ideas which have found their way now into the Workshop module. The Workshop module can now be used to run an Exercise-like assignment (Assignment type 2 in the attached file). The only difference in practise is that the students are asked to assess their work after they submit it rather than before submitting. Given the new feature of typing work directly into the on-line editor I think it's more sensible anyway to ask the students to do a \"post-submission assessment\". So I'm thinking of drawing a line in the sand with respect to the Exercise module. It's probably unlikely that I'll put in-line submissions into that module. I would prefer to use the Workshop module more extensively locally (in place of the Exercise module) and concentrate on getting that module more useable.",

I think Martin may have a point about putting all effort into your module to make it the default assignment module, as it really seems to already have a lot of options. I was wondering if teachers may use the html editor to make inline comments on the assignments submitted by the students. Such a feature would make me abandon the standard assignment module altogether myself. I need to be able to markup the work students submit. Another feature it would be nice to see integrated would be an option like the one in the New Assignment module whereby students can see the assessed work of other students immediately after they submit their own work, or perhaps after their own work has been assessed. Such a feature would be very useful in self-paced courses with rolling enrollment and no fixed due dates and would give students a sense they were working together even if students are at different stages at the same time.",

How am I supposed to make detailed corrections (for example, to specific words) to what students submit if I can't make them in-line? And if I can't make them in-line, then the only other practical option is to prepare their homework in Microsoft Word, upload those files, and then I have to download them, open them up, make inline comments to those files and re-upload them (as is now possible with New Assignment). In some types of teaching, there is no way but to allow a teacher to make in-line comments to a student's work. How is an English teacher supposed to correct punctuation, or spelling, or make remarks on a specific sentence? It is very awkward to have to do that in a separate box, and it is a big hassle to have to download and upload 150 essays. I do agree that students shouldn't have the ability to mess with the files of others, but perhaps the comments made by the teacher could be in a different color from what the student used in their original document. I think we can trust teachers to do that, can't we? In short, there are teachers who need to make in-line comments. If they aren't given an easy way to do it with the html editor, they will still do it via Microsoft Word, and waste a lot of time in the process. There's no way to stop in-line commenting, but it can be made easier for teachers to do.",

The problem is, as you pointed out, versioning. How about if the original submission made with the html editor were saved in its original version. A student might want to work on it over time, so they should have the ability to save it and come back to it later. Once they are happy with it, they can then click a button that would notify the teacher the text prepared in the html editor was ready for them to review. When the teacher goes to make inline comments, an exact copy of the original file is presented to them in the html editor, and when they save it with their comments, it is saved as a second, separate file from the original. The teacher could also be given the option to work on it over time, and to click a button to notify the student when they were completely finished with it. When the student logs back in, they are presented with the marked version, with a button that allows them to see their original submission if they so choose.",

Unfortunately, the font for Windows and Mac that I am using, while the same font, has different names on the different systems, which makes it also a problem if I use Microsoft Word to correct assignments, because it won't automatically recognize the different names of the font, but the html editor could. For me, the html editor is the optimal solution for multiple reasons. You know, perhaps Ray's integration of the html editor could be combined with code from the New Assignment module. That allows teachers to upload a second (or I think even multiple) \"feedback\" file in addition to the original submission by the student. Perhaps it could be modified so that instead of saving a file, it saves the content of the html editor in a similar way.",

The in-line submission from the student could be copied into the grade's text field, the teacher works on that and then gives the student's work a simple grade (zero to n). The grade is probably not the most important thing here, it's the in-line comments. It will work if the student re-submits, the teacher has another grade entry for the re-submission and so gets another copy to work on... Now the current grading strategies are Accumulative , Error banded, Criterion and Rubric . This new one could be called In-line Comments , nothing like calling a spade a spade .

The teacher asks each student to go write their transliteration and translation on the chalkboard for a single sentence, and then critiques what they wrote before the entire class.

          "Text": "This version brings the Workshop module closer to both the original assignment module and the exercise module. When the workshop module is used for a simple assignment (see the attached file) it now makes no reference to student assessments and their grades (there were zeros in a few of the tables). The assignment is very like the original assignment module but with fancy assessment forms and optional attachments. The assignment is in three phases/stages - Set up where the assessment form is created; Student submissions where students submit work and the teacher grades it; and Closed where the optional league table of best submissions can be displayed. To make the module closer to the Exercise module I've added an optional password and the flagging of late submissions. Also an exercise-like workshop only has three phases (like the simple assignment workshop) as opposed to the \"standard\" five phases when peer assessment is involved. (There's a new internal flag which is used to switch various bits on and off depending on the \"type\" of the workshop being run, again see the attachment for a few more details.) It certainly needs a bit of field testing but the module is  showing better \"scaling\" now. Simple assignments are beginning to look simple and the more complicated assignments switch on extra features.",

This means you can change the assignment grade at any time which is nice.] Your only(?) problem could be any assessments done while the grades in the error bands were incorrect (that is scaled in the range 0-100 instead of 0-50 in your case). I suspect those will be double what they should be. You'll need to goto in the Administration page and check out several assessments to see if that pans out. In the workshop module the grade that gets displayed at the top of the assessment page is the figure that stored in the database. In the fullest of time I want be change the Workshop module so that it stores grades in the same way as the Exercise module, but I need to think through how and where existing assignments can be preserved.

I have resubmissions turns on, and some (all?) of them are having nasty problems when they try to re-submit.  They get a second entry in their list of submissions, but it has no title (and thus no link) and they can't delete that entry and other students can't assess it (since it's not there). Oddly, the second entry does show up in the instructor's Administration view.  When I look in the file system, there are directories for the new entries, but those directories are empty. Is the upload failing somehow and leaving the DB in a corrupt state? BTW , this does not appear to be the same as the problem of special characters in file names. I've got a bunch of students who want to resubmit based on the excellent feedback they got from there peers, so any help would certainly be appreciated. Many thanks -- Nic",

          "Text": "Ouch . So just to make sure I'm understanding this clearly, the database for the workshop I'm currently running is pretty much messed up and there's no reasonable way to make multiple submissions work for this workshop. (Which means that I'm going to have to significantly re-work this assignment on the fly, but I guess that's why they pay me .) And if I want to allow/require resubmissions in any future workshops, I'll need to upgrade or patch. I'm using whatever version of the workshop came with 1.3.4 when we first installed Moodle a few weeks ago: $module->version = 2004052100; $module->requires = 2004051600; // Requires this Moodle version $module->cron = 60; The new workshop sounds quite excellent and several of the improvements look very appealing, but I'd been hoping to avoid an upgrade until the semester ended in case things went boom. (I can't perform the upgrades myself due to permissions issues, and depend on the goodwill of a sysadmin to do these things for me.) Not having ever done a moodle upgrade: Is there a patch that would patch my older version? (Or could such a patch be generated?) Would that be desirable, or should I just upgrade to the new workshop (in a production environment )? Can I upgrade just the workshop w/o upgrading the entire Moodle install? Will upgrading the workshop lead to changes in the database that can't easily be undone (i.e., we can't jump back and forth between the old and the new workshop to see what we think of them)? One idea we've had would be to just run two consecutive workshops, one for the initial draft and the second for the \"final\" product, and probably have the first count for less in the grade than the second. Would it be simplest to just do something like that for the rest of the term and then try to upgrade in January after grades are done and turned in? Many thanks for your quick response on this. -- Nic",

          "Text": "This may be a long post, because I need to explain how we are planning to use Moodle. Please bear with me. I have been asked by a NGO to create Moodle courses from content I have helped them create. We do not have any full time, formal teachers but rather a (small) group of volunteers that will help with student queries and asessments. This is why the workshop module was so apealing-- it would allow for peer assessments. My problem now lies with the limitations the different phases of the workshop module puts on us. At the moment I am planning to leave the workshops in phase 3--- meaning students would always be able to post and assess projects. But when do they receive the results? The other option is to periodically move the workshop into phase 6 and then move it back to phase 3 a week or so later. 1. What is the consequences of leaving it in phase 3 all the time --- ditto for the jumping between phase 3 and 6 every 6 or 7 weeks ??? 2. If you have a course that is available to the public on the www, how do you handle issues that result from not having structured start and end dates for courses? I do not think we will have such a large potential user base that we could have duplicated courses that run at monthy intervals of each other (hopefully later )",

In phase 3 students will see the submissions which have been assessed the least number of times. So it's likely that they will see the work from their own cohort.

There's the Maxeditingtime (usually set to 30 miniutes) which hold submissions and assessments back. If it's a test server that time can be cut back to 5 minutes or less to avoid the delays.

With the \"Overallocation\" factor set to zero (use the Administration page to see and change this value) each submission will only be allocated twice. With the low figure of 2 peer submissions you probably need to set the Overallocation to 1 or 2. That will free things up and give your waiting students something to assess. I normally get my students to assessment 4 or 5 peer submissions and things appear to go smoothly then (with an overallocation value of zero).",

In one of my courses students are asked to create a PowerPoint presentation. There are too many students (over 300) for the students to give live presentations, their work is assessed as stand-alone (multimedia) pieces of work. The workshop asks students to first assess a number of example presentations, this introduces the students to the scope of the presentations and how they are assessed. They prepare their own presentation and, once they've assessed the examples, submit it on-line. They are then give a number of the new presentations to assess. In this course, the students are asked to assess 4 examples and 5 of new presentations. (In another of my courses the numbers were 3 and 4 respectively and the work was a report produced in Word.) When the dust has settled from the assessing and submissions, the assessments are \"analysed\". Before that, however, I grade the example presentations, in my case I have 14 examples. These represent the benchmark assessments against which the students assessments are judged. Remember the students were asked to assess (four of) these. The analysis looks at how well each student judged these examples. It is looking to discard a number of the student assessments (the proportion is set by the teacher). It compares each set of (student) assessments of each piece of work (in my case that up to 5 assessments). If the student performed poorly when assessing the example assessments their assessments of the \"real\" work is treated with suspiction and their assessments are much more likely to be dropped then those from students who did well with the examples. At this stage I have only assessed the examples, in my case that's 14 assessments. The analysis might show that some of the new pieces of work have either no assessments (they've all been dropped) or, more likely, the assessments have markedly different grades. In these exceptional cases I would go in and assess the work. I would/should also assess a sample of the pieces of work, usually some at the top, some in the middle and some at the bottom of the range of grades. With those done, the analysis is repeated. This time with more \"teacher\" assessments the judgement of the student assessments will be sharper. In fact, the analysis can weight the teacher's assessments and if the teacher is not the \"best\" assessor extra weighting on the teacher's assessments can make the teacher the top assessor. Sounds complicated but in practise it means the students are doing a lot of the assessment. A real advantage in my case where I've got 300+ students. In order to show that the teacher takes these assessments seriously the grade for the assignment can have an assessment element in addition to the (average) grade given to the actual piece of work. Thus we're asking the student not only to produce something but to be aware of what's good and bad in that work. The Workshop module can also ask the student to self assess their work. In my case I've not included that, I feel there's enough assessment going on already. Finally, the students see the (peer and teacher, if there is one) assessments of their work and (optionally) a list of the best submissions and so the discussions can go on... Hope that gives some flavour of the module, Ray",

          "Text": "Hello, Martin, et. al.... I'm also using workshop module for the first time and also having the same difficulty with the module calculating grades substantially lower than the maximum points available.  For example, I am using \"criterion\" grading where students can select the \"suggest grade\".  I have 20 points (or is it percent???  I can not tell from any documentation?) available for a perfect suggested grade.  However, if a student selects 20 for another students' perfect grade, they are given a score of 4.0 (which happens to be 20% of 20...). I therefore am concluding (and am altering scoring criterion's suggested grade) that the suggested grades in criterion scoring must be in percent and not in whole points.  It would be nice to know this, i.e., how about \"suggested percent correct\" or some other label than \"suggested grade\" or \"suggested score.\" I'm thinking I'm on the right track here but with all the options and all the grading going on, it is confusing when I am not sure what the unit measure of the grade actually is and which seems to vary depending on which type of grading is employed.  Moreover, once students have assessed another student with a faulty measure, e.g., 20% rather than a perfect score of 20, it seems the module will not recalculate the appropriate grade of 20 POINTS when you change the criterion measure to 100% of 20 (to yield a score of 20) when it was first calculated with, e.g., 20% of 20 (yielding a score of 4.0). Hence you and I are experiencing some of the same issues, I'm sure. It would be useful to have a unit measure in POINTS and not in percent option. It would be useful to have an edit function in the gradebook (or recalculation feature in the module) to fix faulty-calculated grades. It would be useful to have standard unit measures regardless of grading method or documentation relative to unit measure of grades. I have had to tell students that I'll work this out and get back to them.... Ray is pretty helpful.  I'm sure he'll help us both out here as I'm sure there are probably 50 other people or more in the world with the same issue.

You will need the latest CVS version of the module, as I've fixed some bugs in that code recently. The Analysis does not require the teacher to do any grading of assessments (the good news) but to grade a sample of the submissions (the bad news).  I've run a few workshops using this newer method and they give quite sensible results when I have assessed about 15% to 20% of the submissions. The trick is to do the analysis after assessing about 10%, look at the analysis and then assess those submissions which look extreme or have widely varying student assessments. The more assessments the teacher does the tighter the process gets, the help file explains it all. At some stage I plan to drop the grading of assessments from the module in favour of the \"Analysis of assessments\".",

          "Text": "Yes, I agree. In the light of other comments I'm revising the way the Workshop module tackles the calculation of the final grade. What it needs to do is compare the students' assessments (and the teacher's assessments, if available) across the piece. Using standardised distances it is possible to rate the students' assessments and from them produce a rank table of good to poor assessors. The tail end of that table can be discarded and the grades of the submissions calculated using just the assessments from the \"good\" assessors. The current module uses \"Bias\" and \"Reliability\" measures but these are currently too blunt, they do not go \"inside\" the assessments. The new approach will use multi-demensional distances and look at the scores from the elements of the assessments, hopefully, a much more sensitive measure. Further the current module has no mechanism of dropping poor assessments. The new version will be able to drop poor assessors. Having a preliminary look at some of the data I'm getting from a live workshop I'm not too impressed by the standard of the student assessments. The new version will have the option to weight any of the teacher's assessments more than those from the students. This option gives the teacher, if you like, the ability to stand out above the noise and if necessary force the teacher to become the \"best\" assessor on the block. Further the method does not require the teacher to assess absolutely everything, just sufficient to stamp their \"sanity\" on the assessment process. The good assessors are then the students that \"grade like the teacher\" and they are helping by grading the work which possibly the teacher did not get round to grading. Sounds good but how well it works in practise will be interesting to see. I'm hoping to get something out this month. Ray",

Number of assessments of student submissions: 1 Self Assessment: Yes I logged in as each of the students, submitted work.  Each student was given the option of evaluating their own work.  Everything fine so far.  But... neither student is ever given the option of evaluating the work of their peer.  (I waited for things to trickle through the system... no change). So, I went ahead and changed the Number of assessments of students submissions to 2 (thinking one for their self-assessment plus one for their peer), and that fixed the problem: they each were given the other student's paper to evaluate. Ok, great.  But... the help information on \"Self Assessment\" indicates that it shouldn't work that way: \"A workshop assignment can optionally include the student's own work in the set of pieces each student is asked to assess. This will mean that if, say, the number of student pieces of work each student has to assess is set at 5, then each student will be asked to assess 6 pieces of work, one of them being their own work \" [emphasis added].

          "Text": "Hi there, I just wrapped up my first \"real world\" use of the workshop module: a short paper assignment given to a class of 18 graduate students.  Each student was given the task of evalauting their own paper and the paper of three of their peers. The really big thing: it worked!  Moodle did a good job of distributing papers and the interface was clear enough that people could figure out how to use it.  Well, mostly, with just the the exception of two students who managed to disregard instructions given in each criteria element... in ALL CAPS none-the-less... that the grading scale was 1-100 for each... instead grading their peers on 1-10 scale.) Yay! The only thing I found myself wishing for was: 1. My own clearer understanding of how the reliability and bias are computed... clearly the values are of iffy usage with only 4 or so evaluations per paper. 2. More options in how the grade is computed--a couple of different algorythm options that might offer ways to help compensate or de-value the weight of extreme outlying grades.  Right now most of the mechanisms for determing how good a grade is seem to rest on punishing or rewarding the person who did the evaluation.  I'd like to also see some options for calculating the grade of the paper assessed. (Having said that, I appreciate the very nifty and revolutionary notion incorporated in the M odule  that so much attention is given to the importance of teaching and giving evaluation on the learned skill of giving good evaluations for one's one work and the work of one's peers.) 3. It would have been handy for me to see a \"League Table\" of all the grades listed in order of highest to lowest, and then from that table to make the decision on the cut-off point for the papers included in the displayed league table. 4. It might be nifty as an option (just an option) that, at the end of the assignment, students can see how their evaluation scores for a given piece of work compared to the evaluation scores and feedback given by their peers to that same piece of work. Thanks again for this great module! John",

One of the most difficult things for a student to learn is how to write good mathematics. How can we teach our students the art of stating theorems and writing proofs? The answer of course is: by giving them many examples and giving them much practice at writing their own. The examples should include good and bad ones. Identifying the deficiencies in bad proofs is as educational as analyzing good proofs. The only problem is: who is going to provide all the examples of good and bad proofs? And who is going to look at all the proofs that the students write for practice? I, the lecturer, simply don't have enough time. Peer marking is the answer of course. And the workshop module makes it possible. Many thanks to Ray.",

Sounds OK but I'm not particularily happy with these measures. I'm now thinking of using distances from the means as a easier-to-understand concept. They will work closer to the \"wood\", in the sense of using the raw values from the individual scales rather than the overal grade scores. I think that will make them more robust. What's needed is a measure to take out the \"jokers\" from the pack. I think using multi-dimensional distances could do just that.

I want the module to work out so that each student self-assesses their own paper and also assesses the work of one of their peers. So, the number of assessments of student submissions is set to 1 and self assessment is set to yes. 3. I can login as either of the two users and submit and self-assess the work. 4. I can login as the administrator/instructor and assess the work that students have submitted. But, heres the problem: Neither student is given the others paper to gradethats true if I have it in either the submit and assess phase or just the assess phase. According to the module, there are no papers for them to assess other than their own. As another quirk, but may be related, if I as course instructor go to administer I can view things just fine in the table under Student Assessments, but on the table under Student Submissions if I click on the List Assessments (2) link (2 is right.. one self-assessment from the student and one from me), I get nothing except a continue to click on, as if nothing is there. I can, however, click Edit and pull up my instructor assessment of the paper. So Any idea whats up? Up until now Moodle has behaving like a dream for me. Im running the latest development version (well, the one downloaded from yesterday). In general Ive had great luck with the development version, with the exception of the journal bug from a few days ago that was fixed (it wasnt showing any journal articles that were submitted by students, but now thats fixed in the latest download ). Any ideas?  I've got two courses this semester that I'd love to use this on, so it would be terrific to figure this out soon. John",

          "Text": "Hello Ray, This is an update on the most recent version of the workshop module. I updated on the 14th, and received word from several students that they could no longer see their grades. I solved this by going back into all of the previous workshops and advancing each to step 6 (remember that I had previously never taken any workshop to that leval because of the \"very public\" league submission table that showed all students' scores - right down to the lowest). Taking each workshop into step 6 allowed the grades to be displayed, along with the factors used and their weightings. Tonight, I closed the most recent workshop. It was started using the version just before 20031014 (Oct 7th?), and I updated to the Oct 14th version after starting the workshop. In the present workshop, I let them submit right up to the end, and then took it to the calculate grades stage (stage 5). However that point I could not access the grade calculation algorighm. An error message was displated that the workshop was not in the correct phase or correct stage. Anyway, it was not possible to access the screen for allocating different weights to the different factors. As an alternative strategy, I took the module into stage 6 and part of the grades were displayed, albeit with incorrect weighting factors. It seemed like the entire step 5 was skipped over, leaving only the previously selected evaluation criteria (peer evaluations weighted at 1, bias weighted at 1 and reliability weighted at 1). It seems to be a bug. I hope you might be able to shed some light. Thanks. Rick",

          "Text": "That's fixed it Ray.  Thanks a lot. Here is a thought (not a problem!).  One of the questions I have had during the past month, is whether there is a correlation between procrastination and validity in grading.  Some students submit their labs quickly, but most wait until the deadline and then submit.  After submitting, they hurriedly grade the 5 submissions given to them.  If I allocate a week to do the lab and make the peer assessments, more than half of the class wait until the last day to do it.  I suspect (but cannot prove) that this behavior has affected their rating validity, but can't check it easily.  It is easy to see when they have evaluated the sample submission.  That's how I figured out that most people were likely procrastinating.  However I can't easily see when they have made their own submission, nor when they have evaluated others.  I can find it out by going into the specific evaluations, but it takes some work. This kind of issue is probably not crucial, nor is it something to consider unless one has nothing to do sometime, and nothing else to think about.... Rick",

          "Text": "I've just put a new version of the Workshop module into CVS . It hopefully solves some the operational problems reported recently. The new version should: 1. Allocate peer assessments to students in a \"static\" fashion. That is once a peer assessment has been allocated it sticks, refreshing the screen will not give a different set of allocations. This solves the \"cherry picking\" problem. (The allocation method is now the same as that used for allocating the teacher examples if they are present.) 2. There is now an option to force the allocation of peer assessments to be balanced. The default is for balanced allocation which says every submission must be assesed the same number of times. The teacher can relax this if required and that will allow for a more speedy allocation of submissions. 3. The student phase of submitting and assessing (peer) submissions has been split. So teachers can, if they wish, get in all the submissions then go into the peer assessment phase. 4. In the final phase, the league table of the best submissions has a couple of new options. The teacher can now control whether it's present or not and they can control its length, for example just show the ten top submissions. The second option is used to switch off the student names in the table. On the last point I think from the student's point of view a workshop assignment is anonymous (provided the names in the league table are switched off). I can't see any other places where students see other students (but I may be wrong ) One thing which needs tackling is the re-submission of work by students in a peer assessment. It is there at the moment but it wouldn't work too well . I think what should happen (but doesn't) is that when the student re-submits work it automatically get allocated to the same set of students who assessed that student's work first time round. It would be nice if they were shown their original assessment on the same page as the new assessment form (or even just their old assessment to modify). Not sure which is less confusing.",

I received your posting at 2:30pm on Thursday afternoon and (silly me) immediately updated moodle via cvs update -dP. The update took my system to development version 1.2 with a date of 20030918000. After I saw that I remembered a posting by Martin to the effect that the cvs server would update about 24 hours later. Well naturally I tried earlier than 24 hours, and naturally your changes still weren't recorded. However it is now just about 45.5 hours since you filed them and the Sourceforge server is still not updated. Maybe we have to expect a two day turnaround on the Sourceforge server. I have another lab in progress right now. After I apply the update, do you think the changes will be able to be applied to the present lab? On a slightly different issue, I have a question about the calculation of the reliability statistics. I'm using a combination of peer assessments and reliability to calculate student's marks. Each student is evaluating 5 others so there should be enough data to get a fairly accurate judgment of their reliability. However, in a class of about 80 students, 48 of them have a reliability grade of 0%. Of the other 32 students, the highest reliability grade was 83% and many were under 30%. I had originally weighted the peer assessments and reliability grades equally with a weighting of 1, but had to switch thing a bit when the 0% reliability estimates decreased the grade on the lab by half! Now I am using a weighting factor of 2 for the peer assessments and 0.1 each for bias and reliability. I'm not sure what to make of a 0% reliability calculation. If you can provide some additional information on how it is calculated, I would appreciate it. Thanks.",

          "Text": "Rick, yes I think the new changes will work OK in an \"running\" workshop. The only thing is that if one of the submissions is already over-allocated it will stay over-allocated. The new code only STOPS submissions from being over-allocated (it wont take allocations away, no need for it to do so in normal circumstances). Ah, Statistics The reliability score is some sort of measure on how well an individual student \"tracks\" the mean (peer) grade given to the submissions they graded. I could have calculated each student's score and then scaled those scores appropriately to give a range 0% to 100%. (Obviously, it's an inverse scaling the bigger the deviations from the group means the lower the score.) I thought I would be clever and use some \"absolute\" measure for the most unreliable bottom limit. I calculate a \"dumb\" reliability score which is for the mythical student who scores anything with the overall grade mean across all submissions. That is, the \"most unreliable\" thing you can do is to give the same grade to all the submissions you assess. If you happen to do worse than this the reliability score goes negative, You can't give negative score to students, so negative scores are set to zero. Thus the large number of zero reliability scores, the 48 students are doing no better than if they gave the same scores to all they submissions. But there are some caveats to make. Firstly that the submissions themselves should cover a fairly wide RANGE of grades. If all the submissions should be graded in the band 80% to 70% say it's a bit difficult to put too much weight on any reliability measure. Better for the submissions to range from very poor to excelent. Secondly, the MAJORITY of the students must be good \"judges\". this gives the means of the peer assessments some meaning (excuse the pun). If you like you can think of this in an iterative way, you look at all the students and measure (in some way) their reliability. You then pick out the most unreliable judges (basically those who don't agree with the majority's views). You really wouldn't want to throw out too many at that stage, perhaps 5% or 10% of the students. You then calculate the reliability scores again because you have got rid of a lot of the \"noise\" caused by those poor judges. You might throw a few more away. You're then left with \"good\" judges and you use their peer assessments in the final grade calculations. Note the module does NOT do this (but might, and probably should, in the future). The option \"Include teacher's grade in the peer assessments\" is an attempt to bring some \"sanity\" into the peer assessment by including the grades from a \"very good judge\". That, of course, requires the teacher to grade all the submissions Having read all this you'll probably want to turn off reliability (and bias) off completely! This you can do by simply by setting the Weight to zero. It then all vanishes from sight (and mind)! As you, I'm sure, suspect, this area of the module needs a lot more trialing and development.

The comments and grade can be seen in the Workshop Assignment 'Lab 4.3' You can see it in your Workshop Assignment Lab 4.3. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In checking the Lab 4.3 link, I got a message to the effect that the \"Workshop Module is incorrect.\" It is not possible to go directly to the comments because of the module incorrect error. Is this a problem? If so, I can delete the present workshop and then create another with the new version of the software. If I wait until tomorrow night, there will be quite a few students who have done the work, so a go/no go decision is best made soon. Thanks. Rick",

It seems like the normal operation of step 3 in the workshop is to assign the 'n' number of assessments and to set them up with initial values of 0 in the evaluation elements.  I saw that last night, and mistakenly assumed that they were assessments which had actually been done incorrectly (i.e. actual material but 0's for all the elements).  In reality, it seems that when the student does the assessments, the real values replace the 0's.  For awhile I valiantly strove to delete all of these (what I called) null assessments, then finally clued in to the fact that they were operating something like placeholders for the real evaluations made later.  I learn slowly, but I don't remember much.

          "Text": "Just a brief note. Yes the module creates, if you like, \"holding\" assessments when it has allocated a piece of work to a student. I call these \"hot\" assessments. As you found the teacher can see these on their administration page, perhaps they would be better hidden? Again, as you spotted, when the student does the assessment the zeros get filled with grades. The assessment is then \"warm\". After the editing time (normally 30 minutes) the assessment goes \"cold\" and the assessemnt is made available to the owner of the piece of work. I'm quite pleased with the hot->warm->cold analogy for the assessments and find it useful in the code. It's probably a good idea NOT to show the teacher the hot assessments on the administration page. I'll think about it. Oh, the other thing you raised, I now have had a think ( ) and what would work best would be to add (yet another) phase to the Module. The phases would be: Setup->Submissions Only->Submissions and Assesments->Assessments Only->Calculate grades->Display Grades That's SIX phases However, it does give, I think, the flexibility that's needed. So you could go from Submission Only straight to Assessments only if you wanted a \"clean\" break between the two, or you could leave the assignment in the Submissions and Assessments phase if you were happy to let the submissions trickle in and get assessed on-the-fly. That will, I hope, suit all sorts of assignments. What do you think? Ah, not such a short note and this tread is all over the shop, time to start another me thinks Ray",

If you could add a sixth phase to the module I would certainly appreciate it.  I think your approach is elegant and will allow for all the grading options anyone could wish.  I've already prepared my class for this feature when it is available.  Over the past month my students have procrastinated by leaving the submission of their own lab and the marking of their 5 peers until the last day.  This makes their grading less reliable and it messes up the assignment of evaluators.  Being able to require them to post their own submission by a deadline will help them to keep up-to-date with their work, and I think it will make their work more accurate. On the display grades feature I have a question.  Each time I calculate the grades, the students can see their grades.  This is in the step before the display of their grades.  In other words, they can see the effect of me trying different weighting strategies on the peer assessments, bias and reliability.  Several students have enquired as to why their grades change before their eyes.  If possible, it would be really helpful if the display of grades is suppressed until the last phase.  Since I haven't been using a league table, I have never taken any workshop past the calculate grades phase.   Thanks.

So teachers can, if they wish, get in all the submissions then go into the peer assessment phase.\"). When I initially read your post, I interpreted this point to mean that I can now set a submission deadline time for my students, after which it is not possible for them to make additional submissions. I can see that this is working in my present lab, because it is now in step 2 and nobody is being given any peer work to assess, even though they have made their own submission and are ready to assess others. After all of the submissions are in, I can then take the workshop into step 3 and let them do assessments. Since all of the student submissions will be in, the system can do a random allocation of peer assessors and they can all get to work assessing one another. Then when we get to the end of the workshop, I can take the system to step 4 and grade them. Finally, I can take it to step 5 and release the marks. This morning I woke up with a bad hunch that in fact I might not be able to stop them from submitting after the workshop is taken into step 3. Right now, I have 19 students who have submitted their lab and are waiting to be allowed to assess others. Naturally they want to get going, but I am delaying (inconveniencing?) them by waiting a bit longer so that more submissions can be received before allowing people to evaluate one another. The other 61 students have not yet submitted. They could be busy or they could well be waiting until I open the assessment stage and THEN they will submit their work. They could be thinking that if they time it well, they can quite possibly get their friend's paper to grade (and vice versa). Are my worries true or false? If they are false, I am happy because your modifications will have completely eliminated most of the problems which have arisen when using the workshop module in a lab situation. If my worries are true, the introduction of the extra step may not really solve the problem of random allocation of assessors. It \"sort of\" works, because the few students who do the lab early are held back until there is a pool of submissions big enough to ensure some randomness. However the slow ones can still mess things up by waiting until the last day. They have a slight chance of getting friends' papers to grade, but I have no way of ensuring that everyone's work is available before assigning the evaluators to all of the submissions. Again, assuming my worries are true, one way of getting around it is to make step 3 a switch which turns off the possibility of making further submissions. Step 2 allows submissions but doesn't allow grading, while step 3 allows grading but doesn't allow any more submissions. I hope you can understand my rambling question. Thanks. Rick",

The student(s) who did to the assessment(s) are asked to assess the new piece of work and they are shown the assessment form already filled out (using their assessment of the old peice of work). If a student has been asked to assess a piece of work which gets replaced by a new submission, AND they haven't yet done that assessment, that allocation is deleted.

          "Text": "Hi, it's Danielson again. I'm into lab 2 now and have found a new phenomenon (my error? program feature? bug?). The workshop is in phase 2 and students are actively engaged in evaluating my one sample submission, submitting their own lab and evaluating 5 others. At the present time there have been 304 submissions, 65 of which are evaluations of the sample submission. This one doesn't count, so there are 239 \"real\" submissions. When I look at the administration screen I can calculate the 239 (i.e. 304 total submissions minus 65 sample submissions = 239 student submissions of other students' work). Further down in that report I can also see that 239 assessments have been made of 51 students' labs. The problem is that 10 lab submissions have been assessed 6 times each. The number of student assessments (minus the 65 sample evalutions) matches the number of evaluations of student submissions (239 evaluations of 51 students' submissions). No assessor has done too many assessments (checked that in the student assessments report), but 10 students have had too many assessments done on their work. Therefore, some of the assessors seem to have been mistakenly assigned to evaluate the wrong students' labs. This is probably not a horrendous statistical situation, since theoretically, the more evaluations that are done of a student's work the more \"valid\" the average evaluation. It is horrendous however, from the point of view of the poor professor who has to explain to students why 6 assessments were made of their work when only 5 were supposed to have been made, and why the same poor professor cannot \"drop the lowest score\" because it would mean that the dropped student assessors would lose some their assessments. The poor professor is in a bind because he has based the grading system on an equal weighting of the 5 assessments done by others and the reliability score of the assessments the given student makes of other students' labs. From what I can see, the poor professor is between a rock and a hard place. He can't delete the extra assessments of the 10 over-assessed students because by doing so he decreases the number of assessments done by the assessors. Again, from a statistical point of view, the more assessments a student makes (i.e. 5) the more accurately the system can determine his/her reliability. Therefore, one cannot delete any assessments that as student has made because he will decrease the accuracy of the reliability estimate. Forgive me for this long explanation. I hope that I have made some error which I can correct. If that is not the case, I hope I can explain my way out of the problem. If that is not the case I don't know what to hope for.",

Does anyone complete a workshop from designing assignments, and peer feedback sheet to generating the final grade? I am preparing an experiment about peer feedback and I would like to use the workshop function in Moodle. I tried to figure out the procedures for a complete workshop but I just can not get the clue. I need to know whether the workshop module works or not in the 1.0.9 version to decide whether I will go on using it for the experiment or make a paper-based peer feedback assignment. For example, in my moodle site I established an assignment (assignment A) as a teacher. I submitted assignments in word documents with several student accounts. I also set up a workshop for assignment A, and upload a teacher assignment and assess it (I supposed it can be the example for student assessors to learn from). then I submitted assignments with different student accounts.  But the problems are: When login as a teacher, I can find the uploaded student files from the assignment module, but I can not connect them to the workshop module. Does it imply it is another way of asking students to submit assignments for giving peer review? What is that? When I login as a student, I can not find the content of the workshop, indicating unavailable, even there is already a link on the left column. What should be done to make it available? By the way, it seems no procedure for te teacher to allocate student assignments to student assessors. Are they random assigned for students to give feedback? If I login as a student will I see the exact the assignments I have to assess? Cheers.",

Previously the student assessments of this pre-submission work had to be \"signed-off\" by the teacher before the student could proceed (to submit their own work). In practice this was a bit cumbersome and complex (and confused both me and my students ). So, the current version still has this pre-submission feature but the students automatically (automagically?) go onto submit their own work once they have completely the required number of assessments (usually of work salvaged(?) from previous cohorts). The \"intervention\" of the teacher is not required. The teacher can still grade and give feedback on these assessments but the \"grading grade\" (the teacher's mark for the assessment) is NOT shown to the student. The student does, however, get to see the feedback comments if the teacher makes any. This seems to work OK in practice and still gives enough \"dialogue\" between teacher and student in the early sages of the assignment. If the teacher does do any grading of these early assessments then they can be carried forward as part of the student's final grade for the assignment.",

When the teacher created a workshop, it implies that the students are given an assignment before they can give peer feedback to each other. They have to upload their finished assignments to the workshop. 2. The teacher must go to phase 2 in the workshop so that the students can upload their assignments. In other words, it is kind of activating the workshop. You can give a test as follow: using two computers, one login as teacher, and other login as student, when the teacher stays in phase 1, the workshop for the student is \"not available\"; when the teacher click on the last link to go to phase 2, the student can click on the workshop again and he can upload the assignments to the workshop. (It is not common that a link will decide something). 3. When more than students upload the assignments, it seems the system will randomly allocate the student assessors. Students will see the assignments they have to give feedback when they enter the workshop and they can assess the assignments but both teachers and students will not receive others' assessment submissions immediately after the submission. At least we wait for at least 10 minutes or so to get the links to view the assessment submissions. This was where we got the most confusion but it is clear.",

Yes, a workshop assignment, by it's very nature must be \"phased\", it's more complicated than the standard Moodle assignment. The new tabbed teacher screen should help show what's going on.

Yes but the allocation is not quite that random, the module tries to \"share out\" the submitted work as evenly as possible.

          "Text": "Gosh, what a lot of questions! Here goes... \"I can find the uploaded student files from the assignment module, but I can not connect them to the workshop module...\" -- True, files for the workshop module are submitted within a workshop assignment. There's no linkage (as yet?) between the resource file area and the module. \"...Does it imply it is another way of asking students to submit assignments for giving peer review? What is that?\" -- Yes within the workshop assignment. If the assignment does not have any (teacher submitted) examples of work then the students see an upload screen. (The default is NOT to have any examples of work to assess before the students submit their own work.) \"When I login as a student, I can not find the content of the workshop, indicating unavailable, even there is already a link on the left column. What should be done to make it available?\" -- That means the workshop assignment is still in it's first (set-up) stage. In this stage the teacher sets up the assessment form, submits any example pieces of work, possibly assesses them and then opens up the assignment to the students. Using the latest version of the module with its tabbed teacher screen should make things a bit clearer. \"By the way, it seems no procedure for te teacher to allocate student assignments to student assessors. Are they random assigned for students to give feedback? If I login as a student will I see the exact the assignments I have to assess?\" -- True, I thought it would be too tedious to do manual allocation of work to students when handling large classes. As it's automatic there had to be some constraints on it. Briefly, firstly, the student has to submit their work before they get allocated other students' work, and secondly the next piece of work to be allocated is the one which has had the fewest allocations (appearances?) (if two or more pieces of work share that honour, one is choosen at random). I've recently \"stablised\" the allocation process so that when a student goes into the assignment they see all the pieces of work they have to assess (given there are enough submissions \"in the pot\"). (Before they saw them only one at a time.) Even if they don't assess those pieces there and then they \"stick\" to that student, they may be added to, but those submissions will always appear for that student. Hope that helps",

          "Text": "This afternoon we tried a new workshop assignment with three student acounts (st001, st002 & st003). We set that every student will assess one peer's assignment. St002 submitted an assignment after st001, and received st001's assignment for assessment right away. Then st003 submitted an assignment and received st001's assignment for assessment, too. Then we logged in as st001 and found that st001 had to assess st003's assignment.  It means, no one will assess st 002's assignment. After that we changed the parameter that every student has to assess two peer's assignments. It is good that we found the three students are evenly assigned to assess two other peers' assignment. It seems to be risky that students will receive other's assignment for assessment right after they submit the assignment. It is doubtful if st001 is usually the first student to submit the assignment and st002 is usually the second, will st002 usually receive st001's assignment to assess? Would it be better to set the allocation of student assessors as an action (maybe a button for teachers to click when the teacher thinks it is about time to do it) or set a start date for the allocation when setting up a workshop module? It would be interesting to see in our experiment how the allocation goes when we have 8 students for peer feedback",

It is very automatic, and you're right in saying that's the first students who submit work get eachother's work. I'm very conscious that the module is complex and an early version indeed did have two dates, the first date marking the divide between submitting work and assessing work. That did seem unnecessarily rigid so I removed that date leaving just the single final deadline date. Now that the phasing of the assignment is somewhat clearer, through the tabbed teacher page, it might be useful to add a \"middle\" phase. The phases would then be set-up pre-submission assessments (if any), and submissions (but no peer assessments) submissions (continuing) and peer assessments calculation of final grades display of final grades The switch from phases 2 to 3 (allowing peer assessments) is not \"fixed\" but would be under the control of the teacher. He/she would decide when sufficient work has been submitted for the peer assignment phase to begin. The two extremes are before any work has been submitted (this is the current situation) or when all the class has submitted their pieces of work. And of course the teacher could opt for some half-way-house somewhere between these two. That needs thinking about and if it's easy to EXPLAIN and SHOW what's happening in the assignment then we'll go for it!",

I would deduce that Sean, Marthe and Lisanne made \"early\" submissions and Mehmet, Sjoerd and Vincent were later in their submissions. With some more students (tom, dick and harry) the next submissions to be evaluated would have been Mehmet's, Sjoerd's or Vincent's. As the module stands at the moment, however, that does NOT solve the problem on who's going to evaluate tom's, dick's and harry's submissions! There is, I think, an easy solution At any time, the module knows how many times each submission has been evaluated, the trick is use each submission only X times, where X is the number of evaluations each student must do. I'll think about that. You are still left with the early submissions being allocated first, so possibly the \"good\" students see other \"good\" students work. That would be at least partially solved by allowing the teacher to decide when to start doing the allocations. That is coming What I'm trying for is to AVOID too much teacher involvement in the allocation of work. The module really needs to that itself if at all possible. I'm thinking of using these assignments with classes of 300 and many times a year Thanks for such detailed feedback, Ray",

          "Text": "Yes, The early submissions are the ones which get used the most. I'm thinking how the assessments by the students could be more balanced. I'm considering an extra option along the lines - Strictly Balanced, Optimally Balanced, and Don't Care. The first option would ensure that the submissions are evenly distributed to the students, the second option would allow some submissions to allocated at most N+X times, and the third option doesn't look at the balance of submissions at all (which is what happens now). (N is the number of assessments each student makes and X is probably 1 or 2.) I've a feeling that the Strictly Balanced approach will \"gum up\" the assignment and the students will see the work for assessment TRICKLING in. There's also the strong possibly that some students will never see their full quota of submissions to assess. The Optimally balanced should still retain some sort of balance but \"release\" the submissions a bit more freely. The use of \"optimally\" is very euphemistic . It will need field testing. Also dividing the assignment into a submission phase and a (peer) assessment phase will greatly help the allocation problem. As to the final grades, if a student doesn't submit they get zero. (They can't do any peer assessments either as student must submit their work before seeing the work of others.) When the students do assessments can get get \"extra\" marks depending on their \"Grading Performance\". That comes from the teacher grading the assessments and from the calculation of bias and reliability values, the last only calculated if the number of assessments overall on each submission is three or more (I suspect that figure should be higher). Perhaps there should be a more simplistic approach, just add some marks for each assessment made. That's really there already in the form of the teacher's grade on the assessment, it's nothing too elaborate, it's just a grade out of 20. The teacher could quickly grade the assessments if they wanted to reward students for doing an assessment and they do need to be at least \"eye-balled\" to see that the assessment does contain something! I will check whether that \"grading grade\" depends on the number of assessments made or not. I think it should do. Ray",

We are very confused about how the grading system goes. Is there already a document or manual about it? Or we will try to discover ourselves and find a bunch of questions. The confusion is especially on the numbers (grades) in the table. The table made from phase 3 is different from that in phase 4. And it seems there are two different grades for each students - grade for assignments and grade by the teacher for feedback. Is that right? Another confusion is when clicking on the links with the numbers (grade), we do not know the feedback is given by whom. 3.  When we give a grading number (for example, 7) to one of the student's assessments ( for testing only), and moves to phase 3, then phase 4, we can not see \"7\". Where does the teacher's grading suppose to be existing? 4. What is the effect of weight for bias and weight for reliability? How does it show?",

Yes the students can end up with a different grade from their assessment. The student's assessment performance can be included into the student's grade. In phase4 (version 1.1) I've added a submission league table where the grades come just from the teacher and peer assessments. This is seen by both the students and the teacher. Yes, the module started life without showing any student names, that's changing but it's an on-going process 3. The teacher's grading of assesments is taken into account in the final columns labelled \"Grading Performance\". That is a weighted combination of bias, reliability and the average of these scores. 4. The weights are there either to fine tune the final scores or to switch off any one of these factors. The latter is more useful than the former! So setting a weight to zero takes that factor (e.g. bias, teacher grading of assessment..) out of the final calculation. Note that with a small number of peer assessments made by each student the module basically switches off bias and reliability as they are only meaningful when say 5 or more peer assessments are made on each piece of work.

In a lab evaluation presently underway, one of my students emailed me with a request to change/adjust her evaluation of another student. She seems to have clicked the \"poor\" button instead of the \"excellent\" one. This is not an overly large problem and will not affect the grade of the evaluated student very much. The lab is set up so that each student evaluates (and is evaluated by) 5 students. The evaluation is an accumulative one, with 11 criteria, equally weighted. My problem is in determining how the assessment grade provided by the system is calculated. Each of the 11 criteria is a 5-point Likert scale, and I have set the maximum possible score in the lab to be 3 points. Therefore, if someone gives a total score of 17 (sum of all 11 scores - 1 point for poor and 5 points for excellent), the assessment should be 17/55*3 (17 points out of a maximum possible of 55, times 3 in order to convert it to a mark out of 3%). By my calculation, an assessment of 17 out of maximum possible of 55, should equal 0.927% out of 3%. However the system calculates the assessment to be 0.41%. Am I missing something horribly simple here? This under-calculation happens with all student assessments. It is more exaggerated in low assessments, but appears in all. This difference seems to be too great for a rounding error. Can you please tell me what formula is being used to calculate the assessment grade? Thanks.",

Student wants to re-do the assessment: this is OK, as teacher goes into the Administration page and views that students assessments, the assessment in question can be deleted and the student can do an assessment (the problem will be that the student will be allocated a different piece of work to assess in all likelyhood). What's really needed in this case is an \"adjust\" link rather than a \"delete\". 2. I think this is a \"I start counting from zero, you start counting from one\" problem. The module as it stands will (internally) score that assessment form from zero to 44 (not 11 to 55). Your score of 17 is internally a 6, and 6/44*3 is 0.409 - Bingo! Now I would agrue that's my way gives you the \"full\" range of scores from 0% to 3% in this case. whereas counting from 1 gives scores from 0.6% to 3%. Also these likert scales can be mixed with Yes/no scales, 0 to 10 scales etc. Starting one scale off from one and the others off from zero was going to be confusing so they are all zero based. The argument in this case is ACADEMIC as the final grades are stored as INTEGERS!!! So a maximum grade of 3% is very bad news! It's good idea to grade these assignments out of 100% and do the scaling down outside in a spreadsheet. (It should say that somewhere but doesn't I'm afraid.) To save the day you can quite safely change the 3% value in the assignment and recalculate the final grades (said with fingers crossed ) Your comments would be most welcome Ray",

If I can switch the value of the assignment from 3 to 100 I will do it.  However, should I wait until the assignment is closed (Wednesday at midnight) or can I do it now?  This relates to my other question in another thread about moving back and forth across stages.  I'm in stage 2 now, and upgrading the workshop will take me back to stage 1.  Might this cause problems for students who have not yet submitted? Sorry for all the questions.  It might not have been entirely a good idea to jump into a complicated module with such a large class.  The reason I did it however, was because I had a large class.

          "Text": "3. I've been looking at the code (always a good thing to do ) and my previous statements are only partially true. The individual items scores, for example from the 5 point scales, are stored as integers. However the Grade for a submission is stored in a float. That is if the student grades a submission as 1.234 that's how it gets recorded. Also looking at the code it would be VERY BAD NEWS to change the maximum grade of the assignment (your 3% figure) once the assignment has started. Assessments basically get their grade calculated when the assessment is made and that grade is not absolute it's relative to the maximum grade of the assignment. Further those individual assessment grades are NOT re-calculated when the \"Final Grades\" are worked out. So AS THE MODULE CURRENTLY STANDS if you change your 3% to say 30% then \"old\" assessments would be graded out of 3% and new assessments would be graded out of 30% and the whole thing would be a MESS So don't change the maximum grade figure. We still have a problem though with the Final grades. These will be CALCULATED OK I believe and you will end up with grades like 1.234, the problem is the DISPLAY of the grades. To keep the table reasonably compact the grades are all shown as integers in the module. Further that problem is compounded by the fact that the Final Grades which are shown in Moodle's Grades screen come from values stored in INTEGERS. This is what the Assignment module does and I saw no reason to do differently. As I see it, there's only lessons to be learnt from this. It would be useful to be able to change the maximum score on the fly and I think all that would entail would be to store the assessment grades as absolute values rather than relative. When the grades gets displayed a fudge factor is applied which represents the current maximum grade value. I'll look into that. I'm afraid that doesn't help your assignment and I fear you are going to end up with students with 0, 1, 2 and possibly 3 as their final grades. Perhaps the taking part was the important part Sorry for another maths lesson and for being first to hit this flaw Ray",

          "Text": "Thank you Ray, for the detailed explanation. I think the pop-up help is fine. What a teacher who is new to this module needs is to know how does the workshop module run in the four phases.We struggled with this for quite a long time. Now we are clearer with the grading system and we can understand more or less how the grades come out. The confusion so far is that what is the influence of  yes/no for the option \"ïncluding teacher grade\"? Another problem happened to different student in each workshop assignment is that the feedback can not be finished at once for one or two students. Is it possible for students to continue the feedback after they did some already in the lecture or at home? It would be of great help if it is possible. Cheers.",
