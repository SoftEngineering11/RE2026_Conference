          "Title": "Feature Request: Editable TexField to Find user in Log",
          "Text": "I would like to highlight a usability issue with the user selection combo box in the Logs filter (see attached screenshot, red arrow). Currently, the combo box displays a long list of users, but it is not editable—meaning you cannot type a name to quickly find or select a specific user. Problems experienced: It is very time-consuming to scroll through the entire user list, especially in courses with many participants. Sometimes, it becomes nearly impossible to locate a specific user, particularly when the list is extensive. The autocomplete feature doesn't work as expected. Most of the time, this feature didnt help me get the user (esp. if you have users with the same first name or surname) Suggested improvement: Please consider replacing the current non-editable combo box with a searchable text field or an editable dropdown. Ideally, as you type a name or username, the field should filter and display matching users, allowing for quick and precise selection. Benefits: Saves time and effort for all users, especially in large courses. Reduces frustration and potential errors when filtering logs. Aligns with modern UI/UX standards found in other platforms. The editable text field will make sure we can type the exact name easily (we can even copy and paste the name, because some names are too long and difficult) Thank you for considering this request. This improvement would make a significant positive impact on daily Moodle administration and teaching workflows.",

          "Text": "Hello Moodlers, We have been doing some ground work research on Double Marking and other complex marking workflows for https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-64118 as we set out to do last summer. We are now at a point where we are able to share our progress and invite potential collaborators to join us. We have completed: Market research First prototype of  basic \"open\" double marking in core Assignment initial engagement with HQ Here is a demo of the prototype: Video From here, we are looking to take an iterative approach Step 1: - “open ”Double Marking with Marker allocation - joint feedback, separate grade, manual feedback agreement -> this is what the current prototype delivers. Step 2 - Improve Marker Allocation by moving to a dedicated page - Sample Marking (only some are double marked) Step 3 - Expand double marking to have parallel independent Feedback options. - Make mark & feedback agreement a sub-plugin type (would allow institutions to implement their bespoke quirky rules) - with a potential output being Marker allocation - full double blind marking Fundamentally, step 3 is where all the good stuff will come together. In particular the agreement plugin framework could allow for bespoke meanings to what is expected from marker 1 vs marker 2, automation of agreement of feedback via AI, allocation of second markers based on first marking, etc. Since Moodle needs to support many different use cases, this ensures the bespoke complexity can be built in pluginland but Moodle can provide the framework for it. The speed at which we can progress this will entirely depend on how many collaborators come forward. We are looking to follow a similar model to the Quiz project. If you would like to get involved, please reach out to me at a.spark@ucl.ac.uk",

          "Title": "Proposal: Improve Core Quiz Notifications (mod_quiz)",
          "Text": "Proposal: Improve Core Quiz Notifications (mod_quiz) Hi all, We recently developed a local plugin to enhance the quiz open notifications sent to students, and I’d like to suggest improvements that could be implemented directly in Moodle core to make these notifications more accurate, configurable, and informative — without requiring a custom plugin. Current Limitations in Moodle Core Notifications go to all users with mod/quiz:attempt: This includes teachers, managers, and other non-students — even if they are not the intended audience. No role-based filtering: Core has no built-in way to restrict notifications to only student roles (e.g., role ID 5). Fixed 48-hour notification window: Moodle currently hardcodes a 2-day window (DAYSECS * 2) before the quiz opens, with no way to configure it. No admin UI for notification settings: There is no place in Site Administration where you can configure quiz notification behavior, delay, or targeting. No way to customize the email content: Administrators or developers cannot add custom HTML or plain text (e.g., exam preparation instructions) to the outgoing notification. Group restrictions may not always be respected: While availability restrictions exist, it’s unclear whether notifications fully respect group-level access (e.g. \"Must match group A\"). Suggested Improvements for Moodle Core Add role filtering for quiz reminders Let administrators limit notifications to specific role IDs (e.g., students only), avoiding unnecessary messages to staff or lecturers. Add a configurable \"days before\" setting Replace or override the current hardcoded 48-hour window with an admin-configurable value (e.g., 3, 7, or 14 days before). Respect group access restrictions in reminders Ensure the quiz reminder system uses core_availability::filter_user_list() or equivalent to only notify students who truly have access based on group rules or availability conditions. Support content injection into the message Provide a way for site admins to append HTML or plain text content to reminder emails (such as setup instructions, policies, links). Expose developer hooks or override points Allow developers to modify or extend the quiz reminder behavior (timing, roles, content) without needing to override core classes like notification_helper. Real-World Use Case We had the following requirements in a real academic environment: Notify only students (not teachers or staff) Respect group restrictions (e.g., \"Must match group A\") Send the reminder exactly 7 days before the quiz opens Include custom HTML instructions in the email: \"Complete Exam Setup\" \"Install Google Chrome\" \"Room Scan required\" \"Review the Examination Policy\" To achieve this cleanly, we developed a local plugin. But these improvements could greatly benefit all Moodle sites if supported directly in core. Would love to hear if this is being considered for a future roadmap, or if there’s interest in extending the mod_quiz notification system to make it more robust and flexible.",

The logic of using this capability to decide who gets the message is correct. (If your role setup is different, I recommend you reveiw it.) The content of the message is a language string. Thefore you can customise it using Language customisation . The groups thing was just a bug, and I think it got fixed: MDL-84327 . I think that pretty much only leaves making the time-perion customisable. For me, the issue is not just the 2 days, it is the built in assumption what all quizzes with a close date have an open date. I tried to point out that was a false assumption before this got implemented, but I was ignored.",

          "Text": "Thanks for the thoughtful response! You're absolutely right that mod/quiz:attempt is the correct capability to use in principle — but in practice, many institutions (like ours) have custom or extended roles for assistants, delayed students, learning support, etc. Some of those may also inherit that capability. We’ve since corrected our role config, but having optional role filtering or exclusions could help prevent over-notifying unintended users — especially for large institutions with complex role hierarchies. As for language customization — yes, for static strings it's great. But our use case required injecting reusable HTML footers with exam prep instructions, policy links, etc., which aren't feasible to manage through the language system alone. A plugin hook or dedicated message property would offer clean extensibility here. Regarding the group filtering — thank you for confirming MDL-84327 fixed it! We've verified that it's working as expected.",

Currently, if a course contains several Turnitin Moodle Direct assignments (e.g., three different ones for multiple submission attempts), there is no way to export all grade summaries or copies of submissions at once. At the moment, I need to manually go into each Turnitin Moodle Direct V2 assignment individually to download /export the required data, which is inefficient and time-consuming. It would be incredibly helpful if Moodle provided a single export option that allows instructors to download all grade summaries or copies of submissions from all Turnitin Moodle Direct assignments within a course in one go. Could this feature be considered for future updates? I believe this would greatly enhance the user experience and workflow efficiency for educators managing multiple submission attempts.",

This feature would streamline the workflow by eliminating the need for external tools and provide a more seamless experience for all users. One of the primary use cases is the submission and review of 3D models. Students would be able to upload 3D objects, such as FBX files, as part of their assignments, and teachers could view and interact with these models directly in Moodle. Additionally, the feature would support interactive feedback, allowing teachers to comment on each submissions. This feedback would be visible to students within the platform, enabling them to take actionable steps to improve their work. Grading would also be simplified, as teachers could assign grades based on predefined rubrics, which could include criteria such as topology, texturing, animation quality, or adherence to project guidelines. The feature would include an open source 3D viewer integration within the moodle grading view, enabling the use of a lightweight, web-based 3D viewer capable of rendering FBX, OBJ, and GLTF/GLB files. This viewer would offer basic navigation tools like orbit, pan, and zoom, along with support for common rendering modes such as wireframe, shaded, textured views and animation playback.",

I suppose that when OS’s don’t have viewers, it is unlikely that web applications, like Moodle, will have viewers. Moodle lacks a viewer for the more common MS Office files. So, from my experience, what you are asking for will likely not happen for a while unless you can develop the viewer yourself. However, Moodle does provide an excellent alternative to grading uploaded files of any type if this is what you are trying to do. When I have students submit files, like Excel or Visio, I can download them in mass, view them with my MacOS viewer or from within an application, and use Moodle’s CSV files to enter grades and comments, then upload these CSV back into Moodle’s gradebook. Nope, you can’t “mark-up” these files unless you convert them to PDFs or graphics, but I prefer to enter comments into the csv file. If you prefer to use Moodle’s Assignment grading interface, you can still open these files in their application and",

However I created this with a view to  learning i.e. formative assessment where quick feedback is very beneficial. I have quite a few ideas for improving the question type, both for the way it gives feedback and for options on how the feedback is given. I have had an excellent code contribution from Justin Hunt (of Poodll fame), who created a prompt testing option.

          "Text": "We, at CAPDM, use our own 'content display' plugin, which is very similar to the OUContent plugin.  We can develop any feature we want in it and have recently seamlessly embedded ChatGPT into it. There are various hooks we use (all of which are configurable and others can be added).  For example, in Reflective Activities we use explicit buttons to allow a question to be asked or for a random quiz to be generated - both using the text of the reflection as the context of the prompt. We have also added a hook to allow a question to be asked of any <p> tag, using the content of the paragraph as the context of the prompt. Both are intended to provide scalable support for the student who might be struggling with a concept and wish to ask a very specific question in the absence of a real tutor. We have taken this a stage further and done the same for all the core texts used on a programme (e.g. OpenStax texts for an MBA).  However we have created embeddings of the content of these texts, stored in a vector database , so that any question asked is padded out with the top 10 hits to provide the context for the eventual prompt.  This way we can begin to ensure a relevance to everything asked. If anyone is interested in a demo, the code, or whatever, just ask.  This is a feature that I suspect all the publishers will offer - at a price.  At least we limit it to only the content relevant and used on a programme/course.",

Chat GPT The links are for moodle.org and not tracker.moodle.org Yes, there are several open issues regarding the H5P content bank in Moodle reported on the Moodle Tracker and forums. Some of the notable issues include: 1. **H5P Activity Missing from Content Bank**: Users have reported that certain H5P activities are not appearing in the content bank as expected. This can be problematic when trying to manage or utilize these activities within courses【11†source】. 2. **Managing H5P Packages**: There are requests for better management features within the content bank. Users have expressed a need for options to clone H5P packages easily to create variations, indicating a lack of intuitive management capabilities in the current implementation【12†source】. 3. **Import Issues**: Some users are experiencing difficulties importing H5P content from the content bank using the file picker. This issue includes not being able to see the content created in the content bank when trying to import it into activities or courses【13†source】. 4. **Deletion and Renaming Problems**: Issues have been reported regarding the inability to delete or rename H5P content in the content bank. This problem has been observed particularly in specific Moodle versions and themes, which can hinder content management【14†source】. These issues highlight ongoing challenges with the H5P integration in Moodle, particularly related to the content bank's usability and functionality.

Tracking the progress of every mentee (Student)  is critical and being able to evidence ( upload ) information like the APL function is very important.  Being able to conduct extensive analysis on the competencies, like we can in courses is required.

Benefits I\nknow of no product that will assist the lecturer to prepare paper\nassessments, store the results in a gradebook, assist with reporting,\nand final outcome calculation. This will reduce the workload of the lecturer. Will provide a mechanism to share question banks. Ease of question creation and administration. Workflow Create questions as normal but also store the question in Latex (a tool like Pandoc [ https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html ]) can be used. Create questions that are meant to be printed (for example crossword) Create\nassessment as normal, but filter to only use printable questions. And\nif moderation / external marketing will be done, set flag. Format the output with the Latex Exam class ( https://latex-tutorial.com/typeset-exam-paper/ || https://ctan.org/pkg/exam ) or something similar Add any additional pages required (for example: formula sheets) If students are going to mark on bubble sheets generate the bubble sheet with a barcode for the assessment ID. Decide\nhow many variations you need (You will use variations when you have\nstudents in rows and you want to prevent wandering eyes) Print\nthe assessment(s) master and memorandum. Add barcode to the assessment\nmaster to track at which workstation, and when it was printed. Students write the assessment / mark the bubble sheet. The exam papers are marked. The bubble sheets are scanned using either a desktop or a dedicated OMR scanner and thereafter the data is uploaded to Moodle. Moodle marks the student responses and creates a data entry form that is used by the\nlecturer\n\nto capture the marks for the rest of the questions that were manually marked. If the moderation flag has been set, capture the moderated results. Store the grades in the gradebook. Generate reports (if required) Use the data in the gradebook as normal.",

          "Text": "Hi there! I've been\nusing Moodle 3.X for a year now at our University, and recently, the system was\nupdated to version 4.1. I'm surprised that I haven't been able to find any\ndiscussions about this particular issue. I hope whoever reads this can\nunderstand my message. 😁 So here's the situation... A Question\nBank is associated with a specific course. As I've been teaching the same\ncourse multiple times, I find myself continuously refining my questions to\nenhance their quality. These modifications are saved exclusively within the\nQuestion Bank of that specific course. However, when I want to use an improved\nversion of a question in a different course, I need to export and import the\nquestion. (These questions are typically STACK -type questions, and there are\nhundreds of them.) To address\nthis, I reached out to our administrator, who created a \"sub-Question\nBank\" for me and my colleagues. This sub-Question Bank serves as a central\nrepository for all our questions. The challenge arises when there are four of\nus, the teachers, each possessing hundreds of questions. This makes it quite\ndifficult to effectively manage and utilize this shared sub-Question Bank. My question\nis: Is it possible to have a similar sub-Question Bank designed for individual\nteachers? Could I have a personal question bank that is accessible across all\nof my courses? This\nwould allow me to categorize, organize, and utilize my questions, with updates being automatically applied to each of my courses where the\nquestion is used. Best regards, Miika from Finland",

          "Text": "I was asked exactly the same question yesterday - how can a teacher have one question bank to serve (all) the (multiple) courses they run on the same Moodle site.. For me, this resembles the Content Bank tool and repository in some way, where teachers can link H5P activities to the instances of H5P contents added and created in a \"mother\" course's Content Bank. I'm not surprised users are now seeking a similar functionality for quiz questions. Add to that the Public-Shared-Listed vs Private-Unlisted switching of status on H5P contents and we end up having a pretty effective mechanism for creating, maintaining, and (if desired) sharing contents. I believe that - where possible - we need similar philosophies to power corresponding actions in Moodle - and I really think both tools - the Question Bank and the Content Bank - could follow a converging path in their further development with respect to the management of contents. Right now, what we can do with the Question Bank, if we want to enable teachers to run single question banks for themselves, is to create (permanent?) course categories for such individual teachers, and to raise their local category permissions (or indeed make them managers of these course categories) so they are able to create, view and manage those category-level question banks and to add questions from there to the quizzes in their courses (within this category). This is not the same as the request that is being asked here - a \"personal\" question bank would have to be more flexible and work (also?) independently of course categories at all - if only to allow effective site-wide course and quiz duplication / backup and restore operations - by / for the same teacher. And if we wanted question sharing, the Shared vs Public feature would probably have to be devised and added to question banks (currently sharing [and collaborating] is possible only between teachers co-running the same course and accessing the course-level question bank, or between managers / admins.)",

Where shared questions can be used is tied to the tree structure of course categories and courses, which might be what you want, but if it isn't, you are stuck. Ideally we should remove that restriction. When you are adding question to a quiz, those you should be able to pick questions from any question bank that you have access to. \"what would happen if a course is moved out of the category?\" This is the good question, and the answer is the same as \"what happens if the question is moved to a different question bank?\". The answer is the same in both cases. Once the question is in the quiz, the quiz is linked directly to that question, without any reference to where it is. So, the quiz will keep working. (But, if you remove the question, then it would be impossible to add it back from it's new location.) This is sort-of a bug ( MDL-14802 ).",

Any time they need to update a question they have to edit 3-4 copies of the question in the respective presentations. So they want to try and cut down on the effort by having a single place to amend a single version of the question, which will feed through to those individual presentations because all the quizzes are set to use the latest question version (historic data is unaffected because Quiz records what question version a student has answered, so no quality assurance issues to this approach). However, setting up Course Category-level categories/sub-categories is messy (and can result in huge pages) and can only be done by admins as they are the only ones with category permissions. Overall this is a terrible process and user experience for something our tutors and central academic staff should be able to do. It would be super-useful and ease question admin if the 'share from website' approach Tim/Thomas/Antonia/Luca have previously proposed was worked on. Like Miika (/Lapland University of Applied Science), we (/The Open University, UK) are struggling with something that should be simple to do in a mature LMS/VLE like Moodle.",

It would be much better to find some meaningful ways to engage with users, and find out what would work for them - remembering how diverse the Moodle community is. (So, a year from now, perhaps we could be having a conversation like that in the new Moodle Product Advisory Group (PAG) .) In the mean time If there is anyone who, at their organisation, is using the current features for sharing questions between courses (particularly if you have questions at the Course category level) I would be very gratefulif you could get in touch. I would be useful to know what parts fo the current system work for you, and where you struggle and would like things changed. It would probably be a good idea to write the clearest possible description of the proposed changes, at it will appear to users, and post them publically so people can give us feedback.

The screenshot attached so the structure for the Civics Course which was created for the Class of 2017 to Class of 2028 the incoming freshmen so there are now 12 courses using the same 100 questions. This was the easiest example to show the structure instead of the SEL which started in 17-18 school year. One of the benefits of ' shared questions ' for the Civics course, is that every 2 years or a new appointment there are 11 potential questions that need to be updated. This is easy enough for a single course, but when these 11 questions are in 4 active courses used once in the US Citizenship Civics Exam and a self-paced Unit Exam: (e.g. Courts) that could be 88 potential edits (worst scenario, but things are crazy now). The Question Editor only needs to change a single question - however since it is a new version the quizzes have to be open and regraded to make sure that the newest version appears on the quiz. That is an extra step, but if 3 questions were updated - that is only a single click for 4 courses instead of editing 24 questions and then regrading each course. One struggle that only the Question Editor experiences is when working at the Category (QB) level is the performance. When making the screenshot and clicked on Gr00 Courst (4) to view the Questions it took 10 minutes to load. Not sure if it is related to that the question is used a total of 20 time in 12 courses. Plus that the each course depending if question was used in Overall 100pt Exam (1000+ attempts) or Self-Paced 4-11 Question Exam (0-100 attempts). We used to display the Question statistics (very useful) but it seemed to even slow it down more that even got error messages. Did not show the SEL Shared Questions list becuase it is so long due to eight grade levels with sub-categories broken into 3-4 units. It helps to have a naming scheme to organize, but would be nice if those categories could collapse/expand! Not sure what would happen with the search field?

Your experience shows that if you are able to organise your question categories so that the current system is usable, then being able to share questions is very benficial. I don't know why you question bank is so slow, even with stats turned off. It is certainly a bug, so if it was possible to get any diagnosis of what is causing the slowness, then we could work to fix it. And, there is more work being done to continue fixing the stats performance. Most recently MDL-78580 and MDL-79254 .",

That is the lecturer creates his/her questions outside any and all courses, and they can build their own structure. Then when they want to create a quiz they use the question from the bank. If the question is deleted from the bank then it can no longer be used. If it was used in a quiz then it stays in the quiz. So the question does not \"belong\" to the course but to the quiz.

Because now students can only navigate from activity to activity through the index, which I would guess makes things less usable instead of a student clicking on a (well formed) button at the bottom of a page to move forward or backwards.

          "Text": "Hi everyone, for those who don’t know me, I am Rafael Lechugo, currently UX Lead / Product designer from Moodle Workplace team. I also worked alongside the Moodle LMS team with the re-design of Moodle LMS 4. Moodle LMS 4 was conceived as a fresh start (mostly for new users and new generations) while trying to keep as many functionalities as possible for users from the previous versions. It should be known by now that we made a great effort to reduce our users' cognitive load to the bare minimum, so the \"learning content\" could be the protagonist in the experience. Our approach (and the approach of most modern software similar to Moodle) is to make the UI as \"invisible\" as possible, so users don’t have to think about it. I can assure you that all test sessions covering users onboarding and course completion were successful (for new users that never used Moodle before — again, our main target in the re-design process). Notice some design decisions that were made to ensure this success ratio: The course index is expanded by default, and users can hide it expressly if they want. When / if they choose to do that, they already learned where to find the course navigation. On top of that, we added a user tour step that expressly indicates the course index and its function. Every activity page has a breadcrumb that takes the user back to the course main page so users can find their way back to the course \"itinerary\", even in extreme cases. Not all activities look and behave the same. Some of their content is very straightforward, so the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons are easily scannable by the users. However, this pattern does not work for every activity out there. Users can't scan navigation buttons that easily in complex activities such as Database , H5P, etc. However, I DO agree that the buttons are convenient on smaller screens. Nobody wants to open the course index every time to switch between activities on a small device. We consciously kept these buttons in the Moodle App, and we encourage you and your users to use the App to achieve the best mobile experience. Maybe we could bring the navigation buttons back for this only reason (and display them only on small screens), so I would let this option open for discussion. I encourage the community to listen to what NEW users have to say about the course experience in the desktop version (users from the new generations, or users that never used the previous versions of Moodle before). Are they facing challenges browsing through the course? Please let us know! I also encourage you guys to catch up with the new improvements in the activities UI regarding new fixed buttons on the bottom of the page, which will make the experience smoother in general. How would this new component/pattern (that adds so much value to the product) dialogue with the old navigation buttons if we bring them back? Thanks for bringing your feedback and expertise to the discussion!",

          "Text": "Hi Rafael, Thank you for the explaination. First of all I want to state that both new as old users I have spoken love the new UX in Boost. The new course index is surely a great and welcome additoin to the Moodle Course navigation. I am for one very happy with this development. It makes my live as an administrator much easier, and I will explain below why. But to be sure, this what I post is absolutly not about bashing into this from an experience Moodle view. Because I support this new UI fully, it was long over due, and it is important that NEW users find their way. It is about embrassing the open communication spirit that Moodle HQ advocates. What is the defination of a new user? My definiation of a new user in this usecase is the new student that first logins in to Moodle, to start his or her course. Some of these new users just come into Moodle for 1 course, others to finish their school carrier or because the workplace tells them to use it. But it all comes to the fact that one day they will not return to Moodle again, one sooner then the other. But definitatly earlier then any site administrator and/or even teacher, which makes them the \"key-experience\" users, and also the \"source\" of any remarks that have been made been during their time of using Moodle. Why am I as an admin happy with the new UI As stated it makes my live as an administrator so much more easy. When a new Moodle site is been requested, I don't have to be \"afraid\" anymore that they are \"horriefed\" by the out dated look. Or I have to install and configure a number of plugins to get an UI that looks like something they are already familiar to. I don't have to maintain all those plugins I use, so I can now more focus on helping my teachers to build the best educational course they can. Why am I suprised that navigation buttons are gone As I stated in my first post. I don't get how something that had dissapeared, had a long outstanding discussion returned, is now gone again. Since I was one of those old users that have attended UX sessions, I know I have addressed the point of the use of the button. I know I was at least one of them, and that I have showned what I will end up in this post. Why do I strongly advice Moodle to reconsider this choice Let's say you have autisme, ADHD , HSP or any kind of concentration or energy issue. As such a user I probably don't use the APP because I am self aware of my issues, the learning content will be cramped into 1 screen, as well I will lose my concenstration and focus because someone is calling me, social media or simply a what's app message popping up. So when I go to my laptop/desktop and enter the course,  it is most likely (because I am self aware) that I will start with closing the Course Index to ensure that my cognitive load is limit to only that what I need to do. I have finished reading, going throuhgh a quiz, upload an assigment , your H5P activity what every is on your screen at that point. And want to move to the next activity. I was fully focussed and concentrated. And now I have to relay that focus and concentration on opening the Course Index, finding where I was and then go further. Even if I had decided to keep the Course Index open, i would still have to refocus and concentrated to know where I was and I want to go next. It was a big course, and it took all my energy on concenstration. I leave the course frustrated, rethinking my steps and what I can do to improve my experience. I might not even concider sharing this with my class mates and/or teacher, because I feel that it's due to my own issues and/or I don't know that it would be an option to have navigation buttons in the bottom that would make things easier for me. what I am trying to say here is that most 'new' users don't know what they are missing and accept the UI experience they have. But I also want to stated that in the current state you might excluded students with dissability that are not visable or even know to most admins and/or teachers. Are their previous experiences with a similar setup The answer is YES. And as I stated above I have shown this setup to the UX team during one of the UX sessions. This experiences has been build about 4-5 years ago for group of clients in Moodle 3.5, and still is running in 3.9. As I then told to the UX team member, I spoke with, it was a combination of theme, courseformat and a variation of the Course Navigation block that is in the plugin database. The most heared question was the option to move the Menu out of the screen, as Course Index is doing now. W e are talking about +300 courses a year, with a user group base of 10.000 users a year. With about eacher year 50% what I call \"new users\". We work with H5P and Quiz, so that states I believe under \"complex activities\". And yes: in our first concept we did get feedback that the moodle standard navigation in the bottom gave confusion in the navigation. So we did 2 user test: 1 with and 1 without, and the feedback is that if it has to be that choice, they rather have the moodle standard navigation. we dived in deeper and concluded that it was about the distinction and visualisation. so we convided with our theme developer and solved the issue (see screenshot below). This said: we also have sites where we have added a top-line between the activity and buttons to ensure they where even more distinctive. Closing argument I don't believe I have in my +11 years of being a Moodle Siteadministrator ever so strongly advocated an item, but I also realize it is up to Moodle HQ to decided what is best for Moodle because they have the pleasure of considering all user cases and scenario's of how Moodle is being used. When it comes to the point if Moodle HQ will ensure a return of the navigation buttons or not. I am fairly simple. I have ensured before that the UI was confirm the research we did, and I can do this again because of Moodle's flexibility. But I do hope that Moodle , reconsider this decission, even if this is by making an optional setting in the boost theme so an admin can decided for her/himselve if it necessary in their user case. Based on that what I above stated, and the posts that followed by the others.",

          "Text": "Thanks for your thoughtful argumentation, Gemma! I absolutely second it and would like to highlight the aspect of cognitive load from an instructional design/learning theory point of view. Cognitive load should not only be considered in getting used to the navigation as a new user (this is a one time process) but in day-to-day learning. Gemma describes the learning experience very well: At the end of an activity - instead of just clicking the 'next' button - I have to shift my focus from the learning content to the course index and then back to the learning content. The continuity of learning is disrupted every time I have to navigate to the next activity. The refocussing produces extraneous cognitive load and therefore reduces the capacity of germane cognitive load that is relevant for learning. This aspect of cognitive load is relevant for all learners, not just those that face cognitive learning challenges. The need to show/hide the course index only increases extraneous cognitive load. Like Gemma, I really appreciate the new design in general and the massive improvement it brings but strongly miss the easy next/previous navigation (not the dropdown list). A simple next/previous button would do it for me, no need for the name of the next activity like in 3.x. @Rafael: Refering to similar software like Moodle: On MOOC platforms it's very common to have a next/previous navigation, see for example Coursera or Udacity. I can't imagine such a button to cause unwanted cognitive load for the users. The course index can instead look quite messy for long courses, therefore increasing extraneous cognitive load (a 'collapse all' option for the sections in the course index might help make it look cleaner). Maybe a good solution would be to add the buttons as an admin setting so every admin can decide for herself whether to enable or disable them?",

I'll also second Ira's comments here on cognitive load for typical learners too (Dylan Wiliam called cognitive load theory possibly one of the most important theories in education). Task-switching (from thinking about learning content to thinking about navigation then back to learning content again) always comes at a cognitive cost & can make difficult tasks more difficult, resulting in shallower learning. The less learners have to think about navigating between Moodle activities , the better they'll learn. Thinking metaphorically, the obvious place for most people to \"turn a page\" is at the bottom right of it. Take a look at a few old magazines & softback books to see which corner is the most dog-eared. I think that should tell us what is most intuitive for most people. BTW , Re the App: for the courses I design, for language learning, the app doesn't support many of the necessary features, e.g. audio & video recording & 3rd party activity modules, & so despite some of the conveniences & immediacy the app can offer, it doesn't justify requiring learners to use both the app & the web UI. I don't think the app should be used as a justification for sub-optimal website UI design.",

          "Text": "Voted up. I would add my two cents to this issue that 1) Devs and admins should be ADDING pedagogical options, not removing them. The long standing value of a \"horizontal\" type movement is why we have tools like Lesson and industry standards like SCORM that use that as a base. Gemma has gone into a lot of detail above why this is so valuable. 2) The excellent improvements to the activity view starting in 3.11 and continuing still are the perfect opportunity to improve the previous-next activity-to-activity navigation, not to throw it away. Just when we finally have rich, informative, standardized activity views, we lose the ability to move directly from one to the other? I recall well the issues that arose when the previous-next navigation was first added: the implications were not thought through very well and there were no options to manage it. This is the chance to finally get it right. What it needs is some attention rather than dismissal. In particular I would suggest - a system level enable/disable setting - a system level default for a course value on/off - a course level on/off setting - an activity level setting to suppress it when it interferes with an activity with its own horizontal navigation, like Glossary, Lesson , Quiz, SCORM , Workshop, etc.; for example, in Lesson, we often want to suppress it during all Lesson but have it show up in the End of Lesson page, so the student can then move on as usual to the Next activity.",

I would just like to share my support for this change to have the option of the activity navigation reinstated. Having spoken with our users, both those with prior experience of Moodle, those with a mixture of experiences of different learning platforms and those with little or no experience. All stated that although the new course index was very useful as a way to navigate around the course and to show activity completion status, they found it jarring as a way to navigate through the narrative of the course, they all stated that they expected to be able to navigate from where they are to the next activity in a more obvious way and without having to reopen the index, having closed it to improve focus on the learning content. Which runs counter to the stated aim of the change. As it has been stated a few times, the change it has clearly been considered but I'm still unclear on why the conclusion was reached. Course format designers can decide to turn off the course index (Why?) and in that case the activity navigation is enabled (Why?). But why should it be this way, and why not provide both options and allow learning designers and platform owners to make the decision as to what is best for their learning experience design.  I for one see great value in have both the new course index and the activity navigation available to users, they serve very different but complimentary purposes in my opinion and the opinion of many of our users, and many people here. To those who say they are redundant, that depend upon your point of view and the purpose you attribute to them, so why not let us decide. You can turn them off and I can turn them on. Gemma has put a great case together, with regard to neurodiverse learners. Moodle has always been a tool that has been flexible and has allowed customisation to meet the needs of its userbase, this seems to run counter to that. Can I encourage you all to raise this with colleagues and associates and to support and enhance the Tracker https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-75683 I hope to see some of you at MoodleMoot Global next week and if we get an opportunity to raise this issue, let's do so.

          "Text": "I totally agree. We have issues because of the missing navigation \"next\" or \"previous\" activity buttons. More information for Moodle: Maybe this isn't really the place to talk about the \"next\" & \"previous\" buttons but this seems the closest so far. I would like to start by saying that a lot of the Moodle platform update has been a great improvement and really well received by our participants (\"Students\"). We train Higher Education (HE) teachers/lecturers in best practice for universities and governments around the world. We have some of the brightest minds in LMS and online education who work for us as advisors. Their day jobs are in online education at a world leading university. I'm saying this to explain that we understand the use of LMS and the theory and real world application very well. Since the 4.0 update, we've had an increase of issues with navigation, we've had people unsure of what they've really done (the \"done\" indicator doesn't really solve this as it would need an infinite number of option) and we've found that even the best participants (\"students\") were accidentally missing exercises. We strongly believe this is because it is no longer a continuous flow but a \"jumping\" motion where you have to manually choose the page/activity you wish to visit next. This is creating a barrier for learners. The other issue with the missing \"flow\" of activity to activity is that it forces a disassociation between information on different activities. This leaves our course creators choosing between putting as much information on each page or reducing cognitive load/aesthetics. The side bar is more like any website menu, on a normal website they aren't usually connected topics. Its a nice touch but we don't think it should be the only option for navigation, there needs to be some sort of \"Next\" & \"Previous\" button to create a flow that doesn't interrupt the learning process. We really appreciate the effort going into the UX on the Moodle platform and look forward to the changes to come.",

Many things that \"seem like a no-brainer brilliant idea\" to developers turn out to be a massive degradation of product experience and value for users.

          "Title": "Text editor analysis - Replacement of Atto",
          "Text": "Hi all, Let's talk about text editors, specifically Atto, and its future. Atto was designed as a lightweight, accessible, in-house editor for Moodle. While it has arguably achieved all of these goals, it was written nearly a decade ago, uses deprecated technologies, and is difficult to maintain. In addition: Moodle lacks the dedicated, in-house, knowledge to maintain a rich text editor\nMaintaining our own editor detracts from our core business goals of writing a kick-ass LMS to empower educators. The JavaScript world has moved on, but because Atto is built upon the now-deprecated YUI framework, it is increasingly difficult for us to add new features using modern language features. The library we use to normalise content selection (Rangy) was abandoned shortly after we started to use it, and has a number of known issues that detract from the experience of using Atto. Many of the language features that Atto is based around were experimental at the time of its original writing and never made it to the browser specification. Their continued use is not advisable. Atto is fine for editing short content, but when editing larger, or more complex, content it becomes more challenging. In particular, the undo/redo are problematic, and image handling is tricky. Possible solutions As with any problem, we have multiple solutions available - each has their own benefits and problems. To add to this, Moodle also has a number of restrictions which we place upon ourselves and which make any product selection more complex and/or prohibitive, in particular: Our plugin structure does not support files being parachuted into place. We have a strict plugin architecture which must be followed for community plugins to work. We do not use any server -side JS processing, such as WebPack. All of our JS is shipped with Moodle, or community Moodle plugins , as pre-compiled code ready for production. This prevents us from using any editor which tree-shakes code based on configuration, or whose APIs are mangled during their build process. We use our own Translation system ( AMOS ) We use our own dialogues, menu bars, and other UI features All software we include must be compatible with the GPLv3 license Rewrite Atto Perhaps the most obvious solution is to rewrite Atto with more modern JS practices (ES Modules) to match our other JavaScript content. In doing so we would also have to find an alternative to the Rangy library, and to the deprecated Document.execCommand() browser API. In an ideal world we would also maintain backwards compatibility with existing Atto plugins, but this would be extremely difficult given the chagne of technology (moving from YUI to ESM), the necessary change of underlying API, and the replacement of Rangy. The complexity of this project would be high, and Moodle would still be maintaining its own text editor, which is a huge distraction from our core business. Replace Atto Atto is not the only rich text editor available, and many other Open Source editors exist. These include editors like CKEditor, Tiny, and Quill. Others do exist but are not included here as they are opinionated in their design and/or abandoned. However, replacing Atto is not a trivial task. Whilst this approach would work around the issues of finding alternatives to Rangy and the use of deprecated browser APIs, it would not solve the issues of breaking compatibility with all existing third-party plugins; however it can provide a wealth of existing functionality with years of dedicated research and development instead. In many cases the current Moodle plugins can be replaced with existing plugins, negating the need to develop them again for Moodle. CKEditor The limitations above immediately preclude the use of CKEditor 5, which requires WebPack, and tree shakes the entire platform. It would not be possible for third-party developers to write plugins for multiple versions of Moodle, and a new compilation step would be required, and could only run when all possible plugins are in place. Configuration would not be trivial. QuillJS QuillJS is an editor framework. Whilst it can provide an editor without any further configuration, to do anything more Moodle would need to create all interfaces using our own existing components and integrate these with the QuillJS APIs. This is closer to the Replace Atto approach, but with a well-supported underlying editor API. This approach would still require all of the current overheads of maintaining an editor, albeit without most of the more complex editor parts. Tiny Tiny is a full-featured editor, which comes with a number of standard plugins which replace many of Atto’s standard features - these include standard formatting, font and colour selection, alignment and justification, undo/redo, word count, source-code viewing, table support, links, emojis, copy, and paste. Many of these features will work as-is for Moodle. Some use the Tiny modal and form frameworks and we would have to decide whether to use these in Moodle, or to rewrite them using the standard Moodle interfaces. This decision would not have to be made immediately. Other options I looked at a number of other possible editors, but these were either opinionated in their choice of technology (for example jQuery, specific Bootstrap versions), or were abandoned. What this means I have just opened MDL-75071 to look at migrating away from Atto in the near future. At the moment, given the above analysis, we are looking to migrate to the latest version of Tiny. Important: If you are aware of other editors which meet these criterion, and you feel we should include them in this consideration now is the time to mention them. At this time we are still analysis the work required to support Tiny 6 and are trying to consider items including: third-party plug migrations accessibility backwards-compatibility with older versions of Moodle The possibility of supporitng Tiny's own 'Premium' pluginset Best wishes, Andrew",

I am not just talking about the accessibility of using the editor but also the quality of the HTML that the editor generates. An accessible Moodle LMS that generates non-accessible content does not result in a WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant website and this is a huge problem for a huge and growing number of site owners today who are now required by law to ensure that their site meets the intention of the accessibility guidelines. With one of my past clients about 2 years ago, we did a lot of testing of several WYSIWYG editors. The criteria for selecting an editor included (listed in order of priority): Accessibility of the content it generated. Must be valid HTML5, no extra junk tags inserted, WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant. Accessibility of the editor's UI. Support for multiple languages. Paste clean HTML content from MS Word. Preferably open source or at least available under a site license, not a per-user license. Notice that generating accessible content is a higher priority in the list that ensuring that the editor interface itself is compliant? When I spoke with many Moodle LMS site Administrators at in-person and virtual MoodleMoot conferences over the last few years, you might be surprised at just how many told me that are still forcing the now very old TinyMCE editor (included with Moodle) on their users instead of Atto in recent and current versions of Moodle specifically for accessibility reasons. The aging editor looks aweful by today's standards but it often still beats Atto in terms of generating valid and clean HTML content. [I do want to express my gratitude to all of the people who have worked to improve Atto's ability to generate valid HTML5 content in recent releases of Moodle. You need to know that your efforts are very much appreciated by many.] In case it is of interest or useful to anyone, I did a little proof of concept back in 2020 to see if it might be possible to add CKEditor 3.5.2 into Moodle 3.8. (CKEditor used to be included with Moodle many years ago). The latest ALPHA/Dev release of my effort is available from: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-editor_ckeditor . I have not tried it in more recent versions of Moodle. Feel free to fork the project and continue its development. Hope you find this helpful. Best regards, Michael Milette",

Atto was always intended as an accessible editor and we worked very hard to have it generate accessible content with an accessible UI. It currently meets AA and attempts to generate AA-compliant content (this is not easy). Sadly the browser APIs do not make this easy, especially without any normalisation layer included.

It's never worked for Atto and unless we get specific funding to work on this in the future I don't know if we'll be able to dedicate time to it in the next 12 months. > - Preferably open source or at least available under a site license, not a per-user license. This is a requirement for us as Moodle is distributed under a GPLv3 license. Any included code must be compatible with this license. > When I spoke with many Moodle LMS site Administrators at in-person and virtual MoodleMoot conferences over the last few years, you might be surprised at just how many told me that are still forcing the now very old TinyMCE editor (included with Moodle) on their users instead of Atto in recent and current versions of Moodle specifically for accessibility reasons. The aging editor looks aweful by today's standards but it often still beats Atto in terms of generating valid and clean HTML content. I'm very surprised by this because that old version of TinyMCE was terrible for both UI accessibilitty, and generated content accessibility. > In case it is of interest or useful to anyone, I did a little proof of concept back in 2020 to see if it might be possible to add CKEditor 3.5.2 into Moodle 3.8. (CKEditor used to be included with Moodle many years ago). The latest ALPHA/Dev release of my effort is available from: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-editor_ckeditor . I have not tried it in more recent versions of Moodle. Feel free to fork the project and continue its development. I have a PoC of ckeditor 5.x for Moodle, but it is not compatible with our direction. The latest version(s?) of ckeditor require webpacking, and the standard configuration performs a tree shake and minification. Because of the way that this is done, it becomes extremely difficult (I won't say the impossible because there will be a way) to write plugins for it unless you run the webpack with all plugins in place . It's also not easily compatible with Moodle's plugin and subplugin directory structure. The only way I could get it working and have it such that I could even attempt to write a plugin which is installed at run time was to include the entire source and all dependencies (some 300MB). As I say, if it were possible to run webpack at runtime, it would be fine, but we don't have NodeJS as a runtime dependency for Moodle.

Thankfully the world has moved on and TinyMCE tout their accessible content as a feature. That said we do still need to do some testing on it. Sadly Atto does still have some issue in relation to accessibility. 2) That's already possible - it's an admin setting and you can enable/disable individual editors, and set the default for all users. You can configure Atto to remain default, and even add it back in after we've removed it if you see fit (though with the obvious caveats). Andrew",

We hope to also make it available in the plugins database for Moodle 4.0, and possibly 3.11 and 3.9 too (to be confirmed). Atto will remain the default editor for Moodle 4.1. From Moodle 4.2, Tiny will be the default editor, and we are considering moving Atto out of core and into the plugins database at the same time. This will depend on community feedback, and uptake from plugin developers. We do not accept any new YUI code into core, and have not done so for some time. We accept patches to existing YUI code and we strongly encourage migration of all non-atto YUI code to ES modules (ESMs) as quickly as possible. Right now we have too many things which are dependent upon YUI to know what the deprecation schedule will be. Once Atto has been removed, we will also be looking at updating the File manager, File picker, and Repository client. At this time we have 191 YUI JS files in core, plus some other locations which explicitly use YUI. After Atto's removal this will drop to 114. Some of those are compatability layers, or YUI itself, so the number is closer to 100. I know that the quiz code will shortly be updated to move to ESMs, and a number of other locations only use YUI code as part of their migration paths (course formats). The other big location using YUI is the EditPDF interface in the assignment activity, but this will require substantial work to migrate. Hope this helps, Andrew",

I'm sorry, but this is the reality. We *need* to make inroads to remove YUI and, as long as Atto is in core, I suspect it's highly unlikely that will happen. The deprecation policy is a little grey on its impact with regards the removal of plugins from core, and we haven't really applied it in that sense in the past. We removed a number of legacy plugins in Moodle 4.0 as a part of MDL-72046 and these were not subject to the deprecation policy either. I'm not sure why Atto is any different to those. Whilst Atto has been the default editor for a number of years, we've all known that it will be retired sooner rather than later due to its reliance upon YUI. We are trying to make it as easy as possible for developers to transition their plugins to support Tiny - for example, we are making Tiny available in the plugins database so that developers have a wider audience (hopefully back to Moodle 3.9 but TBC). I do understand where you're coming from, but I think there needs to be some give and take. Atto will be the default editor in Moodle 4.1 (LTS), which has a support end date of Nov 2023, and is security supported until Nov 2025. This the absolute latest we should consider supporting Atto to. We could (and I'm not saying we will) include it but not recommend it until Moodle 4.4, which has the same security support end date.

You keep taking about HQ 'supporting' Atto, as if HQ atually actively workes to fix the majority of bugs that are reported in Atto. I am sorry, that is just not true. HQ has ignored most Atto bugs for years. (I wonder how has fixed more Atto bugs? HQ or OU? Care to check?) That can continue, and, as I aready said, work on Atto can continue to ramp down. Just ignoring bug reports is very different from ripping it out. I can see your LTS point. So, that is an argument for removing Atto before 4.5. So, I think you should plan to icnldue it up to 4.4. If, by watching all the third-party atto_ plugins in the plugins DB, and montioring use of the various editors on a sample of Moodle sites (e.g. talk to partners), you later get the evidence that no sigificant harm would be done by removing Atto in 4.3 or 4.2, then make that case when you can prove it.

Specifically, to address what Andrew says, \"We removed a number of legacy plugins in Moodle 4.0 as a part of MDL-72046 and these were not subject to the deprecation policy either. I'm not sure why Atto is any different to those.\" The difference is that almost every single piece of text and a lot of other content beside (video etc) in Moodle is and has been done with Atto since it came out. I don't think there is a more important tool for content in the whole system. Not a single one of the plugins in 72046 or related trackers are on a par with Atto for functionality: they were all old long before removed and they had mature replacements. They had long outlived a formal deprecation window. There is a long history, for good reason, of co-supporting key deprecated tools, e.g,. Legacy files (which still exists in 4.0), old Assignment (only removed in 4.0), both got a decade of extra life. I agree with Tim that leaving it until 4.4 is a realistic plan to give people the necessary time to work through the inevitable issues of moving content over. I would call it the minimum realistic plan because the history of replacing things that become legacy is pretty clear in my experience in the field: if the new replacement does not work flawlessly %99.9999 out of the box, it will not be adopted right away. People shy away from it and stick with what works until it starts to break or just disappears. And none of us really want to put people in the position of having to move to something that doesn't work well. When Atto arrived, it mostly replaced Tiny right away for new content not only because it was the default but was simple and worked well. Even then it took a while, a year or two. But meanwhile, old content stayed on: only with the revamping of old content every two or three years did Tiny use fade away. The cycle of content updating plays a key role. On large sites with thousands of courses, many on a two year or three teaching cycle, that won't happen in eighteen months. If Atto is available as a extra plugin, I can easily predict it will be installed widely to get around this issue - because keeping Atto around will be less disruptive to teaching and is easier than updating hundreds of thousands or millions of pieces of text content -- unless the replacement process is almost frictionless, which is really the key. If the new Tiny can meet the accessibility bar, that would be a good choice, since I know it can meet the advanced user needs I see in the technical teaching areas. However, the really great thing about Atto is it is simple and clean: it supports all the ordinary needs without cluttering things up. Ideally we would like to have two modes for the editor, basic and advanced. Right now, advanced users can simply swap to Tiny in the preferences. That is working pretty well as far as I have seen. Basic Atto works very well for everything else. If we had a \"Basic Tiny\" with the same set of features as Atto comes with, paired with a \"Advanced Tiny\" with all the buttons, that would certainly lower the inevitable friction in converting. This could be a preference or even a capability, but I think having one and only one editor with one view for everyone will present some challenges. Atto's great virtue is it is simple (but not too simple). And advanced users still have a way to get those extra tools. Keeping that dual ability would be really ideal.",

Atto uses a time-based auto-save mechanism and can be configured to save the content if there have been changes on a regular cadence (for example every 15 seconds). TinyMCE autosaves the content every time a savepoint is generated. That happens when the undo stack is modified - usually whenever you click out of the editor, use a button, or press the [return] key. Hope this heps, Andrew",

I want to have the same feature for Quizzes; to show when the quiz is due. Activity completion dates do not show on the course view page. I suppose the other solution would be to show Activity Completion dates on the course view page. For now, it is very tedious for me to open each and every assignment/quiz in order to double check the date I set (because I use Activity Completion for uniformity purposes in both Assignments and Quizzes since Quizzes don't have due dates).",

It may be that we are an outlier in that we lock-down student emails to institutional ones as this makes it easier for our HR systems however it would be useful to allow students and external staff to use a secondary alternative email if desired. Some staff work for other institutions and therefore have other email addresses and may wish to group their emails in one inbox; the option for a secondary email would be perfect for us. I'd not seen the ability to forward notifications to another email (other than the profile email) but that does sound useful I'll give that try in the first instance although it does seem to be a complicated, rather unintuitive method for students/staff to simply assign a secondary/forwarding email. I think most users would expect to see this field in their profile settings. Alternatively perhaps the best option would be have the current method but have the 'notification email' field also visible in the user's profile under their main email address making it easier to find and edit. It would also help to advertise that the feature exists.",

Kind regards, Przemek PS. One aspect of messaging that interested me recently was that the specific places / contexts (e.g. courses) were not included in the body of the message, thus it often was and is difficult to quickly associate the message content / notification with the precise source from which it has come. I have added this tracker issue https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-77372 (\"Messages sent from course contexts should include links to the pertinent pages\") to indicate the problem.",

Filtering by department/sub-department, as well as by position, is already possible in the job assignments UI, which has a traditional table. But the department framework UI seems like a special case: it has nested rows, and the order of the rows determines hierarchy; in addition, the only potentially sortable column is a job-assignment count. Maybe the framework could have an \"editing\" and \"non-editing\" view? In editing view, the row order would be preserved, along with drag and drop, but in non-editing view, you could sort and filter, and any department row with child departments would expand to show those departments.

The ticket was closed when a more modest solution was provided, and which you see in your Workplace site: after 200 departments, the drag/drop functionality disappears (which was the cause of the Firefox issue). I hadn't realized that the ticket for the original refactoring approach had been closed, but IMO it's a far more robust solution, and I have asked the Workplace product team to reopen it. While Jira tickets for Workplace are not open to the public, I can share the basic details of the solution: Only show the first X nodes (X being large enough to load all nodes in most of the cases) When there are more than X nodes, show a link or button to load the next X Drag and drop will continue working as it is now, but only on visible nodes Modal form Introduce a Parent field, with an autocomplete. The autocomplete should show the path beside the node name (as in users allocation) If path has more than N nodes, we use ellipsis (i.e. \"... / Node 2.4.4 / Node 2.4.4.2 / Node 2.4.4.7\") Search: Introduce a search functionality: an autocomplete to select a node in the hierarchy (as in the modal) When a node is selected, we only load the node and its children (node's sub-tree) There has to be a way to \"remove\" the filter I'm not sure if this approach would cover your particular use for wanting a visibility toggle?",

In fact, although it is not currently implemented in the place you suggest, it is possible for the administrators of your university to add a section for pronouns. I can think of two ways: Your admin creates a new user profile field called Pronouns. If others enter their preferred pronouns you should be able to see them from their user profile if allowed by admin. But it wouldn't be in the place you specify. If it is a text input field then the admin can set it up so that it appears in lists for teachers (not students) so they can clearly see in their courses who uses which pronoun. If your admin is 100% sure that alternative names are not used in your university then they could rename the field Alternative name to Pronoun(s) and students could enter their pronouns there. However, that depends on nobody using alternative names, so is not so simple.",

You can also create your own site admin preset to share or reuse. The feature is based on the additional plugin Admin presets , created by David Monllaó and maintained by Pimenko . Many thanks to Pimenko for helping with 4.0 feature development. For further details, including info on the default presets Starter and Full, please see the dev docs page Site admin presets . If you're interested in trying out Site admin presets, please go to siteadminpresets.prototype.moodledemo.net . Feedback and suggested improvements are always welcome!",

In that particular case, that's the expected workflow from the original plugin and I can understand why it was designed like this: This option restores a preset that has been applied previously by the admin. So if you use this feature is because you want to revert something that you know didn't work for your Moodle site. With the restore this version feature, no data is lost because, if you revert a preset and then you realise it was a mistake, you can re-apply it again (and your Moodle site configuration will be again the same as before reverting it). However, feel free to create an issue in the tracker if you still think it should be reviewed/improved at any point You know how much we love hearing from the community and creating issues in the tracker and getting some votes/comments on them, is the best way to get some progress and help Moodle to be better Kind regards!

Suggestions for the Starter Pack settings: 1) Plugins / Enrolments / Manage enrol plugins > \"Disable Guest access\" This is vitally important: it is the first thing I do to new sites, always. Starter users not only don't understand how Guest works, but believe it to be entirely innocuous and are unaware of the potential danger. They are often horrified when they find out how it really works and how easy it would be for a course Teacher out of ignorance to enable this in their courses. Likewise: Is there a reason why \"Allow stealth activities\" still defaults to off in Advanced features? It's been around now since Moodle 3.3. I always turn it on. Otherwise, I think this is a good list of settings for real Starters. I would personally always leave Badges and Tags enabled, but I see why there is a case for turning those off in a Starter pack. Reviewing the XML file from the test site and it looks the same as the list on the doc page. Thanks Randy",

I agree with Randy for settings related to Guest access. But for the other points, i understand they are not of simple use, and should be reserved for advanced user/use. The point is that, not viewing things don't encourage to use them, when you simply don't know it exists. But too much things can be discouraging. I think it's the admin job to explain what could be possible, and enabled, if of use. I implies admin well knows what can be possible, event if not activated. Easy for old Moodle admins who knows Moodle well, not for beginners. Perhaps a message should be displayed for admin (a user tour ?) explaining that lot of things are disabled (for simpler use), and he should have a look at the whole existing settings to determine if other things should be enabled.

I've been configuring new sites now for about 11 years and the key issue is always as you say, \"The point is that, not viewing things don't encourage to use them, when you simply don't know it exists. But too much things can be discouraging.\" Where that line is depends a great deal on the prior experience of the admin. However, I strongly believe in erring on the site of leaving potentially useful things - especially for teachers - enabled rather than disabled. Admins, especially new admins who are already overwhelmed with other work, forget immediately once something has been turned off and often don't remember it exists. And instructors will never know something is possible if they don't see it or know it is there. But, on the other hand, I believe in turning potentially dangerous things off - Guest, blogs, search engine settings - until people really understand those. One thing I think can really be expanded is the questions asked in a new install. For example, Moodle now asks if you want another language and whether you want to enable Self registration. A Wizard like this that a new admin could run -after- the install to guide them through some things would be a good way to do this: if you added that to a Starter pack, it would solve this issue to some degree. The issue with Tours is you can't do anything with them: it's just information. A Wizard could actually adjust the settings.",

This parameter will only work during the installation process and will support a preset name (for instance, \"Starter\") or the path for an XML file (with a preset to be imported and then applied). More information can be found in MDL-73145 . For Moodle 4.1, we're planning to add a new screen in the installation wizard to let admins choose the preset to be installed.

Where should I set my Moodle? Written in the style of the page: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Site_admin_presets As an admin: I want to set several presets that can be granted to teachers at different points on their Moodle empowerment journey I want to set \"completion criteria\" that, when reached, moves the teacher to the next preset up (eventually reaching the full preset) Imagine if a teacher, new to Moodle could have their journey scaffolded so that they can unlock additional features as they become more familiar with the system. No information overload at the beginning, and a gamified system of unlocking more advanced features to both ease teachers into using these features AND to provide teachers with the motivation to explore Moodle more.

I made an attempt to achieve this by defining two levels of Teacher role, Standard and Simplified. The role description for the Simplified teacher in Moodle 3.9 is attached as an XML file you can import, if interested. I mainly removed the ability to add some of the more complex activities like Database and Workshop. In the end though, I didn't use it much because: a) I don't know enough about the ~400 lecturers who use the LMS to be able to categorise them into Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced; and b) classifying people like this is a quick way to annoy them. From an administrative perspective, the role has to be applied in each course to which the lecturer is enrolled, so it's not very practical really. A mechanism (wizard?) that allowed a Teacher (or Student) to choose their interface level might work, if framed/phrased well, e.g. \"I'm new to Moodle, show me the Essential interface. I'll change it later.\" \"I'm quite familiar with Moodle, show me the Advanced interface.\" \"I'm an expert, show me the Complete interface. (Warning: this adds lots of complicated and little-used features)\" As far as I can tell, nearly all the underlying building blocks needed to implement this type of facility are already present in Moodle. The only thing that's missing is a user interface that offers users  the ability to choose the interface level. The \"Site admin preset\" offers a template as to how this could be implemented.",

I'm please to inform you that the project is proceeding well and we are close to finalising our integration of TinyMCE version 6. I have created a prototype site to demonstrate the TinyMCE editor, which you can access at https://tinymce.prototype.moodledemo.net/ . I have created a course where you can try the editor in different areas, including: Creating forum content Taking a quiz both with, and without file attachments Creating activities The editor is nearing feature parity with Atto, and the following features have been implemented: Standard formatting (bold, italics, colour, heading levels, tables) Media - specifically images, videos, audio, and media management RecordRTC H5P The Accessibility Checker Several features are in-progress and will be ready in the coming week or so: The equation editor At this time, the intention is to include TinyMCE 6 in Moodle 4.1, alongside Atto and TinyMCE 3. It will not be the default editor in this release. In Moodle 4.2 we expect to make it the default editor. The timetable for removal of TinyMCE 3, and the migration of Atto to the plugins database has not yet been confirmed. If you have any feedback on this prototype, it would be great if you could either leave it here, or in MDL-75071 . Thanks, Andrew Lyons",

My 4.x.x dev site allows me to use both the current TinyMCE and Atto editors. Both use tool icons with borders around each tool button, with the Atto icons using nice round corners that really fit in well with the look of the Boost theme. The TinyMCE editor icon borders have sharper, but still slightly rounded corners, that seem to fit in with both the Boost and classic themes.",

Obviously there is some overlap, but if we were to define the style for how those values are displayed within TinyMCE, then if it were later removed then all of the content would lose its styling. For Moodle 4.1 that's largely okay, but the difficulty comes when we make TinyMCE available in the Plugins database and users install it in Moodle 3.11 where we have not (and will not) add those styles to the core theme.

Rick Jerz commented that Moodle is taking one step forward and around five steps backward with TinyMCE. With the automatic deletion of the script tag, I have no words to say how disappointed I am. For many users, deleting the script tag is nothing less than sabotage since scripts are used in so many situations. You can't just remove the script tag! Please re-allow it! Well, I know you won't.

First two questions: 1) Is it Ok that when we return from the \"Source code\" view back to the visual editor we have to hit the \"Save\" button ? Maybe that button should be a simple \"OK\" ? I believe \"Save might suggest we are done with the edits and leaving the editing page completely? 2) The blockquote style does not appear to do anything? No indent, no smaller font etc? First impressions: it feels great, and I will certainly return for some more testing. I always loved how Tiny displays the HTML elements structure underneath the editing area - so useful to see I'm in a p or in a div, etc. I hope the developers of plugins such as atto_embedquestion and atto_cloze will be able to quickly catch up with these exciting developments.

Rather than doing this we are trying to encourage developers to think about the optimal configuration for their plugins. We will also be looking to add the ability to enable and disable plugins more easily within the UI. It's also worth noting that the menu and toolbar can both be configured from within a plugin, so a plugin could be written to control the toolbar configuration. This is a much more powerful approach from a developer perspective and we've already heard that some organisations are really. keen on this approach as it will allow them to provide different configurations for different roles, activities, locations within Moodle, etc. For example, it would be very easy to only show the formatting tools, and remove all menus and justification tooling for students, or for those in a forum.",

          "Text": "Hi Rick, So, what should one do if one wants to control the tools made available to students? Generally all of the tools available should be suitable for all users. I'm not aware of any tools which you would want to disable completely, and always. Continue using ATTO? Or run the legacy TinyMCE? We will not be removing the Atto plugin until around Moodle 4.4. We hope that you will use the new TinyMCE integration, but if it does not currently suit your needs then we understand that you may wish to wait. Running the newest TinyMCE 6 doesn't seem to provide control yet... you get what you get until someone develops a plugin. Whilst TinyMCE 6 does not provide the same level of control, I'd argue that the control in Atto is very weak. Yes it allows you to configure the toolbar, but it is a very blunt instrument and offers no finer-grained detail. That's something that is possible in Tiny, but not currently out-of-the-box. I would rather implement something well, and with appropriate user research, than to implement it poorly as in Atto and legacy Tiny. It seems odd that the \"newest\" Tinymce has fewer features and control than the legacy TinyMCE. The legacy TinyMCE really does have to go and we anticipate removing it in Moodle 4.2. It has not been maintained for a very long time, and it doesn't really offer anything that is not available in the new integration with the exception of the toolbar configuration. It does not have many of our newer features (for example RecordRTC, H5P, etc). What features do you feel are missing? Yes, I noticed that the H5P button could be turned off by removing it as a plugin. But when upgrading Moodle, one has always to remember to do this. As I noted in my previous reply, the better way to do this is to modify the permissions for this. It is not necessary to remove the plugin. How do I disable the \"record audio\" and \"record video\" tools? We have not allowed for this at this time. Use of these plugins is no different in terms of disk utilisation than a user uploading media, which is still allowed. If a user wants to include a video submission of some kind, they could do so previously by recording it and uploading using the Media plugin. The RecordRTC plugin just provides a shortcut to this. You can, of course, nobble it and reduce the maximum recording length down so that it is practically useless. I would not recommend this approach. Yes, I realize that TinyMCE 6 is more complex. But it seems that Moodle is taking one step forward and around five steps backward with TinyMCE. However, maybe I am missing something. Re-reading the posts from above, I am not sure what it is. I will continue to monitor this discussion. Thanks for the feedback. The integration of TinyMCE 6 is Moodle 4.1 was never going to suit every need, no matter how hard we have tried to do so. We wanted to get it into core for our LTS release to encourage plugin developers to add support for their features to it -- the LTS release is a good carrot to encourage greater plugin availability. We have tried to get feedback from the community on these changes, but as you see in this discussion, the feedback we've had so far is fairly limited. We are aware that some features are not the same as in Atto (or legacy Tiny) but I would argue that we shouldn't be seeking to make them identical. In some cases those existing features are problematic and limiting when it comes to making change.\nYou can already see an example of this with Atto - the existing configuration value is an absolute nightmare to manage and as the default plugin list changes it's quite challenging to update it, or add/remove plugins in a reliable programmatic way. We've had requests for making 'simple' versions of the editor for some situations, and it simply isn't easily possible. We have tried to make sure that the new plugin platform is solid, and detailed, and that the configuration that is present does not cause issues with the hope that all community plugins can be made to work in Moodle 4.1. In terms of configuraiton if we had implemented a rudimentary configuration system in core for Tiny 6 in 4.1, and later get feedback that something very different is required, it becomes more and more challenging to migrate to that position. As I have mentioned, we've already had several people comment that the organisation of toolbars and menus should allow for much richer and fine-grained configuration and this could be very difficult to achieve if we implement some of these features in core incorrectly at the outset. Thanks again for your feedback, Andrew",

For example, in Atto, the button for our embedded question filter ( https://moodle.org/plugins/atto_embedquestion ) only appears to users with permission to embed a question. Same thing should apply to the H5P button. If we want some users to embed H5P and other not, there should be a capability to control that, and that should affect all aspects of how this feature appears to users, not just the presensce of absence of the button in the edtior toolbar.",

Perhaps students can upload large videos, but I am controlling this by disabling the file system for students. I am not arguing the point; I am just trying to present what I see as a problem with TinyMCE 6 and hoping that a solution is found in the future, realizing that this move to TinyMCE 6 is new. When I visit the TinyMCE website, there seem to be all kinds of nice features available. For example, buttons to color the text and background, which I currently have to add as a plugin to ATTO. It would be great if I could simply turn on a button in TinyMCE 6. When I look at TinyMCE 6 in Moodle 4.1, it appears to be a dramatically scaled-down version of TinyMCE. However, I am still learning, and perhaps I am missing something. I have found that when you show things to students that do not do anything, it creates student questions that the instructor has to waste time explaining. This is why I like to remove things (like buttons) that I don't support on my Moodle.",

As everyone scrambles to condense their courses to a more manageable list of activities, one of the major ways we can reduce endless scrolling is by embedding or linking documents directly within books, pages, glossaries, ect. With ATTO, we use the \"Link...\" Option and navigate to an uploaded file via the \"Browse repositories...\" function. This currently isn't the case for TinyMCE 6 but it seems some of the functionality is partially there via the \"Media Manger\". PDF & doc are currently not accepted formats if you use the Insert > Multimedia option. RE: The need to disable certain functions = YES! As @Rick points out, many institutions use enterprise solutions for audio/video and need to disable/limit RTC (side rant: RTC still not entirely mobile compatible). As @Mary points out, if done through privileges/capabilities, this will work for most. Utilize limited TinyMCE Stylesheet control - customizable at the site level similar to custom CSS function for Boost theme. Basic text styling color presets — especially a highlighter. The plugins for ATTO were ok but personally believe folks at basecamp nailed it with their editor options (see image) TinyMCE v6 - website editor Basecamp3 Bootstrap elements — most notably, the flexible grid. Moving users away from using tables for layout is critical to a mobile friendly course. Making it easy for users to add these layout templates without need for coding was extremely helpful. Expanding this to buttons and other bootstrap elements would make some users really happy. Codeblock & HTML mode Styling Codeblock: The styling is problematic and really should mirror what we're seeing elsewhere on the web. Which would you rather look at? TinyMCE v6 Rest of the web... Beautified HTML code mode – props to Andrew Lyons for maintaining that function in ATTO!",

          "Text": "Hi Joshm Thanks for the feedback. 1) Unfortunately this was an oversight and will be added in 4.2. The link plugin was inadvertently missed as a feature needing to use the Repository. We have MDL- to cover this. 2) Disabling featurs As Mary and I have pointed out, this is already possible. We already define RecordRTC capabilities for this. We also do so for several other features (like H5P). Re your side rant, we're trying to solve this, but different browser and OS combinations offer different support for different codecs. The only solutions is to transcode the content once recorded, but this would require something like ffmpeg being installed on the server - which is unlikely to be a popular move, and is also difficult to get right. We are also trying to transcode the content using WASM modules at play-time but this solution is not perfect. It's also not clear how best to solve this one. 3) This is a tricky one to solve. TinyMCE's default colour selector is very problematic and we deliberately disabled it with the intent to replace it with something more suitable in the future. The problem boil down to the way in which it sets the colour on the selected content - specifically it does so by setting a style attribute with a hard-coded hex colour in the element. Whilst that seems like a really simple and obvious way to do things, it does not work well in our case where we have multiple theme support, and themes may change over time, or offer features such as dark mode. As a case in point, you may create content which has a yellow background using the TinyMCE colour palette, and use the standard font colour (dark grey I believe). That works well, until someone updates the theme to support dark mode and flips the background colour to dark grey and the font colour to an off-white. Because of the way in which TinyMCE sets the colour on the content, it's only set the background colour (pale yellow), but the font colour is now an off-white. As a result you have content which has dark grey page background, with the content itself having a pale yellow background and off-white text. It's totally illegible. The other concern with using colours for content is that they are often used to highlight content. Again your suggestion pretty much hits the nail on the head - your suggestion is to add a \"highlighter\", but that's only a visual highlight. It does not work for users of screenreaders with very low or no visual acuity. Ideally we need to find a way that indicates that content has a high priority to them in some way too. We are looking to solve this - and the first part is relatively easy. Rather than hardcoding colorus onto the element via a style attribute, we can set a class name on it with the theme filling in the colours. We can do this using CSS variables so that the editor can consume them from whichever compiled CSS the theme uses (SCSS, LESS, SASS, etc.). A little work is required here as we need to essentially define a contract between the theme and the editor on the styles that they should use, and the list of available colour groups. We don't want to use something that is TinyMCE-specific because if you later remove the editor, along with its bundled style content, any styles bundled will be removed and your content will lose all styling. The latter part is a little more challening and we'll likely need to work with our accessibility consultants and UX designers to find a solution which makes this possible with the least difficulty. 4) Flexible grid That sounds like a really useful feature. Again we do have the concern with theme interactions and requiring a contract with all theme as to which CSS classes they will commit to supporting for which features. That's mostly a discussion rather than a technical challenge. Could I ask you to create a new issue on MDL-75926 with more information on this one? 5) Codeblock & HTML mode Styling The view source code tool is going to be updated via MDL-75265 to support beautification, and code styling. We'll have to look separately at handling this in the rendered content though - again we get into issues with themes doing things differently and this one is possibly harder to solve. We'll handle theming of code blocks in rendered content separately. I have created MDL-76518 to cover this. Andrew",

If you want to have a look at that rubrix plugin before it lands in the plugins db, it's available here: https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-gradingform_rubrix I've heard from a few other people interested in improvements to the rubrics/marking guides recently - hopefully we'll see some more advanced grading methods land in the plugins db at some point.",

I have seen this lots of times on other sites, for instance when buying something as a \"guest user\" and then being prompted after the purchase to create a real account and so put in my name and password where my previous order has been saved for me.

I've struggled to find a similar request though I cannot believe no one has asked this before.

To communicate what day they are on, I need to create a custom message that is restricted to only that group, but I need to have multiple copies, which ends up being very messy and time-consuming. If I could have something like: Welcome [firstname] to Chemistry 1000. You have been placed in the [prac_group] afternoon practical group and the [tut_group} morning tutorial group. Please contact your tutor [tutor_name] at [tutor_email] should you need any help. If this was deeply embedded in Moodle, it would also allow for highly personalized experience for users, since feedback, assignments, everything could embed their names into them. thoughts? Gareth",

          "Text": "Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University recently asked the team here at Catalyst about the possibility of improving the annotation UI to help their teaching staff - they came to us with two main requirements: 1) Page Scrolling - allowing normal page scolling instead of the navigation buttons. 2) The ability to undo. We put together a high level proposal that covered an approach we think makes sense and we wanted to open this up for further public discussion - so here it is: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Improve_Annotation Please feel free to comments here - negative and positive comments are both really welcome and may help to shape the proposal further. Since we put this together the team at Warwick have managed to develop a patch adding undo to the existing annotation plugin which is awesome! (see MDL-60299 ). This is still in the early proposal stage and Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University hasn't confirmed if they will have the budget to fund this yet, but if you think this is great and want to help - there are a number of development tasks that could be looked at prior.",

          "Text": "Looks good - the PDF annotation could certainly do with a bit of work. I would note one inaccuracy in the description: Yes, Moodle does convert the PDF into images in order to show them in the browser (the original version of it long predated the existence of PDF js), but it does not \"convert [the images] back into a PDF so it can be downloaded\". The downloaded version is generated on the server from the original PDF with the annotations added into it - there has never been a step that converted the display images back into a PDF (as that would result in a huge final PDF that is composed of lots of images, rather than the text that you actually find when you download it). To be clear - are you proposing to edit the PDF content directly in the browser and then send the fully updated PDF back to the server? (I could see that being impractical with large PDF files and a slow connection) Otherwise, it appears to be a similar solution as already exists (draw annotations within the browser, send the details of those annotations back to the server, combine those details with the PDF to generate a new PDF to download). Be aware that scrolling is also tricky in situations where annotation is also required, as, particularly with touch-screen devices, it can be hard to determine whether a user intends to scroll, or add an annotation (unless there is a separate icon to switch into scroll mode).",

Yes - we'd be saving these annotations directly into the file itself / editing the pdf directly in the browser so there would potentially be some large files being transferred when saving but the library I'm suggesting we use allow us to get the full list of annotations from a document so we should also be able to support sending the annotations from the browser to the server and letting the server save those directly into the file itself (using the same library but as a server-side process), however I can see us running into edge-case bugs with PDFs where existing annotations are not stored correctly or not supported by the highkite library so I think we should also support a process to send the full edited file as well. This does mean the bandwidth requirements for saving the document in this new process might potentially be higher than the existing method, but if we implement this well I can't see that being a blocker - and if we're lucky, we might find that passing the annotation meta directly to the server might work reliably on it's own.",

In the Boost theme it seems we have 4 \"set\" header items: Home Dashboard My courses Siteadmin for siteadmins In the current theme I was able to remove HOme from the navigation view with custom css , since most of my organizations find it very confusing for students to have a Dashboard and home page. Even though I receive a positive response on the My Course page, I also get the question if in the new Moodle 4.0 LMS it will be possible to disable/remove the page Home and/or Dashboard from the view of students. Since this will no become extra confusing for them, since students are used to see their course in the \"Dashboard\" page. I might be missing the setting and/or capability to remove this from the view. Or maybe it is simply not there? I have been checking out if I can \"remove\" it from view as I did before, but I think I have to do this now with the \"tabindex\" and that just creates a \"white\" gab. So I am thinking of removing the full header, and then just theme settings \"custom menu items\". So concluding I am wondering: 1) Is there a setting/capability I am missing? If not I will remove the full header and use custom menu items. 2) Are there more siteadmin who will face this same issue, and it is therefor worth to create a tracker for this?

However, it takes up about 4x as much vertical space. Is this going to be a good trade-off for everyone? (I mean, a pejorative term people often use about Moodle courses is 'scroll of death'.) 2) So far, we just have requirements, which is fair enough, but I am a developer, so I would love to see a sketch of how you propose to make the additional display of open and close date work in all cases, without causing a performance regression. The 'all cases' I am thinking about in particular are: a) the dates can depend on the individual user and which groups they are in, in at least assign, lesson and quiz. b) activities are a type of plugin, and different activities have different settings that may or may not be relevant here. (So, I assume these dates are coming from some sort of callback? Would be interesting to know what you are thinking here.) Thanks.",

          "Text": "Thank you, Tim, for raising 2 good points. Let me comment on the second one. We are adding a base class in MDL-70815 (core_completion\\activity_custom_completion) which activity modules can extend, so they can implement their custom logic for specifying if a specific completion criterion is met for the activity or not. This is done by core_completion\\activity_custom_completion::get_state() which takes a completion rule (or criterion) and returns if that rule is met. We cache the result in $cm->customdata['customcompletionrules'][] to minimise the risk of having performance regressions. Although it is still a work in progress, Jun has already provided a patch for MDL-70815 which you can look at to see what I described in real and with more details. Our development epic for this project is MDL-70814 . It shows how we broke this project into smaller pieces.",

If I have a to-do list, when I have done something, I just write 'Done' next to it; I don't then go and write it out again in the past tense. I also wondered about reversing things as you suggested John, however the colon in things like \"Receive a grade: Done\" or \"Make entries: 2: Done\" doesn't seem quite right to me.

Below are a few of my comments. 1) To help teachers, could the 'Grade' message be included just as it is in the dashboard timeline block?  Teachers could then scroll up and down the course to see if they have something to grade. 2) Many of our teachers are not keen on students being able to mark something as done without having even clicked into the assignment. Can we remove this from the course page and only make it available once clicked into the assignment and at the bottom next to the 'edit submission' button? By doing so, this would hopefully encourage students to review the assignment instructions and other submission status information. 3) The green Done button seems not very useful. I can click the assignment link and without having read the assignment, the green button now tells me that I viewed it. More importantly I think its confusing because I see a grey button that tells me that I need to submit it. Also not sure about the 'To do: Receive a grade' It would make more sense to me to have something like 'waiting for grade'. Also it would be nice to have an indicator such as 'teacher left a comment'.",

If you are going to require activity completion but for space saving sake decide to not show dates and to not show\ncompletion conditions (you can totally be inclined to do this), how is the Student activity completion in Moodle 3.11 project going to deal with that? (To be clear: \"Show activity dates\": \"No\"; \"Enable completion tracking: \"Yes\"; \"Show completion\nconditions\": \"No\") Showing no visual indicator some action is required then would be a loss of functionality. Moodle up to 3.10 would have shown checkboxes. It also then would require the students to access every activity/resource and to memorize\nthat it has completion tracked. If desired I can absolutely open a tracker Issue \"When \"Show activity dates\": \"No\"; \"Enable completion tracking: \"Yes\"; \"Show completion conditions\": \"No\" is set, a visual indicator should show what activity needs\ncompletion\".

          "Title": "Feature Request > Dynamic Moodle Syllabus",
          "Text": "With a little bit of magic, we've been able to create a dynamically generated course syllabus. We used POODLL to dynamically pull the 'activity names', 'points', and 'due dates' for Moodle activities in each Module We also used Generico plugin to dynamically pull in the Moodle Profile pic and bio of the instructor. And we made the syllabus into a 'Moodle Book' with the following table of contents: Course Overview Meet Your Instructor Required Textbooks Course Calendar Description of Assignments Final Grade Course Policies Communication Policies University Policies This means that the instructor can change, the Moodle activities can change, and the syllabus will dynamically update these changes. Very little need to update or maintain a syllabus to align with the course shell!! So this got me thinking about whether Moodle could create something like this which could provide for 'bulk edit' changes and a single view from which to make them. A 'Moodle Syllabus' which dynamically updates off of the data in the course shell relevant to a course syllabus. Consider, for example, if Moodle Developers added an 'Estimated Time to Complete' category to each Moodle Activity, we could dynamically add that to the Moodle Syllabus because we can do a lookup off of that data. So, imagine a 'Moodle Syllabus' which can lookup this data off of each module and generate the 'Activity Name', 'Due Date', 'Points', 'Estimated Time to Complete' (along with ways to hide or show each one, so end-users could choose what they want to show). But imagine, in addition to this, that you could toggle a 'Moodle Syllabus' edit button—like we do on the Moodle Lesson —and it would turn all of those lookup variables into 'editable boxes' end-users could just type into and upon 'save', it would write those new values to each of those activities in the course shell. You then toggle the edit button for the Moodle Syllabus off and then it looks up those values and you can verify they all changed the way you wanted them to?? Bonus would be connecting this to the Activity Completion so you could 'bulk edit' that alongside this functionality. Add a place for a school or company logo and make it look amazing to Print out and I think this would be a much used feature of Moodle!",

If keeping to the same Moodle instance, it wouldn't be necessary to duplicate file resources, just migrate the data minus user information. It can pretty much be based upon activity backup and restore in core Moodle with the right parameters set (don't copy users, grades, groups etc to the new instance). Should we have a new tracker?  Does anyone agree?  The Royal Veterinary College is too small to support and maintain hand built plugins, so it would be good to see this move into core.",

The problem is that when using course completion by a selection of activities in such a course, you can not specify the required activities per language. As a consequence of which none of the users will have the course marked as completed. Therefore I think it would be a really helpful addition to have multilanguage settings in course completion. For instance to enable you to select the required activities per language. Maybe by having a column for each language that lists all the activities. (Dependent on using the restriction by language or so). Or that you can select several activities with an \"OR\"-statement. Ie: Required activity 1 = \"Introduction_EN\" OR \"Introduction_FR\" OR \"Introduzione_IT\" I already posted a feature request over here: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72804 If you think this is a useful addition as well: Please vote If you have ideas about how to achieve this in code then please add your comments.

Administrators use Moodle but over time settings get changed, admins come and go, and Moodle itself upgrades with new functionality. It would be really nice for admins to have a feature which could do an assessment of a Moodle instance for core \"vital signs\" of Moodle health. Just like you and I go to the doctor and they check our temperature, weight, and blood pressure because these are core indicators of our health, we could do something like this for Moodle. I am not a Moodle expert, so I don't know what those vital signs would be. But use the body for reference. There are core 'vital signs\" for overall health that give you an indication of how the body is doing and whether there are any 'serious' indications this person may need to be 'admitted' for further analysis. There are also 'structural dimensions' to the human body. The spine, for example, needs to be in alignment and bringing alignment to the spine fixes a number of other issues. And then you move your way out to 'muscle tissues' / 'range of motion', etc. If we took an analogous approach to Moodle, we could develop some core 'vital signs' to check a Moodle instance for overall health and give Moodle admins a dashboard with these indicators to fix. Sort of like an SEO evaluation of your website?? And then perhaps there might be room for some of these other factors like 'structure', 'flexibility'/'range of motion', etc. Moodle admins and developers could probably start working through a list of suggestions. But imagine the usefulness of being able to run a 'vital signs'-like check on your Moodle instance and be given a report of things you can fix to improve it?? Todd",

Course \"Announcements\" forums that use the old pre-Moodle 3.0 \"News forum\" name. Courses that don't have the \"ID Number\" field set. Students who don't have the \"Mobile phone\" field set. It's not a dashboard, but it does provide me with daily alerts. I have a rule set on my Inbox to delete emails where there no results to report.",

For instructional designers and those who live and breathe Learning Management Systems, it is not too difficult to figure out the features of the settings and how they might best be used. BUT . . . for non-specialists (the vast majority of Moodle users), they really need more help and guidance. Feature Request: Create a Moodle Assignment Wizard So if an instructor creates a new assignment, they could click an \"Assignment Wizard\" button which would bring them through the settings for that assignment or quiz to set it up with what they want: Would you like to see a word count? Is this a summative or formative assessment? Do you want students to see the answers to the question right after they take it or after they finish the entire quiz? Do you want students to take the question over and over again until they get the right answer? How would you like that to be scored? Points off for wrong answers? etc. The point is that a wizard like this helps 'translate' the functionality of settings in Moodle and does a better job of teaching what is possible (instead of leaving it to instructors to click on question marks next to each setting to figure it out). I know it is a big ask, but I believe functionality like this would increase demand for Moodle.",

However, we had planned to build it within our plugin (which is an activity which has a lot of use cases). Your post made it clear to me, that an „activity creation wizard“ could be a thing. A number of activities come into mind that could benefit from this, e.g. Assignment Quiz Forum Lesson Database Each of them have „too many features“ (which is perfect for experts, but overwhelming for non-experts). What do others think? Is that something of value for teachers? We already have a plugin which makes creating courses easier (kickstart), so it would make sense for us to add such a wizard for activities. Cheers Stefan",

Hopefully a _really_ good wizard would (at the end of the process) also give you an option of seeing all the settings that it has configured for you (so as to be a useful learning exercise, rather than a prop that teachers are uncomfortable to move beyond). I like the idea of the wizard - but the really tricky part is to determine the right questions to ask, to split the features up in a way that works for the different use cases (because everyone will be able to come up with a list of the core, essential features of each activity, and everyone's list will be different). An extensible wizard that can be customised by local admin teams (via some sort of UI to edit every question shown and edit the outcomes - both in terms of activity type generated and settings configured), would be ideal, but one that started with a good, solid range of initial questions, so that institutions do not _have_ to customise it, for it to be useful. Thinking, as I type, an import/export would also be nice, to share good wizards with different institutions ... Just to be clear - I'm not here to volunteer to write this system - I have quite enough Moodle code to write in my day job! Besides, as I implied above, the code is probably the easy part, the hard part is the questions and the decision tree - that needs a lot of careful thought, research and user testing.",

As mentioned above, the first version of it could follow the same logic as kickstart (the course format): 1) The admin creates a number of activities pre-configured for the most important use cases. 2) The admin then creates a backup of this activity and adds it to the kickstart \"activity templates\" 3) The teacher can then open the activity chooser and a) either pick \"core naked\" activity b) or pick the kickstart activity, which acts like a \"wizard\" Within the kickstart activity, all activity templates, each with a description and instructions would be provided. The kickstart would then, instead of saving a kickstart activity, import the activity templates and the teacher can (optionally) configure it. In a future version, we could add the \"decision tree\" using questions like discussed in this thread. We currently work on a development (for another activity) which has 90% of the functionality, once we've completed that, we could wrap that within a separate activity easily, something like mod_kickstart I'll post updates about the developments here.

In fact, about 6 years ago, a user was already asking for that here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=281372 As he already mentioned, this became very common in courses on EDX: when there is a video with some teacher talking, a transcript of what is telling is automatically scrolling on th side of the screen, and it is possible to stop the autoscrolling and click on a sentence to jump to the corresponding moment in the video. This is also possible on some streaming platform like Microsoft Stream and Youtube, it seems. I think it is just a little JavaScript trick, as for example illustrated on this web site: https://jsbin.com/bevehi/edit?html,css,js,output I am not a specialist and I can't make it work when I try the same code in a f ile resource , using a video and VTT that are stored in Moodle. Well, what is important here is that t would be nice to have it when we use a page resource and when we integrate the video player: having an option 'scrolling and clickable transcript on the side' would be great. All the best, Thierry.",

          "Title": "Feature Request > Moodle Glossary for Embeddable Learning Units",
          "Text": "Context : Currently instructors upload content for instruction to Moodle in various ways. These include uploading file folders for course resources, adding online videos to content pages, books, or lessons. Some upload files to a 'hidden module' and then use active links to link to them from various resources and activities . Problem: Course maintenance becomes a problem as instructors make changes. Did I change that in the hidden block? Or was that the file attached to the activity itself? The YouTube link is now broken in the video. Without doing a full, fine-toothed comb review of every single element in the course, there is no way to guarantee all content is fresh and up-to-date. This is time-consuming. Feature Request: What if it was possible to use Glossary Entries as Embeddable Content Units for your Moodle activities and resources? So imagine you could go to a Moodle Lesson , Moodle Page, Moodle anything, and simply 'embed' a content element from the Moodle Glossary (as opposed to simply 'linking' to it and pulling the student out of the activity / resource to the glossary). Here is the 'use case': Instructors could use the Moodle Glossary to create an encyclopedia of learning content designed the way they want it to look. And they could embed these within their Moodle Activities and Resources. When they want to update them, they simply update them in the Moodle Glossary. Think about the value of this for ongoing 'Course Maintenance'! An instructor or instructional designer would not have to go through an entire Moodle course line by line and though every activity. They could simply go through this Moodle Glossary and check for broken links, make updates, etc. I think there could even be secondary value for students studying for a Midterm or Final Exam, as they could look at the glossary, with its comprehensive content, to study for the exam?? Hopefully I am making sense, but I think something like this might be very useful for instructors. They could also use the tags to organize and filter their resources and use the comments to annotate them.",

While we have 'All', 'Activities', and 'Resources', the distinction between the latter two is clear enough. There are no grades associated with the Resources. But for the 'Activities', some have the ability to provide a grade and others do not. 'Choice' or 'Group Choice' do not have grading capabilities, for example. So adding a tab for 'Gradable' activities would really help create some clarity around this, as some faculty (like myself), might create a syllabus thinking one of these activities will be graded before actually building it out in Moodle.",

          "Title": "Amazing Idea for Moodle - Course Review Functionality",
          "Text": "I developed \"Modular\" Course Design Reviews for our University organized by Areas of the Moodle LMS: Course Header (Welcome & Orientation) Main Course Page (Navigation & Clutter) Modules - Big Picture (Alignment with Outcomes ) Assignments - Individual Prompts (Rigor & Standards) Syllabus & Gradebook (Alignment & Accuracy) Media Check (Quality & Accessibility ) Each one allows you to answer 10-20 questions using branching logic on a Microsoft Form. I have it setup with a Power Automate flow to send the results by email to the reviewer. The advantages to this Modular approach to Course Design Review: You can delegate specific reviews to those with relevant expertise (e.g., Media Check by a Multimedia Specialist, Modules - Big Picture to an Instructional Designer) These shorter \"mini-reviews\" are easier to complete in one-sitting (compared to comprehensive reviews) Collating everything which needs to be reviewed for a particular \"View\" / \"Area\" of the LMS saves course reviewers time, as they can review all of it in that location. Here is what I want Moodle to be able to do: An Annotated Course Review Functionality based on Area of LMS The new feature would perform two functions: Function 1 - Based on Moodle LMS Role, would allow customizable questions to be created to evaluate that area of the course. This would allow for both a quantitative, multiple-choice like question (\"Meets Standard\", \"Almost Meets Standard\", \"Does Not Meet Standard\", \"Not Applicable\"). Users could make their own, but this functionality would be capable of generating a CSV file or report of some kind. It would also allow for qualitative, open-ended feedback questions . Function 2 - Both Quantitative and Qualitative feedback could be seen within each area of the LMS as \"annotated comments\" based on certain roles. So an Instructor and Instructional Designer role could see them but not students. They could use this as a checklist to clean up and make adjustments to the course based on these annotations and then delete them or mark them complete when addressed. So there would be a function which would tie customizable questions for feedback to a specific area of the course shell (e.g., Activity, Main Page, Module) and there would be another function which could capture that feedback as annotations which would show up for certain user roles in those areas of the course. What is the value of this feature to users of Moodle? The value is that instead of users of the LMS using external tools, methods, etc.  to do Course Design Reviews for Quality Assurance, this functionality could be integrated within the LMS in the areas where that feedback is relevant and may need adjustment / improvement. This also makes it possible for universities to choose their own, customizable review standards. So a university which wanted to use Quality Matters, could type in those standards into this based on the area of the LMS these could be identified. But another university could use OSCQR Rubric or create their own. This would be invaluable functionality and could really set the Moodle LMS apart from competitors which do not offer anything close to this type of functionality. I am also open to making the modular reviews I created open source so others can benefit from them and the community can improve on them. They could even be added as \"defaults\" to give end-users an idea of how best to use this functionality and  then customize it for their needs?? Bonus would be if it was also made possible to award a Badge or Certify a course based on a certain score for these questions!",

Just my opinion, I don't have a very strong one because we use a custom theme and would not use navigation like this in any case (and I haven't worked out if underlying changes have problems for us). If, and it may be a big if, I have understood the mockup image correctly... Then the navigation on a course page looks like this: Overview Settings Participants Grades Reports Question bank More In other words it visually looks like there are lots of tabs available within a course all with equal prominence, the first is 'Overview', the next  is 'Settings', then 'Participants' etc etc. It looks like the selected tab, when actually looking at a course page, is 'Overview'. This is not the right way to conceptually view a course. There are two categories of thing here: the actual course page (which is not an 'overview'), and then various pages about the course (settings, grades). If you were to represent it as a hierarchy (I'm not suggesting the navigation should work that way), it would be something like: The actual course Metadata Settings Participants ... At a minimal level, a way to represent this might be something like: Use the course shortname (e.g. CS101) instead of the misleading 'Overview'. Change formatting so it's clear that the course is much more important than the other options. Here's a mockup, not that I'm sure this is a great idea either, but just saying I'm not really sure if this metadata really ought to be top level navigation  along with the main course page, or it would be more appropriate in a side menu (as present), but this kind of distinction would at least help imo. --sam",

          "Text": "As an instructor and instructional designer, seeing bungled HTML content from students / faculty is frustrating (e.g, multiple sized fonts, awkward spacing, etc.). Because the text editor in Moodle prioritizes the local HTML of content in each text box, when students and faculty copy and paste from the web or word processors, Moodle retains awkward spacing, fonts, etc. The entire point of using Moodle as a Learning Management System is to streamline the experience of teaching and learning . Seeing bungled formatted HTML is, in my view, one of the most significant frustrations of end-users with Moodle. My web browser has a way to clean up content and strip away ads and content besides pictures and text and puts it into a clean, easy-to-read format. Is there a way to do this with a plugin for Moodle? Can we add this as a button? or code it to work better with existing web browser functionality which already does this? (for example, when looking at a forum post, Safari web browser can clean up the text for the very first forum post, but will not find or clean up the others). Any effort to make readability a priority would greatly streamline the end-user experience. I would love to see this find its way into Moodle 4.0. If there is already a solution, I apologize for not already knowing and would much appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction. Kind regards, Todd",

However, she is not the most disciplined person (well, teenager, I guess that is normal) and she is lacking overview over the assignments she has. In order to \"fix\" this I created some script, which is scraping the Moodle website and collecting all open assignments and their status. I now would like to integrate this feature into Moodle. I am software developer and would like to contribute this to the app. I attached a screenshot of how it looks right now. As you might see, I am a developer and not a UX/UI designer. So I could use some help on the UX/UI part. Actually my most important question is right now: how to ask for those UX/UI resources? Apart from that I read about the dev process https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Process and as soon as I can start programming everything is clear. But it is not really clear for me, how to get to this point. Is there some Product Owner I need to convince? Thank you for your support. Cheers, Tobias",

It is possible that, at some point, your plugin might be integrated as a standard part of Moodle, but this is not a very common occurrence - most features like this are maintained as 3rd-party plugins, for use on sites that want those features. As an aside, it might be worth looking through the plugins directory to see if there is already a plugin that does what you want - if there is, then you would only need to convince the site owner to install that, without having to write and publish it first.",

This could be an integral part of your institution's Internal Quality Assurance. Advanced features could be: instructors' data are automatically transferred from individual courses to be evaluated by students, students who are enrolled in the course   can automatically access the courses' respective evaluations the instructors' picture are visible while evaluating them personally (useful in case of courses with multiple instructors) the option to evaluate would automatically open for students who received their final mark in the course in question (optional) advanced analysis would allow instructors to filter their evaluation by the grade students achieved (what score they got by students who barely passed vs. those that excelled) connecting students' grades with the new evaluation data. Option to export evaluation data, or to visualize them on graphs. Option to compare your evaluation to instructors' average or other specific instructors, within your course, or across all courses in general. option to make the evaluation mandatory by not allowing students to enroll into new subjects unless they completed the evaluations it would also allow survey that are not connected with any subject (e.g. student office, or the faculty in general) overall scores of courses and even instructors (optional) would be transparent - visible to students even to those who are not enrolled. Previous years' evaluation included, providing  opportunity to track a course's or instructor's (optional) development over time. survey question could be of various forms e.g. grading, drop down (who was the best prof?), short answer, long answer, etc. Option for managers (Course leaders, student representatives) to access every aspect of the results Any other suggestion?

          "Text": "Hi community We are the Danish moodle partner and can see that a lot of our customers are annoyed by the inability to delete scales - in some scenarios a scale is abandoned in other cases the scales was created by mistake, or with an error. It is not feasible to delete an already used scale or even do an recalculation if the scale had an error, since each plugin might include it's own implementation of scale. (And it will be impossible to find the tables a random plugin uses to store the scale setting) . Therefore we propose a new feature, so that scales can be marked as archived.  If a scale is marked as archived it must not be displayed on create of new activities or in the gradebook. For activities created before the scale was archived, it will still be possible to see the original and update other fields. Please share your input whether this a feasible approach.",

I'm sure anyone who thinks this through will understand why, and the potential impacts on learners of changing a Scale after it has been used! I do like the idea of archiving, or perhaps \"Locking\" a Scale. I use the word locking because it's consistent with the concept of locking a forum discussion. And yes, locking a Scale would be really good, if it could then not be used for new activities. Given this, it would makes sense to have a \"Replicate\" Scale option, to make a quick copy, before locking the old one.",

Another situation where this would help is when you have both site level blocks and course level blocks competing for space or when there are just too many blocks for one screen: having some collapsible horizontal space would help that too.",

At the moment the recommended way of doing this is by capturing all cron output at time of run (typically by piping output to a log file) but I feel that this has many pitfalls. To that ends I've bee working on MDL-49399 to capture as much of the output from Moodle tasks as possible, and store it for later viewing within the UI. These changes capture almost all output shown in the console with a couple of exceptions to this (When the PHP interpreter segfaults, and one particular method out of output rarely used). It captures when the task fails, dies, or errors too. This change also adds a UI to view and search the logs, and links are included from the scheduled task page. I'd appreciate any feedback, thoughts, comments, etc. that you may have. If this is a feature that you feel would be useful you can also vote on the issue. I've placed some screenshots at https://imgur.com/a/drge11y and in the issue for reference. Thanks, Andrew",

It also allows my (Admin) collegues, less technical, with no direct access to the server to be warned when something is wrong (even if i'm away). This improvment seems promising.

Is there a place to ask if anyone has a made a tour you are looking for? - I love the Tour Repository but I can't seem to find a place to make 'overall comments or requests' ( I see you can make a comment under a specific tour) The actual tour i am looking for is a tour to help people update their user profile (just in case anyone has done one and is willing to put it up lol) - I know I can create my own tour (which is a great feature!) I just do not want to re-invent the wheel if one already exists and my 'skill level' is pretty low (But it might have to get better 2. The Tour about User Tours - is great but I just worked out that when it highlights some things (like arrows to move the order of tours up or down)  when you click next on the tour it actually makes that function 'work' (as in the order of the tour really changes) - Any idea how to make it stop doing that?

The problem happens in Firefox . It does not happen in Chrome or IE . Attached is a screen shot. All of the sites where this is happening use either the Clean theme or a custom subtheme of the Clean theme.

I wonder if there is any roadmap for further development, or any special forum (except for this) with discussions on features for the User Tours? I was thinking about an opportunity to have \"forked\" tours, where you can choose a certain path for a certain setup. Example: You want to add an Assignment with Group Submission You activate Editing and selects Assignment The tour for adding an assignment starts, with the question \"What kind of assignment to you want to add\". There's a choice between \"Group submission\" and \"Individual submission\" When I choose Group submission, the tour first asks me if I have created groups and groupings. If \"No\" or \"I'm not sure\" : the path leads to the group administration page where it shows me how to get this done, and the goes back to continue the Assignment setup. If \"Yes\" : The tour continues on the Assignment setup page, without the group/groupings setup detour. (We all know what a mess a group submission can make if there are no groups, or if the users are in more than one group each without them being organized into groupings.) Question: Is this in the roadmap, or maybe even possible to do already? I guess it can be done right now by beginning a Assignment setup with a statement like \"If you are adding a Group submission, please quit this tour and go to Groups administration page to get your groups and groupings set up\", but that is not as smooth.",

This can be added at your discretion.  So it could be assigned only to new Moodlers, so that the old pro's don't have to cancel it when they open up their new course shell. I could see potentially having multiple template tours for different templates and creating a role for each of them.  Or, maybe I don't even need to do that.  I'll find out as I learn more about creating user tours.  Time to go learn more!",

I have plans to implement tours all over the place, but to avoid user fatigue, I might try and create a more prominent reset tour function at the top of the screen. Sort of like a contextual help button. My plan is to try and set the tours in a completed state, and only trigger them when users call them. That's the plan anyway. In the meantime, I've been experimenting with Fontawesome in the tours. Seems that FA has some great formatting tools built right in, so it makes sprucing up the tours with images very easy. eg. <i class=\"fas fa-car fa-4x fa-border fa-pull-left mr-2\"></i> Where: fa-4x is four times the size fa-border add a square border to the icon fa-pull-right/left pulls the image to one side of the tour box mr-2 pads out the spacing of the image so your text doesn't butt up against it. Anyway, that's it for me. More tours to write... Adam",

          "Text": "Looking behind all the discussions I had over the last months with clients one issue was mentioned very often: activity stream. Driven by other tools like (Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Microsoft Team, Totara Social) people are asking for activity streams as key feature for social activitiy in a platform.  I thought a lot about the idea and why it could make sense in a LMS. Corporate learning is more and more defined by an 70:20:10 concept. 70 % is learning on the job while being confronted with new requirements, making new experience, trial and error. 20% of learning is based on discussion with colleagues and managers, 10 % are formal courses organized by HR departments. A Learning Platform should support all types of learning at an institution. Lets think how Moodle can support this in the best way. Activity streams comes in focus when people are using Facebook, Twitter, Slack Micosoft Team. The common concept is that there is one location where all activities that happens are integrated and I can directly react. Some clients reported that using such tools activated a lot of people that were inactive in blog , forum or chat tools. In formal learning concept that has pros and cons: pro: better overview than only reading the number of new activities in dashboard per forum. easier reaction in course discussion con: formal learning needs concentration on a topic and it makes sense to go to the topic related course first. most learning will use learning paths The argumentation for informal learning will be different: pro: getting a quick overview about a lot of topics I'm subscribed to reaction with a few sentences should be easy its not required to be involved in all activities liek a course getting impulses for daily work are pushed in a activity stream con: If activity stream grows I will see only the lastest topics. I remember an extensive discussion from 2015 about Forums Blogs and Nature of Discussion here at Moodle.org I think we should discuss the Activity Stream idea also here. What do you think?",

We had something similar last year but it was set at an admin level to order by popularity, and collapse the tools that are rarely used. We found it a little clunky though and have since gotten rid - also we felt that it ended up making tools that should be used more less visible, plus extra hoops for people to go through to find things. Your way is far better in the hands of the user - v nice. My feeling is that this could do with a more complete rewrite though - I'd rather have the tools (separate by category or not) available if in edit mode (somewhere or other, not in a pop up) and just be able to drag them to wherever I want them in a section. Obviously haven't thought it through that much! Given that this is a pretty key element It seems a little \"old school\" these days - click, look, scroll, click etc. Also, say if they were presented in more of a grid you could perhaps categorise the tools by potential purpose a little like Joyce seitzinger's tool guide eg assess, group work, communicate, presenting etc ? I guess you'd still havea similar issue with heaps of extra plugins but at least if it wasn't in a scrolling list the design may accommodate that better. Moon on a stick?

For some teachers, that period is quite short (a few weeks), whilst for others it seems to last years. I agree with you regarding the difference between resources and activities. It would be awesome if this was extended to other parts of Moodle, for example the list of options that show up when creating activities and resources. It seems that no matter the amount of training we do, a lot of teachers are still overwhelmed with the amount of options available and feel like they need to unfold each category to see if they are missing anything (e.g. restrictions, competencies, etc.).

Even if you limit to just what is included in core, the list is large, but then you add in plugins, LTI connections, it can explode very quickly. Yet the most popular assignment modules are predictable and there is large gap at my institution between what people use and what they don't. We have thousands of assignments each semester, but at this point zero databases, zero SCORM , zero surveys, and less than twenty glossaries. I'd love an easy way to get those out of the way for my novice users but not removed from the site. The day I remove SCORM packages is the day someone will try to upload one.

What they have done is made it so that themes can override the core menus, navigation etc... in a way that may suit individual sites. Alternatively blocks can add additional functionality. When I did this modification I found that the Resources and Activities list are pretty much hard-coded into Moodle, within function mod_chooser. If the list of activities/resources could be modified in a way similar to the Custom menu items or User menu items then there might be a possibility to specify the order, group items and possibly have a concertina menu with some groups open by default and others closed? I initially wanted the activity chooser to look the same as the default but lose the standard Resources and Activities groupings, I just ended up going a step farther and restyled the presentation too.",

The block that the instructor sees presents a toggle switch to go back and forth between what we call \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\" tools, which are really just two roles, one of which has more capabilities and is added to the regular Instructor role. The role toggle is within the course context , so the role will always have to be set for each course, but it is remembered in the database just like any role, so once it is set it sticks to the course. The switch is very fast. We will see if this need to switch roles to turn on more activities becomes a problem for users. The regular Instructor role is duplicated. The new role is called \"Advanced.\" The Advanced role has the ability to see all the items in the activity chooser. The regular instructor role will be limited to just a few. Under Allow Role Assignments (/admin/roles/manage.php): Instructor should have a checkbox for Advanced. Advanced should have a checkbox for Advanced. Under Allow Role Overrides : Instructor should NOT have a checkbox for Advanced. Advanced should have a checkbox for Instructor. Under Allow Role Switches : Advanced should have a checkbox for Advanced. What it looks like : The toggle switch is just CSS I found online to disguise what's basically just a checkbox in a form. There's an onclick handler to submit the form. Without javascript there's a submit button.",

We added a checkbox which will ONLY show the custom menu items.  This method allows you to control the ordering and what modules teachers can see and add to courses based off the comma separated list. Finally, an additional setting allows anyone with the Manager role to see all modules in case you want them to selectively add restricted modules. Site Admins always see all modules.

Save text as outline (each line of the text becomes a separate \"label\" item. B. Save as one label. 2. Creating the lesson . A. Create local lesson. B. Create lesson as a label. (in the code, it works the same way as 1B above) C.  Link to external lesson.  (The icon indicates this is not only a url, but specifically a lesson url). D. Link to an attachment lesson. E. Read an external book, magazine, etc. (required reading). 3. Extra reading (if you want to learn more about this topic) A. Addition lesson (just a standard Lesson) B. Attachment (stored locally) C. Reading an offline book, book, magazine, newspaper. D. Visit someplace, do a field trip. E. Reading an online website, encyclopedia, news site, etc. 4. Activities that are not tied to a specific topic A. Glossary B. Wiki C. File Repository D. Image Repository E. Url repository F. Bibliogrphy (list of offline resources that were used to create the lesson or teacher recommends for further reading) G. Checklist H. Quiz bank (practice questions for review) -- teacher would need ability to mark which questions to include. 5. Quizzes and Tests 1. Convert single document to quizzes. 2. Create questions 3. Create a quiz/test. 6. Homework / practice A. From quiz bank. B. From lesson. C. URL to online worksheet or other activity. D. Offline activity (a book, magazine, newspaper, journal, textbook, workbook, etc.) A bunch of these are repeated activities.  The difference is that some of the information is pre-filled and the icon may be different.  A url that is intended to be a resource (extra reading) is different than the url that is intended to be the actual lesson (required \"reading\").  Is the url required or is the url optional? I think that boils down to how a teacher is using Moodle.  Is the course truly a 100% unique full course where all of the material is created by the teacher (owner of the website)?  Is it supplemental material with the teacher using traditional lessons and textbooks?  Or is it a mixture of the two where the items can either be online items or traditional books and learning resources?

It depends on what kind of teacher you are or how you want to teach your learners, whether you use more resources or activities (using Moodle's terminology) Giving them videos to watch (embedded in pages or labels) is a resource because although they are doing something - watching the video - they are passive.

          "Text": "This is an excellent idea, and I totally agree that the disctinction between activities and resources only serves to confuse teachers. However, I think the main problem of the activity chooser is that it only uses a tiny part of the screen. Once you fix that, you do won't even need complicated solutions like a personal favourite system, because teachers will just see all activities instantly. I made a quick fix using CSS for our site yesterday, and we are very happy with the result: Its big, colourful, and shows all the important information at once. We are in the process of re-writing the activity descriptions at our site to further aid teachers in picking the right tool for the job. In addition to formatting the chooser via CSS, I also modified the modchooser.php in /moodle/course/classes/output to make a distinction between favourite and non-favourite items. Unlike Rex' idea, this does not allow for teachers to pick their own favourites, but since they see all possible activities at once on a normal screen without scrolling this is not really needed. My next project will be to do the same thing for the question chooser list, which is just as badly designed as the current default activity chooser. If you want to implement our solution at your site, this is how to do it: Above solution uses this as additional CSS in Boost: \n```text\n//activity chooser that doesn't suck\n\n.moodle-has-zindex.chooserdialogue-course-modchooser.yui3-widget.yui3-panel.moodle-dialogue.yui3-widget-positioned.yui3-widget-modal.yui3-widget-stacked.chooserdialogue.yui3-dd-draggable.moodle-dialogue-focused {left: 5vw !important; top: 10vh !important; width: 90vw !important; }\n\n.moodle-dialogue-hd.yui3-widget-hd {text-align: center;}\n\n.instruction, .typesummary {width: 50% !important; left: 50% !important; height: 70vh !important;}\n\n.alloptions {width: 50% !important; max-width: 50% !important; height: 70vh !important; display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; align-content: flex-start; align-content: flex-start; padding: 15px;}\n\n.moduletypetitle {width: 100%; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;}\n\n.jschooser .choosercontainer #chooseform .alloptions .option input[type=radio] {display: none;}\n\n.choosercontainer #chooseform .option {height: 100px; width: 120px; padding: 0px; text-align: center; font-size: small;}\n\n.choosercontainer #chooseform .option .icon {height: 50px; width: 50px;}\n\n.choosercontainer #chooseform .option label {border-bottom: 0px;}\n\n.choosercontainer #chooseform .selected {margin-top: 0px;}\n\n.typesummary {text-align: left; font-weight: normal; font-size: small;}\n\n.jschooser .choosercontainer #chooseform .alloptions .option .typename {width: 100%;}\n\n.typename {font-size: small; margin-top: 3px;}\n\n.moduletypetitle {padding-top: 5px !important; padding-bottom: 0px !important; zoom: 1.5; text-transform: none !important;}\n```\n /moodle/course/classes/output/modchooser.php has been edited like this: (please excuse the awkward php, im not very good at it - it's not elegant but it works \n```text\n         // Activities.\n        $activities = array_filter($modules, function($mod) {\n            return (\n\t\t$mod->name == 'assign' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'checkmark' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'choice' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'choicegroup' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'feedback' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'folder' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'forum' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'label' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'quiz' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'resource' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'url' ||\n            \t$mod->name == 'wiki'\n\t\t);\n        });\n        if (count($activities)) {\n            $\nsections\n[] = new chooser_section('activities', new lang_string('favmods'),\n                array_map(function($module) use ($context) {\n                    return new modchooser_item($module, $context);\n                }, $activities)\n            );\n        }\n\n        $resources = array_filter($modules, function($mod) {\n            return (\n\t\t$mod->name !== 'assign' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'checkmark' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'choice' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'choicegroup' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'feedback' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'folder' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'forum' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'label' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'quiz' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'resource' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'url' &&\n            \t$mod->name !== 'wiki'\n\t\t);\n        });\n        if (count($resources)) {\n            $sections[] = new chooser_section('resources', new lang_string('restmods'),\n                array_map(function($module) use ($context) {\n                    return new modchooser_item($module, $context);\n                }, $resources)\n            );\n        }\n```",

I know there is the possibility of creating a profile to do this, but if I have 150 teachers with that need, the administration becomes chaotic. A greeting",

          "Text": "First of all thanks for your great work and effort to imporve and develop Moodle. My two cents, and things i think have to be added/changed would be: 1\n- Some kind of subtasks inside a task. ex: i have class with my pupils\nmonday, wednesday and friday. Then i open a task to be delivered on\nFriday as a limit date. It would be great to have three or two subtasks,\nwhere pupils should deliver their work ( what they ve done monday, what\nthey have done till wednesday and the final deliver). In this way\npupils where \"forced\" to work everyday and dont let the activity to the\nlast day ( and usually ask for more time to deliver it). Also would be\nnice in order to show to parents or inspectors about the work of a\npupil..... A partial solution would be create three different activities , but it would be more difficult to deal and then the marks.... 2\n- Attendance moudle as core of moodle. Is essential as a teacher to\nhave a proper attendance core module, where you can follow the pupil\nattendance, with some filters and graphics. I know theres a plugin, but\nmany administrators dont like to use them and i think is important\nenough to be a core-part of moodle. 3 - Some kind of\nteachers area, where i cant get info about past activities , with pupils\nwithout marks, any activity that has to be marked, activities that would\nbe closed in short period... 4 - An option that\nactivities that are hidden, would not appear in the gradebook. ex: i\nhave 10, 12 activities from other mates or other courses. I have them\nhidden to pupils and closed. In function of the pupils and when im sure,\ni decided to choose three activities. These ones are shown and opened\nto pupils. Then if i need to configure gradebook i dont want that the\nhole 10 activities would appear. In a big course with 60-70 activities\nis difficult to manage, when you only use or open 10-12. It doesnt have\nsense to have 50 activities hidden in the user gradebook ( specially\nwhen you want to watch pupils marks by rows) 5 - In the\ngradebook, to rename the total mark of a category. I made inthe\ngradebook another categoy ex: M9 - Uf2. Then i calculate the marks using\na formula for example. then i get a Total: ....Would be nice that i\ncould rename this and write something like \"Final mark of M9-Uf2\"\ninstead of total Which these improvements, moodle would be perfect to me.",

          "Text": "Following from the discussion New theme in Moodle 3.2 I wanted to point out the Bootstrap 4 theme in core is called \"Boost\" and you can get a taste of it on the prototype site . Apart from the very significant stuff going on under the hood with respect to the frameworks, you'll notice a number of basic new concepts in the UI: Reduced reliance on blocks.  Navigation and Settings blocks can be deleted completely (and would be in vanilla install).  There is still a block region over on the right if you really need it for critical content (but we advise trying to avoid them, because remember, these don't show on the Mobile app). New \"Flat nav\" menu on the left with key navigation points (designed to converge with the main menu of Moodle Mobile over time). \"Gear icons\" on Site, Course, Activity and User pages with a drop down menu that presents the key things from the old Settings block. If, as a themer, you don't like these, you can easily override them in any child theme and still benefit totally from Bootstrap 4, but I am pushing for these UI features as defaults in Boost to give Moodle a refreshed and modern default appearance that feels more like the many web and mobile interfaces around us, and to raise the baseline for themers. Any help we can get from you in polishing this concept to make it good enough to be default in our 3.2 release (slated for late November) would be very welcome.",

There are lots of use cases, heck - core ships with over 40 blocks(!), that really aren't covered yet. And while the current stance is \"blocks are still there, they aren't going away\", the clean subtext from HQ is \"yet\". My personal opinion is that to truly replace blocks, we should allow modules to have the ability to direct their display on the course page. That would mean more formalizing how mod_label hijacks its display, and allowing more flexibility in the caching behavior of that display. That way something like progress bar can be placed in-line in the course as a mod. Moving to that type of structure would allow a lot more flexibility in course design, and unify the development side.",

The use case that I think is not well covered with this new direction is at-a-glance information at a course level. Maybe an unread message count in our course specific email system, progress within the course, course events calendar, etc. Yes, some of those things will be done on the dashboard, but some don't make sense at that level, and also it doesn't always make sense to be pulling people back to the main dashboard when they are working in a course (i.e. I have 6 course, and I'm currently doing work in course B, why do I need to go back to the main dashboard, and find course B there to get pertinent info), or shouldn't always be mashed up between courses. The other problem with the centralized dashboard is that not all institutions work in a holistic way. Teachers want (and expect) to be able to largely control their students course experience, and that can vary wildly from instructor to instructor. The mod idea was simply what I view as the least painful way to get that functionality back. One idea I've had is you could have a sort of course level dashboard that the teacher could configure with 'tiles' (think block, but a defined size and much more constrained focus). Basically there would be something like 3 side-by-side slots at the very top of those course where they could be located. With the right sort of design guidelines, that something like that could work and be cohesive. And yes, that would be *a lot* of work, I don't deny that. But I don't think blocks will go anywhere until some of those use cases are addressed.",

          "Text": "Well while boost has some nice aspects, but I have some points against it and this trend of completely removing blocks. It is true that most of Internet traffic is via mobile but the statement of \"70% of internet traffic\" looks more journalistic to me rather than a scientific statistic. What is that 70% used for? A random observation of people sitting around me on buss or train shows me that they're just watching YouTube, checking Facebook, or video chatting with their families abroad. Of course the traffic that is used for watching a 30 minutes video can be multiple times more than the traffic that is required to study a typical Moodle course from the beginning to the end. The message that is there for us is that we should take mobile support serious and put some effort on mobile support. That's it. We should not let these statistics to mesmerise us and inculcate the idea of being left behind while everything else has moved to mobile apps. It is really good and actually a must to consider Moodle app users while designing courses. We should remember that they don't see blocks and they view course modules on a 7 inch display. Being limited to a 7 inch display means that only essential elements could be displayed in a single view and some taps are required to see additional stuff. But why should we deprive those who access Moodle on a 20 inch display from blocks? Blocks can be used to display additional info to students without the need to leaving the page they are in. An excellent example is the calendar block. It is fine if mobile users don't see it but it presents helpful visual information to desktop users. Another example is the upcoming events block. Another example is the recent activities block. As an ex Moodle student, I can say that the recent activities block is a must to have for each course. It is impossible for a student to check all sections of their course to see if their teacher has changed something or has added something to the course or not. I completely take my words back if someone tells me that it would still be possible to present all these information on the course page, without the need to do several clicks, without blocks. but at the moment I just don't understand why we should deprive desktop users from seeing these additional, useful information (yet none essential for app users) which could be right in front of their eyes on each course's main page and only present them with a list of activities and a lot of wasted areas which could be filled with blocks. I attached how the administration block looked like in Moodle 1.9 when an admin was in a course. It only displayed options that were related to the course. If you wanted to change a site config, you had to go back to site home page to be able to see site-level administration options. I remember when the new administration block was introduced in 2.0 I was super happy that I didn't have to do so many redundant clicks and wait for many redundant page loads anymore. I could easily access all administration settings wherever I was. Now the administration block is removed from the vanilla install and this trend of removing blocks suggests me that it is only the matter of time before Moodle HQ stops maintaining it. The new gear icon only provides what the old administration block were offering. This is like going one step forward an many steps backward! I understand that some of the concerns can be addressed with a custom course format or a custom theme but means the institutions who could do their stuff with standard install would have to go through the path of plugin developing or if they're lucky, ending up with using 3rd party plugins.",

If you like the deep-menu administration block you can keep it on for your site, no problems.  But it's just not a good direction to be the MAIN direction in the future, given the trends in interfaces everywhere all around us.

What I find interesting is that the other LMSs are still struggling with responsive design.  Sure, apps can fill the gap, but why not give students the entire course as they (pretty much) see it behind their computers?  When my student do comment on their mobile access to my moodle courses, they are doing it behind their smartphone's browser, not from the moodle app.  Moodle is already at least 3 years ahead of the other competitors.  I am glad to see that Moodle is already giving its responsive design the next boost!",

That is: What is useful information on the course page for user's in your institution? When I look at what we did with Snap as a theme I see a lot of the core blocks as being not useful on the course page, but more informative in a indicator manner in a menu or alert area. Things like, latest news, recent updates, recent forum posts. All of these are useful if i want to look at them as a user, but distracting otherwise. Blocks also have a history in Moodle as being the default plugin developers used to create some new functionality, usually without any thought to usability of the functionality. Some of them are administrative others are informative. I think that what needs to happen is that the blocks need to be reviewed and someone should determine how the usability of the functionality should appear to the user. I like Eric's ideas on the modules  although for different reasons. I want all activities to display data on the course page and be interactive there rather than through a click into the activity. I want a student to never have to leave the course page to engage with learning objects. I want them to leave the course page if they or the teacher wants to dig deeper into information about the activity, such as reports or statistics. My ideal is that a student should be able to scroll the course page, know what they have completed, what grade they received, due dates for activities and if feedback exists. They should click in to read more about feedback or comments on a grade, but otherwise they should be able to gloss over the information and move to the next activity they need to complete to further their education.",

I like the idea of removing blocks and moving dynamic and transactional data that is out side the learning materials into a more consistent place (I like the course dashboard idea). I don't like the idea of teachers controlling navigation in the system or where progress and completion data show. The teacher or instructional designer should be in charge of the flow of information to a student and timing. How and when they should be assessed on their understanding. In our discussions with students at Moodlerooms we have found that inconsistent course design, progress information placement and most especially navigation have a negative impact on the student's satisfaction with a course.  If it is not easy for a student to find their course and what they need to do next then they get frustrated. Multiple navigational elements on a course page also confuses students when they are trying to access course materials and assessments. IMO we need to be thoughtful about how we display data and what flexibility teachers have to impact a student's ability to understand how to access data in the system and understand the learning environment. User experience design and usability should be the concepts we support over teacher flexibility.",

          "Text": "That is a simple rule to state. However, it is not clear to me that it leads to the best user experience. For example, when you are on the Edit quiz page, it is natural to want to start a preview of the quiz. That link is in the Quiz administration menu. Or, when you are looking at one quiz report, it is natural to want to switch to one of the other reports. Those links are also in the menu. Really, in the past, having exactly the same settings menu (previously in the settings block) on almost every page of the quiz was really convenient. I think, without that, we aer losing something. I completely agree about forms. Form pages can easily be completely plain, but then interacting with a form is a thing. You go to the form, change some things, then Save or Cancel. There is a single clear next action (click one of the buttons at the bottom). Therefore, you don't need general navigation there. However, on other pages, there is not a single clear 'next' place to go, and I think pages without a single clear Next are good candidates for having all the settings available. I imagine similar logic could apply to the manage enrolments or manage permissions pages for the course. I expect those could benefit from having the settings present. I know these usability questions are not hard to resolve, but I would encourage you to coninue to consider this one further. (Has this been subject to any testing by real users, rather than by developers who are really familiar with the old interface? )",

Yes, we've had quite of bit of user testing these past few months, but there's a limit to what that can achieve. To get the most useful feedback, I'm convinced you need a really functional interface, people who really want to use it to do real things, and some time for them to get used to it so they really understand the pinch points. However, this means you also need to build something.   So please consider Boost in 3.2 that first functional version, a usable preview, that our community and UX team will do detailed user testing with so we can keep improving Moodle along these lines. We've deliberately kept away from changing Clean and core pages in 3.2 (so there is no effect on existing themes), but detailed testing may (and I would guess WILL) require deeper changes that will start affecting all themes. That's when the REAL commitment to a new UI begins (in 3.3 and beyond) - the point where we need a consensus that it makes sense to start deprecating older ways of doing things.",

I then accessed each site from a desktop to see if there are any obvious problems. Presently, as a teacher or student, the 3.2 dashboard doesn't have any real information without blocks. All you can really see is the Boost site navigation menu the same as on any other page. On 3.1, the dashboard shows the navigation menu as well as: Course overview with key information on courses I am enrolled in. Private files area. Online users. Latest badges. Calendar. Upcoming events. These are all blocks in 3.1 and are available in 3.2 if they are enabled. In 3.2, \"Private files\" and \"Calendar\" can be accessed from the navigation menu, rather than an extra block. The only place I could access my badges is in the \"Preferences\" section of my account menu (\"Preferences -> Manage badges\"), so this might need some work. \"Course overview\" and \"Upcoming events\", which I think would be key dashboard information, require the blocks at this point. \"Online users\" likewise would need a block at the moment, although the importance of this may not be so great. One thing to note as well is that without blocks, the \"Customize this page\" for the dashboard really does nothing. On the course page, information provided by blocks that are standard in 3.1 that would be missing in 3.2 are: Forum search. Latest announcements. Upcoming events. Recent activity. I don't think there are replacements in the Boost theme for these function as of yet. I re-enabled those blocks to get that experience back. There are likely sites who don't care if that information is displayed, but there are probably more that would like this information available. Adding it to Boost would also require the ability to choose whether or not to display these bits. Blocks makes that easier now. There was a comment above about \"developers [wanting] to be able to insert anything they like into any part of the page\", but I don't think that's what the key issue is. Its more about learning program administrators being able to ensure that the key information they require for their stakeholders is displayed at the proper places. If its not blocks, then its something else that allows information fragments in the page. It is very important that the design makes the mobile experience better. But it shouldn't make the desktop experience lesser to achieve this. I just don't see how we can do that without blocks or a functionally similar replacement.",

In Boost we have made it clear that content is prioritised over the blocks - but blocks are still there and still work like they always did. Blocks on dashboard makes perfect sense. The blocks ARE the content on this page and putting them in prime position in the middle of the page is logical and good. I also like the idea of a course dashboard with blocks on it.",

So, that post was the result of testing in that way. I was identifying the things that might still need blocks even with Boost. The reason I and others are discussing Moodle without blocks is that it was stated (at least to our understanding) that Moodle is trying to do away with blocks, and that Boost would be the first test of this. And it was definitely stated that blocks would not be displayed in the Mobile app in the opening post of this discussion. Maybe myself and others have fixated on the wrong message then? Is the intent for Moodle to continue to use and depend on blocks for function and information outside of the main theme displays? I feel that is necessary and would be glad to know that is true. mike",

          "Text": "Yes I think removing blocks from the dashboard makes no sense because the dashboard is just a page of blocks. Course formats now come with no default blocks (except the social format which requires the social activities block) - you can add some if you want to and they will function as well as they always have. Martin has commented about the mobile app and is 100% correct in that the mobile app does not display blocks - so if you design your course in a way that is relies on the information presented by the blocks, users on the mobile app will get only a \"partial\" experience of the course. The navigation and settings blocks are 2 that have been prominently displayed on all pages, at the expense of room for the content and I am very glad that these 2 blocks are no longer required on every page in Boost. That said there are many great blocks that provide quick access to information or new ways to interact with a course (level up or progress bar blocks for example). These blocks continue to work and are providing the kind of supplementary information that I think enhances a course without breaking it when that information is not available. We are recommending that course designers should think hard about the blocks they add to a course and only add blocks that will enhance the course instead of sticking with the 5 standard blocks that came by default in previous versions. There is a negative impact on the amount of space available for course content when blocks present. We will continue to refine boost and improve the experience in Moodle over time and welcome everyones opinions and feedback.",

          "Text": "Importing grades is one of the places where some fixes definitely should be made. There are several annoyances in this one module: When uploading a file, the default file should be the last one that was uploaded (if any), and when you are selecting a file to upload , you should start in the same directory as the previous file. The \"Identify User by\" and Grade Item Mappings should default to the previous values (if any). IOW, if you have an assignment called \"HW1\", and last time, this grade was saved to \"Homework #1\", then \"HW1\" should get mapped to \"Homework #1\" by default. (This is especially annoying if you have half a dozen grade items to match up.) The Mother of All Annoyances: If the import fails, you get a generic error message (such as \"Supplied grade is invalid\", with nowhere to click to get more information). If one of your students registered late, and their number is not in the Moodle course, this happens. At the very least, Moodle should identify the student whose grade is invalid. Better yet would be to identify the student and the grade. Even better is to find all invalid grades and report them, so you can fix things all at once. As things stand, you have to delete the records for some of your students and then repeat the entire import process all over again (and you encounter the first two annoyances again) to see if that group is okay. Doing this half a dozen times is enough to raise one's blood pressure. Provide an option to stop automatic recalculation of grades once grades have been uploaded. I have a program that does that already, and they get uploaded to Moodle.",

Some of the language and user interface for the new module looks like a replacement for the database module.  Is there an idea that it might serve both purposes? It was great to see features like conditional branching, lists of participants and their submission completeness, user notes explaining each question, using plug-ins for each question type so they can be extended locally, improved user entry data validation.  These have all been on my wish-list for questionnaire. Thank you! I found some of the help texts and language strings a bit confusing in places - input from a native English speaker will probably help here.  I'll see if my employers are willing to let me spend time on that (and a questionnaire migration script)! There are a number of features which would be important to my organisation that are either left out, not yet implemented or broken (I'm not sure which! Comments welcome): saving template question sets for reuse in other courses, sharing a survey across multiple courses, emailing submissions, connection to gradebook, aggregated responses reporting, graphical reporting. One feature which really caught my eye was the very complex access control for who can view/edit/delete submissions.  Normally in Moodle, only the owner of a post (say forum entry, wiki edit) can edit or delete the post.  The default was all/all/all which I take to mean that any-one can edit or delete any-one else's submission.  Seems like an odd default to me, and personally I can't see its use.  I'm unsure why this needs to be so complicated, and why capability checks are not sufficient? I'd want to set up a default value to suit the OU and tell people not to change it unless they've really thought about it.  Since the module instance screen is complex, perhaps a set of defaults like you get for quiz or glossary could be set up by the system administrator to make 'simple' surveys easier to configure? I've mostly conducted a brief functional review of Collection to see if it meets the OU's requirements, but as an aside I'll say that I noticed that the code will not pass HQ peer review in its current state, as there are a number of coding guidelines that need to be adhered to and the branch will need the commits tidying up and given good messages.  Not a small job on such a significant amount of code",

Phew!). I have given this alpha version a thorough test and I have a fairly large number of queries, bug reports, etc. to make, including the ones you mention in your post. But I'm holding my horses until the following is solved: What is urgently needed at this stage of development is a unique place where testers can post their reports, so they can not only be viewed by the developer(s) but shared with the community. I don't think it's a good idea to have those comments and reports spread all over the place - for the sake of efficiency. Which does not prevent individuals to share their thoughts in this forum discussion or on their own blogs or sites, of course. In tracker issue MDL-36350 we are waiting for Andrea or Daniele to answer our request (and especially Anthony's request) to approve the creation of a \"Collection\" or \"Survey2\" Components section in the tracker so we can post our reports there. Let's hope this will done very soon. ATB Joseph",

About the English language strings, yes a review would be really needed. That would surely make the English sentences and words much better than now as well as help translators to make a better translations (as Italian language pack maintainer, I'm particularly sensible to this topic ). If you could do that we would appreciate it. Same for the Upgrade Helper admin tool from Questionnaire. The use of a migration helper for Questionnaire rather than a forced migration upon update will allow people for a smoother transition from other modules, to be performed only if needed. About features still not present, the next prototype will sport templates saving and sharing for reuse. For the other features you mention, I noticed you already contributed to the http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Survey_2_module wiki page, if you could expand your wish list with some usage scenario that would be useful: apart from emailing submissions (which I think it is pretty clear), expanding the concept of connection to gradebook and type of graphical reporting you like would help: maybe for controlling conditional access it could suffice the completion on submit criterion rather than an evaluation? Access control: yes, it appears complex, however it allows for very fine grained access control scenarios over records collected. Your idea of consistent default looks pretty good to me, as well as admin defaults for the module. And yes the code need to be polished. Any help on that would be appreciated.",

          "Text": "Hi Andrea, Daniele and others, Our small university has a need for a peer evaluation activity inside Moodle and I'm wondering if Survey 2 would meet our needs?  I've been reading through the documentation and forum ideas, but can't quite seem to find what we're looking for (but I may have missed it). We want to be able to allow students in a group to evaluate each other's general performance (as opposed to specific assignments) at certain points in a semester.  This would include some sort of ranking of each student on different factors (such as forum participation, clarity of comments, etc).  It could also include basic feedback as text comments to each group member.  From there, we would want the activity to compile the results for all of the students who took the evaluation and create a 1) a grade in the gradebook and 2) a summary sheet for each student that would contain the student's results on each question, overall compiled/averaged grade, and any associated text feedback.  Students would be able to see their own results and teachers would need to be able to see every student's summary page. It would be ideal if Moodle could set up the process from start to finish, like Workshop does.  By this I mean that all an instructor would do is to add the activity to the course, select which groups would take the evaluation, and choose the questions to ask. Then Moodle would add the the names of each student (per group) to the questions (linking each student to their user account for grade purposes), compile all of the results internally after every student took the evaluation, and then distribute those results to individual students, the gradebook and the instructor. We're running Moodle 2.3 and Feedback and other activities don't seem to have the compiling features we need.  We have been exploring options outside of Moodle, but it seems that whatever you use, it is still a long process of getting the data back into Moodle to the correct student, when you have 200 students in a course (broken up into small groups of 10 each). Will Survey 2 be able to handle this kind of task, or could it be added to the wish list of this module?  If not, do you know of something else that could be used or is being developed for peer evaluations? Thanks for your help! ~Justina Hohmann",

We were considering two routes. One would be to have a report generated once the feedback activity closed that would provide a list of participants. These could then be uploaded to a manual grade item in the gradebook and given the appropriate credit. The other method would be to have an option when creating the feedback that would create the 'feedback participation' item in the gradebook and would populate the item with scores, again only once the activity closed. Additionally, to preserve anonymity, these options would only be available in classes where enrollment > 'x' and in activities where responses > 'x' (currently, we use x=10).

If the student clicks the Pause button, the teacher and student will see an in progress attempt. If the student clicks the Submit button, the teacher and student will see a closed attempt.

I noticed the in the access.php file that none of the capabilities contain any student entries. Maybe that is why students cannot answer questions. I am using Moodle 2.6dev (Build: 20130514).

In spite of this we are only a bunch of people so many issues may still be undiscovered. If you want to use it, feel free to enjoy it and file to the tracker what you find incorrect. Please test its behavior  before loading it to a production site. Current master branch works fine with Moodle 31 and head. There is no more documentation than the one you already found. I am only one. If you want to collaborate and you like the module, I can help you, time to time, and you can write the documentation you feel more relevant. The available features are really a lot and a complete documentation could be really long. In my readme.md I tried to summarize all its features. Behat tests provide examples of many more features too. That's all for the moment. Ciao. Daniele",

I have Moodle 3.1 installed on a LAMP stack.  I downloaded surveypro from GitHub and uploaded it from Moodle's install plugin page.  Once it was uploaded, I noticed that I had another plugin (adaptivequiz) missing from the disk.  So I cancelled the surverpro installation and then re-installed the missing adaptivequiz plugin.  I tried it again and the same thing happened. I also noted that surveypro did not have a file name once it was uploaded so I'm guessing it would not have installed correctly. At any rate, the lesson here is to always test these early versions of a plugin on a development server first, which I did. I didn't really need surveypro but wanted to check it out for usability .  If you think I should report this on GitHub, let me know and I'll be happy to do so. David",

I am working to make them successfull with boost too. If you use to update your surveypro copy pulling from master, be warned that from now on it will require moodle 3.2.

Moodle 3.1 has greatly enhanced tagging functionality over previous versions - but, with one exception, tags currently only apply at an Activity/Resource level. Some activities in Moodle allow content to be created 'within' the activity - forum posts, wiki pages, glossary entries, database entries, book chapters, etc. - but apart from wiki pages, it is currently not possible to tag the individual entry level. The improvements being developed allow forum posts , book chapters , glossary entries and database entries to be tagged independently to their 'parent' activity. Anyone interested can see the WIP version of this code at https://github.com/andrewhancox/moodle/tree/tagging . It's currently feature complete and undergoing testing. To be clear this is not fully tested code and there are known issues so please do not test this on a site you care about. There are a couple of known bugs that have already been discovered which will get fixed in the next few days.",

Dougiamas pointed out that currently, teachers need to add students’ permissions individually. “Group handling is really rough and there’s no synchronisation with other tools,” he said.

Anyways, I would like to share a working prototype of a new Moodle Google drive module I developed which is being used for a few months now. https://github.com/nadavkav/moodle-mod_googledrive The module lets the teacher create a Google drive document (you can choose from several generic types) from within Moodle and also sets its permissions for all enrolled students in that course. One major caveat, is that I had to use up to date Google Drive SDK, as Moodle 3.1's Google libraries did not have the required APIs for this module to work. and so I am getting the ENTIRE SDK with composer, which is a loooot of MB Looking forward for some advice about this, from you fellow developers BTW , I am working on two feedback requests I already got: (1) Be able to choose an already available document (2) Share the document manually by the teacher, at a later time.

While at the BETT Show last week we were able to see a demonstration of Microsoft Classroom and were impressed with how easy it was to use within Office 365. All of the student/teacher documents from OneDrive, class and form groups, SharePoint resources etc where just there and it worked out of the box without any friction. I've been reading through Office365 Moodle documentation and the shear number of steps you have to go through to get it to work makes my head spin. Given the investment we've put into Moodle this would solve a number of issues for us and would be a welcome addition. It's a shame that I was away otherwise I'd have attended the open meeting. Will there be a write up regarding the discussion? My line manager is interested in knowing how this will work and any potential timescales you have in mind.",

The simplicity of doing the \"paper shuffle\" which replicates how teachers are already comfortable collecting assignments is a selling point of Google Classroom. It puts all the documents into a folder on their drive with the name of the assignment with all the work in there. The other feature that is alluring to Classroom is the way students enroll via a simple code.  It would be nice if in Moodle each course created also had a unique code which could be typed into a searchbox on the Moodle homepage and takes the user to the enrollment page of the course.  Kinda like how schoology & classroom works.  I've often wondered how easy this would be to make on our own if possible using an enrollment plugin and theme. Having access to and ability to utilize Google Docs from repositories is most useful.  And we are not talking about a RTF download of a Google Doc.  It would be nice to see the embedded editable document viewer as seen in the plugin posted here. Making Google drive respect the user permissions of Moodle would also be ideal for sharing, editing, etc. These are just a few thoughts I had in looking at this discussion.",

This is being worked on in MDL-46375 and documentation is\ncurrently a work-in-progress. Once this change has been integrated, it will allow developers to write\ntheir own storage backend for files currently stored in the Moodle filedir .\nPlease note that files currently stored in either the temp directory, or\nthe cache directory are not stored through this API, and must still be shared on disk between servers in a cluster. What this change does mean is that the filedir can be replaced with a range\nof alternatives. The most popularly suggested backend is Amazon's S3,\nhowever you could also write backends for systems including: Amazon S3; Rackspace Cloud Files; Ceph; FTP ; WebDAV ; etc. This change should not require any changes for developers or administrators as standard -\nwell, unless you're calling parts of the File Storage API which you\nshouldn't be ;) For developers wishing to implement a File System alternative, there should\nbe generally minimal work required. The new API has the concept of both local and remote file\npaths, with remote file paths beings consumed where possible. Any path using a standard Protocol Wrapper is accepted (or a standard path-on-disk). I hope to finish this change in the next week, but comments and queries are\nwelcomed as ever, Andrew",

Code using the file API will hardly have to change at all. The only remaining thing I am not sure about is whether different file system back-ends should be a full Moodle plugin-type in their own folder, with version.php etc. That is a bit more heavy weight. (Currently they are just one class file in a particular folder. Oh, and hopefully another file of unit tests.) However, if they were plugins, it would be easier for people to share them through the Moodle plugins DB. That might seem like a small thing, but actually, I think it is quite important.

This piece of functionality was internally dubbed the \"Oh shit!\" button, short for \"Oh shit I accidentally deleted 45 minutes worth of work on an essay question and pressed next resulting in me losing all my work!\" I don't think the functionality is complete(Need to log events when a save is converted and when question responses are \"undone\") but it should be stable. The tracker for it is https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-56317 and I am working on the master branch and the 3.1 stable branch(what we use at my employer). The changes are quite substantive and involve modification of data mapper SQL statements, database indexes/columns, question behaviours, question attempts, question attempt steps, question usage, auto-save functionality include the return data etc. I appreciate any and all feedback as I am sure I have missed something and would probably feel rather awkward if everything passed without me having to go back and rework something I missed.",

Request: I want to be able to present learning content followed immediately by a reflective activity/question.  However, because each activity needs to be on it's own separate page, the user has to stop the learning process and then figure out the hyper link - often separated from the learning material. The intermediate step of clicking into an activity needs to be removed (or provide an option to remove it). So a Moodle activity that would normally provided in the content area (by itself, on a separate page) would now be a block that could be sequenced together with other Moodle activity blocks. Example Change from: Page => Quiz => Page => Forum Change to: Page [+] Quiz [+] Page  [+] Forum Further thoughts I find the navigation disorientation is more significant and issue than the \"Death by scroll\" issue.  Scrolling can be managed to a degree through Subject Format, Completion tracking and Theme optimisation.",

          "Text": "I mentioned this on the general developer list, without drawing any comment, so I'll try here, even though it is not a MAJOR feature. There are many sets of constants defined against small sets of integers.  For example, completion/criteria/completion_criteria.php defines such a set.  File cc1 excerpts the relevant definitions. These constants are ubiquitous in the database tables, and they obscure the meanings. To determine the contents of such records requires manual cross-referencing with the code, as in this example from the contributed ad-hoc queries. CASE WHEN p.criteriatype = 1 THEN \"Self\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 2 THEN \"By Date\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 3 THEN \"Unenrol Status\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 4 THEN \"Activity\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 5 THEN \"Duration\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 6 THEN \"Course Grade\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 7 THEN \"Approve by Role\" WHEN p.criteriatype = 8 THEN \"Previous Course\" END AS criteriatype, If these constants change, the query will no longer work as expected, and may not work at all. I noticed this when I was trying to grasp some of  the intricacies of Moodle by looking at the install. xml files and making my own ad hoc db queries. It seems to me that this situation can be relieved, without impacting the integrity of the code by creating an ancillary table or tables that provide a mapping from constants to meaningful text:- the reverse of the definitions in the code. File cc2 shows an outline of the changes to the previous file.  The procedure as outlined would create an in-memory mapping as well as the database mapping, but that can be dispensed wth. Such changes can be made incrementally, gradually increasing the number of mappings.  I, for example, am looking for a way to automatically assign a grade to the simple completion or non-completion of a particular activity, so I could map the constants that are of interest to me.  Others, with other areas of interest, could extend the mappings. Is this of any interest to the developers?",

At first blush, there seems to be a need for only two tables; one to name the set, and the other for the actual names and values.",

The comments would not necessarily need to be graded but rather allow the students to post feedback similar to what they do in social media. This allows for student based feedback using a method they already utilize in the social media. The idea would be for the student to view the instructional video, then the instructor could post a prompt e.g. Have your say and then the student could click on Comment. Then as they click on Comment, the current video/content would shift to the left and the student post his/her comments on the top right along with other student's comments listed below theirs. Thus, when the student is entering their feedback, you have the original video and content on the left and comments on the right hand side. This concept is already implemented in the futurelearn.com open courses and it seems to add a whole new dimension to learning.",

          "Text": "Hi Derek, Thanks for the interest in the plugin. I totally agree that this fulfills the task of, show something, and student responds , and my students always enjoyed using Hot Question just for that type of class activities . I was the \"faculty sponsor\" for our school newspaper and it was extremely handy for getting students input on story ideas. \" This is more than a 'question'.  I wonder if there is a better description? \" Well, the plugin was originally made so that students could ask questions in real time, and vote (add heat) on submitted questions they thought most important, so the plugin was named Hot Question. Like you, I think there might be a better description for it based on all the possible uses other than questions, so I'm open to suggestions. I have gradually started making it less \"question\" orientated by adding and making changes that make it a little more generic. \"Fully featured atto in response field .\" In my experience, this would be a grave mistake. Right now all entries for each round are added in a nice, neat, uniform list, right below the response field. If you give students a full editor, they will start to waste time and effort on trying to \"decorate\" their response to make it stand out, which actually just wastes space and makes the entries harder to read. Nowadays, most students block print when writing by hand, but when typing in class, my students would try to find the most flowery, difficult to read fonts they could, and increase the font size from normal to ridiculous. I literally had to start taking points off grades to make them turn in easily read text. Way to post without stopping video . Use a different media filter for the video that pops it open in another window so it is not on the same page as the post button. I just used what I had handy. Maybe video on left, posts on the right . This is not really a, video with response, type activity. That layout would require a rewrite of the plugin to accommodate one, specialized use, of the activity. Besides, if you come up with a way to have the video in it's own window so you can post without stopping the video, this change is not needed. You are welcome to try making changes to the samples where you logged in yesterday. I haven't had a chance to see if there is another youtube player filter that will open in another window, as I am busy trying to add some new capability to another plugin I've adopted.",

          "Text": "This is a thread to track discussions for MDL-56258 . Essence of the issue and topic of the discussion Currently it is not possible to allow write access for guests. This is due to a Moodle policy of never allowing guests write access to prevent spam and to minimize attacking vectors (eg. possibility of XSS by anonymous users, etc.). I understand the concerns about allowing guests write access but I think there are valid use cases to do so regardless. This brings me to the proposal of adding an option to enable write access for guests regardless to the security concerns. I state explicit that this should not be enabled by default. For all I care, we could \"hide\" this settings under the security section of the site administration and add warnings about the risks. The capability and role system we have is almost good considered. But it should be possible to use its complete power by allowing an admin to configure it completely to fit their needs. And not to restrict it. An admin should know what he is doing. Additionally to prevent misunderstandings, as long as this setting is not enabled the corresponding capabilities should not be displayed while editing the guest role (more specifically a role based on the guest archetype or the role that is selected for the \"Role of visitors\"). And additionally, maybe to initiate another (related) discussion The proposed workarounds of using the \"No authentication\" authentication method or using a dedicated user with public login credentials did not solve the problem completely. This users will of course also get the role defined with the \"Default role for all users\" setting (by default this is the authenticated user role). But due to the algorithm of checking capabilities (calculate the combination of capability settings of all roles the user has in a specific context ) it is not possible to give this dedicated user less capabilities than a normal user in system context but override this to explicit allow some specific things in a lower context. The prevent setting works just for overrides within the same role and prohibit setting can't be overridden (for a good reason). See the Override permissions wiki page for details. Maybe an additional setting \"between\" prevent and prohibit would be useful. But this needs another tracker issue.",

The framework should be confined to the 'themes' folder (or '$CFG->themedir').  Any framework code placed outside of that (i.e. notification templates, 'span' classes in JS etc.) should be removed and moved as an overridden entity to the theme files.  Then can be truly framework independent. Consider auto-flipping for RTL, whereby there is an 'all-ltr' and an 'all-rtl' cached CSS bundle served depending on language direction. Examine current trends in web design and the simplicity of the Wordpress user interface from an administration point of view.  Then from that standpoint consider what will be the next thing and implement it so that Moodle is a trend setter rather than a trend follower. Concentrate on cleaning up the UI beyond the scope of the theme or at least make it overrideable such that 'less becomes more'. Solve long term confusions of the same concept, i.e. 'iconsmall' / 'smallicon' where the icons can be 12px or 16px (I think) but not consistently within and between them. Clean, crisp, elegant and functional. Cheers, Gareth",

One such tool they mention that I like is this one: https://github.com/MohammadYounes/rtlcss And here is a post-css plugin that uses it to create Moodle-style combined RTL & LTR CSS. (Note, I don't think that's a good idea or best practice, better to send RTL or LTR depending on the current page direction, but since we already do it, I thought it would be interesting to note that it can be partly-generated). I've implemented an earlier version of this in a Bootstrap 3 theme and the big blocker was core Moodle's requiremnet to send both LTR and RTL to every page, but this newer tool could work around that if it really needed to. But ideally only the CSS required for the current page would be sent, and this could have a dramatic impact on Moodle's total CSS download size, so that's an important co-benefit.",

          "Text": "Hi Damyon, I would suggest making a clear distinction between working on the CSS framework and a Core theme. The CSS framework should only focus on the UI parts for grids, UI components, layouts etc. The Theme should provide the visual identity. An obvious choice for the framework would be to continue using Bootstrap and upgrade to Bootstrap version 3 or even 4 on which Andrew Davidson made some progress. The effort to upgrade Bootstrap would be relatively small compared to introducing a new framework. The theme developer community has been maintaining the bootstrap theme for some years now. That theme has been kept as clean and simple as possible so it can be adopted in Moodle core and can be use as a parent theme for community themes. A focus on really making use of Bootstrap components in creating Moodle UI's could help unclutter Moodle and clean up the interface. I think the Mahara project did a great job at this for the 15.10 release and it is a delight doing frontent work for Mahara now. The work on the Theme building on the CSS framework would be the fun project. Creating a visual identity for a widely used tool is challenging and could take a lot of time. Especially since it is used globally and opinions on good design vary a lot around the globe. I would say looking into the work done by Google for Material Design (with a focus on the Material and Motion, not the full framework) is worth exploring ( https://getmdl.io ).",

The existing Bootstrap 2 & 3 themes push the boundaries of the current system and are much harder to work on than they should be as a result. Something as simple as every standard form button in Moodle consistently having a \".btn\" class (and removing it from anything that isn't a standard button!) so that you could change a few Bootstrap variables and see the change reflected in all buttons  across Moodle would be nice. Several people have commented about Mahara's adoption of Bootstrap making it very pleasant to do theme work, since it adopted Bootstrap wholeheartedly. Moodle has always avoided making any long term commitment to Bootstrap and this has slowed progress in themes by forcing a series of elaborate workaounds to fake standard Bootstrap behaviour via theme code, while core code continues to do it's own thing(s) when it comes to choosing classnames or standard web patterns. I would suggest the first step, assuming you actually choose Bootstrap for this new theme, would be to add some bootstrap classes  to core code that is not yet in a renderer or template. This would avoid  you having to repeat the complicated and annoying work to shim Bootstrap so that it is compatible with the existing HTML, and avoid any designers brought in to work on this complaining \"that's not Bootstrap\" when they get to see the Moodle HTML they have to work with.",

I disagree.  I believe that the core code should be framework independent.  Bootstrap is not the only framework and who knows what is around the corner.  We should not go down the 'global variables' route but instead move to more 'encapsulation', thus there should be renders in core that produce the template basics that the functionality is responsible for.  If there needs to be framework specific 'hooks' then so be it, just like creating classes with abstract methods, you provide most of the functionality but leave a few methods to be implemented by the child class.  Thus here the theme code in the themes' folder. If there is too much coupling between Bootstrap and core code then will be harder to untangle the mess when you want to use something other than Bootstrap.  Thus there needs to be clear separation between framework code and Moodle code - CSS / JS etc. Cheers, Gareth",

Moodle has committed to frameworks in the past and present, I really don't see the issue with committing to Bootstrap as the base framework for markup / CSS. So long as renderers / templates are used throughout Moodle it would be easy to plug in another framework. The thing that's good about committing to Bootstrap is that it should force developers to start thinking about markup and class names in a more consistent way. It should encourage them to use design patterns that are more standardised across the web. This is only a good thing regardless of the framework you decide to use for your theme. Sure, you are going to have to rewrite lots of templates to make your Zurb Foundation based theme to work but at least what you are rewriting will be better laid out and more consistent. Also, if you take the opinion that the core code should be framework independent both bootstrap AND other theme developers will end up having to override templates. It's no more or less work for the non bootstrap framework favouring theme developer either way IMO .",

And how does using Bootstrap encourage use of design patterns?  Its just a framework that can be abused badly like anything else.  How you create designs and code is down to professionalism and discipline.

You know you are really in trouble when you `!important` a rule to override another rule that was marked as `!important` as well. There is one legitimate use of `!important` —and it’s while\nusing  the developer tools to debug something. Sometimes you need to\nfind which values for a property will fix your bug. Using `!important` in the developer tools and modifying a CSS rule on the fly lets you find these values while you ignore the cascade.\" So, !important may be considered harmful ?

I think that the comments block is already like this. just don't know why other blocks are not. I googled about lazy loading and it seems pretty interesting as well. \"loading images only if they are within the visible area\". Why would someone not love that?",

          "Text": "Mike, I think what Martin clarified, during a Twitter discussion, was that this was a single theme that would be without blocks (I believe he said as the default theme, but I sincerely hope not - maybe as one of the core themes?). Martin's tweet to me referenced a tracker item https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-52973 which seems to go very speedily from the title of ' Convert all the nav block and settings links into contextual lists on each page .' to ' Blocks in general are seen by practically all web designers I've ever met as \"old school\" and something we should get rid of ' to implementing a new core blockless theme. ('Practically all web designers' obviously doesn't include those who design Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook - although not perhaps for navigation and settings - which all seem to have 'blocks' for additional content on their pages) I think the idea of totally reworking the nav and settings blocks and even removing the default config of blocks added to pages/courses by default (Calendar, latest news etc) is definitely a good thing (start with a clean page, sure). But removing blocks/block regions entirely is not IMHO something that should be done with out a way to replace the functionality they provide. The dock and the zoom all features provide a way to hide blocks for individuals or sessions, teachers and admins are free to remove all the blocks anyway (not put any on their courses in the first place - and remove the default ones), so 'removing blocks' per se seems like a bad idea to me, while removing the enforced startup blocks and improving control over where those blocks can be used and positioned would seem a better option. Bad use of blocks can make a course page cluttered and un-intuitive and can harm the learning, but removing them entirely would be preventing the good practice too. But conflating the idea that Nav and Settings badly need a reworking with the idea that 'blocks are bad', is I think missing the point. Personally, I'm hoping the intention is a clean page with no default blocks, but retaining block regions to allow blocks to be added as appropriate. Richard PS - I note that the theme currently linked to in that tracker item does not appear to be blockless or at least it does have pre and post regions in both its config.php and its layout files, so I'm hoping we will be looking at the option of removing default blocks, but not removing block regions? Surely that could be resolved through a change in where the default blocks are set up as part of moodle config though, rather than a new theme?",

Maybe \"blocks\" in this discussion is referring to the way they were implemented in the past, as rectangles on one side or the other.

I look at them as containers for information and functionality that can be inserted in a variety of ways on any page to facilitate the way a Moodle site wishes to manage its information. There are currently 278 blocks in the plugins database . I'm guessing we won't abandon those, right? Anyone from HQ? Make us feel better? Please? mike",

Blocks are still there to provide the functionality where its needed (e.g. if I wanted to add a Progress Bar, or a link to Panopto - video capture that comes as a block providing the integration link) then I still can, but without impacting the main course content display I think its an ideal compromise with the way Moodle currently works, providing a much better interface, but still allowing the functionality when needed",

          "Text": "I am happy you like Snap. Snaps interface is a compromise because I agree right now blocks provide a lot of functionality that teachers require. Course tools however as a term doesn't encompass all the various tasks blocks are created to do. My perspective is that it isn't some much that a theme needs to be created that removes blocks as blocks as a plugin need to go away. Blocks have been historically used in Moodle as a catch all for features and tasks that couldn't be performed by other plugins. You mentioned progress bar which to me is an excellent example. This block has a visual display for the user on their progress ( similar to snaps table of contents showing completion information per section of the course). The block also has a report that you can view. In my opinion these features should have been split up. Progress is a theme display and reporting should be in a reporting engine. Putting the two together in a block provides a usability issue because now if I want to find my students progress I have to find this block rather than looking at the course reports. And I need to make sure the block is in a prominent place for students to see. Not only that some courses might show the progress blocks in different locations  on the page based on other blocks used, which will cause confusion for the student. To me the better process is to figure out if blocks as a plugin should exist or if there are enough plugin types to now support the features blocks are created for in a better way.",

          "Text": "\"Progress is a theme display\" Hmm not sure I agree with that - to me there is already too much functionality being built into themes which should concentrate on the look and feel, simply because its the best/easiest way to make that functionality happen. Maybe Progress is a sub-plugin for activity completion? not sure - maybe you are right, its already there really in activity completion it is just finding a way to display it, so possibly it is a theme issue - different ways to get to the same aim That said - I'm not disagreeing with your principle. My point at UK/ IE Moot at the table with Mike and in other conversations and here is not so much that we must retain blocks at all costs, but that we shouldn't be theming them away until such time as the functionality that they provide is made available in other ways - such as alternative plugin forms perhaps, or enabling existing plugin types to do some of the things blocks do. I don't mind if they are called tiles and moodle allows them to be built into main content, headers or wherever (although that may simply be because I'd like to see more control over that main content layout and not have to use html blocks for some of it to get it where I want it ), or if the functionality is rolled in with activities and local plugins - given that some of the key ones need much more urgent action than that (such as the navigation and settings and so on that I know are already being worked on). Yes, lets move on from blocks if thats what HQ feel is the right way to go (I'm not 100% sure myself but that's more related to the functionality than the display as blocks), lets provide other ways to do it - but lets look at it the way you have with Snap in the meantime - an unobtrusive way to include block functionality, a compromise, until we have the ability to provide those functions in another way. Once we have that 'other way' embedded and in practice, then would be the time to create themes that do away with blocks. I simply feel that doing it now (for 3.2) is jumping the theme ahead of where the functionality is - not that its not the right way to go, just the timing and application of it - And that's one of the reasons I like Snap so much. It (for me) does a great job of addressing that balance, providing a clean user interface, but still allowing the functionality of the blocks on a linked page. [Or to give the TL;DR short version - completely agree with you. But lets get that functionality into alternative plugin types before removing blocks from themes entirely ]",

To me, what is missing is a plugin that can display content in a row that is occupied by a module currently. Right now label is the only one that really inserts special content there. IMO there should be a plugin type that is simpler than mod that can display specialized content there.

Progress also needs to be extended to learning paths and competencies as well. A theme has the most control over all locations that progress should appear along with a congestive look and feel.

But otherwise, I don't think the theme should decide what functions and/or content get displayed. I am unconvinced that we can do away with blocks as plugins. If we want to rename them as \"widgets\" or \"tiles\", fine. But they provide a way of creating add-on functional and content features to Moodle that I don't see any other way to provide. I am sure there are some blocks now that could be suitably replaced by one or more other plugin types, but not all of them. Without the ability of customizing Moodle \"pages\" with block add-ons, Moodle would be a \"one-size fits all\" solution like Canvas. One of Moodle's primary strengths is the ability to customize and tailor it to specific needs. mike",

I don't, however, want to get rid of the ability to place something into the site level of Moodle and have it available hierarchically to users everywhere within the site, whether it appears in a sidebar block, a pulldown menu, or in the central content area.

          "Text": "Hi Adrian and thanks for starting this discussion Personally, I'd like to see more social learning oriented reporting features. I played with this plugin for a while but it was buggy and ultimately too much work to get it to work and keep it working on my Moodle: https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=report_forumgraph Also, I was toying with the idea of creating a learner \"heat map\" module that queries Moodle's DB logs and reports on individual learners, groups, whole courses, and whole sites as maps and/or graphs to show times of higher and lower activity; times of the day, days of the week, course and activity deadline times, etc. I think it'd be useful, especially across courses to see when learners are busiest online so that teachers, faculty, etc. can see if learners are getting overloaded with work, i.e. to help find strategies spread the workload out more. Additionally, it'd be useful for scheduling synchronous online sessions; what days and times are most learners available online? Look at the heat map. But also, we'd need to know if they're online because they have a deadline or another activity demanding their immediate attention... see next point. Also a deadline comparison feature for individual and cohorts of students taking more than one course: How evenly spread out are their deadlines to complete/submit work in activity modules? Are there any \"choke points\" where they'd be overloaded? So that teachers/faculty can take preemptive action before a crisis arises. May be helpful to teachers/faculty so that they can manage the amount of marking/assessment they have to do at any one time. Does this make sense? I hope this helps!",

Also, would there be a way to combine and improve this with the messaging system? It seems like they are both pretty similar. The messaging says where to send messages and this says which events to be sent messages regarding. Also for these rules, will they have to be setup for every module/course per user? Can we have smart defaults so that the user doesn't have to go to this screen unless it is absolutely necessary?",

Now there is class autoloading it makes more sense to autoload the sources and include a file reportbuilder.php similar to how settings.php or db/events.php is loaded. This would work for any plugin type. Table joins in report builder give access to fields within a new table that is related to the base table, but are not the only way to extract data. You can write complex field statements in the column options or join to subqueries to handle more complex cases. RB also natively supports aggregation.

First column: COURSE Second column: Number of activities in the course Third column: Number of turned in activities Fourth column: Number of assignments that need grading Fifth column: Number of assignments that have not been passed Sixth column: Number of assignments that have been passed Seventh column: Percentage of succesfully completed assignments . This report shows the grades of ALL the enrolled courses of a user. A filter on shortname can be placed to exclude certain courses.

You can then filter it by a specific user or a specific course, or by other criteria. You can also aggregate completion results by a common field and get counts and percentages. Simon",

Do you know yet if there is any functionality from Totara you aren't planning on including in core?

Having used Moodle as a student, a teacher, an academic admin, and a site administrator, I can think of many use-case scenarios where it's beneficial to have the email display options. One example: Moodle user profile pages make it easy for non-techie users to add contact details - email, messaging services, VoIP, and social networking services - to their profiles and have them automatically converted into the appropriate HTML links. This makes every users' profile page and contact links consistent and easy to find and users have control over what they do and don't want to share. If anything, the contact information of the Moodle profile page should be updated and improved. It'd be nice for users to be able to select who gets to see which contacts and when.

          "Text": "One of the things that comes up periodically on the themes forum is finding an easy way to migrate features (widgets, code snippets) whatever we might want to call them from one theme to another. Last year I did some work as part of flexibase v3.0 to make some of the features easily transferable, but it was too complex to maintain as part of the theme itself, but having done some work recently with Chris for both flexibase and pioneer, the idea arose again and I put some of these components into a separate github repository with instructions for using them in other themes (awesomebar, alerts, marketing and social and now the radial charts for grade and completion). This restarted the discussion about how we can make this a more standardised practice and simpler to achieve without necessarily being the theme guru that is necessary to migrate some of the features at the moment, with Gareth's suggestion that we need some kind of API to achieve this and my thought (this morning, following Mary's suggestion that this is really a Moodle future feature discussion, rather than a theme specific one ) that this could also encompass some of the thoughts that have been expressed about how we deal with some of the current functionality of Blocks. So, as a discussion: What would be needed for such a feature? Is it a practical way forward - is it already in the minds of anyone at HQ in line with the 'removing blocks' discussions? Is this something that mustache templating would cover? My thoughts on what the elements are of some of the features that need dealing with: the html/php required to display any feature within a layout (and/or the renderers to go with that) the javascript required for some functionalities the settings required for some functionalities and some appearances the lib functions and classes to support the feature I'm thinking that much of this is exactly what blocks do - except, crucially, for the way they are displayed. Blocks being limited to the block regions in effectively rectangular, well, 'blocks', while some of these features might be things like the awesomebar menu, or little display widgets that do not sit well in a block, or that designers want the flexibility to display as part of another region (eg. heading) Comments?",

Jetha Chan and myself have been writing a specification to make Moodle more user-friendly and we would really appreciate your feedback. The current draft can be found at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Navigation_overhaul_specification . You'll notice that some proposed solutions, particularly those to do with courses, do not yet have fleshed-out implementation details; unfortunately, this is due to the nature of navigation - many factors need to be considered when making changes, and we've added detail where possible. At present we've decided to prioritise getting community feedback on 'user context ' solutions, which can be developed independently; feel free, however, to give feedback on both. Please use the discussion page on the wiki, or this forum thread to express your thoughts. Many thanks! Fred",

A few comments: User preferences page Don't forget that it will also the right time to organise many of the random things which are on the 'edit prpofile' page too, and also move some that aren't on there but should be. (Probably a grep for user_prefernces would find some) A course 'Quick access' menu To unenrol yourself from a course, you would not look into the 'Course administration' node, you would rather find a link on 'My home' page next to the list of courses to unenrol yourself from them. I am not sure that this is a wise choice to move the link as we can't depend on every site making use of the 'My home' page. Though I agree with the principle that this is not an important link to be showing all the time. Dedicated grades page for the students Don't we already have one? An administration page per module Potentially more clicks-to-destination I would be a bit concerned about this - it might have a major impact for some modules. We might need to come up with an alternative standard metaphor for those modules to use for navigation between pieces of functionality (something like the old 'tabs' in 1.x).",

The student grades page, will that be linked to the course grade report for each course or will it introduce a new report with all grades in all courses?  Also how will that behave if grades are hidden from students in a specific course (like when Show gradebook to student is set to false) 2, Will it be possible for plugins to be able to inject things into the user preferences page?  There are several components (I'm thinking things like some of the quiz reports and grade reports) that could benefit from having the preferences configured from a uniform place. 3. Where would things like the question bank or filters fall in this new navigation scheme? (Since they can be used in multiple contexts such as a course or an activity) The rest looks good. -Steve",

Whilst I welcome a revision of the Navigation within Moodle, there are a few things that I am not happy with, the main one being the changes made to the \"page-header\". These changes will break the themes that are in place in most people's Moodle Sites, unless they are upgraded, or use the layouts from clean theme by default of their parent theme. That said, I am sure the approach you took could have been better designed. for one thing, why remove the page-header just to add a few new elements? Couldn't these new elements, such as the context header and the page heading been written as a set of single elements and then added to the page-header in the layout, thus giving themes the option to move them to another location in the theme's scheme of things? Also, I think that the breadcrumb would be better being placed just inside the page-content. Just a few thoughts, on a very windy day in the UK... Mary",

A draft spec is here: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Assignment_Grading_UX . The implementation will be a bit exploratory - and the end result will likely look a bit different to the screen shots in that specification. Overall aim is to provide a UI that makes grading faster and easier by reducing page loads, and making things easier to find and use. Regards, Damyon",

I do have a concern with answering the \"How do I get back to my course?\" question.  I can see the link to the course on the top right, but in every other place, this is either in breadcrumbs or the Navigation block, which generally defaults on the top left.  I might suggest keeping the breadcrumbs across the top - although I'm not sure how that works with the responsive design. I was also wondering about having grading/marking guides and rubrics display in more of a full screen (like the PDF annotations).  I see the pop-out/expand in the description, but generally with these types of grading it helps to see the whole picture.  Not to mention the annoyance of expanding/popping out the rubric/guide for every student. I'm excited to see how this exploration moves into a great update! Lisa",

With this new interface and the conversation of HTML (which is highly accessible by its nature) to PDF (which is accessible with a lot of work) you are now moving an issue that had a work around (don't use PDF annotation) to something that doesn't. Unless the workaround is to not use the new assignment grader ux. My recommendation here is that you do not auto convert HTML to PDF and that auto convert should be reserved only for file formats that can't be displayed on the web inline like Word and Powerpoint. Although if the APIs and renderers are done in a pluggable manner the office 365 integration could allow Word and Power point files from office 365 submissions to be displayed instead of the PDF annotator on the left hand side. In fact if done pluggable by file type someone in the community or a Moodle partner could create a crocodoc or scribd integration allowing an institution to replace the PDF annotator with a 3rd party plugin of their choice.",

Moving the pdf annotation to front and center is great and the orientation of the screen is a positive on the desktop. I would recommend some improvements however. Add a demo of how this works with an advanced grading method. Definitely rubric and also marking guide. Allow navigation between assignment so that as a teacher I don't have to leave this screen to grade all assignments that need to be graded currently in my course. Move the grade and feedback information above the submission status. I would even consider having the submission status data as something that can be hidden. The most common thing a teacher will want to do in this screen is grade. Separate submission comments out of that expand collapse area to be its own separate conversation. It will allow for a better flow of the discussion of the submission than the way it currently is setup buried in a table. I am also guessing that this will be a problem for screen reader users to find. Fix the interface on mobile devices at least a tablet should be able to use the interface in some meaningful way.

          "Text": "Hi all, As you may be aware I am the component lead for the Moodle forum. One of my personal bug-bears in mod_forum is the fact that, after every post, you are redirected to a page informing you that you've just posted before you are then redirected back to the forum index. This is poor for user experience because workflow is interrupted and the user distracted, and the message is only displayed for a short period (which may not be long enough). You are redirected to this page purely so that we can display a message because we have no way of storing those messages from one page to the next (without all sorts of nasty hacks like adding the message or some metadata about the message to the URL ). I've put together a proof-of-concept whereby we can store these kinds of messages in the user session such that they can be displayed on the subsequent page load. I've also applied these to all calls redirect() where the headers have not yet been sent, and have added an additional parameter to redirect() to let you specify the type of message being displayed. Previously redirect() only supported 'notification_redirect' which was rendered as a bootstrap alert. It is now possible to specify the constants for success, info, warning, and error. Because of existing naming conflicts (message = Moodle messaging; notificaiton = JS dialogues; and a related but different renderable), I have opted to name these `flashes`. I have also added a public interface to the flash system: \n```text\n\\core\\flash::add($message, $level);\n```\n With helpers for each level: \n```text\n\\core\\flash::success($message);\n\\core\\flash::info($message);\n\\core\\flash::warning($message);\n\\core\\flash::error($message);\n```\n These can be combined with a JS API to both display new messages, and to fetch and render messages currently in the session: \n```text\nrequire(['core/flash'], function(flash) {\n  // Fetch messages currently in the session and display them.\n  flash.fetchFlashes();\n\n  // Add a new message to the display (without storing it in the session).\n  flash.addFlash({\n    message: 'Example message',\n    type:    'success'\n  });\n});\n```\n The flashes generated here are instances of the \\core\\output\\notification renderable, which has also been updated as part of this change to add sanity. The output of these is provided by a set of mustache templates which can be modified by themes. I'm aware that some will dislike the name - if you have a better\nsuggestion, I'm all ears.\nNote that `messages` is used by other sub-systems and would lead to more\nconfusion, and that `notification` is also doubled up with two different\nuses already.\nThe term `flash` is used by Symfony and derivatives and does accurately\ndescribe the nature of the messages - e.g. that they are flashed up to the\nuser once, and then removed from the queue. This is still a work in progress, but I wanted to share my current work and start getting any feedback that others may have. The work on this feature is under MDL-30811 where a working prototype is available for testing. Cheers, Andrew",

Just raising the point without having looked at the actual code. It looks like you may have picked it up when redirecting before headers have been sent? I'm a little confused as to whether you're asking or stating here. With the way in which this is designed, messages are not popped off the stack until display time. In the case of the redirect() function, if the headers have not been sent, then the message is added straight to the session and a header-only redirect is issued. This means that there will be no fetching of the flash. If the headers have already been sent, then the message is displayed on that page, alongside a timeout. The timeout can be specified by the caller: \n```text\nredirect($url, $message, 42);\n```\n If no timeout was specified, and there was a message, a three-second timeout is used. We should perhaps consider increasing that timeout to at least 5 seconds. Flashes are also fetched from the session on the page -- perhaps we should disable that, but I'm not fully sold on that idea. It may be better to extend the timeout according to the number of flashes in the session. Andrew",

The idea itself makes sense and I recall a number of previous discussions of the same idea over the years (I have been trying to find one thread in particular on this topic but have so far been unsuccessful.) The earliest discussion I can find of this concept is this one from Petr proposing the same idea 10 years ago , and Mark Nielsen implemented a patch for it in MDL-6470 (i'm sure there was further Moodlerooms work on it at a later stage too, but I can't find it). 2. As you predicted, I do not like the naming \\core\\flash at all. As Tim Hunt wrote in the developer chat recently: >When thinking about names, it always helps to think about how generic the words are. E.g. instance has very low semantic content. workshop is higher, but not very high within the workshop namspace. In this case, the addition of the word 'notification' would help a great deal.",

The issue I raised was back in 2011 and I was surprised that no other issues existed discussing that functionality already (at least, none that I could find). Regarding the naming I had been trying to keep the naming short, and to the point, but as you point out it needs to be understandable at the same time. Concatenating two words is probably the best option, so how about something like: notificationflash flashnotification flashnotice I think my preference is for flashnotification, or possibly flashnotice.

People are starting to use AMD more and more, and the notification.exception is used very heavily - there is no real benefit in making everyone change from notification to dialogue - and it's actually wrong IMO . (The fact that the exception is displayed in a dialogue is an implementation detail. The purpose of the function is to display a notification). notification has 3 methods in it - and 2 of them are perfectly correct, \"confirm\" is not really a notification, but is similar enough to the other 2 to leave it where it is IMO. In the CBE code, we have a new dialogue amd module on the way (that wraps the yui dialogue) and is a real dialogue (I want to open an window and put content into it). A better solution would be to merge these flash messages functions into the existing notification module and not deprecate/move anything.",

So, for example, the following is 'correct' behaviour: Create a quiz that allows 1 attempt, and which automatically gets marked as complete when a student has completed all their attempts. Student attempts the quiz and gets a bad mark - quiz is marked as complete. Teacher overrides the settings for that student, and allows them a second attempt. Because of the policy, the quiz is still shown as complete, but this is clearly not what anyone was expecting, and this was reported as a bug MDL-52722 . It looks even stranger if the quiz has a 'Grade to pass' set. Then, the quiz is not just shown as Complete, but Complete - failed. Is this enough to cause us to re-consider this policy?

As far I know, the core purpose\nof moodle is to use in schools, colleges and universities where E-learning is\ncompulsory. However, there are many schools, colleges and universities,\nespecially in developing countries where e-learning is optional. As teachers,\nwe realize the benefits which moodle can bring to our students; that’s why we\nuse moodle. Our purpose is different from yours; we’d like to build up online\nlearning environment in developing countries, among them is my country, Vietnam.\nIn my country, teachers have no rights to force students to do quizzes and assignments\nonline at class, just encourage students to do these tasks at home. Therefore,\nhow to attract students online to practice is a difficult question to us. We’d\nlike the courses we create and the documents we share are used not only by our\nstudents but also by other students. If so, we need some more features in future\nmoodle; Forum threads\nappear in fontpage or fontpage blocks (used to have). Frankly speaking, we don’t need news forums. Why don’t\nwe replace news forum threads by discussion forum threads in fontpage? If so,\nit’s easy for students to see them. Forum threads\nand courses should have tags . Why? As\nmentioned above, we need forum our threads and courses appear on searching\nengines. In discussion forums, there should have an additional\ncolumn called View/ Read next to\nReplies one like other sources. Attachment files should have counting function or who downloaded them. Forum thread and\ncourse headings should have Like and Social share button s. (We don’t have to use Social share Block anymore). Have you ever wondered why most people use moodle as a\nsmall part of their websites? They use other sources such as; wordpress, vBullentin,\nXenforo etc. as their main websites. You can see; https://domain.com/moodle . Which source is used in https://moodlenews.com? Surely, not\nmoodle. Of course, you can have your\nown answer for this question. The answer is clear and simple; moodle doesn’t\nlook like a webpage because moodle lacks some of above features. I strongly\nbelieve that moodle developers can make moodle look like a webpage. Sooner or\nlater, moodle developers will add some of these features. I look forwards to using these features in next moodle\nversion. Best wishes,",

          "Text": "1. Forum threads on front page : You may not use the News forum - others may make extensive use of it. Which forum threads would you want on the front page? For instance my workplace moodle has about 2000 thousand courses, most with forum discussions. Its not practical, possible or desirable to put those on the front page. However, if you set the MyHome page as the default for logged in users, then each course they are enrolled on should give information about unread posts, making it easy for students to see the ones relevant to them without being overloaded with all of them, whether they are subscribed or not. You could also enable RSS feeds for any forums you wish and allow students to access forums via the rss block 2. Tags are not necessarily a cure all for search engine optimisation - if you want your courses and forums to appear on search engines, then investigate that as an issue, but don't assume tags will solve it 3. View/Read - presumably what you are after is a means of tracking unread/read forum posts? Have you tried turning on Read tracking, which highlights the unread posts? But yes, agree a count of unread posts alongside the total number of replies in a thread would be useful information 4. OK - don't personally see the benefit of this, and would probably just apply google analytics or similar if I needed it, but if you have a requirement for it then fine. 5. Like/Social Share - we already have a ratings system available to forums and the ability to create your own (see the useful ratings on these forums - the word could just as easily be 'like'). Social Sharing - I can see how some would consider this useful, but I personally don't like the idea of 'forcing' anyone to have an external social media account if they don't want one (or implying they have to connect their social accounts with their learning - many users want to keep their social media separate from their learning), so it would need settings about 'if the user has' and 'what social media the user has' given that some countries ban access to some sites like twitter and facebook, or have more popular social media sites that are more specific to their own country/region. From a usability point of view, I wouldn't want share on twitter/facebook buttons appearing for everyone if they dont have those accounts. Yes, people use Moodle as a part of their total webpresence because they are using teh most appropriate tool for the task - for your example, the moodlenews.com site is a newsletter, not a learning environment, so why would it choose to use Moodle? As powerful as Moodle is as a learning environment, it is not designed to be a one stop shop off the shelf solution for the entire web needs of an institution. It is designed to be the best learning environment it can be. Yes, moodle can look more like a webpage - see some of the newer themes and some of the examples discussed in the forums and around the web. And yes, some of your suggestions may be useful for some users. But some of them are specific to your use case while Moodle needs to address everyone's needs in ways that can be adapted for individual institutions. Can't comment on zenforo as I've never heard of it, while vBulletin is specifically designed as a forum and only a forum, so yes, if you want to use that in place of Moodle's own tools because your needs revolve more around the forum than around the learning environment as a whole, then I would recommend using the best tools for YOUR needs and using Moodle for its core purpose while using other tools for blogging (wordpress) external forums (a bulletin board of some kind) or whatever other needs an individual institution may have. Moodle does not need to become a primary webpage creation tool, at least not over and above its core purpose - where I do agree that having a more 'web page feel' would be beneficial, given that the look and feel of the web itself changes over time too! Perhaps you should consider adding these suggestions to the tracker - mainly by the look of them as suggestions for the forum tool. They can then be voted on and possibly developed by the community. I know improvements to the forum are an often discussed topic (While I still consider it far better than the ones on many commercial and alternative OSS rival learning systems I have used)",

Originally, I posted this thread in Future\nmajor features Forum , so Why was this thread moved to General help? Are\nthese features available in Moodle? 1. We’d like the forum threads like on http:s//moodle.org\n(quiz, theme, forum, and lesson etc.). The newest thread or post in each forum\nwill appear in Fontpage. I think we can control the number of threads or posts\nappearing in fontpage like courses appear in font page in default theme, so\noverloading won’t happen. 2. You said, “ Tags are\nnot necessarily a cure all for search engine optimisation ”. Why posters use tags? Do they use tags for fun? You\ncan read: Title tags are the second most important\non-page factor for SEO, after content. You can read more information about title tags here . 3. I turned on Read tracking, but in fact, not all of\nthe students remember to subcribe forums. In addition, a large number of our\nusers are Guests. 4. Attachment files: Why do teachers have to see logs to\nfind out who downloaded our files instead of seeing them right after the files? 5. Social like and share: I can’t believe that your\nstudents don’t social network accounts. In my poor country, Vietnam, almost\nsecondary students and college students have facebook, google, twister etc.\naccounts. Xenforo not Zenforo! Xenforo\nis one of the biggest and most popular sources. You can read more at: https://xenforo.com How to make Moodle look like\na webpage by using Theme is only a short-term solution. Now we have Moodle 3.0 + while how many themes are used for moodle 3. Supposing you have you favorite\ntheme, you can’t use it for a long time because you have to upgrade newer\nmoodle and the theme designer of your favorite theme doesn’t upgrade it – He/\nshe abandons it. Once again, I say “Our core\npurpose is different from yours”. If you feel my suggestion unnecessary, you\nmay ignore them. I on behalf of moodlers using moodle in schools where\nE-learning isn’t compulsory say and suggest what we want and wish in future\nmoodle. Best wishes,",

          "Text": "Hi Howard and Phoung, I agree completely that the forums need changes. I remember in 2003 when sticky forums were first proposed and now, 12 years later, they have finally moved into final stages of core integration. Sticky forums are not \"fancy\" features, but critical tools to allow teachers to focus key pinned topics for attention, and give students valuable ways to construct knowledge by summarizing long threads and seemingly unconnected comments. Teachers and students do not want to have 5 or 6 separate LMS tools to log into and switch to--a blog tool, a wiki tool, a forum tool, etc. The purpose of Moodle is to have one place to go to. Unfortunately, the forum module has been in a decade-long doldrum (with the exception of word counts!) and your suggestions, Phoung, are spot on. My suggestion to Phoung is that after you get feedback on the these recommendations, that you separate the points and make Tracker items for each.  I know the Tracker is really scary (for me too) and it is easy for a recommendation to get lost for 12 years, but with persistance, and support by other teachers, there is change.  The reason that core development is so slow is because developers think differently than teachers--they are more concerned with long-term maintanence of code, than learning. It is natural, so teachers have to explain their needs convincingly and rally other teachers who have the same needs. Howard, could you move this thread back to the Future Major Features section? Actually, I think the majority of points relate to the Forum Module. Then we should move it to the Forums Module discussions.  My suggestion for retitling this thread is something more specific like:  \"Five needed changes for the Forum Module\".",

Like a lot of simple ideas, incredibly difficult to implement, particularly if the people running the show don't necessarily agree. There can be a very fine line between trying to be a \"one-stop-shop\" and \"being all things to all people\". This is usually defined by ego and not need or ability, just look at the Dark Side - and shudder. I agree with Don, Moodle should be a \"one-stop-shop\", but based on educational requirement and student need. This is why I have mentioned elsewhere that Moodle should have a small, bomb-proof core and layers of plugins from the tried and tested to experimental for people to use, and refine for their own purposes. Such a setup, I suggest, would suit both educational requirement and student need, allowing any educational system, or entity, to structure their Moodle to suit their own requirements and needs.  These are similar in general all over the world, but can be very different in detail and application across nations. Phoung mostly discusses forums and I know Don makes a lot of use of forums, but these are not the only tools they would use. Neither may use a database , but both would likely use a student built glossary for their language students, so why would they have need of a database activity in their Moodles? Which would likely lead to a further refinement, in very large institutes, why have just one Moodle? Languages use many different tools than Maths, and few similar tools than Languages, but Maths would use many of the same tools as Science and Engineering. Why then should someone in Languages have to wade through the Maths, Science and Engineering tools to get to the tools they need? Ok, it is not that difficult, I know, but the idea is to modify Moodles to suit more specific student needs. Could that not be a development goal? Besides, Moodle still looks pretty much like a 1999 interface, how about improving it?",

My point is, that if the OP wants to run a complex forum site *now* then Moodle may not be his best choice. It doesn't stop him using Moodle for other things. However, a 'front page' sophisticated forum could be done today with a dedicated forum application and almost certainly give him the features he needs.

          "Text": "Firstly Phuong, as mentioned below - I didn't move the thread, I dont believe I  have that authority across the forums, I am only the moderator in the Themes forum. I believe, although could be corrected that the forum posts you mention on the frontpage of moodle.org are RSS feeds, which is already possible and which I have built into other themes for schools in the past. From your own comment - Tags are the second most important feature for SEO after content . I don't doubt tags are a good idea, but as I said, they are not the 'cure-all' for search engine optimisation. And getting people to bother using them can also be problematic on forums - its a different use case to tagging a blog post, although may be appropriate to longer forum posts. I would say maybe a tag cloud for a whole discussion rather than for individual posts - but then if the title is meaningful I can usually find what I'm looking for already. moodle.org forum posts seem to have no difficulty showing up in google searches without tags. If they are not subscribed and in fact are guests and therefore anonymous, how would you anticipate Moodle identifying whether they have read the posts anyway? It might be able to identify the posts read in a single session, but if they left and came back, or cleared browser history it would show those users that they have never read any of the posts again. Attachment files - seeing who downloaded them directly: I'm sure a button to a report that extracts that info from the logs could  be coded into theme if it was required, but yes, if there is a requirement for it, could probably be added as a feature into forums itself, if you request it through the tracker, particularly if you are then able to make some suggestions as to coding it (or find a developer who can). The information, as you point out, should all be there in the logs, a quick link button to extract it easily is probably what is needed. As I said I, personally, would not want a list of downloaders directly with every attachment, on courses with a few hundred users, that would be unworkable. I also wouldn't find it very useful - I would prefer to look at the total engagement with the course as a whole (via the logs and reports) and then potentially drill down from there to specific resources, rather than have lists by each attachment or resource, but that would just be my workflow. I didn't say our students dont have social medai, I said I have an issue\nwith 'forcing' students to use those accounts for their education\nprovision and that many (not all, not even most, but a significant\nnumber) of our students prefer to keep their social lives and their\neducation separate. Xenforo - a typo, but doesn't change the fact I've never heard of it before. I had read the link you provided the first time and found nothing there to alter my comment that I know nothing about it so wasn't able to comment on it. Perhaps showing my ignorance, but then I never claim to know every piece of software out there on the web. I am surprised though that as you state its such a huge piece of software that the only mention of it I can find in Moodle forums (which are often full of discussions about integrations with things like Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla) is this thread. Themes, just like the rest of Moodle are open source, and if one gets abandoned that you are using, you are free to maintain it or find another maintainer - big themes such as Essential/Elegance have found alternative community maintainers, and while some of my older themes (as an example) are not being maintained on the community for current moodle releases, I am aware of my old krystle and flexi_ii themes being in use on sites running 2.9 and will be happy to support those users on a 1-1 basis if and when they upgrade next time. Also those of us in the community do our best to continue to support themes from the community plugins database for as long as it is practical to do so - I know there are still people using formal white and other older themes on Moodle 2.9 and 3.0 (That situation does change if you have opted for a commercial theme). Even software like Windows has an end of life period and things that run on one version of Windows may not run on a future one when you upgrade - and upgrading itself is always a choice if it breaks too many of your plugins. I know many sites conitnued to use 1.9 for a long time rather than lose some of their customisations when upgrading to Moodle2. Fortunately the shift to Moodle3 is not that severe. ' If you feel my suggestion unnecessary, you\nmay ignore them.' - It is not my intention to ignore them, or to denegrate them, but to engage with you and your suggestions. If we don't discuss suggestions like yours then it becomes impossible to get community engagement on what is the best way forward. If my ideas contrast with yours, that is not an indication that I believe yours are wrong, or that mine are better than yours in ANY way! simply that they are different and are there for discussion and determining best ways forward. That may be that the discussions lead to changes in core features, or it may be that someone takes your ideas and mine and pushes them in a third direction with a plugin of some kind. 'I on behalf of moodlers using moodle in schools where\nE-learning isn’t compulsory say and suggest what we want and wish in future\nmoodle ' - This is perhaps the only statement you make that I do actually have a major issue with. E-Learning is not compulsory in any of the institutions I have  worked with, although it may be in a few individual courses. However, I would have to say, you do not speak on behalf of me and my wishes for the future of Moodle. I am fine with discussing all the points you make, whether I agree with them or not in the common desire to make Moodle better, except for the sweeping general statement that you speak on behalf of all moodlers in schools where e-learning isn't compulsory. By all means make your points on your own behalf, imply or even state that you believe others in your position would likely share some of your views, but to state that you speak on their behalf in a community the size of Moodle, while actually stating, incorrectly, that you believe Moodle's core purpose is in schools and institutions where e-learning is compulsory, is somewhat undermining your own arguments in my opinion.

          "Text": "Excellent, really glad to see a solid plan for this, I think it's a really important piece of work. I think you've captured the essence of what I had in mind when we discussed the element library at the hackfest in Perth. Having a really robust set of elements to work with will make development and theming easier, and allow the work needed to meet Moodle's many requirements (responsive design, multi-lingual, accessible, progressive JS enhancement, etc) to be centrally managed. It will also help consolidate the overall UI to improve consistency. Some thoughts: Without wanting to instantly double to scope of this work (really!), I just wanted to mention templates. Given the scope of work needed to rewrite existing renderers has there been any consideration of integrating a template engine like TWIG? This could provide improved XSS protection and help enforce the separation of style from content, provide better support for layout changes in themes and make it easier for non-programmers to write/edit themes. I agree that the lack of a connection between a renderer's HTML and accompanying CSS is a problem. Do you have a plan in mind for how that could be overcome? It would be nice to use a convention for classes/ids that have been added for use via JS, so you can easily tell if it is safe to change something or if it is being used for JS. You talk about the fact that bootstrap specific classes are included in renderers, and about the idea of making things CSS framework agnostic. If I've understood correctly you are achieving that by inserting the classes required by the framework into the renderer as required (approaches A and B). That seems quite complex, and I'm not 100% convinced there is sufficient payoff as opposed to just standardising on a single framework (like using YUI for JS). Is there a huge demand from themers to be able to use different frameworks? It would be good for the style guide to recommend a standard layout for similar pages. For example, it's really common to have a page with a list of items and a \"create new item\" option. It would be great if the style guide recommended the \"create new item\" was a button and it should be positioned above and to the right of the list of items. Even better would be a renderer that could be used for any type of items where the developer just provides the elements/components. That way a theme designer could override the renderer and have it change everywhere. I'm a bit concerned that aiming for full backward compatibility may limit the scope of what you can achieve.

The move from Bootstrap 2 seems analogous to the YUI2->3 move, painful yes but how does supporting more frameworks help with that? If bootstrapbase was just one of several \"framework\" base themes it would still be necessary to migrate all the renderers in the bootstrapbase theme once it fell out of support. 5. Sounds good! 6. Yeah I suppose you are right (in that existing code doesn't need to change to be rendered) although until a significant fraction of (core) code is using the new approach it won't be possible to rely too much on the element library when testing a theme.

Another is that I already have a couple of themes (one in use on a personal site, several others experimental) that use flexbox for layouts rather than bootstrap grids (personal example, but there may be other developers out there with other ideas to develop too). For as long as those elements can be overridden in theme layout files or renderers that's fine, but the minute we lock into a single framework through all of core it becomes restrictive. The discussion, as I see it, is that work is being undertaken which - while Moodle core can (and should) focus on a single framework - could either restrict developers to that framework OR create a means where 3rd party developers, if they so choose, are able to (fairly easily) adopt a different framework, with the added benefit of making future upgrades to the supported core framework easier to manage. => my +1 for being as framework agnostic as possible in anything that cannot be overidden by plugins",

The more that renderers that get\nimplement the more of Moodle you can customise. This is probably outside the scope of the proposal, but I think that ANY component that that uses global OUTPUT should be able to extend or overwrite any renderer.  Why should only themes be allowed to override output_favicon();?  Why should plugins only be allowed to extend plugin_renderer_base() and not core_renderer()? We have no established best practices, nor even documentation on\nwhat constitutes a good renderer, or considerations that should be paid\nmind in planning and designing of code. Yes! I have asked before in general developer for recommended best practices on using html_writer()- which is inevitably a large component of a renderer.  For example I have seen several ways of building \"stuff\" with html writer. \n```text\nNested: html_writer::tag('div', html_writer::tag(a, 'hi', array()));\n```\n \n```text\nstuffed $foo= html_writer::tag('a', 'hi', array()); $foo = html_writer::tag('div', $foo);\n```\n \n```text\nconcatenated: $foo = html_writer::starttag('div'); $foo .= html_writer:starttag('a', array()); $foo .= 'hi.';\n```\n There has to be a best way (personally I don't like any of them...). Logic-full renderers greatly hinder theming. I think this also puts too much \"power\" into the hands of a theme.  Where a theme should maximally control only look and feel of output there is a feature creep to add to output in a way that is beyond that scope, e.g. injecting analytics, enabling web fonts, etc... which all belong in a proper separate plugin whose output should then be passed to the theme ( IMO ). Finally define a comprehensive list of low level widgets we can add to\ncore as renderables. This is a library of components that should be used\nby other renderers (by compositing them). seems like another good argument for other plugin types to be able to access core_renderer.  Quiz and forum need access cancel_button() too... ( draft!) Categories for renderables why create our own taxonomy instead of using the one in the linked article(s) and pattern lab?  atoms-> molecules -> organisms -> templates -> pages Progressively convert renderers Perhaps a good place to start is with components that have not yet been converted to a renderer like /login/ - simultaneously getting a POC for the design pattern and knocking off an existing tracker issue, so even if it needs to be rewritten (hope not) at least it now exists as a renderer. A \"good renderer\" is not: Where then IS the appropriate place for this logic?  Many custom themes are introducing complex logic in overridden renderers (like custommenu) to add functionality.  If that doesn't belong in a renderer- then where? FWIW, I like Approach \"A\".",

To understand this, let us just think about core_renderer::single_button, and mod_quiz_renderer::view_page, which uses it, and let us pretend that the code is really simple so it looks like: \n```text\nclass core_renderer {\n\n\n    function single_button($label) {\n\n\n        return '<input type=\"button\" value=\"' . $label . '\">';\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nclass plugin_renderer_base {\n\n\n    protected $page;\n\n\n    protected $output;\n\n\n    public function __construct($page) {\n\n\n        $this->page = $page;\n\n\n        $this->output = $this->page->get_renderer('core');\n\n\n    }\n\n\n    public function __call($method, $arguments) {\n\n\n        return call_user_func_array(array($this->output, $method), $arguments);\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nclass mod_quiz_renderer extends plugin_renderer_base {\n\n\n    function view_page() {\n\n\n        return $this->single_button('Start attempt');\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n```\n (The real code is a bit more complex than this, because it deals with things like error handling, but it is essentailly the same. Feel free to go an look at the real code. I have tried to simplify things without being misleading.) The point about this is that a theme can override core_renderer, and change what single_button does, and that changes all buttons everywhere in Moodle. That is done by defining \n```text\nclass theme_example_core_renderer extends core_renderer {\n\n\n    function single_button($label) {\n\n\n        // Something fancy here!\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n```\n In the plugin_renderer_base constructor, the $this->page->get_renderer('core') call will return an instance of theme_example_core_renderer, rather than core_renderer, when you are using this theme, and so the $this->single_button call in the quiz renderer will go to theme_example_core_renderer. If, instead, we had done \n```text\nclass mod_quiz_renderer extends core_renderer {\n\n\n    ...\n\n\n}\n```\n and did not use the __call magic, then the $this->single_button call would always go to core_renderer, and themes could not override it. I hope that explanation makes sense.",

I agree that themes shouldn't be adding this type of functionality- but right now they're the only way to do it w/o changing core code.  I mean I guess I could create a dozen little themes that only contain renderers with a handful of methods that output a single \"widget\" each where I can then include those themes as a parent/grandparent of any other theme and gain the functionality as needed...",

          "Text": "That all looks very positive, I agree with the general direction. Some miscellaneous feedback: 1. I'd like to see some thought given to how a 3rd party developer, who may not be a professional software developer, can quickly and easily create a UI that will work in multiple versions (2.6, 2.7, 2.8 etc.) and multiple themes (Standard, Clean, a Bootstrap3 or PureIO-based theme) and fit in and work in all of them. There should be functions that they can call that take care of making it all work, but it seems today a lot of things are simply hardcoded and so are fragile and break compatibility easily. 2. Any existing API that simply takes the classname from the dev and outputs it into the DOM needs to go, it's impossible to support the stated goals and that at the same time. This also allows for the API to be improved e.g. the current notification renderer going from notification(\"anything_you_want\") to alert_danger, alert_warning, alert_info, alert_success or similar (and then cleaning up the oddities that do other stuff, like \"notifytiny\"). 3. I'd like to see the stuff that can be fixed within a current theme shipped immediately to get feedback. There's no reason why, for example, the code that just landed to provide Bootstrap compatible progress bars should not be shipped as soon as possible in 3rd party themes. There's no need to wait till the next version of Moodle ships and then the 6-12 months till that actually gets widely deployed before checking our progress on this. In general this is a powerful feature of Moodle's existing renderer system which I think is criminally underutilized. 4. The current continue renderer doesn't return a \"A message and a button to continue to the next page\", but only a button. We do need one that takes a message but since the current one doesn't we'll need to come up with a new one and transition to it. 5. Any time the \"single button\" renderer is used twice to create a form with two buttons side by side, then that renderer should not be used, probably one or more new renderers should be created to fulfill those use cases. 6. Totally minor but... some of your table entries are duplicated (navbar_item, progress_bar). 7. Converting the non-renderer code that does the same thing (or subtly different thing for no good reason) as a current renderer to call that renderer would be a very good place to start this project. There's a fair bit of this, but it's fairly mindless, easy work and you basically can't do anything interesting with a renderer till all the \"fake\" versions of it have been cleaned up. 8. There's a lot of independent things here that can be worked on in parallel. What is the plan for coordinating everyone's work?",

In my mind that is entirely facilitated by the elements and components that make up the library as well as the library itself. It will need to be extensible and we'll have to keep a ear to the ground on what is being done to either suggest approaches or adopt missing pieces. Obviously there will need to be an evaluation process of some fashion for that. As for an actual example that is harder to provide without putting in the ground work on the elements and components, of course once started it should become visible very early on how a UI can be constructed. 2. 100% agreement - that means must end. No HTML or CSS should be passed into renderers, everything should be internal and options such as those you've used in your example should be provided as options to the renderable or the render method. 3. Yes, for sure fixes should go back. Better documentation on process will help this. If I am thinking of the same issue you are that wasn't backported primarily because of the changes to the JS that were made. Better association between the JS and CSS as is being purposed here will in my mind greatly reduce the cases like that one. Of course that documentation will be key, we need to be very clear on what gets backported for theme improvements, as perhaps some should be treated as bugs more than improvements. Maybe a policy issue will be required in the future for it, let us see. 4. 5. 6. 7. This really ties in with the below answer. 8. That is one of the really great things about this project. There is going to be a large amount of \"grunt\" work in several areas. The purpose of this specification is really to nail down what we want to achieve, the first thing that will happen once we have settled on that is to break up the required work into manageable tasks and establish what can be done when. I imagine we will end up with \"stages\" organised under the epic and within each stage achievable tasks. Like most issues we will appreciate any help we can get when implementing this, and most certainly as much help as we can get on conversions. For sure once we have the organisation of tasks sorted we will share how we intend to tackle this and what areas we'd appreciate help on.",

An MVW javascript approach provides a clear separation between data, logic and presentation. It also means we are less likely to be writing lots of code with event handlers everywhere. Why? Because with MVW frameworks, the relationships defined between the data and the template automatically trigger re-rendering when data is provided or manipulated. At the moment for someone to understand the HTML generated by my YUI javascript they would have to mentally picture it in segments or simply inspect the DOM at render time. With MVW you have templates for HTML so you can easily see what is going to be output (makes it so much easier for developers at all levels) Unfortunately YUI does not provide a MVW framework and in my own javascript libraries for Moodle plugins I have created and manipulated HTML in a less than ideal fashion (mainly because I'm doing things the YUI way).

          "Text": "Hi guys, I have chatted a few times with Damyon in the office, but I thought that sharing my views here would not hurt. In general, I tend to prefer the approach B. Mainly because it does not involve much API change, but just some clarifications on how a to write a good renderer and renderable. However, there are a few things that I am not sure I agree with. Anything can be a renderable This is a great feature because it allows a developer to very quickly pass something to a renderer, but I'm afraid that this can quickly expand to be unmanageable and bug prone. Say you are developing a plugin that is mainly using one class. Rather than defining a new class to implement renderable you will implement renderable to your class. So far, that's not really an issue. Now you are working in your renderer and calling the different properties of your class to construct HTML. But you stumble upon some value for which you have not define a property, though it is accessible from a method A. So you will call the method A, and it will work just fine, but by doing so you break the rule where a renderable should only contain simple values. Anyway, let's say that this is acceptable because the method A is extremely simple. But your plugin evolves, and that method A called in your renderer too. Now it contains much more logic than before, and it calls other methods, those methods query the database , use caching, trigger events, etc... Of course, whenever you updated the method A, you forgot that it was called from the renderer. At this point, your renderer has become ugly, it is doing a lot of computation under the hood through the renderable that was supposed to contain only simple scalar values. Who does that hurt? Well, luckily the theme designer is not too much affected because the logic is not contained in the renderer, but we ended up lying to ourselves when we said that we would not have any more logic in renderers, we just moved it somewhere else and closed our eyes. I can this of those typical: 'is_visible()', 'get_post_content()' or 'can_edit()'. Now, let's say that we can live with that, and let's think about templates for a moment. Surely our ultimate goal is to move to templates, and with renderables it is extremely easy: you fetch all the properties from the object, pass them to the template, and there you go, done! But what about our method A... from a coding point of view, how would I know that I need to fetch the return value of method A? Surely we could define somewhere the list of properties/methods to fetch from a renderable, but that should not be the case... you get the point. Oh, did I mention the private/protected properties on my renderable? And the open access to anything public, or caught by __call(), __get(), etc...? Renderables can only be rendered by one renderer If you consider renderables as containers of information, then there is no reason this container could not be re-used in other circumstances and renderered differently. For example, a link_renderable could contain 'text', 'url' and possibly 'icon'. This renderable can be re-used anywhere, in a dropdown, a flat list of links, an indented list of link (navigation), etc... If there is only one way to render a renderable, that means that a link_renderable should be rendered with an icon and a text. But what if I want to display a list of icon without text? In this example I cannot call the common render_link() method because it outputs the text of the link, therefore I have to create another renderable that is icon_link_renderable, and that renderable only contains the URL and the link. But that is not a good option. This option means that the developer makes strong decisions on how the content should be displayed because they pass a certain renderable to the renderer. In this last example, the icon_link_renderable does not contain the text, so a themer will never be able to render it with a text. As renderables only contain information, there is no reason we should duplicate them in order to create a different output. We already have the information ready, let's just make use of it. For instance you would never know how a user_renderable should be displayed (with link, without, only picture, only name, ...) but it would always contain the information that are crucial for a themer to change its layout. One would say that if a renderable can be rendered differently in different locations it does not help a themer. Actually, it does not change anything for a themer, or maybe it even makes it easier for them. There would be more renderers if we have less renderables, and more renderables if we have less renderers, but the naming convention of the renderers would make more sense. For instance, you could create your own new renderer that receives a user_renderable and create your own specific output from it. Whereas if you have to overwrite the renderer username_and_picture to display just the user name of the user because of your design decisions, the name does not make sense any more. Dom manipulation I strongly disagree with the logic that uses some sort of dom_utils to edit the content or classes of a node that was generated in another renderer. This is placing complex logic back into the renderers, and even if they are tied to the 'display', I do not agree that should exist. I am not sure how to solve this, but if a renderable can be passed around to other renderers, then it should be alright to overwrite the corresponding renderers, or create new ones to output the renderer the way you need. Those are the majors concerns that I have about the specification. We have to write proper new renderers and make sure that the rules are defined for this to evolve in the right direction in the future. Many thanks! Fred",

          "Text": "I finally made time to read the latest version of the spec. I have only got half way so far, but most of what I have read so far has been really good. I have to go to an orchestra rehearsal now, so expect more comments later. Project Goals & Benefits I think you have done a really good job at the top of http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Render_library_specification of distilling the essential goals of this project down to a few short bullet points. Hopefully this pays us all back by keeping the (huge amount of) work focussed. So what is the problem I disagree with the \"We have no established best practices\" . Three-layer archtecture, separating UI, logic, and persistence, is a well established pattern, and renderers are Moodle's way of doing that separation of the output code from the logic. So, lots of software design best practice does apply, and is applied, by many Moodle developers. I am prepared to accept your statement that this is insufficiently documented. \" Developers are encouraged to push functionality boundaries in order to\ntake it places observed in other projects or to challenge oneself.\" I think this is unfair. At least in the quiz, where I have gone for a design that is not a copy of something somewhere else in Moodle, that is becuase I have been trying to develop the best UI I can for that bit of functionality. Functionality that users need. I don't think this list curretnly puts the most important things first. E.g. \"Themers have a mammoth task ...\" is much more important than lack of dev docs. (The order only matters in that it makes the document more readable to get to the importnat points first.) The elephant in the room Suddently, when we get to the \"Element library and style guide\" section, it is taken as read that Elements will be rendeables: \" Establish a definition method of elements, and compositions of elements as renderables.\" This is certainly not a given. If you think we muse use renderables everywhere (that is, for any thing that you want to output, you have to define a PHP class) then that is something that you need to justify carefully . I am not convinced. I will probably post more on this point when I have read the whole spec. Thoughts on naming From private chat with you, I know none of us are big fans of all the Atomic design terms. Particularly 'organism'. However, it is something of a standard, so I think we should just grimace and use the standard terms. Style guide I was wondering if it was really neceassry to have a separate style-guilde, or whether we could get everything we want from the Element library. However, I see that the propose style guide is at a higher, more meta, level than the element library, and something there probably is necessary. However, it should be kept as a short statement of principles, and should not duplicate the kind of information that is embodies in the element library. ... this is as far as I got in my reading just now. Minor quibbles from earlier in the document. In \" Understanding renderers in Moodle\" \"Renderers were introduced in a time before Object Orientation was used in Moodle\" - this is not true. There was lots of object orientation in Moodle when we introduced renderers. I more accurate sentence would be \"Renderers were introduced at a time when we were starting to greatly increase the user of Object Orientation was in Moodle core.\" At the end of that paragraph, I would be inclined to add the sentence \"Renderers were the closest thing to templates that it was possible to implement in Moodle at the time.\" More history For anyone wanting more of the history, renderers were originally a concept I came up with, in response to demands to let people override the design of Moodle with templates. See MDL-19077 . Looks like the original spec was delete from the dev docs, because it was obsolete. I worked on them while I was at Moodle HQ, in the first half of 2009. Nico also helped. Then I went back to the OU, passing the baton to Sam Hemelryk, who had recently started at Moodle. (What a baptism of fire!) Later, towards the end of 2009, Petr Skoda had a big hand in improving the concept, particularly at the themes end of the system. See https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=140089 . David Mudrak was also important, becuase in rewriting the Workshop module he was one of the early adopters of renderers, which helped shape and validate the design. So, those are the people who deserve the praise/blame for renderers.",

          "Text": "Hi Tim and Fred, thanks for the feedback. I really would like to discuss this idea of renderables for everything. I apologise in advance, this is going to be long. Perhaps the integrator in me coming out to describe fully what I want to convey. As Fred mentioned at the start of his post, prototype B is appealing in that the \"magic\" lies documentation and understanding, the actual code is simple and familiar. But there are hurdles for it. Prototype A is object heavy, really too object heavy. But it tries to solve a couple of the hurdles faced by prototype B. I wrote that approach and even I am not a fan of it, but it does the following things that I think are important and from it I've forms the following impression of the situation. ** disclaimer , I am discussing ideas, not specific elements. Please DO NOT tell me that element A should not be an element, I am not discussing what should and shouldn't be, but how generic things should and shouldn't be. Sad faces for anyone who chimes in to tell me that a search component is silly. When within a render method and a renderable \"property\" (coming from anywhere) is encountered the render method calls render on it. It never renderers it itself unless it is absolutely necessary. Why. Because when in my theme I override the render_button method I want to see it take effect on every button used in every component, and then if I need to change how a button looks for a component I want to target that component explicitly, overriding how it produces the button (more on that shortly). If you have a search component, and you've styled how buttons look in your theme of course you want the button in the component to inherit initially from your \"standard\" button. This implies the following: a. the button must be a renderable, in turn as button is just an example, anything you can design must be a renderable. It assumes: b. we want to re-use our design to achieve consistency. Starting at the smallest element we want to design up, if you've a component that needs an element to look unique the component has to do the work, and I would expect justify why it is unique (another sad face for the first person to say \"but that doesn't fit with bootstrap\") When rendering an element output context (not to be confused with Moodle contexts) should be given to provide background and flexibility on what is being rendered. I think this is a real devil, its very tempting when rendering a component that contains a button onto which you must set attributes that the component render method creates the HTML for the button with the requires HTML attributes. If you consider point 1 above a rule, then this approach would break it. By having the component render method produce the button your button no longer inherits the button design of the theme. It is not consistent through the render chain. To allow for this we give the render method context of what is being rendered. When rendering an element by itself there is no context given, when rendering the same element within a component the component gets indicated to the render method. That sounds a bit convoluted, and I myself misinterpreted the design of this in prototype A. This is how I achieved it in prototype A. There I introduced an output chain. When you called render on a component a \"prerender\" method was called, that populated a heirarchy for the component, so that each element contained within the component knew who it belonged to. That hierarchy was then used when render was called, the magic render method we already did looked for additional render methods that may or may not exist within the render chain. Using the menu as an example: Their is a menu component The menu component contains elements Menu > Element[] If you had a link that contained a button the following render methods would be looked for. render_link_button render_button (this you should have anyway, if element is a button this is render_button) Within core/a plugin you could define the first method if you had specific needs that were not already being met by the default method such as attributes. When overriding the renderer in a theme methods would be looked for in the following order. theme renderer :: render_menu_element theme renderer :: render_element core renderer :: render_menu_element core renderer :: render_element So you can see how defaults are respected here. When the theme says \"this is how an element looks\" that is the default that is then applied to the element in all of its output contexts. Worth mentioning is that I don't think that I got the approach quite correct in Prototype A. I've used the component in the method name to provide context, however thats not the complete context. The complete context would be to include the purpose the element serves as well somehow. So in the case of a complex component where more than one element of the same type were used for different things they would be distinguishable. It is already complex enough as it is of course. Components can impose properties onto elements that belong to them. This comes about again so that we adhere to point 1. We call render on everything. In point 2 you can see how render methods allow for output customisation to occur, the default is preferred for consistency but you can take control if you want. Point 2 however is very much limited to output. You can add attributes, change HTML etc. However there is also this notion of properties. Properties describe something about an element in relation to the component it is used within/ A great example of this is that a menu node can be active, to describe the element in the menu as relating to the page the user is looking at. The element in the menu could be a number of different elements (link, button, search component etc) and this property should apply to all of them. However it only applied when those elements are used within this component. It's super duper important to differentiate active as a property from say a CSS class \".active\". .active is how the active property may be described. But that won't apply to all frontend designs. Some designs may want to use a different class, or another attribute, or even a different tag. Prototype A facilitates this on the core_ui_element class, in which methods exist for adding, and setting properties. There is a finite number of elements and components This doesn't really fit as a rule, but I think its extremely important to mention. Don't get the idea into your head that you will be writing elements. You won't be. Elements are the basic building blocks they will be defined within core and they will change rarely. Written once, used often. Don't get the idea into your head that you will have to write components often. You won't. Components should be reusable. They should not be specific to what you are creating unless what you are creating is truly absolutely unique and new. We want to be able to create 99% of our interfaces with the elements and components in core. Even then you will need to write one component, maybe a couple if you're determined to make themers lives hard again. Tim I think I can hear you arguing this already. But really I don't believe it will happen but once in a blue moon. Those points I consider to be important. It's very important to note one other thing. All of this magic in regards to which method gets used, I think these rules only apply core/plugins. Themes, I would like to think that themes can do what they want. This approach is about building a consistent system that they can use, and that favours minimal work as I see it in themes. If they choose to override the render_menu and render absolutely everything in there I think that is entirely acceptable. It is still up to the themer to craft the end result that they are looking for in the way they want. But hopefully this magic provides them a way to do it easily, making the page easy to restyle. I am sure that with strict rules and proper understanding we can apply these to prototype B. We can require people to always call the render method, we can invent a way to publish theme defaults methods past the core more exclusive methods, and we can continue to employ dark magic (dom manipulation, I really dislike this, I wish there was a better solution). Obviously we've got to make a decision, the decision we make is what we will live with. There is more unknown with the OO approach, and for sure it is complex. But I don't think it should be dismissed lightly. I've tried to simplify the approach a bit and have come up with these two alternatives: https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle/compare/output_prototype_2 This again takes the OO approach but tries to simplify the classes and method chain, making them more simplistic and perhaps more appealing. https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle/compare/output_prototype_3 This takes output_prototype_2 one step further and simplifies the renderers, not sure this is a great approach but it feels more comfortable. Truthfully I think we loose a little of the noted advantages with this approach. Ok enough for now. Please please please give the OO approach some thought and let me know. I myself an not sold on it, but I think we are dismissing it to lightly. Cheers Sam Edit: We'll utilise MDL-45885 to discuss and document the fine details once this conversation on approach matures.",

          "Text": "Thanks Sam, While I like the simplicity of approach B - I do not think the DOM manipulation is simple/scalable. Imagine a list with 1000 items - parsing the entire dom of the list to add an attribute to the top level node is wasteful. Neither do I think it can be solved with regexes or any other \"quick fix\" - I think it's doomed to fail. I also thing that approach A was too complex. There was a lot of hidden detail in that branch, that I could not follow from reading the code alone. Freds suggestion does sound good initially - but I agree that if you take that path down the road you will have to overide 20 render methods to change the style of a button consistently. Really I like the further work you did - and the prototype_3 branch seems the closest to a nice solution I have seen. It is relatively simple, but allows parent containers to put some additional \"state\" into the renderables it contains. The method for rendering a (e.g.) button is defined only once - but it is flexible enough to cover the different uses. There are some more fine details to be worked out there, such as the stripping of \"core_ui_\" prefixes or whether we want to use namespaces such as in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-41663 to achieve this. (I don't think I am in favour of stripping the prefixes even if it means long render method names - at least the long names lead to easier finding of the exact method to overwrite - less magic). So - ATM I give my vote to prototype_3 with a bit more finesse-ing.",

          "Text": "(Markdown seems to play tricks on my post, it seems more readable here ) Hi Sam, thanks for your feedback. I have to say that I do not disagree with your approach, I agree with most of it. the only thing that I dislike is the developer that makes assumptions on how things should be displayed. If you have a renderable that is called dropdown_renderable, then it is awkward for a designer to overwrite that to display it differently as the name does not make sense any more. For instance if I do not want a dropdown, but a horizontal list of links, or tabs, ... What I am suggesting is that renderables are containers of information that are not tied to their display. If you look at it from a templating point of view, you would say that the renderables contain the variables to pass to the template, ignoring what the final display would be. This is common to a more stricter MVC model, and I guess we could apply it to Moodle. If the developers hold the logic in the controller, gather from the model the information, and sends the data to the renderers, then themers have full control at the view level. That is what I would like us to achieve, leaving developers away from the design decisions and giving full control to themers. Of course developers will have to make a decision for the view implemented in core, but that does not stop anyone from rendering things differently. We could talk about backwards compatibility too. If at some point we decide to change the layout of a page, we will have to update the controller to change the renderable to something else. As a themer, that means that the renderer I wrote for that renderer is not called in that location any more, and thus it breaks the layout I had in mind. Let me try to explain with examples, and some code. Actions not links How are links supposed to be displayed? Well, commonly, they would be displayed as an anchor tag, with or without an icon. But they could be displayed differently in different locations. They could be real buttons attached to a form, or triggered with JavaScript, they could be just icons, they could be anchors styled as buttons, they are not necessarily links, to me those are actions. By creating a link_renderable, the developers implies that it should be a link. While if you define it as an action_renderable, it is an action and it is displayed differently depending on its location. Code example Let's see how that could look in code, we will create renderables and renderers to display a basic forum post that has a few actions like 'reply' and 'delete'. First we assume that core has an action_renderable, and a standard way to display it. \n```text\n// Renderable.\nclass action_renderable implements renderable {\n    $text = 'Something';\n    $destination = 'http://somewhere';\n    $icon = pixurlObject;\n    $disabled = false;\n    active = false;\n}\n\n// Default renderer.\npublic function render_action(action_renderable $renderable) {\n    $text = $this->render($renderable->icon) . $renderable->text;\n    return html_writer::link($renderable->destination, $text);\n}\n```\n This is the very base, and it follows the different prototypes, now let's define a dropdown menu in core. \n```text\n// Renderable of list of actions.\nclass actions_list_renderable implements renderable {\n    $actions = array of action_renderable;\n}\n\n// Default renderer.\npublic function render_dropdown(actions_list_renderable $actions) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"dropdown\">';\n    $html .= '<ul>';\n    foreach ($actions as $action) {\n        $html .= '<li>' . $this->render($action) . '</li>';\n    }\n    $html .= '</ul>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n As you can see, the renderer for the dropdown menu does not specifically accept a dropdown_renderable, but a list of actions. Now in my module, I would have something like this to output a forum post: \n```text\n// Renderable for a post.\npublic function render_post(myown_renderable $renderable) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"post\">';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"content\">';\n    $html .= $renderable->content;\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"actions\">';\n    $html .= $this->render_dropdown($renderable->actions);\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n If we stop thinking further for the moment, we find the same benefits as for the other prototypes: The designer can overwrite the default look of an action_renderable. The designer can overwrite the default look of a dropdown. The designer can change the look of the post Now let's say that the themer does not want to have a dropdown in the post, they want a horizontal list of links. We have three options here. 1/ They use CSS specific to the module They use CSS, target the specific pages they are interested in, and use the existing markup to layout the dropdown as a list. But there are two issues with this solution: The CSS cannot be easily re-used throughout Moodle for other dropdowns that they want to see as lists. The existing markup might not fit their styling needs (lack of divs, classes, ...). 2/ There is a core renderer for horizontal list of actions. The designer will overwrite the default implementation of render_post, and call the render_horizontal_list_of_actions. \n```text\n// Renderable for a post.\npublic function render_post(myown_renderable $renderable) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"post\">';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"content\">';\n    $html .= $renderable->content;\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"actions\">';\n    $html .= $this->render_horizontal_list_of_actions($renderable->actions);\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n 3/ Core does not provide such a method. And so they create their own and overwrite the default render_post() renderer. \n```text\n// Renderer for a horizontal list.\npublic function render_horizontal_list_of_actions(actions_list_renderable $actions) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"dropdown\">';\n    $html .= '<ul>';\n    foreach ($actions as $action) {\n        $html .= '<li>' . $this->render($action) . '</li>';\n    }\n    $html .= '</ul>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n\n// Renderable for a post.\npublic function render_post(myown_renderable $renderable) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"post\">';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"content\">';\n    $html .= $renderable->content;\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '<div class=\"actions\">';\n    $html .= $this->render_horizontal_list_of_actions($renderable->actions);\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n Solution #2 is the easiest, and surely the encouraged one, but the solution #3 is a good enough alternative because it creates a re-usable component. It also means that if later on we update core not to display a dropdown but something else, my own design will not be affected as the renderable I am getting is identical. Adapting to other frameworks Now, if we think of the adaptation to other frameworks, and the need to change the dom structure and add classes and stuff, you will notice that the dropdown_render method is not quite right because it refers to render_action(). So we have to provide a way for designers to change the look of an action within the context of the dropdown. We have two solutions here: 1/ Specifically create a new render_action_in_dropdown() \n```text\npublic function render_action_in_dropdown(action_renderable $renderable) {\n    $text = $this->render($renderable->icon . $renderable->text);\n    return html_writer::link($renderable->destination, $text);\n}\n\npublic function render_dropdown(actions_list_renderable $actions) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"dropdown\">';\n    $html .= '<ul>';\n    foreach ($actions as $action) {\n        $html .= '<li>' . $this->render_action_in_dropdown($action) . '</li>';\n    }\n    $html .= '</ul>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n 2/ The display-context is passed to render() We could define more specific renderers attached to a display-context (or components), and have something like: \n```text\npublic function render_dropdown_action(action_renderable $renderable) {\n    $text = $this->render($renderable->icon . $renderable->text);\n    return html_writer::link($renderable->destination, $text);\n}\n\npublic function render_dropdown(actions_list_renderable $actions) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"dropdown\">';\n    $html .= '<ul>';\n    foreach ($actions as $action) {\n        $html .= '<li>' . $this->render($action, $context = 'dropdown') . '</li>';\n    }\n    $html .= '</ul>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n The render method would be smart enough to first check for the existence of a render method called render_dropdown_action , and if it does not exist refer to the default one, render_action . Of course, the context should be well defined and only used within the same context. It would unacceptable from render_dropdown() to call render($action, $context = 'tabs'). Maybe there is a magical way to guess the context we are in from the render() method without having to pass an argument. Complex list of actions In some dropdowns (see Bootstrap 3), you can include dividers, and headers. So we have to think about more complex list of actions that can contain not only action_renderable, but also divider_renderable and header_renderable. Let's try. \n```text\n// PHP logic.\n$actions = array(\n    new header_renderable('Some pages'),\n    new action_renderable('http://', 'Page 1', $icon),\n    new divider_renderable(),\n    new action_renderable('http://', 'Page 2', $icon),\n    new action_renderable('http://', 'Page 3', $icon),\n    new divider_renderable(),\n    new action_renderable('http://', 'Page 4', $icon),\n);\n$list = new actions_list_renderable($actions);\n$post = new myown_renderable($foo, $actions);\necho $OUTPUT->render($post);\n\n// Renderer for dropdown dividers.\npublic function render_dropdown_divider(divider_renderable $renderable) {\n    return '<div class=\"divider\"></div>';\n}\n\n// Renderer for dropdown headers.\npublic function render_dropdown_header(header_renderable $renderable) {\n    return '<div class=\"header\">' . $renderable->text . '</div>';\n}\n\n// Renderer for dropdowns.\npublic function render_dropdown(actions_list_renderable $actions) {\n    $html = '<div class=\"dropdown\">';\n    $html .= '<ul>';\n    foreach ($actions as $action) {\n        $html .= '<li>' . $this->render($action, $context = 'dropdown') . '</li>';\n    }\n    $html .= '</ul>';\n    $html .= '</div>';\n    return $html;\n}\n```\n Being able to pass/guess the context from the render method is really helful here, because we can automatically match the different types of objects contained in the actions_list_renderable. And if core were not to provide a renderer for headers in dropdown, I could add it to my theme renderers when I adapt it to Boostrap 3 for instance. Ideas of renderables action_renderable: An action, represented as a link, a button, etc... actions_list_renderable: A list of actions, rendererd as a dropdown, tabs, list of links, ... user_renderable: Rendered as picture, picture + name, name post_renderable: For comments, blogs, or forum posts. (time, author, content, actions) block_renderable: For any kind of block of content that contains a header, content and footer (blocks, course sections , forum discussion page) I am not really in favour of layout renderables (2 vertical columns, grid, etc...) because essentially the output should always be defined from a renderer, and I can overwrite that renderer to change 2-columns to 2-rows if I want. I do not see any benefit for a designer to change a 2-column component to 2-rows site-wide. Food for thoughts While writing this list, it came in my mind that maybe we would want to introduce a collection_renderable, that contains a list of objects, and call render on them with the 'collection' context, leading to: render_collection_user render_collection_block Javascript I did not look at all at the Javascript in your patches, but if the renderable is a container of information, without a context, you could simply extract its data, json'd it, and pass it to Javascript. Maybe it could also be easy to create handlebars templates from PHP by having ->render() to replace the final variables with {{ context:placeholder }} or something. I don't know, I haven't thought about this really. Plugin renderers For core and non-core, plugins should always define a renderer, even if it does not contain anything. Then they should always get their own renderer rather than $OUTPUT. If their renderer is empty it will fully rely on core, which is fine, but at least themers can override the output of a specific plugin if they need to. Final thoughts Briefly looking at your patch, I would be concerned about the difficulty for designers to understand the PHP logic when dealing with core_ui stuff. Calling add_class() or is() is fine for developers but not so much for designers. Though, I give you that it is a lot simpler than the existing renderers we have. Also, I saw somewhere that we would have to deal with cloning objects to prevent random behaviours when modifying their values, I am definitely sure that designers should never ever have to think about that. You and Damyon have done a great work on this already, and I am coming once the spec is already well written, and I apologize for that. I am surely missing some cases in the ideas developed above, but hopefully there is something to get out of it. Thanks!\nFred",

So, just like we make UI mock-ups in the tracker to quickly make it clear what were are talking about when designing a new bit of Moodle functionality, we need something similar here. API are the 'user-interface' that third-party developers user to interact with Moodle, and it should be possible to present a quick sketch of the key things like: I am making a plugin, and I want to output a user picture. I am a themed and I want to change how the user picture is displayed. I am making a plugin, and I want to define a new thing like a forum post that can be displayed. Sure, there also needs to be a lot of clever back-end code to make what is shown in the mock-ups work, but that is an implementation detail, and only a few people need to understand that. Many people will need to work with the public face of this in future, so that is why it is worth showing small snippets that mock-up how that will look.",

          "Text": "Let me try to summarise (in a short post ) some of the things that have been said about one of the key issues: Should we pass 'real' objects to renderers, or specially made renderables objects that only contain the information needed for output? As Damyon/Sam said in the spec : \"... This means that the renderable class [a real object] can be a mixture of data and methods that perform logic associated with the module. This also means that the renderer can call those methods on the renderable class - effectively using the API of the module.\" Certainly, calling a method on an object that has been passed into the renderer is one of the more subtle ways to sneak logic into a renderer, and that is bad. However, I think the general assumption in Moodle is that developers are non-malicious. If you want people not to do something, then it is normally enough to just ask them nicely (in the coding guidelines) and then check it in peer review and integration review. After all, any developer could add a call to undefined_function() in there renderer and crash Moodle. That is far worse than sneaking logic into a renderer, but it does not happen and we don't try to prevent it. (Of course, logic in renderers does happen ) However, there are plenty of methods on objects that would be fine to call in a renderer. The best example I can think of is the context object, and the methods $context-> get_context_name() an d $context-> get_url(). Those would be completely fine to call in a renderer. So, I think this line of code is fine . (However, a lot of the other code in that renderer does not belong there!) An advantage of using methods like this is that it means we do not compute something (e.g. the URL or the context name) unless we actually need it. This is like lazy evaluation, and is good. It is like the LISP/Scheme notion of a 'thunk' . In PHP a logically side-effect-free method of an object (which you can hide behind a PHP magic method if you like) is the simplest way to achieve this. The other key point is Fred's , that using real objects give more flexibility to themes. For example don't have separate link and button renderables. The concept here is an action, so the element should be an action, and it is up to the theme whether it should be a link or a button. (Of course, the action needs enough meta-data, such as whether it is a GET or POST request, to help the theme render it appropriately.) Another good example would be user picture. Sadly, we don't (yet) have a a real user object in Moodle. Perhaps we should, in the same way that $context stdClasses were converted to be real context classes. When a forum wants to output the information about who made the post, as part of rendering that post, then the current way is to call the user_picture renderer. However, what it really wants is to display information about the user in a particular amount of space. It would be more flexible if the theme could decide how to do that. The default is the picture with the name beside it, but why should the theme be limited to that? (Of course, for consistency, a theme would want to change how users are shown everywhere, not just in forum posts, if it was changing this.) Oh dear, I seem to have failed to do what I promised. This post is not short, and I spent more time giving my own opinions than summarising what others said. Since this is already long, let me finish with one anecdote about passing limited data to templates. One time I wanted to modify the output of CVSweb. The screen I wanted to customise was the one that showed the diff between two versions of the file. It showed useful information about one of the files, but not the other. I wanted to add the missing information. CVSweb uses templates, but it just passes to the template the values it thinks it needs. So, more like the renderable idea than the real object idea. Since it did not pass the two file objects to the template, the only way to get the information I needed was to change the code that called the template, as well as the template itself. Hence, there was no benefit to this system using templates. I hope we do better.",

Static variables are bad for this, because this should be tracked per-page, and we have a class page_requirements_manager designed for tracking this sort of thing. I just made a patch that shows one way it could be cleaned up. See MDL-46031 for details. Let me know if that seems like a viable approach.

Not all atoms will be reflected by classes. Done for simplicity in renderers, only atoms with more requirements greater than fixed HTML will have classes. All molecules and organisms will have classes, and all implementations of a molecule or organism will extend the base molecule or organism class. Relies upon MDL-41663 which essentially adds support for an Output API when autoloading. Output classes will be namespaced as either \\core\\output\\xxx or \\plugintype_pluginname\\output\\xxx Base classes element , atom , molecule , and organism are located in lib/classes/output/xxx.php and namespaced as above for autoloading. Organisation and implementation Core components being created will be required to use the new elements. Plugin developers will be encouraged but not required to use the new elements. We will have a guide to writing elements We will have a best practices guide for renderers - in draft now, see this section of the above guide for some of what that will contain. We will have a CSS style guide - in draft now. We will decide upon the list of elements we'll have initially in core. Write the \"core\" elements and their associated tests+generators. Likely convert an entire component to use the new renderables, likely changing its interface. Likely convert an entire plugin, likely changing its interface. Conversion of Moodle core will be an ongoing process and we will encourage developers to use this method as we originally did encourage developers to use renderers. This is the next step. The proposal Shows how element will be written, where they will be located, and how they should be rendered. Has a local_output plugin (local/output) that contains classes and a renderer to reflect cleanly how this will look. Obviously the actual implementation will not be done in a local plugin it will be done in core, but as that would lead to messy diffs I did it this way and I believe it will be easier to understand the nature of the proposal. Consists of 8 commits now, each with a notable purpose and each with a short commit message to explain its purpose. The commits: Added YUI module: required only for the PureIO theme Required core changes other than to core_renderer Create basic local_output plugin Add an element class Added atom, molecule, and organism abstract classes Added action, link, button and text atoms Added menu, and dropdown menu display Added themes to show how this looks when you override the renderers What I think of this approach It is a step forward for output, it is not the perfect means of producing output. I don't believe the perfect approach to producing output in Moodle is possible presently as it would require more time, effort and planning than we can afford.\nThis however takes us in the right direction.\nWe introduce a more rigid method of producing output, and document it with guides and best practices.\nIt will continue to evolve along this narrower path and both with the aid of and within the constrain of the API we continue to let it do so.\nIt will be required in core to use this for new interfaces, existing interfaces can be improved as time and effort permits.\nFor plugin developers we encourage and shout the benefits of this system, they are not required to use it but hopefully the advantages will.\nThe actual benefits can be summarised as for developers it will be less design, for designers it will be less development and design.\nThere will be more code initially but as custom interfaces are replaced with reusable elements we will end up with less code as well.",

          "Text": "Yay! sam. That is much more digestable. It will still take some time to digest. Some initial questions spring to my mind, which hopefully I will be able to answer myself when I have read and thought about it more: Initial thoughts Are three levels (atom, molecule, organism) always enough? (I guess they are for other proponents of Atomic design.) What benefit do we get from the atom, molecule, organism base classes? (I am guessing it just serves a documentation function.) Why does the element base class have public get/set_attribute & add_class methods? I though we wanted to move away from developers putting hard-coded classes on thigns, since that goes against the point of elements making things easy to style. Similarly, it is worrying to see button and link as example atoms. action is a good atom. It is a conceptual thing: Somethign you click to do something. Whether that is output is HTML as <input type=\"button\" ...> or <a href=\"...\"> is exactly the sort of thing that the renderer should be deciding, not the developer. Oh dear, I had thought I was resigned to the way MDL-41663 was going, but now I am concerned again. Are we sure we have the right proposal there. There will be many elemnts in core/classes/output and mod/quiz/output Are we sure we don't want more hierarchy like mod/quiz/renderers, mod/quiz/atoms, mod/quiz/molecules, etc? At any rate, I would hold off on the details of MDL-41663 until this proposal is further along. I don't think that matters. We don't want people renaming their renderers and renderables until they move directly to elements. I really need to go to the supermarket now. I will continue reading later. Where renderables came from Incidentally, I did recently re-discover why we have renderabels in the first place. Have a look at MDL-46030 , which I am still working on. Specifically the new renderer method: https://github.com/timhunt/moodle/commit/b9a5d388f6ad93806298d91bdebbe384b7f71571#diff-7999b363de96d73a6c618bc44614e547R67 . That is a pretty bad renderer method. There are about 30 lines that aer mostly logic, just getting the right attributes that will be required to make the JavaScript work. Clearly it should not be there in the renderer method (becuase that will be a pain for a theme wanting to override it.) On the other hand, we should not move that code into the place that calls the renderer, becuase that would be horrible duplication. FOr someone who wants to print a 'Create new question' button (or link), the call to ask the renderer to output that should be as simple as possible. Hence, you need a third place to put that code, and that is the renderable object. The person who wants to output a 'Create new question' button (or link) creates a rendererble for that, jsut passing in the key values. Then the renderable object can compute all the technical stuff. Then the renderer can easily get that technical stuff to put in the HTML. I think the original example where this was worked out was user_picture. Where renderables are going Just to say tha now renderables are being reinvented as elements, which makes them a more conceptual thing, rather than just being an implementation detail to get logic out of renderer methods. This is probably a good thing, but it requires care.",

          "Text": "Thinking about this cycling home, I realised that as currently implemented, renderer classes have to serve two duties, and I am wondering if this causes problems. What I mean is, on one hand renderer provide an API for the plugin developer do display things: e.g. \n```text\necho $OUTPUT->user_picture(...);\necho $myrenderer->widget(...);\n```\n On the other hand, they define the methods that themes can override to change how things are displayed, e.g. \n```text\nclass theme_mytheme_core_renderer extends core_renderer {\n    protected function render_user_picture(...) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n This does not seem to cause huge problems, but it does mean that the class that themes override is more complex than it needs to be. Then, it occurred to me that it is conceivable to change this without breaking too much backwards compatibility. Obviously the thing that themes have to override must continue to be called ..._renderer, since it is referred to directly by name as in 'theme_mytheme_core_renderer extends core_renderer'. However, the $OUTPUT or $myrenderer objects that developers use to do output are obtained by a call to $PAGE->get_renderer. That could return an object of any class, we could call it something like core_output, or type_myplugin_output. Then, the ..._output class would have receive API calls form the developer doing output, and translate them into calls to the ..._renderer object that themers override to do the output. If the ..._output class does not exists, then the $PAGE->get_renderer call could just return a ..._renderer object as at present, hence almost completely backwards compatible. (The only compatibility breakage I can see is when the return from $PAGE->get_renderer is passed to a function that has a type hind on that parameter, which names a specific class.) I have no idea whether done this is a good idea or not. But it is possible. It replaces one complex class with two responsibilities with two simpler classes. But that requires more different classes for people to understand and implement. Update: I just got to this bit of your prototype: https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle/commit/ad10639cf68e5e03ae53cdcde90de872da688298#diff-cccc22b53bd9bed7ec9f8106dff13222R109 .

Actually, I have been thinking about this off and on from when you first asked for comments on this spec, and I really did not like the though of 'everything is a renderable', because that seemed to require many classes. If you want an example, here is a recent thing: https://github.com/timhunt/moodle/commit/554e3bf53b689cee16320971ca6b1ac71e582675#diff-8ccc4cc7f10e952926d0e945446e82f4L740 It is the kind of renderer method which takes many arguments, not just one renderable object, and I needed to change one of the arguments, which I was able to do in a mostly backwards compatible way, but only by adding logic if (is_string($preflightcheckform)) { in the renderer. (Slap wrist!) We know that APIs with many arguments make it a pain to change the API when necessary, although PHP default parameter values make it possible more often than not. However, it does mean that when the API changes, it is pretty obvious what is going on. The parameter list changes. That is clear to see. Now contrast that to the \n```text\npublic function render_widget(widget_renderable $thing) {\n```\n case. In this situation, the API will never change. What will change is the set of fields available on the $thing object. However, that does not prevent things breaking if a field is added or removed. And, the breakage could be quite subtle. Will it be obvious what has broken and why? It is not as clear as a changed parameter list. (As I say, I got this far trying to work out why I thought making everything a renderable object was and. However, it turned out I was wrong ...) BUT ... we are very good in Moodle, when we add or remove a field or a method from an object, about handling the deprecation. That is, we will leave the old method in place @deprecated, and with some debugging() output to explain how to upgrade the calling code. Similarly for fields we can do __get magic to make the change explicable. So, actually, having renderable objects for everything is better for forwards/backwards compatibility.

(Actually, I am lying - but that is a minor detail. It does not invalidate my point about what the ideal is.) This gives a complete separation between the output code and the logic. (Between the V and the C in MVC, if you like.) However, this is just a theoretical advantage. The practical advantage is that it gives the theme complete control over that page, if the theme wants it. In terms of the atomic design language you are using, this is the template or page level. Ah! I need to read what you are actually saying, not what I think you are saying. You are saying that in Moodle, the first three levels, atoms, molecules, and organisms will be represented by Elements, that is PHP classes. You are not saying that we won't have renderer methods like this. Just that they won't be classes. That makes sense. We hope that elements are re-usable, where as the quiz attempt page is only output in one place, here, so we need not define a class. Is that what you are saying? I don't want to put words into your mouth. And, for one page, https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/mod/quiz/view.php#L247 , it turned out to be so bloody complicated that I ended up with a bloody horribly class to hold all the data that was needed: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/mod/quiz/renderer.php#L1188 . Should that class be an element/renderable? (Or should it just be taken out and shot?) If course there is no need to display pages in the element library. If you want to see what a page looks like in your theme, just go there. (Of course, it might be nice if the element library, where it lists all the elements specific to each plugin, like mod_forum:post, or mod_quiz:nav-block, could also have a list of all the pages in that module. Sort-of like http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Quiz_user_interface_overview , but less graphics and more list-y. Summary ( Since this thread seems to incite long posts .) Should each script in Moodle only have one output line at the end: echo $output->xxx_page(...); Is this consistent with adopting atomic_design in Moodle? Are these pages handled like other elements, or something else? I think Yes, Yes, and something else / I don't know. I am hoping that you agree with me on 1. and 2. and will be putting 1. in your best practice documentation. I hope you are way ahead of me on 3. and have a good idea about how this should work.",

          "Text": "Aside As I just said, it seems to be a rule that posts in this thread are excessively long and rambly. Clearly I was worried this one might come out too short, so here is a mostly irrelevant aside to pad it out As I see it, there are three roles a developer might take which are affected by this proposal, and only one of them is easy to give a name to. There are the theme designers . This proposal should make things a lot easier for them, and looking at the corresponding thread to this one in the themes forum , they agree. There are the developers adding a new feature to Moodle, whether in a plugin or Moodle core . They are the people who will have to create the renderers that theme designers will be able to override, and to define new custom elements, where absolutely necessary. (E.g. mod_forum:post makes sense an element - I guess that would be an organism?) As you can see, this is the role I can't think of a good name for, and I bring it up because they are the people I want to write about in this post, once I get to the point. There are the theme system implementors , who have to build all the infrastructure that makes the whole system works. Actually, this role has a name at the moment, or rather two: Sam and Damyon That is something of a point. There (we hope) many theme designers, and Moodle add-on developers. There are very few people who work on the core of the system. Therefore, if we have to make a trade-off that makes life simpler for everyone else, but more complex for the theme system implementors, then they will just have to suck it up. Fortunately, I think they are likely to be able to handle whatever is thrown at them (metaphorically only!). Of course, we hope that the core of the system comes out looking really elegant and simple, since that is easiest to maintain. However, if that is achieved, the I am sure that it will be one of those things that only looks elegant and simple with hind-sight, because people sweated over it for hours. (Is this post long and rambly enough yet?) To get to the point My concern is for people who implement Moodle features (2. above). I don't yet get what they will have to do, and since I am quiz module maintainer, that is a question close to my heart. I think I understand the concept. To display the quiz info page (view.php), I am supposed to do that by outputting a bunch of standard (or custom if necessary) elements. Well, I think the code is already pretty close to that: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/e20392edc002ad70f5230f573d3ccc01f12bdfb5/mod/quiz/renderer.php#L695 (That is not perfect in various ways I won't go into here. If you don't like that one, look at attempt_page, summary_page, review_page, etc in the same file.) Then, those large-scale elements (organisms) that make up the page are meant to be output as smaller elements, molecules or atoms. Well, again, https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/e20392edc002ad70f5230f573d3ccc01f12bdfb5/mod/quiz/renderer.php#L711- I think I already deserve at least some marks for effort there. OK, so how will that look in the brave new world of the Element library? Well, I am afraid it looks pretty ugly to me. Going through the prototype to try to find comparable code I get to: https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle/blob/ad10639cf68e5e03ae53cdcde90de872da688298/local/output/classes/output/renderer.php#L73 - that method and the three that come after it. I am really, really hoping that I am misunderstanding the prototype. Please can you make some nicer examples (In my experience of doing various sorts of development, which includes Java Swing, Borland builder C++, and Moodle 1.6, output code almost always ends up looking bloody ugly. The current Moodle 2.0 style is actually not too bad.) Note, it is not just add-on developers who have to do this sort of thing. Theme designers who want to override renderers (e.g. to change which elements appear on the quiz view page) will have to write code like this. Summary Please make some nice examples, to sell to us Moodle feature developers how wonderful life will be when we have the element library available to build our UIs. (Pseudo-code will do, and please feel free to use examples from the current quiz renderer as a basis of the examples.) Thanks.",

          "Text": "I've just read the latest version of the Element HTML and CSS guidelines and here's my current thoughts: The very first thing to mention is that all classes in Moodle must now\nbe prefixed by *m-*.\nThis instantly identifes a class as belonging to Moodle, it aids us in\navoiding conflicts with any non-Moodle css that may be loaded, and it is\npart of our framework agnostic plan. that truly seems like a good deal of overkill to me.  If we do a good job of creating grid renderers then this sholdn't be an issue.  I don't know, outside of a framework, how much non-moodle CSS there is in Moodle.  Namespacing makes sense for JS and for PHP, but this is the first time I've heard of it for CSS. We need to adopt a single grid framework.  Personally I don't think we should use pure bootstrap or pure\nYUI, instead we should choose one of these and build it use our class\nname structures. I don't think we should reinvent the wheel again.  a DIY grid is NOT the same as framework agnostic.  A good example of how this could/should be done in core_renderer() exists in course/management_renderer() https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/course/classes/management_renderer.php#L875-L960 which includes YUI PURE and BS2 CSS output.  it could easily be modified by a theme using a different framework by overwriting the functions or extended to include BS3 like this: https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/blob/master/renderers/course_management.php#L29-L58 then, as far as core and plugins is concerned its truly agnostic. It is possible in Moodle to add CSS stylesheets to all plugins (including core plugins). Moodle always looks for a styles.css file within your plugins\ndirectory, and it also looks for a styles_themename.css where themename\nis the name of the currect theme being used. For instance the following could be added to the forum module: mod/forum/styles.css: Used all the time. mod/forum/styles_base.css : Used when the user is using the base theme. mod/forum/styles_bootstrapbase.css : Used when the user is using the bootstrapbase theme. mod/forum/styles_clean.css : Used when the user is using the clean theme I'm sorry, but this frankly sounds like a terrible idea- but I'll assume I don't understand something. First, I hope that the proposal is ONLY these 3 extra sheets and not creating a separate sheet for every conceivable theme out there.  What happens when someone's using the \"More\" theme?  instead of the necessary enahncements for bootstrapbase or clean being included they get nothing? Second, I don't suppose that plugin developers are keen to test and maintain their plugins in multiple themes. Third, if a plugin is developed using the new output methodology then the base styles for the elements and molecules should be included in the theme inheritly.  And if a theme is not, then styles.css should suffice. Fourth, for an end user trying to track down the source of a display bug they get bounced back and forth now from the theme developer to the plugin developer. Fifth, and finally, why hold plugins to a different standard than core plugins?  Especially if they're going to be distributed via the plugins database.  If you're developing for yourself, yeah, do whatever you want.  But if you want it in the plugins DB it needs to follow the core guidelines.  This also facilitates the adoption of plugins into (and out of) core.  Otherwise for a plugin to be included it might need to be entirely refactored from a CSS perspective. Aside from all of that I think we're generally headed in the right direction Looking at the breadth of this proposal and the amount of refactoring that needs to happen (every single renderer, and every single that that still hasn't been converted to a renderer *cough* /login/ *cough*) how long are we looking at having mixed soup?  2.13, 2.14?  When will the core elements be ready for plugin developers? 2.9?",

This file is sent to the browser with headers that say \"You can cache this forever\". Therefore, when you visit a different page, you don't need to download any more CSS. Now, if you downloaded the HTML of ever page in your Moodle site, and used this too, then you might find 5% or 10% of the CSS that is not used, and it would be worth removing that.

Re-using renderables for JS - right now we have 2 completely separate theme systems in moodle - anything created by JS is either not themeable, or is accepting a massive pre-rendered, escaped string as an argument. Both approaches suck. Defining a renderer is complicated and based on strict rules rather than something that is natural to implement. This is the nature of OO I think - but I think maybe we should step back and try something else (I am thinking of using mustache for php/js templates, and replacing render methods completely). No improvement on the adhoc approach to defining DOM hooks that JS can attach to (we say to use ID's for this - but this is not always the best way and we don't do it consistently). We are constantly creating things that can only exist one time on a page because of the use of IDs. YUI - if we are making huge changes to the JS templates etc - it does not make sense any more to do it in YUI. We need to propose and move forward with something else (I'm not going to expand on this in this thread for fear of hijacking it). Because once we add all this foundation work, there will be a huge task in updating existing code to use the new system - we only want to do this once - and it makes sense to hold of on implementing anything until we are sure it meets all our needs. I have not spent much time on this recently but it's still on my (and Martins) radar. We are still planning what dev issues get prioritised for the next release - hopefully we get the time to do this properly.",

One remark to support the mustache template approach - I have been using js/php mustache templates in some themes and to me as I am more a designer than a developer it is much more \"natural\" to create the repeating page parts in HTML in a template than to write a renderer which then outputs the HTML. When I work with templates I work somehow directly with the output which means I have less abstraction layers and can concentrate more on the details of the HTML page part. From my work experience the mustache approach is quite successful. When I am working on PHP code I detected several times that writing renderers fits better into the workflow than switching between HTML and PHP all the time. So I understand that developers prefer the renderer approach. And I think working with renderers is much more consequent than echoing HTML strings mixed with PHP variables. While I write this comment I understand that the \"clean\" approaches are renderers or templates - not mixing HTML and PHP. Unfortunately few people in the Moodle field understand the advantage of front-end work with less abstraction - hopefully the mustache approach will be successful for MoodleHQ.",

However, there are some inaccuracies in your post: In a PHP application, HTML will always involve a method call, even if the method is called reder_template(...). Templates add an extra layer. OK, that is a bit pedantic. Slighly less pedantic It is a fiction to say that templates are devoid of logic. Many templates will contain looks (e.g. forum thread, or any report). Also, many templates will have to contain if statements (e.g. displaying questions with or without feedback, depending on which options the teacher set). It is correct to minimise logic in renderes, and to only have simple display logic there, and many of the Moodle renderers already do that. It is correct that the syntactic constraints of using a templating system make it easier to separate things properly, but it is still perfectly possible to make a bloody mess with complex logic in the templates. It is not a magic bullet. All that said, I hope you can come up with a good way to use templates in Moodle. For me the three requiresments are: The code must look nice, and be easy to implement and maintain for developers creating new plugins and functionality. The code must look nice and be easy to implement and maintain for designers creating Moodle Themes . The templating layer must not hurt performance too much (unless the other gains are big enough to justify it).",

Your statement » if developers actually make the effort to covert their existing output code to whatever the new way of doing things is.« is quite theoretical. Yesterday I tried to change the look of a not core Moodle module - which had been maintained by a person who worked at MoodleHQ - where no styles.css file is used to collect the module CSS but styling is mixed into the code via inline styles. Moodle practices a great deal of laize faire concerning following guides and best practice. So I think changes will be adopted when they are explained and the advantages become clear. It looks as if Moodle development will be confronted with some fundamental changes on the frontend side in the near future - the potential move from YUI to some other JavaScript framework and a new development workflow with the integration of an element library. The change process may be accompanied by explanations and examples about the advantages - that could convince more people to accept the need to change their code.",

So the term »logic less« tries to communicate that there is no data generation logic in the template - only data rendering logic. The process to work with templates is (simplified to focus on the basics): Generate and save logically structured all data/information that will be shown on the page Fill in the structured data into the HTML template This two step process reflects nicely the organizational concept to work with backend and frontend teams. I prefer to think and work in the language in which the page will be rendered in the browser - HTML - when I have my web designer hat on. It is much easier to see all aspects and work on the details. For me it is even easier to fine-tune the page output when the template and the page view in the browser's web inspector look similar.

I think it is nice to be able to focus on the tasks how to get the needed data in an efficient way and how to structure it for later output. That is with the backend developer hat on. If the same person also creates the HTML page this person will change the hat from the backend to the frontend developer hat and create the HTML template for the plugin. 2. The code must look nice and be easy to implement and maintain for designers creating Moodle Themes . Templates are written in HTML with a mix of data placeholders and loop/conditional logic. The skeleton is HTML. It is always nice and easy to work in HTML for web designers 3. The templating layer must not hurt performance too much (unless the other gains are big enough to justify it). Comparing the template rendering process with the renderable/renderer logic used in Moodle now and its several function calls I don't think that working with an optimized template engine will hurt performance more than the actual workflow.",

The JS Framework needs to be in place before we implement this support for templates (because we should write the JS template renderer using the new JS framework). Once the JS Framework is in place we can implement this support for php and js rendering of mustache templates. (There is a prototype here: https://github.com/damyon/moodle/tree/MUSTACHE ). The summary is that the render_thing(thing $thing) method in the renderer is replaced by a thing.mustache template in your components template folder. Some benefits of these templates are: Themers can work directly with these templates (they are HTML - not php). The logic is forced out from the presentation (because mustache intentionally supports only a very limited set of logic operations). The same templates can be rendered by user interfaces written in Javascript or PHP. Fully backwards compatible. Once the template support and the JS framework is in place we need to: * Write lots of docs on how to use the new system to create renderables and templates. * Create the element library tool (this was done previously it just needs updating) * Start building a good set of default renderables to show in the element library",

Here is one example, in the new quiz editing UI in Moodle 2.8: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/mod/quiz/yui/src/quizquestionbank/js/quizquestionbank.js#L130 We have just updated the contents of the question-bank pop-up from an Ajax, call, and that content requires various js_init_calls to work. I could do find a way to do that properly, so I just duplicated all the necessary JS calls inline in my code. Another case, where I just gave up on trying to make it work was in https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-quizaccess_offlinemode . At the moment that is limited to deferred feedback questions, because I could not think of a viable way to reload one question in a page via Ajax. We just don't know what initiation JavaScript each question type might need. Getting to the point What I am wondering is, should we try to define a consistent JavaScript API for Elements. We might have some elements like mod_quiz-question_bank_view, or core_question-question. Perhaps we should say that the main JS module that relates to that Element has the same name, and it implements certain standard functions that you can rely on, like: init() - this will be called after the HTML of the element is in the DOM of the page, and it is safe to initialise the element. destroy() - this will be called just before an element is removed from the page (or is after better) so that the element can clean up any event handlers, etc, that will no longer be necessary. Those may be all we need, or we might find others helpful, like shown/hidden/focus/... I guess we add what we need, when we find we need it. I really don't know if this would be a good or bad idea, which is why I am raising it as a suggestion, so see what other more experienced JS developers think.",

          "Text": "There are actually several ways to do this and it depends what the javascript is that needs to run, and whether this is newly loaded javascript or existing javascript in the page that needs to be aware of the new thing. Some more concrete examples: Case 1: I load my page and on init it sets up event handlers for 3 checkboxes with specific ids. I load a 4th checkbox into the page via and it needs the same event handlers attached. Solution: Use delegated events with a CSS selector that matches any existing or future checkboxes added to the page. Delegated events will automatically work with newly added nodes in the DOM, and will also not care if nodes are removed. Case 2: I load my page and on init I need to do something more complicated with 3 specific elements in the page (maybe I'm enhancing input fields to some sort of auto complete field). I load a 4th element to the page and I need the same JS to run on this new element. Solution: Because this is not about events, we need a more general solution. On page init we can run the JS code for the 3 existing elements - and set up an event listener to respond to a custom event. When we load the 4th element we can manually trigger the new custom event and then the initial JS can be run by the event listener on the new DOM nodes. We do this with MathJax in the help popups. Case 3: This is the most general case. I do not know in advance what JS might be needed (maybe it's from a plugin) I just want to render some new UI piece via AJAX and add it to the page and have any required JS that was generated by the renderer (or template) run automatically. Solution: We can support this with the new system. What it will require is a custom \"ajax\" renderer that collects any generated inline JS calls from the renderer and returns the generated HTML and the generated JS separately. Then the generated JS calls can be inserted into script tags and appended to the page HEAD (must be done after the new DOM elements are added to the page). This can be taken care of by the JS API for rendering. Note - if replacing parts of the UI the event listeners attached to the DOM nodes will automatically be cleaned up by the \".remove()\" function in JQuery (or in YUI \"Y.Node.remove(true);\") This would actually be really useful/powerful for updating parts of the page via ajax without re-rendering the entire page.",

(You are right, custom events are much better than particular methods in a module.) Then, can we also use this for Case 3? If you need a sequence of complex initialisation calls when your elements is added to the page, well, just subscribe the your own element_initialised event, and call the sequence of functions you need to call? (For passing data to JS, I am assuming we will prefer to use data attributes, rather than passing arguments to js_init_call functions like we tend to do now.) (Oh, I suppose a new element may need to make new strings available through M.util.get_string. We need a nice way to handle that, but I am sure we can find one.)",

We trigger it from various places in Moodle (the glossary auto-linker and the atto equation editor) - and any filter can subscribe to it and re-run and JS required for filtered text if they want to support that. This is sort of a standard way to do it - but it's hard to call it a standard when you're the first Re: get_string - case 3 would cover this as the JS to add the new strings would get automatically run. We could also fetch the missing strings on demand via AJAX if they were not present when required - but we haven't done that in the past because we didn't want anyone to get lazy about calling strings_for_js (performance).",

Because: a) The php implementation of mustache is much more robust and compliant to the standard than the handlebars one ( I tested the handlebars one and found it was buggy and incompatible with the JS version ). b) Handlebars is less strict and so allows more logic to leak into the templates. From one of your examples above: {{#get \"posts\" id=\"current-post-id\" include=\"next,prev\"}} This is an example where a developer who is also writing the template can understand it - but someone who knows nothing about the renderer cannot. What are the valid arguments ? How do I pass variables ? What permission checks do I need to add to see the next/prev posts ? If this was in Moodle, next and prev should be pre-calculated public properties of the renderable - not fetched from the template.",

          "Text": "Overall this seems like a very good plan but I do have one potential serious issue that would affect us at the OU, and I know other institutions with very specific requirements do similar things. Basically, in the new templated approach, will it still be possible for themes - or a suitable plugin - to override what happens when a renderer displays something, using PHP code and not only templates? I'm not saying this should be the general approach, absolutely not. But it's really important that there is some way to do this because it's basically the solution of last resort for customising Moodle, and there are quite a lot of things you can't customise any other way without modifying core code, which is always bad for maintenance. To give a simple example, we have logic about who should see the Settings block on certain pages. We can implement this without modifying the Settings block itself, by changing the theme renderer that displays blocks. So if it's displaying the settings block, and if the current page is x, and if the user does not have capability y, then we return blank instead of displaying the block. There are other examples where we want to hide a certain link that is available in Moodle, but there is no way in Moodle settings to get rid of the link. What we do instead is, in the renderer for that part of the page, call the normal renderer then do a regex replace to remove the unwanted link and adjust the HTML as suitable. Again this may well depend on business logic such as the user's capability, or whether editing mode is turned on, or the current course shortname, or whether a particular type of module exists in the current course, or something. In a sense this is not really a 'theme' type of thing, but the theme provides a really powerful mechanism in Moodle for configuring that type of detail, so removing it would be a big concern for us. As you can tell from the two examples I've given, these changes are usually kind of hacky and some of them are prone to break on Moodle upgrades - but it's still far less horrible than if we had to go and hack the core code every time we need a small change like that. So anyhow what I'm wondering is, is there still some way for the theme (or a local plugin or whatever, I don't mind) to override this process at a low level? For example some kind of hook at the point where it would normally do the 'call the templating engine and return the results' bit. If there isn't already, please could one be included? I wouldn't anticipate this hook being used by any core or plugin code, but strictly by third-party sites like ours which need to modify some parts of the default rendered output, based on arbitrary PHP code rather than just a template.

A template and a renderer method will be mostly interchangeable, and the rules for priority will still apply (in decreasing order theme -> theme parents -> plugin -> base). The only edge case to consider is when there is both a template and a renderer method for a theme/plugin - in this case we will choose the template. But - this just means that any existing renderer method overrides will continue working even as we convert core renderers to templates - but the \"nastiness\" of that approach still remains (I understand that it is purely to avoid modifying core). I think it is a good idea to add a new \"hook\" to the render system, so that the theme can manipulate the data before it is passed to the template. This would be pretty easy to add in, and addresses something Tim raised a while ago in relation to templates. Tims concern was that when he used templates in another system (I think they were for mediawiki) the template did not have all the data he needed to do his modification, so he first had to modify the calling code to add a lot more data to the template. If we add a hook (prerender) at this point, we can make it simpler to do these sorts of advanced modifications. This prerender hook could get called for either templates or renderer methods.",

          "Text": "And some more specific info about some changes to the template system design to make it more flexible and practical: Initially I thought it was a good idea to implement templates as a replacement to renderer render methods. But I was wrong, that has too many negative consquences. 1. There have never been restrictions on renderable classes before (only recommendations), so some have logic, complex data types etc. Imposing new strict conditions on renderables would create a lot of refactoring work for everyone. 2. As sam pointed out, sometimes you want to override the HTML, but some times you want to override the data the HTML is using. A more flexible approach is to still have render methods in the renderer, but those methods can choose to call \"render_from_template\" if they want to. They can also choose which template they want to render (e.g. to combine multiple things). There is still a step required to \"flatten\" the data for the template - to help standardise this I added an interface for templateable with a export_for_template function. This function should take the renderables data and return an stdClass containing only strings, ints, bool, float, stdClass and array properties. Note that this is fully backwards compatible. If a theme has overridden the render method, their version will just not call the template. If they want to change the data fed to the template they can override the render method, but not override the template. Or the other way around. And another benefit to the above approach is that it provides a way to pass this data to the javascript for client side rendering. The same export_for_template function can be exposed as a webservice, then (combined with MDL-49163 ) we can load or reload the data for the template at will.",

It's dom structure and theming system is alien to what we have used before. It's accessibility features are only \"good\" not great. In the meantime, what I am proposing is to use AMD \"wrappers\" that still call our old YUI implementations. That way we can write new code in AMD without using YUI directly, and later when we have a good alternative we can replace those wrappers. It would be terrible to have different looking/behaving UI widgets all over this place - so this approach at least keeps things consistent while we start transitioning.",

There was something implemented recently in core Moodle, which had a horribly about of logic in the renderers. I can't remember what now, it might have been the badges renderer, or the category editing UI renderer. Anyway, I am surprised that the integrators let it thought. Let me give a clue: if you refer to $DB in your renderer, you are doing it wrong. Regarding 'A more flexible approach is to still have render methods in the renderer, but those methods can choose to call \"render_from_template\" if they want to.' - that was pretty much the plan for day 1 when the renderer concept was first raised. To get to a more serious question, thinking about the whole element library thing. Some bits of the picture are now clear. We have elements, and generally an element is output by calling a renderer method that calls a template. But ... Ideally, output of larger elements will be made of up smaller elements. E.g. A forum thread is made up of a lot of forum posts. A forum post includes a user picture, and the user's name, and some buttons and links. How does the code for the outer template trigger the generation of the inner elements? And, don't just say {{> pacman }} as in the docs , because you have also just said that the marshal the data required to call a template, you need to go through a renderer method. This also relates to calling templates in JS. The necessary data-marshalling PHP code will not be available there, so how does it really work? Unless it is easy for developers to output elements, no-one will ever user them, and we all want the benefits they bring. Please explain.",

Which would have meant refactoring most of our existing renderables. To the more serious questions (ahem): 1. There are 2 ways (at least). The first is, if all the smaller elements are converted to templates already - the data-marshalling code for the \"forum thread\" calls the data-marshalling code for all the \"forum posts\". Then the \"forum thread\" template, can use {{> mod_forum/post }} to show the template for the posts in the right place. 2. OK - so you didn't like {{>}} - (or more likely, the smaller elements have not been converted to renderers). Here comes the second method... \"$data->post = $output->render(post);\". That is why the signature for the export_for_template() method requires a renderer ($output). 3. One of the other important changes in the epic is MDL-49163 , a generic ajax script that exposes webservices. So if you want to expose the data-marshalling php code, you expose it as a webservice. Some pointers to a working example of this: Data marshalling exposed as an external function: https://github.com/damyon/moodle/blob/LP/admin/tool/learningplan/classes/external.php#L491 Javascript to call a webservice function that changes data in the db, then reloads the data for the template, and finally updates the page with the re-rendered template. https://github.com/damyon/moodle/blob/LP/admin/tool/learningplan/amd/src/frameworkdelete.js#L32",

Example - \"show description after date X\" If the date is after X the description field is included in the flattened data, otherwise it is empty. 2.

In the template for displaying a list of courses, you will have an array of 'course' objects. And each course object will have a field description. If you output course.description (or whatever the syntax is), then the description will be output with all the expected filters applied, because it has passed through the format_text function. The template does not need to know when format_string was called. It could be that course.description is a PHP string, which can just be output. Or it could be that course.description is a PHP object with a __toString method  that calls format_text with all the right arguments if the description is actually displayed, but if not, does not do any work. As far as the template is concerned, course.description is logically a string.",

My only concern is that it's possibly getting even at this stage a little too complex for the average admin/teacher/student who will want notifying about everything in an elegant manner. Additional items that would be useful in our context (and possibly to others) are: Ability to add rules at site level - eg. for all forums in sites i'm enrolled in, perhaps only allow students to modify setting at site level (for all courses they are enrolled in). Ability to set-up default settings for all students - If student A gets notified about forum posts but Student B does not we would have complaints. For consistency I would move away from having teachers define there own message templates (or make it an advance option), students will be working across different courses and possibly receiving lots of notifications short, sharp and consistent is the key.  Perhaps we could construct a useful default for notifications based on the settings in the rule. Really important: The notifications need to have a link back to what they are being notified about ie. If there are 2 new posts in a forum - link to the forum concerned, if a file has been updated - link to the file in the notification Not really an additional item, but, students and teachers are really used and primed for getting elegant notifications via social networks, websites and apps so the output needs to look professional and constant (possibly fun) to my mind this would mean having a nice email template that has good formatting in it - a default would need to be shipped with the code Question : Am I correct that the user can then consume the notifications as they wish? mobile, rss, email etc.... If selecting email as a notification method, do all the notifications get bundled into one email? if not it would be useful to have this option, so students & teachers) are not overburdened with notifications. I hope these comments are useful, really happy to be of help and test further if that would be useful. Mark",

          "Text": "Hi Mark, Thank you for your comments. Additional items In the current design, we are planning an ability to add rules at the site level. However it won't possible to subscribe to a rule at site level for all courses. For example, say you can create a rule called \"Active forum\" at site level, and that would make it avaialble to be subscribed to, in all the courses. But you still will have to subscribe to a rule through a course. That is a nice idea, we can have \"Forced subscriptions\" concept. It is not in the current spec, but surely sounds like an interesting concept, that we can consider. We would be providing a reasonable default that ideally would contain the rule name, description, links etc. And if you are an advanced user you could customise this as per your needs. The messages will contain those links for sure. Perhaps am misunderstanding this, but won't this template be the same as configured while creating the rule? Question : Yes you are correct. You can consume these through any messaging output plugin. By default we ship (email, popup, air notifier, jabber), obviously you can install any third party one you like. This is exactly like any other message in Moodle. This was discussed in our planning meetings as well. This feature really needs to be a part of core Moodle messaging system as a lot of other places can benefit from this too. I have created a tracker issue for this MDL-46128 . Please feel free to vote/comment on the issue. Again, I would like to thank you for your interest and feedback. Please feel free to post any other questions/suggestions you might have. Cheers",

In response to my responses Additional items Whilst I understand the reasoning here and that this seems to be the model that moodle uses across other tools. I would imagine that many students/teachers would want the same settings on all their courses so the process of having to go into each course to modify their setting could grate somewhat. To be honest - given this fact I would probably set a default level for our users and not allow them to modify it as allowing them to do so could cause confusion - I would be keen to have this view challenged though by others! Would be great if this could be included - hopefully if sensible defaults are set all the users would be happy and not feel they needed to configure it, would go some way to negating my previous issue Great! Great - wo ho! I guess this could be another issue (not with this development but moodle more widely) at what point does moodle define how it formats a message? is it done in the tool or by the messaging system? So ensuring that the message sent is suitable for the medium that is receiving it. The reasoning here is that for a push notification you may just want a short sentence and link but for a daily digest email you may wish to have a more vobose message with images, links and more text. All the best Mark",

Would it be within the scope of 2.9 planning to think about how it might be extended for learner use? items that would be great for learners would be: an activity stream, style block on the homepage (as Dan previously mentioned) a really simple interface that enables students to set up monitoring, arguably the current more detailed one would be overkill for students - perhaps a starting point could be one that an admin sets up and propagates out to all student users across the site All the best Mark",

Less than 5 students did a quiz during last two days. Make it easier to define time frames. Add hours and days for defining tresholds. I.e. more than 10 assignment submissions during 1  day. There are small and huge courses in Moodle systems. The absolute number of  events is significant only in relation of the number of students often. Idea: Less than 20 % of students/more than 70% of enrolled students did something during last three days. Its added to tracker in MDL-48417 . Just one more  question. Is a report possible about this: - Notification if more than 10 students visited the course during last 24 hours? Ralf",

This list is too large for normal users and moreover he can add rules to events that are not intended for his role. I'll give an example out of our Moodle system: Our teachers don't have the capability to view the course log (capability report/log:view) However a teacher can create and subscribe to this rule: Log testcourse Logs Log report viewed 1 time(s) in 1 minute(s) When an admin views the log of this specific course, the teacher gets a notification. However, when he clicks on the link to the log he gets the following message due to the missing capability: Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (View course logs) More information about this error Debug info: Error code: nopermissions Stack trace: • line 786 of /lib/accesslib.php: required_capability_exception thrown • line 115 of /report/log/index.php: call to require_capability() So, it should not be possible to create and subscribe to rules that are not meant to be used by a specific role. We don't want to take the capability tool/monitor:managerules away from the teachers. They still should be able to create their own monitoring rules. Now I wanted to start a discussion how this can be optimized so that each user only can create and subscribe to event monitoring rules he has the capabilities for?

If so, please tell us. I can think of example in other software (which has had a lot of UI expertise put into its design) that contextualises UI based on what you are doing like Moodle currently does. E.g. in MS word: the toolbar at the top completely changes, when you click on an image, to show you relevant options for manipulating images. (Other MS office programs all work the same way.)",

Frédéric Massart : Ankit, comment on the forum! Ankit Agarwal : Sort of \"My x\" stuff. For example say there are more activities like \"forum\" etc ? Adrian Greeve : Yeah, I can see that being useful. Though such additions would have to gain approval by my superiors. This is a valid point, and if you need more specific examples: The Open University does not use the standard Moodle forum at all. We use ForumNG instead. Therefore, we should be able to hide all mentions of Forum everywhere (e.g. by configuring capabilities) and show ForumNG in its place. Similarly, we use OU blog in place of the standard Moodle blog.

          "Text": "I agree with Tim that a main issue is the Navigation block, not Admin. It is clunky and vastly lacking in customization. Looking at the mockup, the first thing I notice is that the user pull down menu in the upper right has some select items on it, but others items are only to be found on the dashboard . What is the rationale for this? I ask because by far the greatest desire from Student role is 1) to get to their courses immediately and 2) see in one list all the collected activity or due items they need to work on such as Assignments & Quizzes etc. Related to this, by far the most common complaints I hear from Teachers is they want 1) to see the list of courses they are teaching and 2) to have complete control over the ordering of that list, with the ability to prioritize current courses and hide past courses or shuffle them off to another screen. Users spend almost no time in their profiles or messages or private files or badges, etc. They spend almost all their time in courses.  So getting into the courses easily should be the priority.  (That's a vast generalisation, obviously, but is my experience across many sites in different industries over the last few years.) I like the dashboard idea a lot - I encourage you to build it out more. I've thought for years that having strong user dashboard is a key lack in Moodle. But it needs to be much more functional than the My home page which is so limited. The best use of a dashboard I have seen in an LMS was in Sakai (2.x series).  It has (or had when I worked with it)  a nice user dashboard: it was organized as a screen of placeholders for widgets, so users could easily add or hide/drop any features they wanted to the dashboard, whatever sets of roles they might have had in various courses. As admin I could make dashboard templates and assign them to users, too. So, teachers or members of one department could get different default dashboard look than students or other departments, etc. While it was very user customisable, widgets could be controlled live by admins too: so I could turn a particular widget on or off for users of a particular named template. The dashboard was front and center when you logged in but left room for site news and course lists. And it was always just a single click away no matter where you happened to be be on the site or in a course. Randy",

On the myHome page, this is just a block and the main content area is a block region that other blocks can be added to by admins as well as customised by the individual user (eg widgets). OK there's only one template for it, but perhaps some of your dashboard suggestions Randy can be achieved through using/creating/modifying additional blocks for the myHome page more easily and flexibly than the (much needed) complete reworking of navigation/admin that HQ are currently working on?",

While the points raised will need to be (and will be) answered, it is important for us that you observe the navigation structure exposed in the mockup. As Adrian pointed out, our main (and only) focus was to improve the navigation in the user context . And we need you to tell us if we are doing it wrong. The navigation in categories, courses or modules has not been looked at (yet) because it was decided internally to split this massive work in two consecutive projects. So while all your comments about courses and modules navigation will be useful at some point, they are not answering our current questions. The questions with regards to developers API for content injection, etc... will be answered later but rest re-assured that we do not intend to remove functionality, we want to make Moodle a better, easier and even more enjoyable place for students and teachers. If you could follow the different steps that Adrian enumerated in the first post, and tell us how your experience was improved, equalled or diminished compared to the Moodle that you use everyday that would be very helpful to us.

I agree with Tim about the 'admin block', really stupid to remove it.  Actually need a 'control panel' page too.  I think that in reality that: The breadcrumb should be fixed such that every element is clickable and goes to where it says it represents. Some sort of Moodle version of the MS Office ribbon for desktop users, as long as no patents are infringed. Less clutter and duplication, only put on the screen what is really relevant to that page. Clearer access to own stuff, improve on the 'My Home' such that becomes a personalised collection of everything that the user interacts with, so grades (rather than the drop down menu), forum posts like a twitter feed etc. I've been playing around for a short time on an open source install of 'Canvas' and it does have less clutter and more focus.  But it struck me that you need to learn the 'Canvas' way of doing things workflow wise, a bit like working with Maven for software development.  So Moodle needs to improve by only presenting what is needed 'once' but not take away the ability to work the way you want to.  Canvas does provide help though in relevant areas without needing to click on the question mark.  Moodle should do the same but have different levels of visibility: beginner, intermediate, advanced etc. such that the amount of help reduces. Cheers, Gareth",

          "Text": "It's great to see the issue of navigation getting some more love and attention, thanks for sharing this work Adrian! I think it is critical (especially being almost 2015) to consider the presentation of any changes in the navigation system on a range of screen sizes. Mobile access is extremely common with my university students, and I find panel-based navigation on smaller screens particularly challenging. In general, panel-based navigation between courses is more reasonable since students are less likely to do so frequently, but something I still try to avoid. I like the idea of the Dashboard as shown in the mockups. When it comes to navigation within course elements (not the focus yet I know) then panel-based navigation becomes much more problematic esp. on smaller screens. Based on my own customization (i.e. hacks) work on Moodle, incorporating course element navigation in a menu system is quite beneficial for students on a wide variety of screen sizes, as shown in the previous example provided by Jez. Here is another example, a Moodle course of mine using a menu system for navigation, which is also multi-device friendly: http://iy103-w14.hibbittsdesign.com/ Hope the above is of help. Thanks very much, Paul",

After looking at the mockup, I didn't notice any immediate changes that would impact me as an admin (presume Admin menu block will be left unchanged??)  Dashboards are a nice touch. Please note we at Exeter College haven't and don't currently use the navigation block as we find it well... pretty clunky and useless to be brutally honest! Our theme uses a drop down for course categories as well as image tiles on the front page linking to course categories. Enrolled courses also on front page and in user menu. I asked an IT L3 Student (17 yrs) to have a quick look, and give his opinion: Initial Opinion \"what's changed??\" O I see there's a dashboard, shouldn't that be my homepage? Expectations: T he student expected an AJAX course/universal search (I.e like facebook) the home page should display basic dashboard, notifications, courses, personal to them. and that a graphical representation of all parent course categories displayed somewhere. I would imagine this would be the same for teaching staff also. What we would like is a default way of displaying categories dynamically in a graphical way, much like the Essential theme can achieve. I don't know if im the only one on this but that is the single 'feature' or change in terms of navigation we are after. the actual structure we are fine with (I think, but being we have never used the Nav Block, I guess I wouldn't know!) I must say the BCU theme also looks awesome.. and would be great if some of the features/ideology were taken to core. Rant over, thanks for reading if you got this far!",

I've done some casual looking in the docs and tracker and can see it's mentioned on the dev roadmap has a dev page with some quite radical and neat development ideas on and am aware there has been a moodle forums V forumNG debate going on.

It is still causing problems today: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=228226 2. New assignment module in 2.3. That was a new module beside the existing one, with a migration script that could be run at any time, one course at a time. That has been remarkably trouble-free, from what have seen in the forums. forum -> forumng would be an example of 2., and seems like the easiest option to me.

It is a patch to core that adds additional functionality. There would be no conversion process it would just be adding functionality to existing code. The only reason it is a separate module at the moment is because we were unsure how core wanted to proceed with forums and our clients demanded the extra functionality ASAP. So to be able to maintain it long term and allow clients to also use Moodle forums that would upgrade with Moodle core's decisions we made a separate activity. We have kept Advanced forums up to date with all changes to Moodle core forums as well. It would be a drop in solution not a conversion or migration. In the code for Advanced forums you should be able to replace hsuforum with forum and slap it on top of forum and it will work.",

But I was quite excited by the content of: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Forum The idea of being able to; label posts under pre-defined categories, use them anywhere etc.. would be great on many fronts. Regarding our 'read it later' spec we've got some more detailed documentation and will be meeting with our developers next week but as a brief overview please see below: Goals: To develop something that is really easy to use Not alter core-code Not be too tied to forums, so that it could be added to other areas of moodle. be a temporary 'working area' for storing interesting bits, not as a personal library for posts. Bookmarking a post Next to posts is an icon that the user clicks on, when clicked a pop-up shows allowing the user to; add a due-date and set colour to post. When added the icon reflects that the post has been bookmarked. Removing a bookmarked post (in situ) User clicks on icon next to post. a pop-up then allows the user to remove the post from their reading list. Managing List Users can get to this interface from any moodle page (there will be a link in the menu bar). It allows for filtering and searching of list by; text search, colour, who posted (faculty or group). From here users can click to view a preview of the posts (detailed below) Preview post A 'light box' prevew of the post from which the user can: 'View in context ' - this will take the user to the forum Edit & remove from list (by using the icon next to the post, as above) Any Feedback would be greatly appreciated, as mentioned in my previous post would be really good to know or develop a roadmap for the forum tool - am happy to help if I can.

I've been waiting to see the outcome of a conversation between you and Sam's boss.  I notice you have some problems with NG's code .  I'd be interested in what this means. And also the interface. (Cluttered).  Point taken, but in a hypothetical future with NG, this is surely part of the process.  Really, where is the adequate evaluation of NG. Re Advanced forums.  I have not seen these, so I have no point of comparison.  I am interested to note this tracker item: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-39707 (evaluating Advanced forums for incorperating into Moodle core) and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLSITE-1910 (some for Moodle.org) I'm concerned that putting effort into cobbling together enhancements for Standard forums are making decisions by default, and it will be using valuable coding time.  I wonder what has bumped subscriptions to be 'critical' for Moodle.org, which I see as a philosophical shift.  I support this: but not at the cost of clear thinking on a way ahead with forums. I've also noticed this: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-3681 where Sam has basically moved on with work on this thing (an evil hack that I have no idea of the significance of it).  I hope this does not mean development of NG is stalled outside OU for migration to future versions of Moodle. My final comment: we've had a number of conversations about the functionality of the ideal forum.  Here we come to the old issue of one person's vital is another person's essential.  How we come to consensus about this is still a question.  I've had my say about this elsewhere (drafts, 1<>1 options, inline, tags etc) but we could be wasting time developing lots of single issue developments and merely bolting them onto existing forums. Is there anywhere public where we can check out MR advanced forums?  Is there something in the way of user notes? I do not think we should underestimate the significance of this issue of getting a decent forum into Moodle core.  In Most settings, online, forums are a key component of an LMS.  Functionality, simplicity and power (or lack of it) is a big factor in how easy it is for tutors and lecturers to manage dialogue.  Just one illustration of what I mean.  Currently, click reply and you loose the view of the whole thread.  The inline reply of an AJAX version has huge power for many users.  To say OK, use tabs, cut and paste etc is fine, it puts a consistent overhead on the activity of everybody. We have yet to have any discussions on what the best for the end user really is in terms of the learning and interaction. Is this correct? - our options fix existing forums (may incorperating some bits like AF from MR) (maybe getting input from HSU read later etc) or incorperate NG (after a develop) and offer a migrate process. Off my soapbox now.  As with Buddy , we are also following this conversation with interest. -Derek",

Organizations interested in Joule features and possible hosting can also request a 15 day trial of Joule as well. The 15 day trial will be their own site to play with where the above link is like demo.moodle.org and gets recreated every 12 hours. There are also several videos on Youtube just search for advanced forums. Both of these options provide a demo of all of the features we are suggesting be part of Moodle core, activity grading interface, advanced forums, alerts and streams, and outcomes (as of July 13th when we release it to our clients). Because advanced forums is a separate forum type we have never recreated the forum search functionality or the display posts in the user's profile. This would all come by moving Advanced forums back to a core forum. As I said the migration would be as simple as search and replace hsuforum with forum in the code. Nothing currently exists in Advanced forums for user notes beyond adding the notes block to a forum. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-39707 lists all the features that have been added beyond core forums with the exception of manual grading through the activity grader interface. Which as Martin stated is not included because AGI is not in core. As for the lose of the reply I agree that is the one feature that Forum NG has the I want to add to Advanced forum's nested view. It is my opinion that if you combine Forum NG's inline reply with Advanced forum's Nested view (AJAX load of forum and replies on demand) you would never use any other forum view unless you were visually disabled. One thing that both advanced forums and forum NG fail at is an accessible view of the forums. I have seen nothing from OU in this respect for forums, but I know we will be implementing this functionality by August in advanced forums. Again as per the ticket above the design will be based on http://blog.bargirangin.com/2013/03/a-model-for-accessible-lms-discussion.html . I still need to get a public specification for this, working towards this by the first week of June. Multiple display options to me is a huge advantage of advanced forums over forum NG. A user is allowed to pick a view of the forums that is most productive for them.",

The regularly review parts of our VLE, and since Forum NG is one of the main tools used by students, it has been reviewed several time, and the accessibility problems fixed. (IET reviews and testing have also fed into accessibility improvements in core Moodle over the years.) So, if nothing else, ForumNG is very accessible. The other area where ForumNG has more features than standard forum (in addition to student-visible features that everyone wants like subscribe to thread) is in the moderation features. Some of our courses are very big, and have very high traffic, and we insist on moderating them, sometime by teams of people. So, for example, when a post is 'deleted' by one moderator, it is actually only hidden, and another moderator could review that decision, and undelete the post. You can also delete any post, even if it has been replied to. You can subscribe to a group in a forum, if you have access to multiple groups and don't want to subscribe to everything. Another point to make is that a lot of forumNG functionality is implemented using the 'ForumNG feature' sub-plugin type. By default there is a lot of functionality, and if you don't need it all, you could remove some sub-plugins. (Some of the sub-plugins are quite specific to how the OU does things.

Sticky posts: There are patches here waiting for something: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-372 Renderers: Jetha Chan has some work on the go here: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-45862 that seems to be fundemental to other movements. Reports for a foum , https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-8 one of the oldest tracker items may be easier now with new API changes? Accessibility? https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-41773 I don't understand this much, but I know it is an issue. Edit inline: Personally, I'd love to see Inline posting addressed as well.  I've watched students try to engage in a forum thread and have to use two windows. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-33692 I guess 1) is the most ready.  Just needs patches to be evaluated. Having made the decision that ForumNG is not good enough, Moodlerooms advanced forums is not good enough, having got editor save draft, and email to forum, how about just a little progress in this current cycle to assist in the core Moodle forum development?  One or two of these issues maybe? -Derek",

          "Text": "Hi Derek, Apologies for the delay in my reply. I've had a very busy few months and some of my forum subscriptions have fallen behind. Regarding your first question, I was really hoping to get some Forum changes in for Moodle 3.0. I have been actively working on User Disguises (formerly Anonymous Forum - MDL-1071 ). This is a work-in-progress and I have a working prototype with basic functionality already. I hope to be able to set aside a week at some point to try and finish my prototype and get some initial feedback. Regarding your specific items: 1) Sticky posts Sticky posts are an interesting one. There have been a number of patches along the way, and the latest from Charles looks pretty good. He has already identified an integration blocker regarding it. The main blocker though is that Sticky Posts do not have a pedagogical purpose. The Moodle Forum is intended to be a single-use forum. You use it to discuss a single topic, and any essential information which would be found in a Sticky Post should be in the forum description. This is a view that Martin has put forward at various points, and has re-iterated in discussion about this feature. Personally, I can see a place for this kind of functionality, but I think that it is also highly dependent upon the ability to freeze discussions in real-usage. The pedagogical use to me is that individual discussions can be pinned as important for those students coming back to view the content again later. 2) Renderables / Renderers / Templates I've attempted to work on this numerous times too. Jetha has recently done so, but he has now moved on to greener pastures over in Japan. Again, this is one of the features I am really keen to work on and to finish. I deliberately held off on doing this work until the new template system arrived, which it did in Moodle 2.9. Now it is here, I simply haven't had any time to pick this up again. I started looking at it again 2 weeks ago. Personally I see this as the biggest blocker to all forum changes and this has my highest priority. 3) Reports for forum I'm really hoping that someone can define more of what they want here. With the new logging systems, we should be able to do more. I would love to close this (it's the oldest open Moodle issue), but other items are higher on my personal list. A decent specification for this item would bump it up the chain significantly. 4) Accessibility This is very related to item 2. It's also one that is high on our radars. I have tried to address this before at the same time as 2, but I think this made things too complicated and ultimately led to the problems that I was having. I think that this needs to be completed once we have 2 in place, but hopefully straight after. 5) Edit inline Again, very dependent upon the templates, but also on our forms library in general. To my mind, 2 is the most important because it also enables a host of other things: ability for designers to change the DOM structure improved accessibility (4) allows templating of forum e-mails too easier to add new features like sticky posts (1), and user disguises I'm sorry that we haven't made as much progress on the forum as we would like. I am actively trying to improve the forum. The forum is an incredibly complicated module, largely because it supports so many use-cases and has so many diverse and inter-connected features (multiple groups + grouping modes, multiple distinct types of forum with different features and functionality, email out, subscriptions to both discussion + whole module, digests, post read tracking, rss, etc.). This complexity is often forgotten, and I suspect that when I look at the code for the sticky discussions, this will be the case there too - it simply doesn't make sense to pin posts in a blog forum for example. Hope that helps explain the state of play, Andrew",

Then the migration to Oauth2 should be easy for them. Maybe we can detect site with Mnet setup without enrolment and then automatically switch them to Oauth2. The tricky bit will be for site using Mnet beyond the SSO. Replacing enrolment features will need a real brainstorming. The idea atm is to use the web service to replace all other Mnet features. We'll specially check with the Mahara team (ps: I don't know who's in the Mahara team atm but I'll look for you if I'm in charge of this change ;)). Removing Mnet from 2.6 is the earliest possible date - a suggestion I made myself. I have no idea about the implication on LTI, I suppose LTI is not related to Mnet so it should be no problem.",

However, the oauth documentation seems to be written by hard-core cryptology devs and is beyond me (and I'm not completely stupid). Anyhoo, unless I have completely missed the point, oauth2 is an \"authorization\" system rather than an \"authentication\" system. So, I'm a bit hazy about what we will be getting in 2.5. What will thie Oauth2 provider actually *do*?? I'm not saying we should not use oauth2, but it will need to be a proper job with docmentation and example clients otherwise it'll just be another MNET.  That assumes it is even intended to do the same job which I am very unclear about.",

Yes, OAuth is not, in and of itself, an authentication system.  In general, OAuth-based authentication works using the assumption that a user who can authorize a function call is the user him/herself.  So, system A requests access to a function (for example, a function call to ge the user's profile data) on system B.  If the user authorizes the function call, then it logs the user into system A. One issue with using OAuth as an authentication system (at least in OAuth 1 -- I'm not that familiar with OAuth 2), is that nothing is standardized for using it as an authentication system.  There's no standard for what function call to use, and there's no standardized OAuth endpoint (or standardized way to do discovery), which means that the implementation will probably have to be a bit different for every system that you want to autheticate against.",

We also need to pick up whatever profile information \"System X\" has. I get asked this every other day, but I've never been asked the reverse or to code a facebook style solution. Maybe that's just my experience. It brings me back to my original question - what will Oauth actually do in Moodle. I'm not sure this is clear. Perhaps it should be before we go very much further. EDIT: I read Eran Hammer's blog post. It's quite depressing and certainly doesn't make me feel any more optimistic at all. Are we *sure* we are going down the right path here?",

Regarding Eran Hammer's blog post, I personally would say that we should just use OAuth 1 (especially since I've already done a bunch of the work in making Moodle an OAuth 1 provider ), but I don't feel strongly enough about it to argue for that.",

If I summary, replacing Mnet has for goals: * obtaining maintainable/expendable code => using more standard methods / common concepts to developers for the authentication and authorisation process. * make it more easy to set it up for the administrators. The idea of using Oauth2 as an authentication protocol is that: - it is easy for a developer to implement an Oauth2 client. - it is a popular authentication/authorisation system - it's still in draft, and sometimes described as a mess (Eran Hammer's blog post), but from my point of view it does not matter. We just need to do it the Google or Facebook way. Most client developers will be happy with that. Google already deprecated Oauth1 for Oauth2, forcing developers to know about their Oauth2 implementation. For the Mnet authorisation parts (enrolments in external courses, list of courses... TBD): I thought using web services, so using temporary tokens from Oauth2. But with OpenID, the provider could also generate a token during the authentication process. After reading Hubert comments, I don't see any issue using the couple OpenID/Moodle web service to replace Mnet. As I don't see much more issues with Oauth2. I think, for the authentication part, we should evaluate: * how easy is the authentication provider to implement/maintain (knowing that for OpenID there are written plugins...) * how easy are the clients to implement * how easy is the authorisation part to implement/maintain * how easy is the administration process (in Moodle) I'll start writing a doc. for Mnet replacement.",

There is a hybrid OpenID/OAuth extension that allows the OpenID authentication sequence to also exchange an OAuth token.  I believe it's only for OAuth 1, though.  But it seems like it might be simple enough to adapt it for OAuth 2.  Or we could make our own extension that will exchange a Moodle web service token. Anyways, IMHO , the MNet replacement should be designed in a way that it is not its own separate component, but rather is designed in a way that it improves the other existing parts of Moodle (which sounds like that's the plan anyways).  e.g. MNet web service calls should be callable by non-MNet clients, MNet SSO can be used by non-MNet clients, etc.",

As part of MDL-50851 I'm changing some functions in Tag API and have discovered one of \"easter egg\" Moodle functionality called course tags. There are so many things wrong with it and so many bugs that migrating on the new API is impossible without either fixing or dropping it. I have not found a single bug in the tracker regarding this and I assume nobody knows about it / uses it. First of all, what is wrong: This functionality can be enabled only in the settings of the block \"Tags\" by checking \"Show course tags\" ($CFG->block_tags_showcoursetags). When enabled block \"Tags\" can no longer be used for displaying tag cloud and is used to allow users to tag the current course with some tags. Every tag added to the course via this block \"belongs\" to the user who added it. So no manager can change the set of tags for the course if they were added by another user. Courses can be searched by the tags using \"Site pages > Tags\" search box just as well as user interests and blog posts tags. Obviously bad tag words can be removed or flagged as inappropriate but nothing can be done with valid tag words that are irrelevant. BUG: When course is backed up and then restored the information about the user is lost and nobody at all can change it any more BUG: When course is being deleted function coursetag_delete_course_tags() is called that deletes tags instead of deleting tag instances. This means that if the deleted course has been tagged with \"moodle\", the tag \"moodle\" is removed from any user's interests, any blog post, etc. BUG: If instance of block \"Tags\" is configured to show official only tags, and user is trying to add a tag it will disappear without any explanation because newly added tags are not official UI of course tags (again, accessible only via block) is so terrible, it makes me want to vomit. There are some minor bugs there as well. It is impossible to use \"Tags\" block to display tagcloud when $CFG->block_tags_showcoursetags is on and so on What I would like to do: remove all \"coursetags\" functionality such as block setting, pages to add/edit \"my\" course tags during upgrade automatically convert all existing course tags into proper user-less tags add a field in course edit form that will allow teacher/manager to set or change course tags similar as one can set user interests, blog tags, question tags, wiki pages tags, etc. everybody will still be able to search for tagged courses using /tag/search.php If you do use the coursetag functionality in it's current form, please tell us why it is good and we should not drop it. If you don't but would like to tag courses - vote for MDL-51132",

Also, I don't see a list of how this fuctionality breaks down into Moodle plugins . These are developer-focussed bits of information, but it is important to get it right, so please put it somewhere in the spec. Of course, some of it will be a new core component, but some things, like the reports, should clearly be plugins. 3. While most of the spec looks very sensible, come bits strike me as highly speculative. The first such I came to is the bit about 'streaks' and 'risk metrics'. This is clearly an area where research and experimentation is needed, so these crazy algorithms need to be consigned to some sort of plug-in, not hard-coded in the core of the system. (Apologies if there is a statistically regorous theory behind what you have specified, but if there is, please can you give some proper references.) (Thinking about this is what lead me to make the preceeding Point 2.) 4. http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes_Instructor_Specification seems to be incomplete as yet. Naturally, as quiz/question maintainer, that is the bit I am most interested in (\"Instructor Maps Quiz Questions Against Standards\".) If you would like to discuss this with me, please ping me and we can arrage a time to talk on Skype, Google hangout, or something. 5. But can I ask for clarification about how you intende to implement that outcome. I can see two possibilites: a. An outcome is a properly of the question in isolation. That is, it is metadata stored alongside the question in the question bank. b. An outcome is a property of the question in a particular quiz, That is, it is stored alongside the information about which questions are in this quiz (the quiz_question_instances table). 6. Regarding \" Outcomes Student Use Cases\", particularly keeping a permanent record. One way you are supposed to be able to export a permanent record of what you have done from Moodle is using the 'portfolio' API. Did you consider that? (That would give in-demand, not automatic, transfer of the information somewhere is, so is probably not what is wanted, but considering the portfolio API / badges / outcomes together is probably worthwhile in terms of keeping Moodle's funcitonality coherent. Probably outside the scope of this spec, and one for MD.) 7. Re: \"Course Outcomes - Student View\". Presumably everywhere the name of an activity appears, it will be a link. 8. Have you though about what to do where an outcome was achieved in an activity that has now been hidden? 9. Outcomes currently get displayed in the gradebook. How will the gradebook changes as a result of this spec? 10. Removing dependency on scales seems like a win to me, but I am probably not qualified to comment on that. I can see it being a useful option, but only an option. So, in summary: Good set of requirements. Mostly good UI mock-ups. Before you start writing code, please share the DB schema changes and breakdown of code into plugins wiht us for further comment. I hope others will join in the discussion of the details of the functionality, so they get properly validated before we move on.",

Okay, so, let me hit your questions or comments in order: #1,#2 - Per my note, this is still pre-tech design.  I'll leave that to people who are smarter than I am.  (I'm a developer, but I haven't been developing for several years.) #3 - I have some research on this, which I'll dig up tomorrow and include in the spec.  However, I have a bit more work to be done here.  A couple of broad concepts that I am working under.  1) Plugin System - By making this a pluggable system, we allow people to have different methods of completion for different types of programs.   2) We will probably only build the simplest ones by default.  I'm thinking of just one based on % correct and maybe one based on streaks.  3) All of these are suggestive, rather than conclusive.  One screen which I am currently mocking up is the Instructor Marking screen.  They can choose one of the completion metrics, which will suggest which Outcomes have been achieved, but they can manually mark them or unmark them as well. #4 - There's still a bit of work here (see #3).  On the quiz stuff, we should clearly chat sometime in the next couple of weeks. #5 - In answer to your specific question, I'd personally like to see the outcome as a property of the question itself, and independent of the quiz on which it is attempted.  Mapping questions is a time consuming process, and including it on the question will encourage re-use of the question.  In my research on how outcomes/standards are used in most professional schools and primary/secondary institutions, a well-written question is typically very granular, and maps against one outcome, and likely couldn't be mapped against a second outcome.  However, we won't do anything to prohibit mapping against multiple outcomes. #6 - Martin and I have talked about this at a high level, and I agree, this needs to tie into badges.  I will defer technical implementation details to the tech team and MD.  I think we all agree on the goals, however. #7 - Yes.  If that is not clear, I will update on my next revision. #8 - No.  Haven't thought about it, but I will think about it this week, and update, if necessary. #9 - Gradebook - More work needed here for sure.  I can share that very few clients are using outcomes as they are implemented today.  We did some data mining on client usage.  Of our approximately 900 clients, only about 25 are actually using outcomes.  So, while I want data to migrate for those clients, the current implementation is not meeting the needs.  In my spec review focus group in a couple of weeks, that seems like a good topic to probe with those few that are using the functionality. #10 - Scales - So far, of the 20 or 30 people who have reviewed this specification (including our training and implementation team, who have been training people on how to use gradebook, scales, and outcomes), not one has asked that we maintain the dependency on specs.  I'll wait for more people to chime in, but I don't know how we can leave the dependency on scales, unless we were to make \"Scales\" one of the achievement plugins (mentioned in spec and above). Thanks again, and thanks for starting the discussion.  I'll keep working, and we'll hope that other people start getting involved as well! Phill",

          "Text": "Thanks for your detailed answers. #5 - I see that I forgot to give my opinion, which I am afraid is the reverse of yours. I think question outcomes are context -specific. That is, it is a property of the question in a particular quiz. To justify that, consider these use-cases: Teachers in different states collaborating on a question bank of maths questions, where they all have to map them to their own State standards. Similarly, text-book publishers wanting to sell question banks. Or, a question that could be seen to assess both two different outcomes A and B in one standard. However, in the quiz we are building now, we are only interested in assessing A right now, so we want to ingore the contribution to B, since it is irrelevant noise. I can see the scope for meta-data on the questions, to help teachers set things up (e.g. \"if you are adding to a quiz using this standard, the likely outcomes are A and/or B\"), but I think teachers need the flexibility at quiz building time. I do have a vested interest here. A long-standing feature request, that applies even if outcomes are not in use, is to have one quiz report multiple scores to the gradebook. (The gradebook can cope with one activity mapping to several grade-items, like the Workshop module does with the score for submission and score for grading.) I would like to implement that one day, and I don't think it should only be available when outcomes are in use. Of course, if the quiz had that functionality, then it would help set up the outcomes thing. The quiz would set up one grade-item for each outcome, and then the outcomes code would only have ot look at that grade-item. That would give good decoupling between the quiz code and the outcomes code. A similar bit of design might also resolve the piont David makes about different advanced grading methods.",

          "Text": "Tim, So, in those use cases, I think that it would be okay to have the question mapped against multiple standards, even if it existed in the question bank, not just in the context of the quiz.  The instructor can filter all of their reports and coverage/performance criteria to only the standards that they care about. The use cases if we map them to an individual quiz have pretty poor usability .  Every time I copy a question to a new quiz, I would have to remap it.  In the U.S., the publisher would have to create 50 quizzes (actually 49, as one state hasn't adopted standards).  Generally speaking, the publishers in the U.S. use a company called Academic Benchmarks for aligning against state standards, and they have a meta-ID layer, which allows them to map the question against all of the state standards by mapping them against just one \"meta standard\".  These are usually distributed through software bundled with the book (the most common is called Exam Soft), but they are localized to a particular state (as is the teacher's edition of the text book).  This does remind me that I should add a use case for the import of quizzes from ExamSoft/Respondus/etc, that are mapped against outcomes.  It would be good if the API for the questions also brought in the standards (we could make this an option, I suppose).  I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to best do this. I did have another concept that people are asking for on the quiz that is related to this.  Several of the people who have been reviewing would like to be able to tag a quiz as a practice quiz or a drill quiz, rather than an actual assessment.  Then they would like to be able to partition the performance data based on the type of quiz.  (They would use some of the same questions in each, but the drills would be done earlier in the term).

Another point: Are you going to get Microsoft to change the format of .doc files, so that when a teacher uploads a .doc to the course, it automatically gets assigned to the right outcome? I didn't think so. Quiz questions are similar. Outcome mapping is not inherently part of a learning object, although it is metadata associated with it, and associating metadata with things is still a weakness in Moodle. Moodlerooms may not want to completely solve atbitrary metadata on things as part of this development, but we could try to store the data in a way that assumes that is coming eventually. All this should be entirely compatible with getting the Outcomes UI you want. I agree that your use case (Teacher imports Examview files, builds quiz from the questions, has outcomes automatically set up (or not at their choice) is well worth having. On the subject of metadata, does IMS LOM ( http://www.imsglobal.org/metadata/index.html ) have an encoding for outcomes mappings? As usual IMS standards are sufficiently incomprehensible that I was not able to tell quickly.",

          "Text": "Tim, Not sure I understand the point on the Microsoft document. I guess that I need to add a new use case (or three) about sharing of questions that are mapped to outcomes.  I've been working under the assumption that we would want users to be able to share and collaborate on questions without collaborating on the whole quiz.  So, in the simplest use case (which I can add to my use case document), two secondary math teachers are wanting to give Algebra quizzes.  One wants to give a quiz of 100 questions (he's a mean, mean teacher), and the other wants to give a quiz of 10 questions.  They should be able to use a shared question (if they both were to have access to it). This is the way that other LMS systems have implemented it (I know that ANGEL and Blackboard do it this way, because I wrote the spec and implemented it for ANGEL, and Blackboard basically did it the same way a couple years later).  Not saying that we should it because of that, but the workflow has been ironed out over the past 5 years in those systems. I guess in the end, I'll do in the spec whatever the users that we focus group with the spec next week tell us to do.  From a technical perspective, I don't necessarily mind how it gets implemented.  In the end, you own Quiz, so I'll defer to your judgment.  I just want to make sure that the end users get to weigh in before we make any conclusions. re: IMS - I know that IMS LOM is not really being used anywhere that I know of.  The key standards would be IMS Common Cartridge.  The newest version of IMS CC includes an Outcome ID, which is mapped at the question level in the assessment and in the \"Question Bank\".  I will have to look at how we implemented Common Catridge in Moodle to see what we are exporting to the \"Question Bank\" item in a Common Cartridge.  We may not be exporting anything at this point into that particular field.  I know that we have not implemented the most recent version of the CC spec which has outcomes, so I included a use case for that.  If we are exporting into the Question Bank element of a CC, we should include the Identifier there. Unfortunately, today, the CC ONLY has an Outcome ID, so unless you have a shared set of outcomes with matching IDs, this is not terribly helpful.  Of course, you could export it and import it into the same moodle, but you can just use Moodle Backups to do that. The reason that it was implemented that way is that the publishers do all agree on the same set of outcomes (in this case, it's the Academic Benchmarks outcomes, or in a few cases, it is their own internal set of outcomes), so it works for the publishers.  It doesn't really work for the individual institution that wants to implement outcomes, however.  I'll be at the IMS meeting in May, and I can try to dive deeper into them. Thanks for spending time on this.  I'm really enjoying the dialog.  Getting this stuff hashed out before we start coding is key, and Kris and Mark are itching to get started.  Glad to see that there's been a lot of interaction on this spec already!

Our primary objective is to create a system that can be powerful enough to meet the demands of the most requested features, while remaining flexible for developers to extend and implement in their own creative ways.  It is not our intention to define a white-list of plugins that can support Outcomes, and the way(s) in which they do so.  While the specification may identify a specific use case for associating outcomes to quizzes and rubrics, our technical team will need to abstract that as a way to allow outcome association at a more granular level per module and advanced grading method, using quizzes and rubrics as a specific implementation example. Let me also try to address the questions you've raised: 1.  The DB schema will be part of the technical documentation.  It makes more sense to me to hold off on it until we've addressed the requirements further, but we can craft something if that would be helpful for the conversation. 2.  There's a balance that must be struck between creating new plugin types vs. the overhead of maintaining and configuring them. The 2 primary areas for plugins would be the reports (piggybacking off of the existing system) and the algorithm for marking whether a student has met the outcome (aka Streaks).  There may be other areas that would be useful, and they will likely come out in discussion. 3.  I would agree that Streaks should be a pluggable system - for those who attended, this would be the same system that we discussed during the Outcomes session at Hackfest.  We need a little more definition around Risk Metrics to determine whether it should be pluggable system or can be addressed through configuration. 5.  Obviously we'll defer to your judgement here, but couldn't we technically have both?  From the feedback we have received, it's pretty critical that the outcome is associated with a question in isolation, but that could simply be used to facilitate the outcomes associated with the question in a particular quiz.  I could see it being useful to allow the instructor to override that in some cases, preferably based on a capability to do so. 9.  The new Outcomes system would operate independently from the Gradebook.  I personally don't think it makes sense to mix Outcomes and Grades on the same report, especially since the Outcomes could be organized very differently in the new system.  It's possible that the Outcome Marking plugin could create a bridge in some cases, but that still needs to be defined.",

          "Text": "1. Yes, I get the point that DB schema comes later. But ... I still think there is an argument for starting to develop the high-level logical data model now. What are the major entities, and how do they link to each other? For example, we know we have standards and individual outcomes, with a one-to-many relationship. Also, how to they link to existing moodle concepts like activity modules? That is many-to-many. Another way to put it is that some people might say that UI mockups should come later in the design process, but you have included them in the spec already, and that is really helpful for understanding what is going on. I think that some high-level entity-relationship diagrams would similarly illuminate the spec, and more importantly help validate early on that what you are specifying will be possible to implement in the back-end. 2. First, creating new plugin types is not a big deal. pluginlib.php etc. do a lot of the work. Of course it should still only be done when really necessary, and for this spec most of the functionality fits into existing plugin types: Any reporting uses either report_ or gradereport_. 'Manage outcomes sets' could be a tool_. I think we have greed that algorithms for computing whether an outcome has been met from other data should be a new plugin type. (Good luck naming that ) In theory, different import/export formats for outcomes could be a new plugin type, but in the first instance, we probably don't need to formalise that. If we ever find it necessary, we could move the code from inside tool_manageoutcomes to separate plugins. For bits of the UI, particuarly student-related display, the UI might naturally work as blocks. The core of the system will, of course, have to be added to Moodle core, as will the API that activities use to communicate with core. 5. Yes, looks like we are talking ourselves into a 'both' solution. 9. I am not suggesting that we mix grades and outcomes in the same UI. I am asking about the back-end. There are lots of similarities: There is a central store of information about what students achieved on different activities. For each activity, there can be multiple 'grade_items'. Those might be one or more different numerical grades, or they might be the evidence that a student has met one or more differnet outcomes from an outcome set. There is an API for acitvities to push the information about which 'grade_items' correspond to it, and the value for each student for each grade item, once the student has completed the activity. There is a plugable system of gradereport_s so the the data in the back-end can be displayed in different ways. There are also import and export plugins for getting the data in and out. There is already code in the back-end to calculate new grade_items, and overal course summaries from other grade_items. The gradebook and advanced grading plugins already play nicely together. I think there is enough there to justify doing some serious thought about how much of the existing back-end can be re-used. That does makes things harder initially. Certainly for you doing the design. It is much easier to design with a blank sheet of paper that to start from someone else's design where the only accurate and up-to-date documentation is the existing code. Simiarly it is harder to build on someone else's code that to write your own. Also, there are known issues with the gradebook API, but why can't we take this opportunity to fix them? Even with all that, there may be good reasons why it is better to not build inside the gradebook back-end, but if so, I think you should be able to articulate why. You were the one wh raised \" overhead of maintaining and configuring them\" (quite rightly!).",

Activities might be just marked complete/not complete (or percentage) as currently but the outcomes can be seen clearly as met or not met. results should be clearly visible at least course-wide so outcomes in the whole unit/moduel can be seen in one place.  Ideally it would also be possible for a student to see outcomes across Moodle courses as well (for those of us who use a separate course for each unit/module ina  qualification).  I am also aware of some units/modules which are taught by more than one person and I guess some might use separate Moodle courses and yet the outcomes are only relevant as a whole.  I suspect you would not want to include this in this particular project as it would presumably be best done as a separate plug-in. Have you considered what will happen if one outcome is met across multiple Moodle activities?  Often an outcome might say something like \"Show examples of dealing with clients in ...\" or it might say \"Design, create and test ...\" and again that naturally exists as three activities or more.  This is not hypothetical as I have already had to split outcomes including one into 8 separate outcomes (even though it is one official criterion).   For me the answer is simple - each outcome should have a configurable number of \"mets\" and for it to be completed it would have to be met in that many activities.  Students complete an activity and the outcome can be shown as 1/3 met or a percentage.  This simplistic approach may well not work for others so a one-to-many use of sub-outcomes might be unavoidable Overall this seems to me to be a potential monster so well done for tackling it! I am aware of PHP (but not OO PHP) and databases so if I can be of any use in opinion or testing please let me know.  The way Moodle works behind the scenes is something I have not looked at though so I may not be much use!  Hope this helps.",

          "Text": "Just one more point to throw in to this discussion about outcomes. When I was still teaching, I tried a few times to use outcomes to record marks for BTEC qualifications. These work by having a number of Pass (P1, P2, P3, etc.), Merit (M1, M2, etc.) and Distinction (D1, D2, etc.) marks across as many assignments as the college wants to provide for each unit. Each mark can appear in more than one assignmet (theoretically anyway, it rarely happens in practice), although each student can only gain each mark (P1, P2, M1, etc.) once for a unit. To gain a 'pass' for a unit, the student needs all the pass marks for that unit. All the pass and merit marks are needed for a 'merit'. All the marks are required for a distinction. I found that using outcomes for this was very unwieldy, as you had a large number of 'outcomes' in each course (especially if each course contained multiple units, in which case they ended up as U5P1, U5P2, etc. for Unit 5 P1). Each outcome also only needed a grade of 'Yes' or 'No'. There was also no sensible way to gather these grades into an overall pass/merit/distinction for a unit. It may well be that this use case is completely outside of anything that outcomes will ever sensibly address (and maybe there needs to be some different mechanism to support such 'exotic' marking schemes - some sort of 'yes / no' criteria, rather than graded outcomes).",

If I understand you correctly, I would use a Rubric that contains a criterion associated for each of the relevant unit marks.  Each criterion would be associated with a P, M and D outcome.  The instructor would mark off whether the student received a P, M or D, and the algorithm would mark off each outcome as Met or Unmet depending on the algorithm.  It could do this even if the Outcome was used in different assignments or even courses (depending on how Units apply). This might give you extra information in an Outcomes report as it would show each Pass, Merit and Distinction outcome as either Met or Unmet instead of showing each outcome as Pass, Merit or Distinction.  However, you could probably customize the report in some way to get the information you need.",

          "Text": "Folks, Just a quick update, and then I'm also going to use this forum post as a TODO list for myself.  We've been meeting with clients and end users about this over the past several weeks, and they've made some good adds from a functional perspective.  They've also overwhelmingly confirmed the vision of removing the dependence on scales.  Their suggestions will appear in my TODO list for updating the specification below.  On our side, our technology team, which for this project will be headed by Kris Stokking and Mark Nielsen, has now reviewed the spec, and provided me with a lot of feedback (much of which will also appear in the TODO list below). TODO List and Key Decisions: Course Mapping to Outcome Sets - We had a lot of discussion, both functionally, and technically about the importance of the mapping of a course to Outcome Set(s).  From a functional perspective, this mapping has two purposes.  First, it simplifies the  mapping of activities, rubrics, and questions, by limiting down the number of Outcome Sets that I can select from.  Second, the course level mapping defines which outcomes I want to report against.  So, from a functional perspective, this is important.  However, as I discussed with the tech guys, the mapping that is the most important is the mapping of the outcome against the content itself.  Let me give an example to clarify: Let's say that there is a quiz question that is used in multiple courses through the question bank.  That individual question might be mapped against two outcomes.   However, for my course, the only outcome that I care about is the outcome that my course is mapped against.  Why does this matter? Backup/Restore - If I restore a course that has items mapped against outcomes, the outcomes won't really appear in my reports, etc. unless we also map the course against that outcome. Shared Questions (see above) Accidental Deletion of Mapping - If I have mapped 1000 questions against my outcomes, then I accidently remove the Outcome Mapping at the course level, it should NOT delete all of my work in mapping the individual items. Report for \"Unmapped Activites and Questions\": Great customer suggestion here.  If I am in a course that is using outcomes extensively, we should build a report that shows items that are not mapped against any of my associated outcomes.  This would be like the coverage report but would be content centric, rather than outcome centric.  The assumption is that if I am tying my course to outcomes, nearly every piece of content in the course should be mapped against an outcome, so if something is not, it probably should be. Detail on the Reporting - We need to go one level deeper on the reporting pages and define what happens when I click on the links in the summary reporting.  One of the particular questions that came up was how easy it would be to gather the artifacts of student submissions. Use Case Add: Export Outcomes data through API to Portfolio System (such as efolio or Mahara ) Outcomes Summary/Workflow Block for Teachers - An idea from a client is to create a block for the course home page that gives updates on outcomes workflow.  More definition needed, but wanted to document the idea. Define XPath options on import as only non-complex elements. Clarify how \"Average Grade\" works for quizzes where questions can have different weight. Define Capabilities (Create Outcomes, Import Outcomes, Map Course, Unmap Course, Map Activities, Map Rubrics, Map Questions) Backup Restore Specification (include Common Cartridge) More work on Recommendation Engine - Users loved this concept BTW .  One of the biggest problems was the sheer volume of work created by outcomes.  Anything we can do to make that easier helps. Outcome In Use - Warn before editing Versioning of Outcomes - We know that this is a major use case, but we can't bite off everything this time.  Let's make sure not to design ourselves into a corner on this from a technical perspective. Can instructors see how students did on the same outcome in a different course?  Is this a setting? Cheers - Phill",

I do have a couple of thoughts/questions, and I apologize ahead of time if I missed these being addressed already in the spec or above.  These are primarily reporting (module/plug-in) specific, but I thought I would mention them because they may have some implications for data capture and storage design. I saw in the specs that the intent is to provide for hierarchical Outcome structures.  If I understand you correctly, this would be wonderful.  One of the major limitations of the current Outcomes schema is that it is difficult to know which \"level\" of the standards hierarchy to track.  Using Outcomes to track the 4-6 \"Strands\" (in my terminology a Strand aggregates several Standards which themselves aggregate many Benchmarks) that would go on a report card.  From a feedback perspective (assessment for learning and not simply assessment of learning) using Outcomes to track Strands or Standards provides essentially no helpful data.  To be helpful for learning, the Outcomes need to track Benchmarks (specific learning/performance targets), and at the high school level in some courses (e.g. ComSci) these are legion.  In the specs it is clear that you intend to have Outcomes tied to Benchmarks, but will tying an Outcome to a Benchmark automatically tie it to the Standard and Strand of which it is a component?  I am assuming so, but do want to raise the issue.  Doing so would certainly help teachers in schools that continue to give grades (whether simple A, B, C..., or 1, 2, 3...with descriptors, or some other system) help in deciding to what degree a student has met the overall Strand/Standard requirements of the course. In the same vein, will there be a way to assign a \"weight\" to each instance where a question, rubric evaluation, etc. is tied to a Benchmark, and each Benchmark is tied to a Standard, and each Standard is ties to an ultimate report card Strand?  If a student has met a Benchmark 10 times over the course of a semester, will each success be weighted equally even though they arise from different assessment modalities (e.g. multiple choice questions, essay questions, performance assessment).  Will there be a way to weight the reporting data in terms of where an assessment item falls in the learning process (most recent performance vs early performance)?  Will it be possible to aggregate performance data for Benchmarks by mean, mode, median? Again, I realize these are primarily report plug-in related questions.  But, if the right data is captured, I can envision some wonderful graphical reporting tools that would make Standards Based Instruction and Reporting both productive and a pleasure. Finally, any remote sense of what your target for release would be on this? Cheering you all the way, Doug",

          "Text": "Hi Doug - thanks for your feedback on Outcomes.  I think you raise some very valid points about reporting, and we actually met about this as a group on Friday.  You are correct that Outcomes are to be organized into nested Outcome Sets, which you define as Benchmarks and Standards/Strands respectively.  The student will only be marked as having met the Outcome, not the Outcome Set.  However, that information can be aggregated into useful reports - one such example is the My Outcomes report which shows progress of achieved Outcomes against a related Outcome Set.  The question we need to solve is which level should be used in order to make them useful. For example, if we had the following Outcome Set: Computer Science Standards -> CS Standards for 2013 -> Basic Concepts -> Data Structures That contained the following Outcomes: Arrays, Hashes, Trees, etc. At what point does the aggregate reporting become useful?  Too high up the hierarchy, and the student would likely never achieve 100%.  Too low, and it may not be useful enough.  In most cases, it will probably make the most sense as the last Outcome Set in the hierarchy (i.e. Data Structures), although there may be cases in which it would be dependent on how the Outcome Sets are arranged.  In addition, we have performance and design considerations - making it too flexible could frustrate end users (e.g., if they need to navigate to the correct \"level\" in the Outcome Sets each time they run a report), and we would not be able to cache the data effectively as we would need to do so for every given scenario.  Simply put, there's more design work needed here and it's on the forefront of our discussions on Outcomes. Regarding your second question about Outcome \"weights\" - we plan to handle this via a Recommendation System.  When the instructor is on the Completion Marking report, each Outcome will have an associated recommendation for the student based on their performance against content.  A streaks-based or probability-based recommendation plugin may not care about a weight - it may make its recommendation entirely on consistency.  But we do plan to make useful bits of information available to the recommendation plugin such as mingrade, maxgrade, rawgrade, even the passing grade threshold (where available) so that if the plugin wants to weight each attempt based on the amount of points for that (which is certainly reasonable!), it may do so.",

On the issue of aggregate reporting usefulness, I suppose the major thing would be to make sure the fields used for data capture would permit a report module to query for any or all heirarchy levels.  That way report modules could be written to address different user needs.  I am so please that you are considering these issues! In thinking about the Recommendation System you describe it strikes me that there may well be many situations in which streaks-based or probability-based recommendations are not appropriate to analyze the data set.  It seems to me that those analysis tools fit a situation in which computer assisted assessment presents multiple opportunites to achieve mastery of an issue within a single or tight series testing event using the same testing modality. They may not be as applicable to a set of responses gathered via different question modalities over the course of an entire semester or year.  Just a thought. As to the information bits to be made available to the recommendation plugin, I hope you will include date of assessment.  A primary premise of standards based assessment (at least as it is described in the US) is that students are like popcorn (each kernal pops when it is ready) and so the primary question becomes what did they ultimately learn, not what is the average of their learning over the breath of the course - often referred to as the last, best data.  Again, getting the data into the properly granular fields is the issue (in terms of ultimate data mining), and I'm hoping the design will err in the direction of particularity rather than exclusion.

          "Text": "Hi Kris, Good to see you folks moving ahead with speed, but I must also say I am concerned about two thing I see in the Outcomes Technical Specification: 1) Outcomes no longer appearing in the gradebook, and 2) Outcomes no longer supporting scales.  Perhaps I don't understand where this is going, but it seems likely to me that these two changes will make the Outcomes module virtually unusable for K-12 schools in the U.S. The move is on in a very, very big way toward Standards Based Reporting and Assessment in the U.S. but the ususal approach is to assess and report student achievement on a scale - typically something like: 1 Not Present; 2 Area of Concern; 3 Progressing; 4 Mastered.  I don't see how a pass/fail approach to data collection can support this model, nor how pass/fail can be used to meaningfully report student performance on essays or other performance based assessments.  Also, in the end the teacher's assessment of a student's  performance on such a scale (perhaps by looking at the mean, mode, median, most recent or a combination of these) IS the grade in the gradebook.  I'm not seeing how outcome tracking can be separated from the gradebook. I am attaching a short article by Thomas Guskey (one of the leaders in SBG in the U.S.) which provides a basic example of how Standards Based Reporting and Assessment is being implemented in U.S. schools. I realize that standards or criteria based grading is being implemented differently around the world, but would hope the new Outcomes module will not exclude K-12 teachers and schools in the U.S. All the best, Doug",

The instructor will know whether the student has achieved an outcome, so we give them the ability to mark that achievement and give them the applicable data to make the assessment.  Using the definitions from your article, the \"Outcome Attempt\" would translate to the Product criteria, which the instructor could access from the marking screens.  They would also have access to resource views against supplementary materials or attempts against ungraded activities, which could be used as Process criteria.  Finally, we have recommendation plugins that can analyze the student's attempts and make an informed recommendation about his or her progress towards the outcome.  And a t the end of the course, each student is marked as having Met or Not Met an outcome, which they will carry with them across the site.",

          "Text": "Doug, So, I think that we are all shooting for the same goal.  I'll add to Kris's comment to describe a little bit more of the background of this, and ways to accomplish what you are trying to accomplish. First of all, the reason that we went the way that we did was that, while you could do grading as you describe in the old outcomes system, it had some real limitations, specifically around tying outcomes to quiz questions.  There are many times where a quiz question ties tightly to one outcome, and whether or not the student gets that question (or a group of like-mapped questions) correct is a very solid indicator of competence.  We have to balance this with the more subjective nature of other types of grading, such as assignments, where a paper could cover more than one outcome, and the grading is more subjective.  For this, we are doing tight integration with rubrics (advanced grading).  So, in the example that you mentioned, you could create a rubric that was mapped against outcomes and had the scale that you mentioned ( 1 Not Present; 2 Area of Concern; 3 Progressing; 4 Mastered).  Upon grading that activity, you would have the data that you need.  This is different from a quiz question, where it is a much more binary condition.  We want to make sure to support both paths. Additionally, the ability to do coverage reporting, as well as \"Completion\" reporting, where you can see whether or not your students have read or participated in the background materials tied to specific Outcomes should be a huge win for remediation of possible issues. As to whether or not to display them in the gradebook or not, I think that there are arguments for both, and I'd love to hear more dialog on it.  Currently, the Outcomes link in the Settings area takes you to the Gradebook, but you can also get there through the gradebook.  We could potentially leave both.  I know that Kris and Mark were looking at the technical hooks needed and whether we should leave both. By the way, I've made a bunch of updates to the spec over the weekend.  Take a look.  I'm going to make a separate post with notes about the changes and a link to the change log.  Thanks for being so active in this thread. If you'd like to have a more one-on-one discussion with me about some of these issues, let me know. Phill",

I've spent a lot of time considering the proposed data structure and didn't want to reply until I'd had a chance to really think through its implications.  Although, in the end, I still think many schools will want to report student progress and final standard mastery on a scale rather than a simple yes or no basis, the granularity with which you are capturing performance data is what is really important.  If the data is there (and God bless you for making it so), then those who want to scale it for reporting can do so via a plugin.  Great work.  This is really exciting. This granularity of data capture will also allow for the creation of plugins that report student progress with a degree of specificity that will truly provide assessment for learing (what teachers and students need to guide student progess in real time) as well as final assessment of learning (what parents and universities care about).  I can't wait to start using it (and probably writing a plugin or two). Keep up the great work! Doug",

I first misunderstood during the dev meeting that people would want to distribute/publish outcomes (either with Mnet, either with Moodle hub repository). It's why I suggested to implement the web services. From the specs it's an import/export feature for admin. So no need of web services. However it still would be nice to have some web service functions for two reasons: * it shows when your lib.php API went wrong. When you think as a developer of a teacher/student app or admin tool, you sometimes find out that your API functions do either too much, either not enough. Issues related to parameters, capabilities, return values, abusing of Moodle form, etc... the web service functions will expose the problems of your API. I believe you'll save quite some maintenance time and some future development time if you write web services from start. * currently we are pushing for web services to make Moodle more open . If you have some time to create some web services, I wrote this documentation to contribute a web service to core . I'll be happy to answer if you have any specific questions regarding web services.

          "Text": "Hi I went thru the wiki and this thread again, with the focus on the technical specification. I have couple of comments and questions in random order (as they came to my mind). DM1 Firstly, please rename pages like \"Capabilities and Roles\", \"Migration and Technical Issues\", \"Specifically Excluded Use Cases\" and similar in a way that it is clear they are related to this project. Using \"Outcomes Specification/\" (including the tail slash) is what I would do. Without it, they just pollute the dev wiki and may confuse developers looking for a documentation (imagine a developer looking for dev docs on capabilities and roles system in Moodle, for example). DM2 Looking at the Backwards compatibility breaks , they all look like real enhancements for me. I'm also happy with most of decisions recorded at the changelog . DM3 I don't like the userid column in outcome_sets table. If it should be foreign key to the user table, it can't have 'default 0' imho. If the value is to be optional (as I understood the description of the field), just keep it declared as the foreign key with the NULL value allowed. I can't see any reason for 'default 0' (especially for foreign keys). Same may apply for other columns. DM4 I would like to hear more about your concept of the outcome_areas table. 'Areas' are used in several subsystems in Moodle core, such as files API or advanced grading methods. They represent sort of unified system of locating and addressing places in Moodle that other components can hook to (as in file is attached to a post, image is embedded to a text field, advanced grading form is used for assessing submissions in the Assignment module etc). It has been proved that what works is what I call \"the holy four\" (I wanted to call it the \"fantastic four\" but some puny film studios trademarked it ). Shortly, it is good to use the combination of contextid + componentname + areaname + optional itemid to address hookable places in Moodle. So if there is a file attached to the student's submission in the Workshop module, we can easily associate the file with the context (contextid of the workshop module instance), componentname (\"mod_workshop\"), area (\"submission_attachment\") and itemid (the submissionid). Similarly, the rubric form used to assess submissions in the assignment module is hooked to an area identified by context (context of the assignment module instance), component (\"mod_assign\") and area (\"submissions\"). Looking at your ERD , your tables outcome_areas and outcome_used_areas do not fit my mind well. Not only I'm missing the contextid there. Could you please provide an example/illustration of these tables filled with some data and explain what these data mean? Eventually some pseudo- SQL queries? DM5 WRT Phill's answer above , I have not found any detailed information of how you plan to integrate Outcomes with advanced grading methods. The spec just claims that there will be an API for that. But how will that API look like, at least roughly shaped? What I would expect is that every advanced grading form is able to be associated with zero, one or many outcomes. When a form is reused in other activity or shared as a template, these mappings are preserved by default unless they are explicitly removed (note that advanced grading forms are copied for each individual activity, that is different from how Questions are implemented). How would such association be stored in the database?",

DM1 - OK, we can do that. DM2 - Sounds good. DM3 - That's fine, null will be used instead of zero. Please see change here . Let me know if I missed any. DM4 - I was also trying to stick a contextid into the outcome_areas table, but it wasn't making sense for the associations that we are making. EG: what contextid would you use for a question (remember, questions exist on the site or course)? Same question for a grading form. If you think of a way to include it that would be beneficial, I'm very much interested. Example for a grading form data would be component=gradingform_rubric, area=criteria, itemid=gradingform_rubric_criteria.id and this would represent an outcome(s) being associated to a rubric criteria. Once the grading form was associated to an activity, then a record in the outcome_used_areas would be added with the cmid of the activity in question and the id of our record from outcome_areas. The outcome_used_areas is important for coverage reports and because some content (like questions) can be used in multiple activities and we want to be able to distinguish between the two. DM5 - I don't yet know how the API will look, but the idea is, it'll be designed to accomplish the goals I have laid out and more. I assure you it will be flexible and re-usable and it will be developed out in the open for all to review and critique. What you are expecting is exactly what I was thinking. Since grading forms are loosely defined, meaning the plugin can do whatever it likes, then the integration of the outcomes would not be automatic. So, it is up to the grading form to determine how it would like to use outcomes. For example, what we would like to do for rubric is to be able to associate outcomes on a per criteria level. Another grading form may want to do it on another mechanism or just allow a single association to the grading form as a whole. Please see my response to DM4 for example data.  If we are using a grading form template, then the outcome associations would be copied with the rest of the grading form. Cheers, Mark",

I've just come across this discussion, so I apologize for the late remarks. Hopefully it's not too late to give some input. At this point, after reviewing the Outcomes 2 specs and conversations, I'm generally optimistic, but I do have a couple of questions/comments/suggestions: Will it be possible to unify Grades, Outcome results, and Badge status somehow? I.e., I design my activities so that success (a passing grade) on the activity indicates that the learner has met the Outcome. When I grade an activity, I don't want to have to go in and manually set an Outcome as well-- and if I ask other faculty at our institution to do it (e.g. using the current field on the Rubric form), it will never get done. I recognize that some users need to keep these two values separate, but will we have the option of unifying them? If so, I think we will be able to tie Badges in by setting their criteria based on the Grade of an activity... or maybe the Badge criteria should be based on the status of an Outcome? Will it be possible to tie multiple activities into a single Outcome with aggregation options? Or will it be necessary to create Sub-Outcomes and have the status roll up from there? This might be an Advanced Grading plugin question, but what about aggregating Grade input from more than one grader? These could be co-teachers or student peers. Tying low-level Outcomes to specific quiz questions makes sense, though our outcomes (at a college) are usually less granular. It might be helpful to allow the instructor or administrator to set the Outcome by Category of questions, for large test banks where the questions have already been sorted into different Categories based on the Outcome. By tying Quiz Questions to individual Outcomes, a single Activity can contribute to more than one Outcome. What about Activities other than Quizzes? Can a Rubric Criterion be tied to a specific Outcome? Currently Ratings can feed into Grades of some activities. This is helpful as a possible method of peer review, though not very specific. Will Ratings tie into Outcomes at all? The specific example I am thinking of is the Forum. We emphasize discussion in most of our online courses. A single Forum might span multiple Outcomes. Currently the only way to grade within the Forum (without creating a separate Grade Item in the Gradebook) is to use Ratings. (Sadly, this means we can't also use Ratings to let students recognize helpful posts.) Can we configure a Forum so that we can indicate student completion of an Outcome while reading posts? What about partial completion? Thanks for any info!",

          "Text": "Wow, lots of great questions in here.  First, let me say that I appreciate the feedback.  Development is progressing quite nicely, but we still have a ways to go.  Let me hit some of the points that you make, and try to answer questions.  Some of these questions are already addressed in the spec, so if you haven't given it a read yet, please check it out. 1.  Outcomes are new, as are badges, so we haven't integrated them yet, but there is a clear connection here.  On the grade side, this is actually possible with the design that we are pursuing, depending on how you grade.  For example, if you have an assignment with a rubric tied to it, that rubric could be tied to outcomes (as criteria).  So, when you grade it via the rubric, both outcome achievement and grades themselves are actually updated.  Right now, there is no design for how the aggregate of outcomes could translate directly to a grade without going through an activity, although this is an interesting idea. 2.  So, multiple activities can be tied to the same Outcome, and the results are aggregated into reports, both at the course level, and (eventually) at the Administrator or Assessment Coordinator level. 3. No plans right now for multiple graders, although we are looking at the grading workflow with some of the core developers right now.  Stay tuned. 4. Interesting idea.  We haven't gone down this path.  I agree with your comment about University criteria being less granular.  However, the Outcome Sets are a heirarchy, which means that there could be high level objectives, and then you could create more granular objectives that lead up to the higher level objectives. 5.  Rubrics can include Outcomes, and the measurement rolls up into the reports. 6. Great idea.  We don't have this now, but we are looking at how you grade forums with Core, and there might be progress here soon. Hope that this all makes sense! Phill",

Having Grades based on Outcomes is certainly one way to go... having Outcome completion based on the Grades of certain activities would be another, don't you think? But the overall point is to only have to grade an assignment once. Whether an automatically scored quiz, an essay or project graded with a rubric, or a discussion grade based on ratings, it will be important to us to have a tight binding between Grades and Outcomes so our faculty and learners (and accreditors) can easily see that Grades are a reflection of meeting Outcomes. Is there a discussion about grading workflow and the grading of forums that I should be following?

          "Text": "Hi Elizabeth, The workflow is designed such that grades flow into outcomes, which could theoretically then flow into badges at a later date.  We are currently developing the screens to allow instructors to manually mark off outcomes based on grade and completion data for the related outcome \"attempts\" (e.g. a mark in a rubric, a grade for a quiz question, whether the student has viewed the supplementary material, etc.)  We'll be progressively enhancing on this approach by building in support for \"recommendations\" which will allow plugins to make recommendations to the instructor on whether the student has met an Outcome based on some algorithm (e.g. streaks, probability, average grade, a custom algorithm for your institution's grading workflow, etc.)  We think the instructor should have the final say in determining whether the student has met the outcome, but it would definitely be possible to automate the recommendation in a later phase or as a separate plugin altogether to make it easier on instructors that are only looking to grade once. Re: Forums - you are correct.  Graded forums would be achievable by using Advanced Forums , which is currently under evaluation by Core, along with the Activity Grading Interface .",

          "Text": "I've been asked to look into the situation with Outcomes again, both for faculty professional development and for student reporting and program accreditation. How is the Outcomes 2 development progressing? Now that Badges are in 2.5, hopefully there has been more thought about integrating Outcomes with Badges. Based on what has been written so far, I look forward to support for many-to-many relationships between Activities and Outcomes, though I'm still a little worried about how this will work for Activities that don't currently support Advanced Grading options. Here are some other thoughts: 1 - Could there be a way to automatically display the Outcomes (or summary Outcome Sets) addressed by all Activities within a Course Section? If not, could we at least have the option to display the Outcome within the course section under each Activity? 2 - Suppose we have a list of Outcomes and a list of Activities, and we have not specifically defined the relationship between them, and we'd like individual students to suggest this relationship. For example, suppose I have an Outcome of \"consistently uses correct writing mechanics such as spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.\" The course has a dozen essay assignments. How about letting students identify up to three (or another defined number) of Activities that they feel meet the Outcome? Granted a more sophisticated way of solving this would be by using an e-portfolio system with integrated assignments, but that would probably also be more difficult for students to use. 3 - Bulk course create and remove tools are now in core as of Moodle 2.6 ( MDL-13114 ). Will the identity of an Outcome Set for each course in the csv be supported when Outcomes 2 is integrated into Core? Or will we need to rely on making a copy of some canonical template course that has the Outcomes defined? 4 - The current Outcomes Import system is very difficult to use. Although the documentation says it wants a \"comma separated values\" file, in fact the separator must be a semicolon, and a single non-ascii character will halt processing of the file. There is no way to manipulate Outcomes in bulk once they are created (e.g. modifying the Scale defined). There is no report that I can find that displays the Description of the Outcome, making me wonder why the field is even present. I hope the new system will be easier to use. 5 - It seems that Advanced Forums will not be replacing Forums in Moodle Core any time soon. Hopefully there will be revisions to Moodle Core Forums that will provide better grading features. MDL-1626",

          "Text": "I've just finished a MOOC on badges. My project involved creating a badge system for Liberal Arts college outcomes. I based my outcomes list on the \"VALUE Rubrics\" developed by AAC&U (The American Association of Colleges and Universities). Sorry for the US-specific focus-- if someone would like to suggest a more universal document, I'm all ears, but I think this will work well enough as an example for the discussion at hand. In the AAC&U VALUE Rubrics, there are 15 topic areas, each with 5-6 criteria. Example: Topic Area: Global Learning Criteria: Global Self-Awareness Perspective Taking Cultural Diversity Personal and Social Responsibility Understanding Global Systems Applying Knowledge to Contemporary Global Cultures For each criterion, there are four levels: \"Benchmark (1),\" \"Milestone (2)\", \"Milestone (3)\", and \"Capstone (4).\" My badge system implementation awards a badge for the Capstone level of each of the criteria. I have \"Constellation\" badges defined for each of the categories, meaning that if a student completes all the outcome criteria in a category, they get a larger badge for the whole category. I also created cross-category \"cognitive competency\" badges. For example, many of the competencies defined in the various categories involved learning to incorporate multiple perspectives. If a student achieves several of these competencies, we would award a \"Perspective\" badge. In many ways, this is the real value of the system, showing a prospective employer (for example) the cognitive skills gained by liberal arts students. To make this system work, we need a master list of all the competencies as Outcomes, and we need to be able to assign sets of these competencies (criteria) to all sections of a given catalog course. So, for example, every section of our World History class that is created in the system needs to automatically include the Outcomes expected to be achieved in that course. There are also some \"secondary\" or \"opportunity\" Outcomes that might be present in many courses, e.g. \"propose Solutions/Hypotheses\" from the \"Problem Solving\" category. We would need to be able to designate a source of a set of Outcomes for inclusion when each course is created, or even after course creation. So Outcomes and sets of Outcomes need to be addressed in the bulk course creation and editing features included in Moodle 2.6: http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Upload_courses We also need to be able to set criteria for what constitutes meeting an Outcome. As has been mentioned earlier, I don't think an all or nothing binary status is really sufficient. The Scales tools in Moodle are cumbersome and using them with the existing Outcomes is difficult, but that doesn't mean that some kind of Scales aren't needed to work with Outcomes. Otherwise, I end up having to create four times as many outcomes and track them all. As a use case, this illustrates what we will need to be able to do with Outcomes. Once the Outcomes are defined at the institutional level and attached to each instance of a given catalog course, the instructor attaches specific assignments to Outcomes (or Outcomes to Assignments, whichever), so reporting can show that all the Outcomes have been allowed for in the course designs before the start of the term. When an Outcome is connected with an Assignment, the rubric attached to that Outcome needs to also be attached to the assignment, so that when a faculty member grades the assignment, they do so in accordance with the definition of that Outcome. For any given student, we (staff, faculty, the student) should be able to easily see which Outcomes have been expected of a student, and the level to which each has been met. For Outcomes achieved at the Capstone level, an Open Badge needs to be issued. But it might be the case that a specific Outcome requires at least 3 examples of student work to reach the Capstone level. It could even be required that the work cited has to come from different courses or subject areas. So multiple instructors could easily be involved-- but it is important that they don't need to know what work a student has done in another context in order to be able to give credit in their own contexts. It feels like this is a lot of text for an idea that might better be explained with a diagram. Should I link or upload a file that will show more of what we need to be able to do?",

Then there was a comment that some people might want a way to wipe the grade on import. Well, you could do that by having a special value, like '-', 'null', or 'No grade' (that last one localised) which when present in the file in place of the grade, would cause the grade to eb wiped. That seems like a simple solution to the original problem. Am I missing something?",

Several professors grading the same activity and each one of us wipes up the grades imported by the other professors because all of us have \"null grades\" for the students we don´t grade.

Many people find this very annoying. Shall we change the default? Admins would still be able to make it a required setting in their site settings if they wanted, and we would not change the setting for existing sites. The reason I bring this up now is that Mary Cooch created MDL-49006 , then I did a patch, and now it has been reviewed and submitted for integration, so if you think this is a bad change, you need to scream loudly this week to stop it being integrated. But hopefully, like us, you will agree it is a good change. The full list of activities affected are Book, Folder, IMS content package, Lesson , Page, File resource and URL .",

There are still several activities like Forum, Feedback or Database which have the description field as a required field and which completely lack an admin setting to disable this requirement. We have always asked ourselves why Moodle is inconsistent with these settings and could not find a bulletproof reason why, for example, a forum must always have a mandatory description as for simple usage scenarios everything can already be said in the forum title. I think your change now would be the chance to fix this discrepancy, right? Thanks in advance! Alex",

As an experienced admin, I hesitate from using such wizards, but it might be of great use for novice admins who don't want to go through all admin setting screens.

This request was originally raised in MDL-3714 . I'm still working on documentation, and some of the language strings will need adjusting, but the prototype is otherwise fully functional. To access the prototype site, you will need to create your own account at http://prototype.moodle.net/verp , where instructions on how to use the prototype system are provided, along with some suggestions on other things to try. The system I've conceived allows for much more than just e-mail to forum replies. There is an extensive API which be used to create a message handler for almost anything within Moodle. As an example, the above prototype site also includes an e-mail to private files feature. The full details can be found in the parent issue, MDL-47194 . The initial developer documentation is available at https://docs.moodle.org/dev/VERP , with API documentation available available at http://prototype.moodle.net/verp/apidocs/classes/core.verp.handler.html . There is one caveat that I have discovered - when using Google Mail, and replying to an e-mail whose Sender is an\naddress that is one of your verified e-mail aliases, Google ignores the \"Reply-To\" header. I'm trying to find a solution\nfor this issue, but without success so far. Andrew",

Would be helpful for the documentation has some kind of process diagram that shows what notification the user gets when posting to a forum or uploading a document. So when I reply to a forum post by email I get two back; a 'process' confirmation and then the post - could these possibly be rolled into one for the poster? - this would make the whole thing more elegant. When a message fails (due to using a non-registered email account) it would be good for that message to give possible explanations to the user as to why it might have failed. I also agree with Joseph's comment 1 - that would be great and also signpost to the user that they can reply via email. All good stuff though. cheers Mark",

The API docs are pretty complete now, but I would like to start putting some diagrams together too. 1) I'm not sure at this stage... the confirmation e-mail is generated by the higher-level API, but I may move it such that the handler sends the message. Even then though, it is very difficult for us to combine the two into a single message at this stage. That's because the outbound messages are sent by the forum cron. We store a single flag for whether a message has been sent -- in the forum_post table. Each post knows whether it has been processed for e-mail. We do store a message_read flag too, but I think that is only respected if the user has read tracking enabled. As a result, we don't know whether to send the user the e-mail in all situations. It's something I'll look into, but I need to get the rest of the API sorted first. 2) Yup, again I agree. The current language strings are placeholders and we'll work on those before release.

As far as I'm concerned, for the sake of usability of students and teachers, without there being a 'filter' to strip quoted material we would in all likelihood end up turning off this feature.

It's not an easy task, and I haven't yet found a PHP library to do so to lighten the load. I wasn't aware that Jira did this yet, but I know that GitHub does not. What GitHub actually does is to include the entire response but collapse it. As an example, see my reply-by-email comment in https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/1336#issuecomment-28349568 . Gmail also collapses the reply section of the response, and perhaps this is something that we should look at too. There have been a couple of suggestions on how we could remove the response though: work out where the reply ends and the original begins, and chop, however: different mail clients behave very differently when it comes to quoting replies; different languages could potentially make this harder; and people who bottom post (as e-mail was originally designed) will lose their replies. add a 'reply above this line' type comment, however: again, this is language dependent; and we may encounter issues with HTML vs. Plain text. add a non-language dependent marker (e.g. ========================), however: this probably requires a description too; it prevents people using the same marker in their reply; and we may encounter issues with HTML vs. Plain text. If you have another suggestion, we can look into it. I've put down this project for a few days to give people a chance to give feedback, and I'll be picking it back up again later this week so I'll try a few different approaches then.

It currently only supports three languages from what I can tell. We could pop it into the code pretty easily (there's a handy space to do so), but I'm concerned by the number of caveats, and the lack of language support. One of the known issues is that it does not support Gmail for example. Actually, it is more than just a semantic difference and it does make a difference to how we do things: If we cut and remove content at the appropriate location, then it is gone. We don't store it in the database and it is not possible to recover it if it has been cut in the wrong place; conversely if we collapse, and we choose to do so in the wrong location, then it is recoverable and nothing is permanently lost. There's also a difference based on the point at which we make the cut: If we make the cut when we receive the e-mail then we store less in the database, but at the expense of a permanent change. If we make the cut at display time, then we have a recoverable content and we can change algorithms to retrospectively improve the cut point. However we store more in the database and we add more processing at display time. Ideally I'd prefer to do the latter, but I don't think it will necessarily be easy. I imagine we'd have to introduce a new text format (in addition to HTML, Plain, and Markdown) - e.g. Reply. We'd then filter those differently: When displayed on screen we would put the hidden content behind a collapse span; and when sent by e-mail, we would cut. Andrew",

It been over 15 minutes, and she hasn't received any emails confirming or denying her post, not sure if this has to do with having a bigpond account. I agree with the others that the confirmation emails do tend to crowd up the inbox, the possibility of being able to turn this off would be a benefit. Otherwise great function.

I was making some changes on the prototype server yesterday around the time you made this post which may have broken replies for some users and I think this is what's happened. Sorry about that - I was fixing some bugs and inadvertently made some breaking changes. This won't happen in normal use, but the prototype server is a demonstration system and sometimes things get broken.

          "Text": "Hello everyone, It's my last day at Moodle HQ today and while cleaning things up for my departure I have organised a proposal for changes to the cache stores in Moodle 2.9.\nThis just involved consolidating what was already out there and fixing a few bugs in the process.\nI'm purposing the introduction of new stores as well as the removal of less used/desirable stores. I have created MDL-48226 for this, let me summarise what I am purposing: MDL-37069 Add an XCache store. MDL-39117 Add an APC store. MDL-38987 Add a WinCache store. MDL-48468 Add aRedis store. MDL-48469 Remove the MongoDB store. MDL-48505 Remove the Memcache store. To summarise my view:\nI really like XCache and APC, nice fast opcode caches, not multi-site safe but in situations where you've only one web server these are ideal.\nRedis is fast, really fast for an external service and right up there with memcache. Truthfully I haven't even published this plugin in the plugins database yet (I will do of course).\nMongoDB is slow, really slow, I needed it when writing the Cache API to test functionality and it shows what a No SQL store would look like. That being said I doubt anyone really uses it and I don't believe it needs to be in core.\nMemcache, well this is an interesting one, its removal is based really on the fact that it is not multi-application safe, and cannot be made to be so. I have created MDL-48506 to make Memcached multi-application safe as that is possible.\nWinCache I've there for completeness, I've truthfully not looked at it nor run it in a long time. So my votes:\n+1: Add XCache, add APC, remove memcache, remove mongodb\n+0: Add Redis\n-1: Add WinCache That would see 2 added, 2 removed, 1 left to public vote/time, and 1 rejected. I'd really appreciate any thoughts, feedback, votes if you can muster the effort. Many thanks\nSam",

          "Text": "Sam, Thanks for taking the time to work on this.  Over the last few years I've used the XCACHE, and memcache stores in both my test and production environments.  (My production server is running MS Server 2008r2 and currently hosts a few Moodle instances ) Here are a few things I found: In a single server environment running on MS windows the Xcache store worked generally worked well depending on the type of data stored in it.  If I remember the only issue I had with it was storing course group information, where it the data being cached was not always simple keys ( CONTRIB-4318 ) When I upgraded PHP to 5.5 I started using optcache in place of XCACHE since the Moodle environment check recommends it. Since optcache cannot work as a cache store, I am using memcache to as the cache store for the bulk of the high traffic data on my site.  (This is because I had issues getting memcached to work properly under windows)  If redis is a viable alternative to memcache for those of us on a single server install, then I would support moving it into core.  I currently have a couple instances of memcache running (one per install) and it seems to be working well. All I ask is that you don't force those of us on Windows to have to use the file cache for everything since it is rather slow.  And before someone comments that we are free to install a different cache store from the plugin directory, While cache stores can be installed, they cannot be removed ( MDL-45498 ) So my vote would be: +1 for xcache (assuming CONTRIB-4318 is addressed) +1 for Redis -1 for Memcache (It works well in a single server / application environment) -Steve",

Cache stores are one of those.  When I migrated from xcache to opcache the only methods I could find to remove the cache store was to either reinstall the site from scratch and restore all of the course backups one at a time or to hack the database to try to remove all references to the plugin. (On the three Moodle sites I currently maintain, I ended up rebuilding two of them while the other I attempted to remove all references to that plugin) If the decision to encourage users to install cache stores from the plugins database, could part of that process also involve improving the machinery around the installation and removal of cache stores so they can be removed like most of the other plugins? -Steve",

          "Text": "Hi Sam, Thanks for all the hard work and I look forward to continuing to work with you in your future endeavours. I've just peer reviewed your Redis plugin, which I must say looks spot on. I've been looking at Redis for several years now and when I last looked at writing a plugin the php support was a little too immature so I'm really keen to see this now. As I mentioned in my review, I'd give this a -1 for inclusion in core, and I do so for the following primary reason: Redis requires both a server and a php extension which are non-standard in a typical installation. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that an administrator installs the Redis plugin from the plugins database too. I also agree that we should remove the memcache plugin for the reasons that you list (also because it just completely sucks because of the memcache extension itself), and we should remove the mongodb plugin. If nothing else, having some of these plugins in core legitimises their use and, as we've found, they are not really ideal for use in core for several of the reasons you mentioned. With regards APC and XCache, I'm less convinced. OPCache is now standard in PHP 5.5, and I think we should be looking at prioritising caches which are standard and do not require a large amount of installation, and configuration. That said, they are useful caches, for older installations which you find with a lot of shared hosting providers. Similarly, Wincache is useful for those windows installations which people insist on running. Providing Wincache in core again legitimises use of Windows as a valid server environment. For anyone interested in running on a windows server, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask them to install the Wincache plugin. So in summary, my votes: APC addition: +- 0 XCache addition: +-0 Wincache addition: -1 Redis addition: -1 memcache removal +1 mongodb removal +1 Andrew",

          "Text": "Andrew, One thought about APC, XCache and WinCache.  While I understand your concern about supporting competing caches, all of these are actively maintained and provide functionality not available with PHP's built in OPCache, specifically the ability to cache user data and be used as a cache store.  When OPCache became part of PHP, it looks like the user cache portion of APC was broken out into it's own PHP extension called APCu.  From what I've read, it looks like APCu can be installed in parallel with PHP's OPCache and is fully backward compatible withe the earlier APC functions.  This would mean that if the APC store were to be added to Moodle core, it would support both the APC and APCu PECL extensions, which I feel would be a useful to smaller single server sites.  Since Moodle core ships with a store for large sites (memcached) it would be nice to support a cache for small sites (APCu) There is some useful information about APCu here: https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/26902267-PHP-Performance-I-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-OpCode-Caches http://jessesnet.com/development-notes/2014/php-55-opcache-apcu/ -Steve",

By sticking to a small set in core, we support each well. It looks like an opcode cache solution is a gap in our small set and it would be good to have one in core for single-server sites. So: 1. I would like see only one 'winner' chosen between xcache/apc etc to go into core. Lets have one and focus our 'core' energy on that working well. 2. It sounds sensible to remove mongo, I don't expect it to affect many of our users (based on issues reported). 3. I suspect memcache removal might affect more users (because we gave too much choice in the first place), but memcache d is the alternative and it is justifiable to me to remove the confusing choice between the two. 4. Outside of core, the community can develop any promising alternatives, but lets make some simple choices. A problem we have with MUC is making it too flexible and so hard for people to choose their configuration.",

I think we would like to investigate a move to redis and/or opcache when we upgrade our server operating system. One thing I'd like to clear up - am I correct in thinking that removing something from core means that HQ are dropping all support for it and will not maintain it in future? In other words if memcache is removed from core that doesn't just mean we have to install a plugin, which in itself is fine - that also means it will probably stop working at some point and we will have to fix it ourselves (unless somebody else volunteers as maintainer). Or is it going to remain supported by HQ for a certain number of versions, like when code is deprecated? And while messing about with the list of included caches - I don't think memcache(d)_clustered was integrated in core yet. I said we use memcache but I think we actually use memcache_clustered... Would this be a good time to incoporate that plugin as part of the core memcached handler, perhaps? It's basically just adding some extra optional configuration settings. It makes a large difference to performance on multi-server systems because it lets you use local memcache servers; having to go across the network for every MUC read is a substantial performance penalty. --sam",

The Grader report is a potentially large interface which has been a bone\nof contention for usability over the years. Some experimental options have\nbeen added to it to try and improve the usability, but these have generally\nbeen buggy or unreliable. Thanks to some work from Rex Lorenzo and Alfonso Roman of UCLA, we have\nworked to replace the previous 'fixed' header experimental setting with a JavaScript floating headers system which is cross-browser compatible, and\nmuch less likely to break. This new system creates a copy of the headers and footers and makes them\nfloat at the top, left, or bottom of the page (as appropriate) so that they\nare always visible and that you can always determine where in the gradebook\nyou are, which grade item you're viewing, and for which user. As a result of these changes, we have also taken the opportunity to\nsimplify the interface, removing: The floating tooltip - since this shows the same information visible on\nthe page already, and it is now possible to clearly see where you are on\nthe page, we felt that this was no longer necessary; and The row and column highlighting - again, it is now much clearer on the\nscreen which row, and which column you are currently viewing and we felt\nthat this was no longer necessary. A prototype of this UI update is now available on our\nprototype server . Login credentials to view the page are provided on\nthe login page. The issue containing these changes is MDL-46658 and we welcome feedback\nboth on the issue, and within this discussion. The original design discussion from this change is also available in the developer documentation wiki . Best wishes, Andrew Nicols",

          "Text": "Hi all, I'm considering patching Moodle to support pluggable search engines for searching content. This is largely inspired by customisations I've previously worked on using the GSOC Global Search plugin. I envisage two stock search plugins, a purely SQL based one that will run in a standard Moodle environment, and a SOLR plugin that will require a connection to a SOLR instance/master-slave setup. To keep my life simple, and release code to the community in a reasonable timeframe, I'd like to incrementally patch different search functions in moodle core, starting with course descriptions, then moving on to other content at a later date. Would people find it useful/desirable to merge a partial implementation as a base for future development, or is the preference for a fully complete feature? A key part of this implementation would be providing a standard mechanism to add custom metadata to indexed resources, to allow drill-down by these additional criteria in large catalogues, in a similar way to many e-commerce sites (e.g. e-Bay, Amazon, etc.) Note that I'm likely to largely ignore the current SOLR global search plugin (possibly using it as a reference in some instances), as there are quite a few limitations I'd like to get away from - not least is the requirement for a PHP plugin when talking XML to a SOLR instance would work just as well. Feedback desired, Phil",

Altough the code was a little bit old-style, i've managed to update it to work on 2.7 with not much work (github link on tracker issue) and also implemented a \"more like this\" feature for foruns, also known as MDL-46429 or \"Implement \"related forum discussions\" list on top of Global Search 2\" =) I know that having to install a php library may be problematic for many people, but moodle already depends on other php libraries so the pretty-decent API of this library avoids a lot of work dealing with the XML and other APIs of Solr. Please note that I am not here defending Solr as the best tool for the job, just addressing some points =) I would also like to see http://sphinxsearch.com/ integrated on Global Search for Moodle but i had no time to work on this yet and i think that sphinx does not have the \"more like this\" feature out-of-the-box as solr have and I don't know about the term similarity algorithms sphinx uses. If you don't mind,  I would like you to say a little about the \"limitations you'd like to get away from\". Kind regards, Daniel",

          "Text": "Hi Daniel, Other than the need to build the SOLR plugin from source (for Ubuntu 12.04/14.04), the main limitation I found was not being able to set the endpoint for the SOLR instance - e.g. it would only work against /solr/search; since I was using faceted queries, I really wanted to be able to use a moreLikeThis endpoint where I could specify facets; unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way of doing this with the existing PHP module. Other areas I'd like to improve on (which can be addressed in PHP) are the ability to send updates to a different host to queries - this would allow a load-balanced hostname providing node-failure protection for queries, with updates going the the master (I'm assuming a SOLR master-slave set-up). The way I envisage a pluggable search engine API to work is to provide a base class/interface that different engines implement, and allow hooks for pre-query and post-query updates. This would allow, for example, facets to be layered on top of a search for engines the support faceted queries, and results to be filtered for engines that don't. Phil",

There was quite a lot of work already put into the GS2 implementation and the code from Daniel at https://github.com/danielneis/moodle/tree/MDL-31989_master seems to be the best starting place. I would definitely start there if I were to pick it up again. Your plan is very ambitious (that's always good) - and original plans (including mine) for this plugin were pretty ambitious as well. Now I think that better way to approach that would be to start with something small (less features) but fully work-able - and then extend it. cheers, Tomek",

Code and screenshots are available in MDL-7315 I have re-used all the code done by Matt Petro for implementing user and group overrides in the quiz module so it works exactly the same. Of course as lesson has a lot of settings related to user, there is a lot more lesson settings you can override. I would enjoy getting some comments: is this an interesting feature do you see any other lesson settings you would be interested in overriding ? ... I know some Moodle users would be interested in a more general approach to allow overrides for all Moodle activities , but because of the differences between modules (and I should say difference in the code quality between modules, no offence, but some modules have very old code ) I am convinced after working on lesson that this would be a very big task. So I decided, as there were many votes to implement this in lesson to give it a try in the hope it would be useful to those users. Maybe in the future somebody else will try a more general solution ? Note that it was in fact rather simple because I started from good code.",

Any feature that is added to a core component which is maintained by HQ requires allocation of HQ resources on an ongoing basis. As Jean-Michel has pointed out, HQ have limited resources. These limited resources should be better invested in features of general nature and further plugin support. Lesson overrides is a particular instance and arguably pluggable. In my opinion it is better to develop it as a contributed plugin, until HQ or one of the for/non profit partners allocates resources for a generalized solution. A general solution should probably be an API and hooks for a module overrides plugin similar to solutions in many other areas of Moodle (e.g. logging, course formats, etc.). Should HQ opt to add the overrides feature to the core Lesson sooner than later, I think that some work should and could be done to wrap it as a core module pluggable component with hooks in relevant areas such as backup/restore.",

As an aside the events are clearly general enough to be defined as core events, override_created, override_deleted etc. So, the module specific part is the form and DB and it should be possible to implement them as a local plugin. The plugin can add a designated overrides-managment link to the activity administration and the teacher will click that link from within the activity for adding/updating/deleting overrides. The core module code only needs to get the overrides for the current user/group on instantiation. In modules that use an object class for the module instance this would be fairly easy and centralized. Afaict the lesson does exactly that to the effect that the overrides can be fetched and applied to the instance data in the constructor (or init method as its case may be). More generally, if it is not essential to specify DB columns for the specific overrides, the DB support can work like config and be the same for every module that implements overrides.",

This is a feature that a lot of community themers have integrated into their own themes, and I'm excited to be a part of building it into Moodle core. Don't worry too much about the old login_info renderer going away; this will only replace the use of it in the header, base and bootstrapbase will still call it in the footer and if you're using a custom solution this shouldn't affect you at all (unless / until you decide to use the new renderer, albeit). There've been some changes to the bootstrap navbar as well; it's now a renderable with all that entails. Menus can now be enqueued in the navbar, optionally specifying whether or not they collapse on narrower screens and a custom hamburger to use if necessary!",

The commit in question is: https://github.com/jethac/moodle/compare/7a4832e...MDL-45893-master Is that what people have been doing? That's great - yeah, the new user_menu (lib/outputcomponents.php:3033) extends custom_menu so we can leverage existing YUI stuff on base themes and so that the bootstrapbase renderer doesn't have to do too much fancy. The username(s) in the link maintain status as profile links not so much for the dropdown but so that people have right-click->open in new window access. Thought it'd be a good idea.

Very possible; we'll probably do that as a separate issue - I know we at HQ are very interested to see what can go in this new menu.

You could try to integrate this, but bear in mind that that might make subsequent patches to 2.7.x harder for your institution - this patch makes changes to core Moodle files.

          "Title": "Conditional availability: Enhancements including OR conditions, plugins",
          "Text": "Hi all, At a recent Moodle developer meeting, I introduced a proposal to significantly improve the conditional availability system. (my part starts at about 01:00 and runs until about 07:00) Some key parts of this improvement are: Allow OR (and NOT) conditions. Improve the user interface for availability restrictions on the activity/section settings form. Make restriction types (date, grade, etc.) into plugins. I've now filed a Moodle tracker issue MDL-44070 . Attached to that issue is a Word document with a fairly detailed outline of the development. If you want a quick overview, I'd suggest the presentation above - if you have questions about the detail, please go to the tracker issue and look at my document first. As a member of the Moodle community, here are some ways you might want to contribute now: If you like the proposals and want to see them in Moodle 2.7 (or whatever version), please vote for the tracker issue. If there is something important I've forgotten or that won't work, or you have other concerns about the change, or you think restricting access to anything is a waste of time because the NSA can read it all so why not students, go ahead and say so. If you have a feature/improvement you'd like to be included in this change which isn't yet, feel free to ask (let me know the MDL number for the feature request). I'll try to avoid increasing the scope - it's already a rather large and monolithic change - but even if I don't want to include it, I can at least consider how well your improvement would fit with this change. Important caveat: this relies on my time being allocated to the development by my employer (The Open University). I don't yet have full confirmation of this but it is looking positive so I am ready to go ahead with investigation, prototyping, etc. So just a warning that I might have to stop or delay development later if something else comes up, but I hope that doesn't happen. That said, I think this is going to be a really nice improvement because the current interface is pretty clunky and limited, so I'm hopeful that most people will like it. Thanks for reading. --sam",

I.e. there will be a grouping plugin as part of the main change, afterwards we could just add a group one with relatively little work. Looking at that issue MDL-30554 , basically I objected to it because it duplicated a whole stack of functionality, increasing the maintenance cost and complexity etc. With this new proposed system, because it will have a proper plugin API, there will be no need to duplicate anything.

          "Text": "I mentioned that as part of this change it will be necessary to slightly change the wording used for displaying conditions (these appear to students when they don't meet the conditions, and also to editing staff). This turned out to be super complicated, but with a little help from Tim Hunt, I now have a plausible approach for the new wording (this is linked with the new API). I'm posting it here just in case anybody wants to comment. I'm not actually planning to substantially change the way this information is displayed - it might be nice to do so (e.g. make it fold up with a JavaScript reveal link if it's long) but that can be done as a future change if required. This is really about wording. At present, the wording for students is done like this; each condition has a piece of text. If there is a single condition, we display only that piece of text. If there are multiple conditions, we display all the pieces of text in a bulleted list. That's it. Because of the wording involved, this doesn't handle the case of OR conditions, so I need to change it. The new proposed approach is. Each condition has a piece of text. This now describes only the condition itself and does not contain the words 'available if.../unless...'. We display standard text 'Not available unless:' before the condition or before the list of conditions. If it's an OR condition, we show 'Not available unless any of:' instead. A common use case is for an activity to have only a single date condition. The API will allow for conditions to output different text if they are the only condition that applies (which I'll implement for date conditions), bypassing the 'Not available unless:' text. Worth bearing in mind that, as at present, you can still choose to hide the activity entirely instead of showing it to students with the list of restrictions, if that's more appropriate for your situation. You might choose to do this if the restrictions are very complex, as in my fourth example. Below I've included some examples. If anyone wants to suggest improvements to wording (particularly around the 'all of / any of', etc.), please do. --sam Example 1: Single date condition 1a. Available from 5 December 2014 . 1b. Available until end of 7 December 2014 . Example 2: Single other condition 2a (completion). Not available unless: Participation statement is marked complete 2b (user field). Not available unless: Your Department is equal to Maths 2c (grouping). Not available unless: You belong to a group in Tutor groups Example 3: Multiple conditions Not available unless: It is on or after 5 December 2014 It is before end of 7 December 2014 Participation statement is marked complete You achieve a required score in Block 4 self-assessment Example 4: Multiple conditions (OR and nesting) ( This example is pretty complicated and I hope would be rare in reality. ) Not available unless any of: All of: It is on or after 5 December 2014 It is before end of 7 December 2014 Any of: Participation statement is marked complete You achieve a required score in Plagiarism practice You belong to a group in Teacher's pets",

          "Text": "I'm happy-ish with 'Not available unless'. That's wording taken from the current system, the main difference is that instead of including that wording with each individual condition (current system is like 'Not available unless you achieve a certain score in Fun Quiz'), the 'Not available unless' part becomes separate, either before a colon if there's only one condition, or as a heading to a list if there are several conditions. Don't like 'Restricted availability unless', sorry, I think that wording is even scarier for students. I like things that are (a) simple and (b) short. (Obviously both of those fall out of the window with the last example whatever the wording is, but you know, it could be even worse.) Basically what I've proposed is the best that I (and Tim) could come up with, and it is also similar to the current wording, so I'm reasonably happy with it. Just posting here in case anyone else has a genius idea. I've already had to redesign my entire API so I can do this kind of output, so I'm hopeful that any other genius ideas won't be so genius that they require me to redesign it again. The string I'm most doubtful about is 'Not available unless any of:', which I don't think is strictly speaking correct, but 'Not available unless any of the following are true' is really long and sounds totally like a programmer's way of describing something rather than something we should be telling students. Another option is 'Not available unless one of:' but really that has the same problem. If other people are like 'eh whatever that looks okay' then there's no problem, we'll go with it. --sam",

          "Text": "(I've also discussed this with Martin D in chat. Thanks both!) It looks like the situation - from Martin - is that we need to either delay this feature, or else just the groupmembersonly removal part of it, from 2.7 until 2.8. I'm currently thinking about whether it is sensible to remove the groupmembersonly-related changes. Of course that adds more work and means I won't be ready to submit the feature until even closer to the code freeze... We also would probably need to remove the group and grouping restrictions from this feature (leaving them in groupmembersonly) to avoid user confusion by having two interfaces to do the same thing. Or I guess they could be left in the code but disabled behind another experimental setting. So basically I'm not sure whether this is feasible given the rest of the work I haven't finished yet - i.e. I probably have time to finish it, or time to change it to remove group-related stuff, but probably not both. I think it might be better to move the whole thing to Moodle 2.8. On the other hand, because of the way Moodle development works there is a huge gap between 2.7 and 2.8 development during which the code will rot and this will make significant extra work... So I'm still thinking about it. The rest of this I somewhat agree with (I already have a solution for it vaguely planned). However, I do want to make a few points: 1. The current situation is not as rosy as implicitly suggested, since there are existing conditions which should be type 1 and are presently handled as type 2. For example, if you set a user profile condition like 'Department = Maths' that should be a permanent condition. 2. There are very few places which actually implement the groupmembersonly condition in lists of users like that (even though more probably should do). 3. I will implement a solution that I think people will be happy with HOWEVER it will still not be a perfect solution.The perfect solution is impossible with Moodle as it stands (and probably even in theory) because there are several ways other than availability conditions to restrict access to modules, and also some conditions could be either permanent or temporary (we can't tell). Here's what I am proposing: Within the availability API, there will be a way for condition plugins to indicate whether they are 'permanent' or 'temporary' conditions. Permanent conditions will need to provide a method to check that condition that can be done in bulk for a list of users and does not rely on individual user modinfo. Temporary conditions (= anything that actually should be temporary, + anything that can't efficiently be checked in bulk) will be ignored for the purpose of this list. (By 'ignored' I mean that if the condition is 'User must have TEMPORARY CONDITION' then it passes. But also, if the condition is 'User must NOT have TEMPORARY CONDITION' then it still passes too.) As you can see, it will be easy with this API to replicate lists of users for group and grouping conditions, including more complex ones that are not supported with current groupmembersonly. (E.g. 'User must belong to GROUPING A or GROUPING B', 'User must belong to GROUPING A but must not belong to GROUP X'.) --sam",

          "Text": "Thanks for comments. To update on this, and based on the previous discussion with Martin, I am now aiming to submit a version of this change for Moodle 2.7 although that is subject to Moodle HQ reviewing and accepting it. (I aim to submit it by end of next week which is before the stated code freeze on 4 April.) The planned version: Does not contain any modification to groupmembersonly - everything using groupmembersonly will behave exactly as at present. (That is to say, it will be broken in lots of ways that nobody much has noticed.) This reduces the scope of the change by a reasonable chunk, i.e. it is basically confined to library files apart from a few small cases where I moved a function, and doesn't affect individual modules etc. Does contain support for 'bulk' checks for permanent access conditions when listing users, as outlined above, although this will not be used initially by other areas of code. (Obviously the long-term intention is that this API would be used in places that previously call groupmembersonly-specific APIs, but as above, I won't be switching any code to actually use it.) The group/grouping availabilty conditions from the new system will be available for sections (which don't have groupmembersonly and don't have code all over the place using them). I will make it so you can't add group/grouping availability conditions for modules. (I was thinking about leaving them on if groupmembersonly is disabled, but that might possibly confuse. A bit up in the air. Would be easy to change later anyhow.) I was hoping to make a screencast this evening demonstrating the feature, but making all the changes above has obviously set me back by about a day, so it's not quite ready to show yet. Maybe Monday evening! --sam",

We have on-campus working groups and staff use the system as well. What if you just use the more generic term \"Participant\" (similar to how there is a Participants list)? I was really confused by the \"eye\" icon and was wondering what it mean until you got around to mentioning it. Before you explained it, I thought it was a status indicator if the condition was met or not. Don't know what to do to improve it. When you add a new condition it automatically says \"Invalid\", which is potentially upsetting to the user using it. What if the initial state is \"Please set the condition\" or something friendlier? Then if the user chooses an invalid condition then display the \"Invalid\" message? I really like the restriction picker. However, some notes: For \"Activity completion\", I feel it should be more obvious that it refers to another activity. What about you word the sentence \"Require participants to complete (or not complete) another activity\"? For \"Date\" the wording says \"until\" and \"after\", but in the demo the dropdown state for Date is \"from\". Can the wording be made consistent? I am hoping this gets to 2.7, since we will be on that version for at least the next 2 years.",

I think it's officially okay (Moodle policy) to use the word 'student' in language strings within the editing interface, to simplify matters. (None of this interface actually appears to students, remember. Er. To participants...) Could somebody correct me if I'm wrong and another word is preferred, Mary maybe? This is another case where friendliness won over accuracy - the restrictions might apply to other people who aren't students, it depends on your role setup etc. 2. The eye icons are a bit confusing but are quite fully explained by the popup tooltip, and are elegantly small at least. It may not matter too much as the default (visible) is probably okay most of the time. By the way, if you mean you couldn't tell it was supposed to be an eye, sorry but these are default Moodle theme show/hide icons, feel free to override in your theme. 3. Agree, but your text is probably a bit long - I've changed it to 'Please set'. (I don't want to do logic for different times it appears, don't think this is needed,) 4. Agree with both points, have fixed these. --sam",

Since I translate the Moodle interface in french, I'm a bit concerned about some potential problems when translating this. Some of my notes may be irrelevant, as my english is quite imperfect. The phrase \"Student [must|must not] match [all|any] of the following\" should be improved. If I understand correctly, a student cannot match a date (in french at least, this is the case). I'll suggest something like \"[All|Any] of the following conditions [must|must not] be fulfilled (or met?)\". In the same phrase, the string parameter [All|Any] in the combination with \"of the following\" could pose problem, as the wording is (en french at least) not the same with \"all\" than with \"any\". In french, \"all of the following\" is \"toutes les conditions suivantes\", but \"any of the following\" is \"une des conditions suivantes\" (notice the change of the article \"les\" -> \"des\"). I didn't look at your code, but I suggest that the strings and their parameters allow for such constructs. Thanks again, and cheers, Nicolas",

I did think about it a bit and I think the current wording is a pretty good compromise between friendly language and accuracy. When you make it more accurate, it tends to become longer and harder to understand or have programmer-ish text... Regarding the translation - it works like this depending on whether there is only one dropdown (single condition that you can choose NOT or, er, not) or two: X [dropdown] Y [dropdown] Z or X [dropdown] Z2 You can change strings X, Y, and Z/Z2 and the text of the dropdowns. Seems reasonably flexible regarding different orderings etc, correct me if wrong.

          "Title": "Redesign Activity Chooser",
          "Text": "Hi All, As time goes by the legacy divide between \"Activity\" and \"Resource\" is making less sense for us (our University). A simple illustration of this are the Big Blue Button Session vs Recording types which are at opposite ends of the activity chooser (see screen shot). I will concede we need to remove some of the plugins we have at the moment which would help, but the point remains this is not the best in terms of organisation / usability . Another example is the separation of SCORM / IMS, I know why they are split, but it makes little sense unless the SCORM activity actually uses tracking, often they do not. Does this distinction make any sense at all to a non technical teacher? I would suggest not. I see this problem potentially being compounded if we try to make better use of Bootstrap elements. For example if we want to add additional permutations of \"label\" which could be used to build Bootstrap elements like \"hero\", thumbnails etc there are would seem to be two options: Extend the text editor Add more resource types This can be done in text editors but anyone who has used similar things in Wordpress (shortcode builders embedded in the WYSIWYG ) will know that whilst this can do a good job of building the element to edit it afterwards you need to meddle with the code, which leads me to think resource types would be a better way to handle this? What I think may work better in terms of the activity chooser would be the option to group items according to their function / type and for the layout to be horizontal, headings at the top, items below in columns and descriptions perhaps shown below, or on tooltip. Ideally it would be configurable, i.e. you would be able to alter headings / sections and assign plugins to those sections. Something similar was done with the layout in 1.9 by Sussex University but I believe it was a core modification, not distributable, you can see what they did here: http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/elearningteam/files/2013/10/add_resource.png I am not suggesting that layout, I don't think it makes good use of space / would not scale, but the organisation of elements beyond \"Activity\" \"Resource\" makes increasing sense to me. The other issue with the current activity chooser is the waste of space in the description section (right hand column). Again this is shown in the screen shot below where we have a lot of whitespace below a short description of the activity type. I know other activities (Quiz, Assignment for example) make full use of that space, but it would perhaps make more sense to use tooltips or Modal to show this information?. I do not mean to be a whinge or be seen as overly critical of the current arrangement (which does work), just sharing my thoughts... which are there maybe some room for improvement An illustration of what we see with BBB in the default activity chooser currently:",

Atto will be the default in new installations, but this will be configurable by admins. The creation of plugins for Atto is (reported to be) easier than TinyMCE. There is some information on creating plugins at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Atto#Atto_Plugins but I suspect there is more detail needed. We need a pioneer outside HQ to give this a go and help improve that. By the way, if we'd upgraded to TinyMCE 4, you would have had to rewrite your plugins as they have changed their API.

          "Title": "Feedback for new opportunity - Mark as all read",
          "Text": "I’m a student at a university of technology on Cyprus and I use the moodle just like other students. From the use of this moodle I have discovered some new ways to improve new functions. The function that interests me is part of the function of messages. At my university we use the function of messages to communicate between as about a subject, so that we are continuously updated for any course. The moodle platform gives as the opportunity to connect with any account for example: Gmail account, Hotmail etc… so that incoming messages are sent there .To make it clear, if someone sends me a message and I’m not connected to moodle account I can receive it through my email. So now I want to propose a modification for the domain of messages, about the function which use a popup window to inform the user for new messages. Existing Function When a user has new messages a popup window pops up. The popup window has two options: 1) Go to messages When the user presses on the link a new window appears, so from then on he can read his messages. (If he has messages from more than one user, then he must to choose the messages that he will read) 2) Ignore When the user presses on the ignore link the popup window disappears. But when the user logs in again the popup appears, regardless if he had read his messages from his other account. Suggestion What I suggest is to create a third option which is “ Mark as all read ”. So I have come to this option after I have researched it with quizzes in my university. The results that I have found are very positive and the student think it will be very useful. Like we have seen different organizations like google, outlook, etc. they have already added something similar. What does the function do? When the user presses on the mark as all read link then the unread messages will get transferred from “ message” table (Stores all unread messages) to the “ message_read” table (Stores all messages that have been read). The user gets transferred to the Homepage! The next time the user logs in, the popup will not appear except if he has new messages. Why did I choose mark as all read? The popup window displays the messages that a user has. If he has more than one message then it displays the total of the messages. The user most likely has read the messages from the other account so the mark as all read option will be useful. If the user observes that the total messages are more than he has read then he will have the option go to messages, where he will read the message that he wants. The next time that he will log in and the popup appears, then he will have the option 3. If the user hasn’t read all his messages but presses on the option 3 then the message are still in his email account. The “Ignore” option is very important because it forces us to read all the messages and we were always informed. But many times we read the messages from the other account and not from the moodle account and the number of unread messages increases. So, I believe that this option is a very good idea and it will be very useful. I would really appreciate any feedback for the new opportunity that I propose. Thanks in advance, Koulla.",

Jokes aside, there is one thing that I don't see discussed there, and I think is quite central: differentiated handling of old logs vs recent logs (vs very old logs?). We want to write them out fast and low-overhead. Whatever this storage is, it won't be query-able, or will have restrictions. So at least we should say: our read/query log API is not guaranteed to see the very latest entries. In fact, you probably can't see the last 5m of activity - deal with it. Anything that wants to see the very latest entries needs perhaps a different approach. Perhaps the logging layer has some pre-cooked hardcodes bits that are tailored to run fast (keep a list of recently seen usernames, keep a tally of pages loaded in the last N minutes), or modules could register a callback. Either way, these are hot paths. A bit of, ahem, not entirely thought through code here can throw the handbrake on. Big time.",

The set of operators allowed in $selectwhere are :- =, <>, >, >=, <, <=, != The set of keywords allowed in $selectwhere are :- IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL Use of anything besides the mentioned keywords/operators is strictly forbidden. I assume that means something like a string \"userid = 123 AND value > 3 AND time BETWEEN 1234567890 AND 1234567900\". Note you, have not said AND is an allowed operator! Also, I see no need or advantage in allowing both <> and !=. <> is the SQL standard operator. Let us insist on that. Instead of invention some new thing (pseudo-SQL string that then each implementation has to parse) why not instead do something like we already do in $DB, e.g. the above would become array('userid' => 123, 'value' => array('>', 3), 'time' = array('BETWEEN', 1234567890, 1234567900)) This would be nicer if we used the new PHP array syntax: ['userid' => 123, 'value' => ['>', 3], 'time' = ['BETWEEN', 1234567890, 1234567900]] If we decided that this format is nice, we could even start using in in $DB methods like get_records as well as here.",

I agree that duplicating code is bad, and should be avoided, but people have been avoiding duplication in object-oriented code for years in many computer languages without using trendy language features like traits, so I would like to see a proper justification why traits are the only solution here, otherwise, the blind assertion from the developers just makes me think one of they are just having fund playing with a trendy new language features; or they just don't know the standard object-orented techniques (design patterns) that would like them do this without traits.",

Interestingly thats something none of our tutors have a problem with when writing a book or article where they expect a designer to do that work for them! At sussex we basically did a medium/evernote and stripped all the crud while making their content look beautiful so editors didn't have to. With the new emphasis on ui and usability i'm thoroughly looking fwd to the moodle front end team moving towards an interface more like medium soon.",

One of my biggest concerns with Atto is the lack of subscript/superscript button and the symbol button.  I'm a high school chemistry teacher.  I'm not concerned for my use.  I know enough HTML to manage these things myself.  I'm concerned for my students.  If they are posting in the forum how are they to go about writing something like MgSO 4 •7H 2 O? Secondly, the disappearance of the Paste as Plain Text.  If this goes away, as the site admin, I'll start getting all kinds of calls from teachers asking why the stuff they copied and pasted looks strange and is doing strange things.  I'm less concerned about the loss of Paste from Word since the Paste as Plain text would help on that end also. As I understand it, the goal with the editors is to make something easy for everyone to use.  Dropping those out of Atto makes Atto more difficult to use.  People shouldn't have to muck around in the HTML do simple things.",

Broadly speaking, You will be able to do pretty much exactly what you can do now with the current editor. However, when you look at the details, there will be some minor improvements: It should be less fiddly to use. For example you should be able to drag images directly into the editor, rather than having to fiddle around with dialogue boxes. That annoying thing where it takes several seconds, or longer, for the editor to appear should be fixed. Behind the scenes, it will generate HTML that does a better job of complying with accessibility best practice. Not that exciting, but important for some learners. ...",

This means that Moodle will have to know the exact structure of the logging implementation. Only the interface methods for getting logs may not be enough. One way to deal with it, would be to keep a minimal core SQL DB log table forever. So an even would be created but for some logs they would go to mdl_log as well. This could be a minimal set of log events with a minimal amount of data - just to suffice for common functionality that uses log table at the moment. Another way to deal with it, would be to create a set of interfaces for each functionality that we need from logs, eg: interface login_information with log_login_errors method to cover http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_usage#lib.2Fcronlib.php . This way, when some functionality would be required (e.g. finding failed logins since), log mechanisms would be queried. The first one that implements appropriate interface would be used. If none, then the feature would not be available. Another point, invoking get_events like this: \n```text\n$reader->get_events($select, $params, 'timecreated DESC, id DESC', $page*$perpage, $perpage);\n```\n looks to me like every log plugin will *have to* expose/store data in SQL table, is that intentional?

Some logged actions do not contain important information needed later. New framework won't help for #1 - logging will still need to be added ad-hoc by developers. To fix this, we would need to think about front-end controller that does the logging without having a need for developer to implement that explicitly. The same goes for #2 above - we need more data passed not the new framework. As for: log tables are joined in many popular queries and are slow This can easily be fixed without complete rewrite as well - it'd be enough to log as we do now and also trigger an event. So - what are existing issues with logging at the moment? I don't think we need a complete rewrite and new architecture to solve issues listed in http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Logging_2#Existing_problems . By creating whole new logging layer we are: reducing reliability (introducing new bugs, new layer, more components) introducing more complexity (logging is dead simple now, does it have to be complex?) decreasing performance (direct write to table  vs event -> observer/listener -> write to table) creating more work just to catch up with the existing features at the end of that phase we will have no added value (as there will be no other logging plugins) I would think about what really is important and implement just that, for example: events seem like a great idea, maybe just trigger an event after we do a normal write to DB? If anyone needs to consume logging event, then even creating local plugin may be OK, do we really need more interfaces? Look at messaging plugins for example - nobody is really using them and that has added more complexity into Moodle structuring log data is again a great idea - we can do it already without complete rewrite (e.g. add more columns to mdl_log) we need to tackle SQL joins on mdl_log no matter what - so let's do it now and then think about the rewrite. Maybe we should put some data (like logins) into a separate table, as suggested by Petr? In general, I would suggest to first see what we need and then create a framework/layer for our needs, instead of doing the opposite - creating architecture that we may need in the future. Tomek",

It took me a little while to get my head around the way in which YUI3 handles things, but once it clicked it made a lot more sense for me and the benefits for Moodle become clearer. I've been trying to improve the Moodle YUI documentation over the past year or so, but if there's something specific you think we're missing I can put pen to paper and try and clarify things further. The way in which we now handle YUI (as of Moodle 2.5) is much more similar to the way in which YUI handle YUI and generally the upstream documentation is worth having on tap. The only real things to bear in mind as key differences are: you must write your JS in a YUI module (see the Shifter and Module docs below) our module namespace is moodle-frankenstyle_modname-yuimodulename you must include YUI modules from php using $PAGE->requires->yui_module('moodle-frankenstyle_modname-yuimodulename', 'M.frankenstyle_modname.yuiodulename.initFunction', array(array('a' => 'list', 'of' => 'arguments')); This is the Moodle-specific documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI - general introduction http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Modules - this is more on why, and how to use YUI modules in Moodle http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Shifter - some more information on building YUI modules (plus rationale again) In terms of upstream documentation, the YUI API is really handy and I find myself delving into it to find and check things daily - http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/ The YUI user guides ( http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/ ) are also very useful, as are the examples which you'll find on the right-hand side in the user guides). I'd also highly recommend Evan Goer's O'Reilly cookbook. He's provided a three-chapter sample at http://www.goer.org/YUI/ which is also extremely handy. Hope that this helps, and as I say, if there's anything specific you think we could do with documentation on, I'll try my best to whip something up. Best wishes and happy New Year, Andrew",

The specification is based off of our currently working feature Joule Grader. You can see demonstrations of Joule grader in the following YouTube videos: While this funcitonality exists in our product we would like to make it part of Moodle as a whole. The reason for this is to provide a more cohesive integration and better maintenance as Moodle features like Assignment continue to change. We also want to release this so that our community contributed advanced forums plugin will have all of the features we intended it to have. I would love to hear any feedback, comments and recommended changes to the currently proposed functionality. While the functionality exists currently we beleive it can always get better. We also have a technical specification for how we propose the API to work for other Moodle plugins to follow.

It is not our intention, our intention is to be a good open source community member and improve Moodle for all. The activity grader has been fully baked, we have had clients using it for 1.5 years and have modified it and updated it in several ways based on their input. It is our opinion that it is to the point where the only positive progression forward is the inclusion of more activities within it. When it comes to inclusion of more activities we have 2 options: 1. Continue how we have and hack parts of core Moodle to add activity support and maintain these hacks as the core activities are modified. 2. Ask that Moodle and the community to consider the inclusion of an activity grading interface and work with the community towards consolidating activity grading. We could release this interface to the community via the plugins but then that would require community members to maintain core hacks. We want to be good citizens and so we try to stay away from releasing features that require core modifications. On your point about commenting on other's specifications, I believe we have participated in many ways. I have commented on several of the tickets in the tracker on requested features, we have provided accessibility feedback on several tickets and our developers have reviewed several specifications for suggested features. If there is something specific you would like comments on I would be happy to review it and give feedback. There is nothing about this specification that requires it be in Moodle 2.6, we would definitely think the community would benefit most if it was in 2.6. The interface already works, as I said it has been used for 1.5 years. We can demo it now, in fact anyone can test it out on our public demo site at http://demo2k12.moodlerooms.com/ . We plan to complete the lions share of the work that needs to be done to complete the inclusion into core. We are more than happy maintaining it as a proprietary feature of our product or considering its release as a plugin that requires core modifications and updates with each Moodle release. The reactions to the interface we have received at Moots, from prospects, and our clients though pushed us to request that the feature be added to Moodle and not released as a plugin.",

See e.g. MDL-31237 - How would this interact with sites using TurnItIn or similar? Can this display TurnItIn assignments? Could it help in allowing Advanced Grading (e.g. a rubric) with those assignments?",

Originally we were unable to allow users to adjust the size of the columns, since our last release this has changed and we are considering improving this. 2. We are adding that to our December 2013 release of Joule so that change would be included. 3. Currently only Forums is supported and we could probably add rating capability to the interface, but the original idea was that you would review the forum and rate the posts then use grading interface to grade the overall performance. The idea was that ratings would be used as a metric for grading but not as the grade. Database and glossary don't support grading. Long term I would love to convince Moodle HQ to add grading to many more activities. 4. At the moment no, but that is something we will be looking into as part of the Assignment grading work flow that was added in Moodle 2.6. Long term imo this interface needs to support all grading options a teacher would want for a course. 5. Turnitin would depend on what plugin you are using. Joule grader will have an API that activity plugins can take advantage of. Turnitin Direct would need to add Joule grader support to their plugin. If you are using the plagiarism plugin not the activity then that like PDF annotation should be supported in this interface. But needs to be added. This is something we would need to look into further.",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, I've been working on a tool to replace the course and category management pages within Moodle and I'd love to get a bit of feedback or see if anyone has any interesting ideas. First up there is a tracker issue for the new tool: MDL-31830 I've created a prototype of the tool that can be found on my github account https://github.com/samhemelryk/moodle-tool_coursemanagement and is already functional. It is in it's very early stages and has only been tested in Firefox + Chrome and presently requires JavaScript however if you're keen to test it out your more than welcome, have a read of the README and on the tracker issue first though just to get an idea of its state. So a bit about this tool... I have created with the hope of simplifying the process of creating, ordering, managing and deleting both courses and categories. It does this by providing all of its management functionality through a single UI (page) that is kept optimal thanks to AJAX loading of content and makes use of JS enhancements such as drag and drop reordering and moving of courses (and in the future categories). As mentioned it is a prototype and presently you can do the following with this tool: When viewing a category: Expand the category tree to see subcategories. This happens via AJAX with no reloads or redirections. Create a new basic course through a JS widget that gets automatically added to the stack with no reloads or redirections. When viewing courses in a category: Use drag and drop to reorder the courses within a category. AJAX is used so that this happens immediately behind the scenes no reloads or redirections. Drag a course over another category to move the course from its current category to the targeted category. Click on a course to view details. Details are loaded by AJAX with no reloads or redirections. When viewing a courses details: Perform normal actions such as editing, deleting through the existing methods. At the moment I'd like to see if there is any feedback or good ideas before continuing with development. When I do I hope to implement drag and drop functionality for the organisation of categories as well as a JS in-page widget to quickly create categories (like you presently can with courses). I'd also like to include a means of accessing category actions (edit/delete/permissions) and finally bulk actions for courses (you'll notice there are checkboxes already this is what they are for). The following are a couple of screenshots I've taken of it just to give you a quick idea of its looks. Both have been scales down so if you want a better look open the image in a tab separately. So please if you have 5 minutes to spare and are interested I'd be keen to see what you have to say about it, doubly so if you have had a wee play with it. My appologies if there are bugs, its pretty likely as this is very early on in development. Cheers Sam",

I could easily create an action for the courses in the list to duplicate them. It would rely on the backup and restore system and could execute a backup and then restore behind the scenes. Of course the user would be required to have the required permissions but that isn't a problem. I think this is a really good idea and have created a sub-task from the main issue to see it implemented (or at least so that it is not forgotten). b) This is a little more difficult, I think technically it is possible and again could be achieved through the backup+restore systems however I could imagine the mechanics for it would be quite a bit more difficult and out of reach for the initial version of this tool. That being said I'll keep it in mind as we are yet to see where this tool goes. Once more thank you very much for the feedback! Cheers Sam",

Reading that line basically put our plans for upgrading our 2.3 setup to 2.5 rather than 2.4 over the summer on hold. Some other people might not have sought clarification and just decided to stick with what they've got on that basis. Which is a problem that Google Apps don't really have. If they upgrade and break something on IE8 then your choice is like it or lump it. Everyone running their own Moodle has to take that upgrade decision independently, so you might want to put the emphasis on the carrot (e.g. the drag'n'drop functionality has been really good for getting people onto Chrome/ Firefox at our institution) rather than the stick. You might also want to be explicit, in the dev docs, about exactly which versions of IE you are happy to actively and intentionally break. I had a conversation in a bug report in the last couple of weeks that suggested that \"supporting\" IE7 was still a requirement for any change, and your comment here similarly focuses on \"new bugs\" rather than on development decisions that will knowingly exclude IE8 from working for large swathes of Moodle e.g. adopting JQuery 2.0 (I realise that Moodle doesn't use JQuery, but it's the most prominent 3rd party library example I could think of that has dropped IE8 support and provides a benefit, they claim it's faster, as a result) so you might end up in a worst of both worlds situation where you're actually doing the work (or holding back progress) in order to support IE7/8, while also scaring off people from upgrading by announcing you don't support them.",

Surely the fact that bugs and errors will progressively break a users experience the more out of date their software becomes is bad enough for the end user without being directly disenfranchised by the page they are trying to view? By all means inform a user their stuff is old and provide a link on how to fix it but I thought blocking users because of their browser, began dying off sometime in the middle of the last decade because it smacks of elitism and punishes the less technically adept. YMMV. Cheers, Sam.",

          "Text": "I'm currently looking to address a number of issues we've identified with forum notifications. The issues that we've identified all relate to the volume of e-mail generated by the Moodle forums. One of these will hopefully be addressed in MDL-39707 with introduction of per-thread subscription. Force Subscribe forums We make a lot of use forums in a force-subscribe mode. This is because we want to ensure that students receive notifications for some forums. We therefore want all students to be forcibly enrolled. However... some of our staff also want to receive notifications, whilst others don't. Most often this can be accomplished by using different roles for different types of staff (e.g. Teaching staff vs. Administrative staff), but often we have many members of teaching staff and not all of them want to receive notifications. This is currently handled using a capability - mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe (introduced in MDL-33166 ). Anyone with this capability is forcibly subscribed to the forum, whilst anyone without the capability cannot subscribe. We'd like to propose introduction of an additional capability - mod/forum:allowforce un subscribe to allow certain roles to unsubscribe from forum notifications. I've raised MDL-40483 to propose the introduction of this new capability. Per-Forum Digest settings The final area we've identified for improvement is that of the volume of e-mail for forums where a user is interested in the content. At present, it is possible to choose how to receive forum notifications with three options: No Digest - single e-mail per forum post Digest Complete - a daily digest with the full post details Digest Subjects - a daily digest with the post subject only We're proposing that this be changed to a per-forum setting with fall back to a per-user preference so that users can have a default setting, and override this on a per-forum basis. This change was raised in MDL-4908 may years ago but has not been addressed to date. I've written a brief specification of the changes in http://docs.moodle.org/dev/mod_forum-subscriptions . Summary I would really appreciate any feedback that people have for the new capability introduction, and the per-forum digest setting. Thanks in advance, Andrew",

So perhaps along with the capability we would need to design an easy to use centralised interface for each user that displayed their forums (or groups of forums) along with their subscription settings and then ideally allow them to manage them from there.

The docs page with the record of discussions is available here http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Perth_Hackfest_October_2012/Custom_fields_and_Metadata .\n\nDiscussion centred around the best database back-end for this feature, with two competing options of\n\na) flat _extend tables being available on every table in Moodle which would dynamically be updated to add columns every time a new custom field is added e..g course_extend, user_extend\n\nb) a set of custom field tables one for each key data type with property/value pairs and a mapping using the usual system to identify what object the specific row relates to.\n\nA 'definitions' table is needed in both cases to describe the user interface for the fields and as a foreign key to the custom fields table(s).\n\nAs I remember, the agreed next steps were to engage more developers in discussing the relative merits of these two options and for further research into the database performance of the differing queries that would be needed to obtain a single object representing a course/user/whatever with all its custom data. Hopefully those Moodle Partners and others with existing custom field solutions will be able to help with this investigation.\n\nI blogged about my thoughts a bit here http://ltsdevmusings.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/moodle-custom-fields/ and got some interesting feedback. I was also asked whether there is a forum thread or tracker issue for this. So here I am setting up the forum thread! There are a number of existing tracker issues on this theme, so I haven't created a new one (yet) as we should probably have a clean-up once we know what we want to do.\n\nSo please, everyone and especially SQL gurus, share here your thoughts & evidence about how best to make these kinds of queries quick!",

There is one table for long text, short text, integer, and decimal data.  Each table has the same basic structure: the regular id field, a field_id (indicating the custom field that the data is associated with), a context_id (indicating the context [1] that the data is associated with), and a data field. There are a few other tables, but those four are the main ones of interest in this discussion. An advantage of this method is that you don't need to grant permissions to modify the database schema.  A disadvantage is that you're stuck with \"four sizes fit all\", which is an improvement over the \"one size fits all\" approach of Moodle's custom user fields, but you can't, say, customize the precision of numeric data. [1] Custom fields are associated with contexts, so fields can be attached to courses, users, activities , categories, or ELIS' custom contexts.  If I were to redesign it from scratch today, I might instead have \"type\" and \"instanceid\" fields, similar to mdl_context's \"contextlevel\" and \"instanceid\", or mdl_course_modules' \"module\" and \"instance\" fields.  This would let you attach custom fields to anything that had an ID, which may not necessarily be a context.",

Also let me know if I've misunderstood any implementation details. I didn't bother with indexes on the data fields at this stage.

The pivot hack refers to a way of getting the custom data via a single join suggested by Loic - see the query for details.

For example, if we have a field type \"Licence\" with a fixed set of possible values like \"All rights reserved\", \"CC-BY-NC\", ... then the set of permitted values should be the same for all types of object that have a License field. However, the Licence field for objects of type Resources could well be a different field than the Licence field for Qusetions in the question bank. On the other hand, even if they are separate field, we may still want to search for objects of any type where Licence = CC-BY-NC. Indeed, Objects that metadata can be applied to would naturally form a type hierarchy, and you might apply some metadata fields to the base Object type, and others only to specific sub-types - or that might be too complex. Clearly, lots of design decisions to make here.",

Then our choice is about how we reflect this in the definitions table - I think we have to create multiple entries, one for each object. So where that gets us for the queries, is Justin is right that the unique identifier for the object being extended would make them look like two different fields even though the definitions themselves are the same thing to the human eye.",

If I understand correctly, the two proposed implementations would break some of these features. Here are a few questions on the purpose of the future custom fields: Should the custom fields be declared at the platform level or created at the fly?\nE.g. should a course form allow the teacher to add whatever key/values he wishes for? If a previous definition is still required, should a custom field be defined per target\n(user, course, etc) or globally?\nOr both, i.e. some fields apply only to a specific target and some to everything? Should a category system still exist on custom fields? Our POV: If custom fields definitions were to disappear, it would be a major drawback.\nWe really need to declare that some added fields are locked or hidden. A per-target definition is important to us, whereas global fields are not.\nGlobal fileds would also add complexity (both for the users and the developers). We need categories when the are dozens of custom fields. For a quick explanation of our POV, we have developed for a client a custom field system in Moodle.\nIt's in the tracker\nwith the code and documentation on Github .\nIt is an extension of the current user profile system to other objects.\nIts SQL schema was partly de-normalized for performance reasons.\nWe only added an UI to handle course custom fields\n(by sharing code with the user profile UI),\nbut it would be easy to add interfaces for other objects (cohorts, etc),\nor create a generic web page for the custom fields of all targets.",

As far as your questions go: Fields absolutely must be predefined.  Having different fields for different courses would create a big mess. It seems to me that everyone agrees that fields should be defined per-target. (e.g. it makes no sense to have a license field for users.)  Some people want fields to apply to multiple targets.  I think that would be a useful feature, if it can be implemented sensibly without making it too confusing for users. Most probably, yes.  Ideally, IMHO , the custom user profile fields would be replaced by the new generic custom field system -- it's silly to have two different custom field systems, especially if one is generic.  So the new system should have all the features of the current system.",

Other than that, I'm a lot more interested in how this will be implemented in the UI. We are a Remote Learner customer, and we have ELIS. We find it very difficult to use, primarily because the added fields are not integrated with the objects they go with (other than User Profile fields). For example, a field added to a course attaches to a separate \"Course Instance\" object instead of attaching to the actual course, and the fields are not visible within the course itself. This means we can't use these extra fields to store information about each course in a way that other users, e.g. instructors, can easily see it. We can't use existing bulk course creation tools to modify these fields. (Remote Learner's own Integration Point/DataHub utilities require us to update Moodle courses and ELIS course instances separately.) We can't report on those fields easily, either. I was very excited to see the integration request by François Gannaz in MDL-34634 because it seemed to me that this would integrate with the existing functionality in the same way that the User Profile fields do, which is very usable. Couldn't we get this moving for inclusion in 2.6? Are any of the other proposed back-end implementations that much more efficient? Are we letting perfect be the enemy of good?",

Moodle's dominance ... ultimately will loose (sic) it the users it depends on. Get with this century Moodle!\" Hmm.... I guess my real question is this: how do I win over my management to Moodle 2.x in the face of other competiting GUI-and-more-Web 2.0-and-Facebook-like-and-Google-Apps-like-based LMSes? It seems to me that Moodle being free (except for server rental costs and IT staffing) is great, but it seems that GenX digital natives and technologically-challenged-oldie-mouldies are preferring the LMSes with pizzazz and graphical interfaces. We're talking about a measure of success of a LMS is in the number of teachers who end up adopting it and using it regularly. Regards Frankie Kam",

On the one hand I have personal experience of how people will chose beauty and convenience over security and functionality.  I was selling software during the phase from DOS to Windows and people wanted a proper MS Windows (TM) version even if the DOS version was better software.  The division of HQ development into Frontend and Backend does promise a better user experience in the long term. Moodle has made significant strides in terms of usability for example the drag and drop file capability and many other tweaks. The ability to install plugins from within the browser offers the possibility of greater experimentation and uptake of contributed code.  If quizzing is important to an organisation then Moodle simply wins period, nothing else available paid for or free is even in the same league.",

          "Text": "Its not just about beauty either. That helps, but in the end, it is about PERCEPTION of the user. Does the user PERCEIVE that one software or hardware is better than another? This battle is fought constantly between tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.) I have personally been stung by choosing the technologically superior software over the less capable one, only to see public opinion squeeze out the technologically superior one. We might remember the old battle over Betamax and VHS. In my opinion, Betamax was the superior one in features, but VHS won. Or, you may remember the BlyRay battle. In so many ways, Bluray wasn't the better format, but it won. Why? Current market share of moodle will not win in the long run just because it has a lot of users. Only if moodle begins an aggressive marketing strategy will it win. So far, moodle hasn't faced much competition. I think Blackboard is the main competitor. But slowly, blackboard has been the predominant player against moodle on college campuses simply because it has a professional marketing staff who actively go to the purchasing people at campuses and promote their platform. The typical decider on campus might not be a LMS expert, and will choose Blackboard simply because moodle wasn't presented well by a \"techie\" person who is better able to show the \"how\" than the \"why\". The end result is that moodle loses because it doesn't have the promotional backing. Again, its all about PERCEPTION. So, we can lose this race if we don't do something as a community to change people's perception of moodle. The most important issues to deal with, in my opinion, are the following: Moodle is hard to use. Not true, but still, many perceive it that way Moodle's interface is \"old\". I think that is true, and as Frankie puts it, the \"beauty\" isn't there. That's a technical issue, and if the moodle developers concentrate on this, that will be great, but it still won't win the day because as a community, we moodle users don't promote what moodle can do. Unfortunately, moodle has a negative history in the minds of some influential people. Simply fixing the interface is not enough. After it is fixed, there has to be a promotional campaign. Moodle is hard to install and support. If you have a great techie staff, this doesn't matter. But if you make moodle support a part time job for a teacher or staff person, users will get frustrated, and frustrated users become enemies. The only solution here is to offer professional top notch support 24/7. Companies like Blackboard can afford to do this because they make money selling their product. Part time people on campus cannot. An upgrade path. This means that once moodle is installed, the system deciders (high level administrators) want to know that their investment will be continually \"modernized\". Things always change in education, and educational institutions must be on the cutting edge. Moodle falls down on this point. As Frankie pointed out, where are things like HTML5 support. Is phone and tablet support a high priority? How hard is it to upgrade moodle to include those items? If LMS competitors have such things, guess what? They are going to stress how well they can support a cell phone screen or tablet, and to a busy administrator (decision maker), when they see how easy it is for a student to do work on a cell phone, then all the other technical superior features moodle has won't matter. Again, its about perception, not reality. If its so simple, even a caveman can do it, then it will win in the court of public opinion. Well, these are the things that someone who promotes moodle ought to consider. The thing we have going against us is that we don't have marketing specialists. The free, user supported model that is moodle's biggest strength can also be what kills moodle. I don't have any easy answers, but if some company wanted a great business opportunity, it could create a method whereby those who wanted professional support could hire them and they could charge for that. Of course, there are companies that already do that. But what they lack is the right to SELL moodle. The current moodle license prohibits that, but I think that in order for moodle to survive, it will have to branch out and have a two-tiered business model. The free model will need to continue, but a paid-for version will need to be allowed also. Perhaps a version of moodle that has all the bells and whistles could be allowed by the general moodle license. I envision something like the Linux model. There are free versions of Linux, but there are also professional versions that have \"value-added\" to them. Moodle needs to have this model also if it is to survive. I hope it does. I love Moodle, but I am a techie. From the user and administrator point of view, moodle DOES seem to be \"old\". Only a company that has skin in the game can rescue this by letting the free market decide based on the public's perception. And, that perceptin won't change based on technical features. It will only change if it is actively marketed, and that can only happen if money can be made.",

          "Text": "Doug, I agree that perception is everything! I have exactly the same issue to face over the next 6-12 months here: Two universities merged, one using Moodle one using Bb. I am the Moodle support, advocate, manager, evangelist, ninja -  but Bb have already had marketing people in talking to those higher up the decision making tree than I am, sponsoring events and so on, ever since the merger was first talked about (and before) even though all the users I've spoken to on the ground who have experience of both systems want Moodle. And your comments about 'being on the cutting edge' - Moodle is already using HTML5, it has responsive themes (even more coming now bootstrap is included - although other responsive flavours have been available for a while) It also has device detection which allowed separate Mobile themes to be used, it has a mobile app, and mobile/responsive seems to be the main priority for the frontend team at HQ - so I think Moodle is already there (as in pushing things forward on the cutting edge, not as in being at the end of the race!) and these things seem to happen much faster in Moodle than in commercial equivalents. The difference, which does tie in to your point, is that as you say, the commercial marketing departments create one heck of a song and dance about it - quietly covering up the bits that their products DONT do, until they launch them with an even bigger song and dance when they do. Is Moodle behind its competitors - I don't think so in general, although I'm sure we can all pick on specifics of Moodle that a particular other product does in a really nice way that we'd love to see in Moodle: But the 'this works in facebook' and 'that works in Wordpress' and 'such and such works in XYZ' is not always easy (or appropriate) to apply to a.n.other piece of software - Would the Wordpress back end work well for Twitter? Yes, there are definitely things Moodle can learn from all of them, but perhaps we also need to start shouting back about some of the things they could learn from Moodle . If someone like yourself or Frankie or myself, all active in the community, find it difficult to highlight these things, how much harder is it for a decsion-maker faced with a keen teacher advocating Moodle on one hand and a slick marketing rep drilled in all the strong points of their product (and how to cover the rest) on the other. However, I don't think you are correct that moodle needs to change in order to offer the two-tiered business model: Its already in place isn't it? The work done by many moodle partners, and products like Totara being built on top of 'free moodle' would suggest that this already happens, within the existing structure. This is exactly what happens in the Linux world - its not Linux (the kernel) that comes as  paid-for commercial versions, but the bells and whistles of the distribution and the support packages. Those commercial companies do not sell 'Linux' - they can't its open source (or at least without being an open-source/copyright lawyer I'll just say there's no point as Linux itself is freely available), just like Moodle - what they sell is the extras and the services, which as I understand it is the same model that the likes of MoodleRooms et al already use. Its often easy to look at moodle and the community and say how much better the 'product' could be, because as so many of the community are developers, we are always trying to push Moodle further and further forward, so it always seems like we are addressing weaknesses, while other companies develop (or buy up!!) in the background, shouting about what their existing product can already do, almost hiding the weaknesses until they have something new to offer. And also because we are constantly striving to address the edge cases (or not so edge, but institution specific) that people come to the forums for help to address, with the usual response, of 'OK lets see what can be done to get it working like that for you' - while my own experience of dealing with those sorts of issues in a closed source product is that the response is generally 'Sorry, XYZ doesn't work like that', issue closed, no further comment, no ongoing discussion, just 'sorry' (or not in most cases!!!) All that said, your basic point about MARKETING MOODLE, and the perceptions of Moodle (but also of open-source software in general) is, as you rightly say, where the battle needs to be fought. So maybe a large part of the issue should be whether Moodle HQ needs a (bigger) marketing budget - but as a community member, please don't ask me where that budget would come from!!! ;) Maybe just putting out some professional quality presentations/videos and printables that those of us in the position of being the institutional moodle evangelist can use/tweak to balance up against some of the commercial offerings. Moodle is an incredibly strong product NOW - but it needs (we need) help shouting about it against the marketing/pr blitz from 'the dark side'. We shout a lot about the way forward, the work going on to make Moodle better (all necessary, all good), we don't do enough shouting about how great Moodle is already! I'm not advocating sitting there with what we have and not continuing to push the boundaries, just advocating 'selling' Moodle as the great tool it already is (while continuing to push it forward)! All of which is a very long-winded way of saying you are right that PERCEPTION is the key! Richard",

I have worked with some clients who wanted nice front pages, and some nice extra features and so forth and spend significant effort and budget to achieve the \"look\" they want - up to 2 weeks + effort in some cases on their theme. I have also had some clients who wont spend more than 1 days development budget as they are happy with that. However pretty much all clients I work with want something different, mostly \"it must look a lot like our website\". If an organisation is willing to spend 5000 on the design of their web portal, and only 500 on the LMS, marketing need to be brought into the equation imo.",

          "Text": "Hello all, First, a disclaimer: I've been digging through docs and source code for a while now as I maintain and customize a Moodle instance at work, but there's still a lot about the internals that I don't understand, and it's possible that I'm just missing something obvious here. Please accept my apologies in advance if that's the case, especially if I come across as presumptuous, or critical of a sensible design. Ok, so, here's the short version: Looking at the database schema underlying Moodle, it seems that the many:many relationship between courses and module instances via the course_modules table could provide the level of abstraction needed to allow an activity or resource to have instances in more than one course at a time. Let's call this \"cloning\" an asset. Unlike importing an asset from another course, which creates an independent copy, updates to a cloned asset would affect every instance of it. This would be very useful in situations where assets are frequently remixed into custom courses, where importing can create a maintenance nightmare. The thing is, there are a bunch of other things in the db schema that seem to negate how useful this could be, and I don't really get why they're there. Words get cumbersome at this point, so I took some time to put together a gDocs drawing to describe examples of what I'm talking about (no Google account necessary to view), as well as a proposed solution. You will probably need to zoom in to read it properly-- just select View->100% from the menu, or use the magnifying glass tool: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Sl-xWv_b8GpD2rG-EUfvvMqJMNMaQ999h1LMdQSG8lc/edit?usp=sharing I realize that this would be a huge undertaking, and maybe not enough people besides me care about this feature to make it happen, but if there's a good reason to not even try I'd like to know, in case I decide to mess around with it, and just for the sake of understanding. Thanks to anyone who can offer suggestions and/or clarifications ( btw , I've enabled comments in the doc in case annotating one of the images is easier).",

Either way, I acknowledge that this isn't the sort of thing that would just be changed in an update to the 2.x line.",

As a feature I think it would be great, and we actually gave it some thought as to if we could implement something like this for Totara, but it is hard to see a path to making such a fundamental change to the existing code. For example, I suspect it would break moodle's hierarchical capabilities system. If you have a forum activity for example, in mdl_forum: id name 1 My forum And you put the same instance in two courses via mdl_course_modules: id course module instance 1 2 11 1 2 2 11 1 Then the context table will need to look like this: id contextlevel instanceid path 1 10 0 /1 Site context 2 50 1 /1/2 Site course 3 40 1 /1/3 Miscellaneous category ... 23 50 2 /1/3/23 Our first course 24 70 1 /1/3/23/24 Our forum activity in course 1 .. 47 50 3 /1/3/47 Our second course 48 70 1 /1/3/47/48 Our forum activity in course 2 ... So now any changes to activity level capabilities are no longer stored in one place, plus you need to figure out which courses contain the activity so you can rebuild the cache, and before you know it you have to rewritten accesslib.php . You can see how a single modified assumption (one course module record per instance) can lead to further changes to other assumptions (one context per instance), which then leads to more changes... So yes, something for Moodle 3.x I suspect. Simon",

          "Text": "There is a intensive discussion about inclusion in German schools in all German countries.  The concepts concentrates on individual learning plan in a way that teacher assign activities and resources to small groups and single students. The concept is different to the ILP block. That means that thee are several groups in a class and often some activities are assigned to one or two students only. Moodle offers such functionality with groups, groupings and exclusive settings for groupings on activity/resource level. This works well technically. If we think about a one year term, a class with 25 students its no fun to try to handle this with Moodle features and processes. We are looking for ideas how to make this much easier for teachers. Here are some first ideas: The teacher can select on activity level with a new icon in edit mode students from his course that should get access to this activity. The student sees a separate icon that this activity is selected for him/her. The teacher gets a new link in settings block with a table listing all activities and students and can select the students that should do some special activities.  Students will see only activities that are marked for them. Same should be done for groups. We would like to see if other  regions are also interested in such features and what additional requirements are. ralf",

I imagine that this should really be part of the conditional activities , so for all the activities - not implemented separately for each. For example, in section \"Restrict access\", for allowing access from/to - you could set up dates relative to your enrolment time, not just absolute dates. You could say that activity X is available to students X days after they enrol. \"Expect completed on\" could also be set mean \"students are expected to finish this activity within 10 days\", instead of just a date. The extension of this would be to move options in assignment module for \"allow submissions from\", \"due date\", \"cut-off\" date into generic module options (and then have each module to support those or not). This way, a common notifications framework could be easily built in Moodle (e.g. send email 1 day before cut-off date for any activity). cheers, Tomek",

This is a follow-up project on the recently introduced \"Available updates notification\" feature. In short, Moodle administrators should be able to download and deploy (install) updates purely via the web interface. We believe that this feature would encourage more admins to keep their sites up-to-date which is considered as the key protection against security attacks. In the first phase, we plan to focus on updating and installing contributed extensions from the Plugins directory . Later, we plan to add a support for updating (and even installing!) Moodle core itself via this new tool. The use cases and a rough implementation plan is described at Automatic updates deployment project page. I admit it's a bit late for significant changes in the spec for the first version of the tool (planned for 2.4 release).

          "Text": "Why use SHA-512?  Because it is the currently generally-believed-to-be most secure hash algorithm. IMHO , when designing a new protocol/system/etc., one of the goals of the design should be to build for the future as much as possible and as much as practical.  That means, for example, making things extensible, and avoiding having to change things in the future.  Even though there may not be any currently known attack for generating a malicious Zip file, the known weaknesses in MD5 indicate that it can't be trusted for much longer.  In fact, US-CERT says that you \" should avoid using the MD5 algorithm in any capacity. \" (emphasis mine) Also, regarding building for the future, even though you say that its intended  purpose is as a control checksum rather than a cipher, unless you are absolutely certain that nobody will think that it's a good idea to also have a cipher, if you're choosing to use a cryptographic hash function anyways, why not use a stronger one that can be used for both purposes?  You say that you don't think that hackers would waste their time trying to build a malicious Zip file, but with Moodle being one of the most popular VLEs, and with more companies and institutions investing in VLEs, and with things such as people using the same password for multiple sites, Moodle could very well be a tempting target. IMHO, when someone says \"hash\", one's first thought, barring any other constraints or considerations, should be the current best hash algorithm, which is currently generally agreed to be SHA-512.  Some possible constraints or considerations are: hash size: in some cases (e.g., if many hashes are used and/or if the data is small), a large hash size may cause too great of an overhead.  But this isn't the case in this situation, since the hash size is many, many times smaller than the ZIP file. speed: one hash algorithm may be faster than another, and if many hashes are calculated, this may be an issue.  But in this case, a hash is only calculated occasionally, so this is not an issue. availability of implementation: in some cases, the current-best hash algorithm might not be readily available in the target system.  But in this case, PHP 5.3 already includes SHA-512 support, so this is not an issue. Given that no other issues are, IMHO, relevant, the remaining distinguishing feature for hashes is the security, and in this regard, SHA-512 is the clear winner.  Even if you think that SHA-512 is overkill, at least use SHA-256, or even SHA-1. Another thing that I would like to point out is that by using MD5, you may be encouraging others, who might not know better, to do the same.  \"If it's good enough for Moodle, it's good enough for me.\"  We should be setting an example of migrating away from MD5 wherever possible, rather than encouraging its use. As I see it, there is simply no reason to use MD5 here, especially since it is just a one-line change.  (Well, OK, two lines -- one line on the server , and one line on the client.)",

In other words, when you download https://download.moodle.org/qtype_stack.2012092600.hash the the file contents will include both the name of the hash algorithm, and the value to check against. Looking at http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php is seems this could be achieved if the contents of the .hash file looked like \n```text\n$6$rounds=5000$somehashstringXX$D4IrlXatmP7rx3P3InaxBeoomnAihCKRVQP22JZ6EY47Wc6BkroIuUUBOov1i.S5KPgErtP/EN5mcO.ChWQW21\n```\n which is the kind of thing PHP's crypt function needs to tell it to use SHA512.

So the support all the time knows which packages are installed for a client.  There are lots of systems with same code basis but seperate databases. If one of the admins updates the system its updated for all other systems. In some environments several packages are not allowed, mainly due to data protection regulations. If admins who are not aware of the information and install additional packages it could be critical. Reset the system to former version. During last version updates lots of APIs have changed. Connected systems often got problems. If we simplify the update process lots of system connections  to external systems will crash. So it should be possible to set the system after a quick test back to the former version. I know there are a lot of admins who like such a feature in Moodle. I also saw a lot of wordpress users who crashed their systems by adding plugins.  We should implement it carefull and with some barriers that it is not so simple and could be disabled. Often teachers are admins and most of the teachers are collectors of features and gamers.  They really like to try new features but often they are not aware about the problems if plugins are not updated and supported continously.

Introducing a setting for the comment editor is not the right solution. We need something more generic, else we'll end up with a toolbar setting for every single editor in the whole Moodle interface. Actually there seem to be a few different solutions to simplifying the tinymce editor going round. MDL-32750 recently introduced the ability to collapse the editor tools by default. There was a post and bug ( MDL-37565 ) created about improving the default theme too. A setting specifically for the comments is the start of a slippery slope and not the right solution here IMO .",

These solutions would solve the first requirements which is to shrink the HTML editor to fit nicely in all areas where comments appear. The second requirement was to allow an administrator to restrict functionality the user has access to within comments. Not all site administrators will want comments have file attachments from the moodle media button, or images, or raw html for that matter. Or video or audio comments (these of course are based on third party plugins not core functionality). Maybe I missed it ( i only skimmed the first really long ticket). How does either solution serve to meet the requirement of site administrators limiting commenting functionality? I am not stuck on the comment toolbar setting for TinyMCE, but I didn't find another solution that allowed button restriction only for Comments. I am open to other ideas.",

Sorry, I was not suggesting either were solutions to this, just pointing out other work in a similar area. Not all site administrators will want comments have file attachments from the moodle media button, or images, or raw html for that matter. Well, restricting the editor toolbar is only one part of the solution to that. Note how the 'essay' question type has a number of options for formatting with the editor, the editor with file picker, plain text. These are setup differently on the server side andsprocessed differently on the server for each variation in addition to the editor being setup with the different options. I realise that its out of the scope of your work, but customising the editor toolbar per form is a feature which would be beneficial across all Moodle forms. Adding a site level configuration only for commenting would be a step in the wrong direction IMO.",

          "Text": "I agree the current UI for comments sucks and would love to see a lot of UI fixes to make it more useful.  Most of the workflows in the specs are attractive. I'm a little worried about adding HTML and files to every comment though. The original comment system was designed to be lightweight and to work anywhere across Moodle.  Things it is missing intentionally: HTML:  Formatted text in Moodle means allowing all editors, not just HTML.  And opening up to HTML means a lot of security around that, as well as a drop in performance and a more cluttered UI.  Note that Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus do not allow HTML in their posts, and no-one seems to mind.  I don't think the case for HTML here is good, and you'd need to make a good case for it if you want to keep including it. Files: There is a slightly better case for files, perhaps, but again this will open up a  bit of can of worms with performance and security.  Comments can appear in MULTIPLE contexts (eg a comment block) and the capability checks start getting onerous for all the file access and handling. Not to mention a blowout in course sizes as all these \"temporary\" files flinging back and forth have to be backed up etc. I do like that these features are optional and have switches, but this itself creates some complexity, and remember that changes here will affect a lot of modules in Moodle and perhaps cause a lot of new bugs later on. As a result I'm wondering if the commenting you are focussing on, which is almost exclusively discussion between student and teachers over graded items, might not be a separate beast to the commenting API, perhaps a gradecomments or feedbackcomments.",

          "Text": "I would argue that in 1 each of the simplified comments you mentioned, twitter, facebook and google plus all allow multimedia to be embedded in a comment. I would argue that their use would be significantly reduced with out mutlimedia. My goal is multimedia not HTML. If we can design a way to easily allow the embedding of multi media (links, video, audio and images) without the need for a full HTML editor I would do that. I went with the Moodle way of allowing media though, which is the HTML editor. For 2. I would argue that based on our usage most files of of a small size 2 MB at most. I would see media file of greater concern. And the course back up you mention with user data is generally for archival purposes. If I am cloning a course from semester to semester I am not taking student data with it. This means that most institutions will off site the larger backups and rarely use them unless a student has challenged a grade or is requesting to retake a course. IMO comments needs to be drastically expanded to be of significant use to teachers and students. The more activities that allow for grading and commenting the more robust the commenting system needs to be. In conversations with clients and industry experts I have heard requests for graded wikis, graded forums, graded glossaries and databases. There are a plethora of ways teachers want to use activities and in each one I see comments and notes as being a significant way to improve the course dialogue. But not with just text. Media is a requirement. We are finding that instructors prefer audio comments over text because they are easier and quicker to make. All the uses above those as you said are grading. We could definitely work with just a grade commenting system, although the current database structure for comment support everything we have proposed except file attachments. I would suggest reviewing what commenting system you use that actually doesn't allow HTML content. Meaning only text, no links, video or images.",

          "Text": "Alright, I've tried drafting a response three different times, and I've liked none of my drafts so far. However, I think I can't wait anymore to get the wording right.  The teacher perspective needs to be interjected now: My initial reaction to this idea (last week) was that maybe we are starting to get confused about the types of communications that belong in the new comments exchange option in assignments (which I guess I had defined in my head as an area to exchange short \"tweets\" of sorts and nothing more) and the more involved feedback made possible by the file and overall assignment feedback options. I also find that I've been asking myself the following question a lot these days: At what point do we end up giving our students feedback overload?  And how do they know where to look at any given time? It gets a little overwhelming to track all of the different ways we've created to leave messages for one another in our courses.  It isn't just in Moodle, either--it's in other systems, too.  Take the Turnitin .com integration, for instance. I can post general essay feedback.  I can post specific flags with comments directly on the essay.  I can post recorded verbal feedback.  I grade with the rubric, which also provides a kind of feedback.  All of these options are pretty amazing and give us opportunities for a depth of exchange we haven't had before.  So I'm thinking to myself, I'm providing a pretty high level of feedback, right? Until I get an email from a student saying she thinks I probably left some comments somewhere, but she can't figure out how to access them because no one yet pointed out to her what the icons mean or she didn't yet access the \"How to access your instructor's feedback\" tutorial prior to looking at her draft.  Upshot: What good is having all of these options for communicating if the message doesn't get to the recipient? And should my student have to access a tutorial first before she can access her feedback? Specifically, with regard to the comments option, I'm finding that while I REALLY like the two-way communication option, it is so easy to miss that someone said something if one doesn't have the arrow activated or isn't paying attention to the fact that the 0 has turned into a 1 or 2.  I am on board with the idea of creating a more robust two-way conversation area than we currently have, but I'm not sure whether opening up the comments in this way would just exacerbate the multiple feedback loop issue if the definitions of communication purposes aren't more clearly drawn up first--or if something doesn't get streamlined somewhere.  The flexibility of the proposed options in the settings area sounds really great until I start seeing how many switches I will have to remember to throw or not throw.  Please, please don't direct me to the messaging options window for any other settings options.  My own eyes glaze over trying to navigate all of those decisions, let alone a group of teachers or students who are brand new to Moodle. I'd therefore like to ask us to take a step back for a moment and ask ourselves if we are asking the right questions.  I think you ARE asking the right question where you begin your conversation here: how can we create a space where teachers and students can have more robust communication?  It is in attempting the execution of a solution that tries to use a system with pretty inherent limitations that I think you start to ask the wrong questions.  I've been watching the developments in outcomes and elsewhere starting to take shape, and I'm thinking we are coming closer than ever before to being able to offer a more cohesive, meaningful, dynamic learning environment that is a curriculum map, portfolio, and highly personal learning space all at the same time--but we keep chopping this experience up into little pieces as we come to understand the smaller parts involved in this endeavor. This has been the vision I've been chasing ever since 2008 when I first looked at outcomes and assessment feedback options in Moodle: In a perfect world, as a teacher, I want a system that dynamically maps my curriculum as it grows and adapts to the learners in my courses as they come in and out of different collaborative groups and individual projects; as a learner, I want to see a portfolio that shows my growth over time--and shows it by capturing the snapshots that have been most meaningful to me.  We are closer than ever to being able to offer this system, and that is really exciting to see. Now, when you meet on the 26th, I respectfully ask you all, as my favorite educational software wizards, to try to move forward with the idea that this system needs to function as a cohesive whole, no matter how many chaotic and disparate things are going on behind the scenes.  One way I see this happening is if, somehow, we start to think of tracking these systems differently--maybe having systems that work in parallel and often together at given points without being inextricably bound to one another: a learning object that can have comments/feedback conversations attached or not, grades and/or outcomes attached or not, in a portfolio--now THAT would be a powerful tool for a student to control and wield.  I'm not sure if that is what you meant, Martin, but if it is, it really caught my attention. And Jason, if you are starting to envision a commenting ability that might replace the other options causing the feedback loops I described, so that all of the feedback related to a learning object starts getting logged in the same place--then I am liking that conversation direction, too. Back to the how:  You know I have no business talking about the how, really, so I'll just leave that part of the discussion to you with one plea: Whatever you all decide to do, make it so that it is something simple that can be done in very few steps with no extra settings and no complications involving decisions that a site admin has to make when it really is a question of individual preference on the part of the teacher. Finally: THANK YOU!  I like that you are still starting the conversation with what best promotes a richer learning experience.",

Directory: course/extensions/ blah This is not the correct path for this feature - the extensions only relate to modules - not a course so the folder would sit at the top level (like plagiarism). 2. Re: changing get_coursemodule_from_id... No - you should create your own function and not try and overload this core one. Firstly - you often need to get the extension date for someone else (not $USER) - so your function needs to accept a userid and second - if everyone added their own features to that core function it would be an unrecongnisable mess. 3. I see a couple of other things not mentioned in the spec. (a) The assignment and quiz both have their own extension date logic/data which would need to be upgraded into these new tables with no data loss. (Quiz has special handling for when a student has the quiz still open when the time expires - the assignment doesn't need that). (b) This extension date information will need to be included in backup/restore. (c) You will probably need something like the user_picture stuff to add the extension date fields to a query and then a function to display a date from a record with those fields. Regards, Damyon",

I've followed the lead of how Plagiarism/Repository plugin system was implemented and built it to work with all the internal Moodle plugin management functions. One consistant theme that appeared to be mentioned a few times was a central method of tracking and keeping deadlines was also something people wanted. Recognising that Extensions and Deadlines work hand in hand, I have built a Deadlines plugin also which (for the activities that are modified to support it) will track open/deadline/cutoff dates in a central table. I've structured it such that at the base level, there is a 'deadline' module which contains the base class; like how Plaigiarism operates. With just that setup and no deadlines/extensions plugin installed the activities will default back to their own storage mechanism (own database table). When a Deadlines plugin is installed, for modules that supports it (determined by calling plugin_supports('mod', $this->modname, FEATURE_DEADLINE)), it will track that modules open/deadline/cutoff data in it's own table, linked back to Course Module ID. For now I've been concentrating on making mod_assign work with this, so far so good, individual and group extensions are implemented and working, and the functionality for staff to add an extension to a student is working too. I realise I'm kind of side stepping some of the established processes here regarding the spec etc - but fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) we're developing this primarily for our requirements first and foremost, however we're fully committed to giving this portion of work to the Moodle community. I'm lucky that my manager shares my vision to contribute this work to the community and he was very accomodating when I threw the 'deadlines' monkey wrench on the table which required a little extra work that wasn't in our Moodle2 upgrade project plan. The feedback we've had in the past is that it meets most peoples needs (admittedly a small subset of people though), our academics certainly love it and the usage of our 1.9 version shows that. I have been keeping my thread here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=216784 updated with my progress. It's heavy on the pics, apologies in advance if you're on a low bandwidth connection. I'd love to hear back from people regarding this, particularly HQ and Core devs, both from the implementation aspect (admittedly hard to gauge until there is code in the open, still working on that!) and from the usability aspect of the UI - which is where I think it needs the most community input to be honest.",

          "Text": "I think that the problem statement at the start of the doc frames it perfectly and I got quite excited, because I thought you had the solution to all our problems. But, sadly it seems not quite... Because there is no requirement for plugins to implement any of the ‘read’ features, it will be very easy to write custom plugins (for an institution that does not intend to use the standard Moodle log viewing features). I wonder how much of a step forward this is? It seems to be me that logging/tracking is a fairly fundamental part of a learning management system and what is being proposed is to outsource this problem from Moodle completely. I understand the attractiveness of this from a system administration point of view, but I worry that we'll end up with 'toy' tracking features in Moodle which are never used by 'real' sites. In the future, I think we should have a 'recent activity' system scales for the OU with 500,000 users and for a school with 20 students. Moodle core should be able to provide teachers with a way to see which resources are being used by their students, regardless of logging plugin installed. What I worry about with this is that we're moving away from this, not closer. But, we don't have that at the moment. So maybe this is the right direction . At the hackfest in October, it was discussed to try and move everything out of the log table and to introduce specific tables needed for tracking the individual aspects of tracking. By moving towards this we turn the log table into the fire and forget logging, and encourages us to move us to the individual tables for specific reporting needs. (As you might tell, i'm not quite sure myself)",

          "Text": "Hi Dan, Thanks for your comments! I understand there's a different emphasis here. Basically, my characterisation of the different focuses would be: I want to make it feasible to use Moodle (at all) in a large system without infinite hardware budget. (This applies to our existing main system in that it's running fine now but we'd like it to continue to work as usage increases; there are also some potential large systems in future where we are considering whether it is possible to use Moodle or not.) You want to make it feasible to use Moodle in a large system without turning off the existing log/statistics analysis features in Moodle. Martin wants to actually improve log information for teachers (and others) within Moodle. Obviously, I think mine is the most important requirement. But I think it's also true that the system I'm proposing actually helps with all requirements: Everything keeps working if you don't change settings. Even if you do want to use more efficient logging, nearly everything will keep working, assuming plugins are developed to support some level of read access (and the new file plugin I've proposed for core would be). Regarding the 'nearly' everything, i.e. where I had a bit of a cop-out regarding recent activities and some of the other items in the 'Logging 2' page which I'm suggesting will become unavailable if you choose to use file logging, this system provides a way forward by clearly identifying those areas of code, which others can then take forward as independent development steps. The 'Logging 2' proposals include moving some things out of the log table, which my proposal supports as above, and also adding more logging, which my proposal (as the plugin element listed on the 'Logging 2' page) makes feasible. Basically the I think this proposed development, which is reasonably restricted in scope (it's actually got wider scope than I'm really happy with or than I expected initially), can be done independently without causing any problems for current Moodle users (who can continue to use database logging if necessary) and while enabling the large-scale use I'm after. As we all know, it's better to divide problems into small independent developments (that you can complete and release in entirety without breaking anything). I think this is one of those. About your specific issue, my proposal also allows institutions who don't want to use the in-Moodle log analysis and statistics to write a plugin that doesn't support them. Which is something we would want here for any plugins we might write. You're right that here, we have no intention of using logs or statistics within Moodle on our systems. It's not directly related to this new development, but I can explain why. Why we don't use Moodle statistics Back in 1.x days, we turned off Moodle statistics because generating them entirely killed the system (I can't remember if it ran out of memory and failed, or just monopolised the database for pretty much the entire day when calculating the previous day's stats, but either way, it was no use to anyone). In addition, the information from statistics wasn't organised in the way we wanted. I can't remember the exact detail but we wanted different data in order to support the people running/designing courses. So anyway, I wrote an entirely new statistics analyser that was designed for performance. It did a similar thing to Moodle statistics but much faster, without running out of memory, and generating more useful (for our purposes) numbers. There was also a nice interface with pretty graphs and whatever. We don't use this system in 2.x. Here's why: as usage built in our 1.x system, even this new high-performance stats calculation, when accessing the ginormous log tables, started to take too long (causing performance problems for other areas while it was running). Then it started to run out of memory and fail. Toward the end, we had to turn that system off too, leaving users without any statistics. What are we doing in 2.x? Shipping mdl_log data out of our database and passing it to an external system. There are two reasons for doing this: Performance: The minimum of work (reading the new data out of the database once a day) takes place on our live infrastructure. We're doing all the calculation, analysis, and reporting on a separate system. Even if it goes wrong or takes forever, failures of that other system cannot affect students. Consistency: Other OU systems also provide data to the same external system, which (at least theoretically) allows us to answer data-mining type questions such as 'did people who registered late for the course also visit the website less regularly than those who registered in plenty of time?' (Moodle doesn't have the first part of that data, so it wouldn't be possible to get that from Moodle data alone.) I'm not sure that particular question is any use, but you get the point. Both of these are a good thing in my view, and I don't think Moodle - for large institutions - should prevent people from doing this. Yes it would be nice if Moodle statistics were fast enough to run on large systems (and we didn't actually try them in 2.x, maybe they are better now). I think some of the other proposed Moodle changes, like separating cron up so that things can run in parallel, might allow this type of thing. But I think people who don't want to use Moodle statistics should be allowed not to. Why we don't use Moodle log display We do use Moodle logs, mainly to investigate problems, but we generally do so by manual database access (so we can do custom queries) for system administrators; or by other custom queries for specific reporting (using the 'Custom SQL ' report plugin). So far as possible we don't use Moodle log display for non-admin users; we've basically got it turned off in nearly all cases. There are really two reasons for that: Performance worries. In 1.x we were concerned about almost any access to the log table because it is so huge and there were performance issues. I don't think this is actually a problem nowadays; we've got the database infrastructure working (using Postgres features, the log table is split into new tables each month which are combined in some kind of view, and we can delete the tables older than the previous month) and Moodle log views use the indexes, so it works OK. Data protection. Moodle logs tend to give information that you don't really need, such as student IP addresses, and unless you're really careful with permissions they tend to give access to people who don't really need it. This is both a legal concern, but also a general good practice concern - i.e. we don't want tutors examining everything students do in minute detail, because that's a waste of their time plus students might not like it. Hopefully that explains where I'm coming from. But regarding this specific proposal, my position is that basically, what I've proposed is a good independent first step torward what everybody wants. Which is why I think you should all approve it. ;) --sam",

We do not yet have any mock-ups of the separate block option in the tracker issue. Surely it would help to see what we are voting for. (A quick way to mock it up would be to use a HTML block to fake the proposed reports block, then use Firebug to hide the other links.) Note that, in MDL-31983 , we have already discussed that the Settings block should probably be renamed to something else, particularly if the Reports are going in there. P.S.

If you go to your profile it shows profile related stuff, if you go to admin it shows admin related stuff, if you go to a course it shows course related stuff, same for categories, modules, gradebook etc. It's hardly elegant but it seems to be all we've got. Maybe if someone can come up with a name that reflects what it actually does then things will make some more sense. Someone could go through and count but there's a whole bunch of things in there that aren't Settings (e.g. there's several links that are \"actions\" like \"purge caches\", \"backup\", \"restore\", \"import\", \"export\", \"publish\"), possibly as many as half the items, so banishing anything that's not a \"setting\" doesn't seem like it would work, and where would they go if not here? On the other hand, going the opposite direction and moving profile related stuff out of the \"Navigation\" Block and putting it into \"Settings\" and thereby leaving a list of enrolled courses seems like it could be an improvement. And then move everything below the level of the course name (e.g. participants list, reports) also back into \"Settings\" under the \"course\" sub-heading. This also seems to be the relevant place for any other reports, particularly as there's already a bunch of things that could happily described as reports that live there already (e.g. Grader Report, Outcomes Report, Overview Report, User Report, Enrolled Users, Groups Overview, Check Permissions, Other Users, This User's Role Assignments, Browse List of Users, Cohorts, everything under Site administration -> Reports etc.)",

It would be good to be able to lock that combined block in the top corner and know that everyone would see all those things in the same place. Other very generic and general suggestions: \"Moodle Block\", \"Main Block\", \"Context Block\", \" Dashboard Block\", \"Primary Block\", and getting desperate and turning to the thesaurus now, \"Thingy Block\", \"Whatchamacallit Block\", \"Paraphernalia Block\". edit: added mockup, note that the courses are just links, if you want to access anything about a course you need to click on the link, which will take you to the course, and then you'll see a) the front page of the course with list of activities etc, b) the course administration tab will appear and expand, giving you access to the contextual actions for a course.

To follow the discussion about renaming the Settings block, the option 'Switch role' is not a 'write' option either. Also, as a student, Grades under 'Settings > Course administration' is not a writeable option, and doesn't make much sense to me. I think there has been (and still has) a lot of confusion on what has to go where, another example would be the blogs.

What about a little running list somewhere in docs of minor changes that have come with a .X (or even a .X.X) version like the loss of editing inline with assignments, changes in role hierachies, changes in flowplayer version and behaviour, changes in course formats . . .  sort of a one stop shop focused on just the version upgrade to ask \"is this what I see a feature or a bug or an unintended consequence\". Such a hypothetical list could have links to the tracker or a discussion.  A first point of call with considering the upgrade to a new version.  Some sort of focus on the Current upgrade path, which is what most will be looking at at any given time. We actually all (as a community) are doing some wheel spinning doing lots of testing for ourselves and there are lost of duplicate posts on critical issues.  See just as one example this blog post by Mark: http://www.markdrechsler.com/?p=878 -Derek And as a PS.  Plugins remain a huge problem with version changes.  I'm personally finding it hard to keep up with GIT , Google docs, Blogs, Messaging, Forums, Plugins database , Tracker, Dev and Docs as inputs.  I am conscious I do not want to sent more stuff in the direction of developers if I have not done my homework.

I will return to this topic at some stage, once I have thought a little more. I have several servers I work with, and have just done a test upgrade to 2.4.1.  I thought I had done my homework, but there were still things that were gotchas.  All tracker items are not the same.  There is the nice summary that Martin pointed to.  I'm not sure that the docs thing Mary referred to is as good as it could be.  But trying to figure out quickly the potential bugs is a little difficult.  Martin's list doesn't address this and you can spend time on the tracker and still miss it.  I'm going to try to get my filters better.  But then some kind of human tagging can help.  \"If you want X, these issues are critical\" I know this goes against the trend of Helen's work plan, but I wondered if a forum \"Upgrading to 2.4\" may help centralise some of the issues, even if they were just references to activity in the other 43 relevant forums.  This is where tagging of threads would be great. -Derek",

I'd now like to add this: We curate a list of feaures of a new release quite clearly as has bees said. However we do not curate a list of current problems whether critical or trivial (by anyone's definition).  They are scattered around the forums.  Sometimes it is quite random if you find them.  We often find tem too late.  Now I know i would be difficult to do this,but not impossible. But what I am saying is we need to not only have list of current new features, but a list of problems introduced by a new version of Moodle that may be unexpected.  Where a feature of Moodle version X+1 BREAKS a feature of Moode X. As I said:above: features of a version X of Moodle may become part of a workflow, and sometimes these same features get broken and are no longer possible in Moodle X+1. This is all in the cause of helping smooth the upgrade path for indiviuals. Not just \"What new goodies do you get wih the latest release?\" but also \"What are the key issues people are finding in upgrading to the latest version?\" -Derek",

The list you descibe is not a \"curated\" list.  It is just every single known problem.  There is a list in the tracker of fixed issues.  (Uncurated) There is a list in dev.moodle.org of fixed issues in a new release (curated) and as Martin said, if there is anything missing here, then we add it. Trying to find an example: the 2GIG file restore limit. https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-34388 Moodle 2 has broken this.  But no where is there a place to find this out specifically and easily.  This is an old issue.  The onl way you wil find this out is by trial and error, unless you read a lot. I've done a quick survey: some other OS projects have a simple curated list of \"Current known issues\"  ie it's a problem, we know about it.  It's a big problemand we know about it.  Or it's a smal problem, sorry if affects you so much, we know about it.  And: current workarounds.  My view stands: an Upgrading to current version forum will help.  Martin said this is not the right place to go.  But tracker is not effective.  Current curatated lists in DEV don't work for this purpose. Your list \"every unresolved issue under the sun\" does just not work for this purpose. As I said, all tracker issues are not the same. 2. Lost functionality label. Cool.  This is a major learning moment for me. I've just added it to 2GIG UPLOAD LIMITS FOR RESTORE https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-34388 MISSING LINK IN BREADCRUMBS https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-37762 (However much I dislke the tone of the description) REMOVED MASS DELETE FOR FILES https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-36121 LOST AJAX FUNCTONALITY https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-37528 I will do some more later.  This may be there, but, as you say, it is certainly not used widely.  When you pointed me with the link in your post, to the list it was 8 issues long. EVERY lost functionality item is here: https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20lost_functionality a total of 34.  I'm sure I can increase this.  I'd like to see this list linked to in devs docs release notes.  I think it may help solve my problem.

Whether we need to organize a site into course categories or a quiz bank into something useful that can be shared or a course with cohorts or groups or groupings or a list of hundreds of standards that need to be applied in thousands of places from granular quiz questions to whole courses, I'm finding an increasing need to be able to cross-list these different needs and ways of organizing.  Maybe there is no shelf.  I was always a skeptic about the whole tag cloud value, in terms of being able to see for myself beyond the \"most users at this point in time are concerned about x\" part, but I think now I'm understanding why every librarian I've talked to in the last five years has been so excited about this concept.  They must be able to see, based on their experiences, the potential this would afford over the limitations they've been struggling to overcome for years. I suppose this is, in a strict sense, not a discussion anymore about where to log minor feature changes and track them for ourselves, but the point made earlier about someone's minor is someone else's major really rang true for my experience. If nothing else, it made me think, and that is what I love about Moodle.org conversations.  Especially some of the slightly off-topic ones.",

I think that the confusion comes from the fact that '/course/renderer.php' renders the components of the course which are overrideable by the theme, but it is the course format that defines the layout and as little styling as possible by overriding '/course/format/renderer.php'.  Themes and course format's share a common goal but do need to be separate because theme's style and perform overall layout, course format's just layout courses because you always want a 'corporate image' and way of doing things across all courses but want at the same time to have separate layout templates for the individual courses. I hope this makes sence! Cheers, Gareth",

And if it is the case we need to raise a tracker issue for that and move discussion there. I have not tried it myself yet so I can't confirm at the moment. The solution that I see is to make the format_section_renderer_base not abstract and other renderers such as format_topics_renderer will do $this->baserenderer = $this->page->get_renderer(...) in their constructor and instead of calling parent::xxx() will do $this->baserenderer->xxx() . And format_section_renderer_base::section_edit_controls() can be moved to format_base class. Actually I should have done it in 2.4 when I created format_base class. I only moved is_section_current() at that moment",

I agree with Tim with the format_renderer_base still being abstract. Understanding this from an OO / Java / C++ background perspective I would think that the theme would want to override certain functionality and a course format another.  If you have the structure: format_renderer_base -> format_renderer_course_format_overrides -> format_renderer_theme_overrides Because the theme wants to override some of what the course format is doing then you would need a class for each course format you wanted to support unless PHP supports multiple inheritence (nasty). But as I understand it with what Tim is saying you would have: plugin_renderer_base -> core_course_commonbits_renderer(abstract) -> format_renderer_base(abstract) -> format_renderer_course_format_overrides and plugin_renderer_base -> core_course_commonbits_renderer(abstract) -> theme_renderer_base(abstract) -> theme_renderer_theme_overrides Such that the theme and the course format can perform overrides.  But what happens when there is a conflict?  Should themes and course formats do the same thing or should there be a distinction in functionality of responsibility?  Such that a theme does specific things and a course format does other specific things and never the twain shall meet.

For example: 0 56, 0 34, 1 57, 1 58, 0 35, 1 89, 2 111 which translates to the hierarchy 56 34 57 58 35 89 111 With such a list it should be fairly easy to handle moving/adding/deleting sections, to generate the navigation tree, to manage visibility and availability and most importantly to adjust in restore. That's how I implemented it in my (obsolete, thanks to your work on this important enhancement ) course format and it seemed to work reasonably well. Of course, if the course manager doesn't set a hierarchy the field that holds the list remains empty and navigation is generated by the simpe order.",

Or plan B: to be able to go direct to the \"Highlighted weekly topic\" page and show just this section. -Derek",

I've been thinking a bit about how, while we're at it, we could look at moving some of the 'print' functions that still exist in course/lib.php to the format renderer and give the individual formats a little more control over sections and activity content while doing this full refactor?   You touch briefly at the bottom of the specification about creating a 'Class Course' after this particular 2.4 targetted work is complete and mention print_section etc below the main ideas on that but not what, if anything, is being thought about their future so I'm interested if any of this has been discussed already and what the thoughts were. I've often wished that at least print_section(..) was easier to modify on a case by case basis and the course format seems the more suitable location for them at least that I can find.  I had a bit of a play on my 2.3 dev instance the other day, literally just copying the functions and amending the calls to them and it seemed to behave correctly without any obvious extra work being required to maintain the functionality but I could see areas that for robustness and better extensibility and theming the functions might also be worth refactoring independently - in particular also to ensure that the YUI 'drag/drop' requirements for <ul><li> structures aren't broken by contributed formats and that completion indicators and activity listings themselves could be drawn independently etc. I don't have any serious conclusions here though, more just awareness that there are points that might need extra focus or could be better worked as rendered elements to make it more usable. Looking forward to seeing where this all goes, happy to help out if you need the extra pair of hands as well. Stacey",

          "Text": "I was playing around the other day trying to learn more about some of the features available in YUI and came up with this enhancement to the Activity Chooser (and any other chooser dialogue box in Moodle when they start to appear). Personally, I use the keyboard frequently for navigation and with a dropdown, it's great to be able to type the first few letters of an entry to jump straight to it before pressing enter. When I wrote the Activity Chooser, the one thing I found particularly frustrating was that it's no longer possible to do this. This enhancement lets you filter the items shown in the Chooser dialogue simply by typing - exactly as you would when using a dropdown menu. You can still navigate through the results using the keyboard up/down arrows and the mouse and everything continues to function as before. I've prepared a short YouTube video to demonstrate the feature (sorry there's no audio): And I've opened an issue in the tracker for it - MDL-37325 . One of the areas I'd love to improve is letting the user know that they can do this - but I don't think that all users will use the feature, and even those who use it won't want it there all time. It would be good to have a tip shown somewhere to advertise things like this and the ability to double-click. If anyone has feedback, I'd love to hear it. If you have any suggestions on how to improve things I'm all hears too! Thank you in advance, Andrew",

I have a feeling that most users won't actually use it, even if they know it's there though. A thought has just occurred to me though... At present the default text when you open the chooser informs you that you can 'Select a module to view its help.'. We really shoudl expand this to explain (briefly) about the double-click, and possibly this too. We should also make this text a bit larger IMO . I also wondered about highlighting, but the autocomplete actually works on tags rather than the title of the module. The title is *one* of the tags, but so is the module name and the two may not necessarily be the same (e.g. IMSCP). It may still be possible to do, but I will admit I've not thought more about it than that. YUI does provide a Y.AutoCompleteHighlighers so I'll take a look at it. I think that searching the help string would probably a bit too much. I may be wrong, but I think it would probably return too many results most of the time :\\ Do you think that the enhancement is a worthwhile addition? Thank you for the feedback - I'll have more of a play, Andrew",

Having a search box located in another section of the window, makes me think I'm searching the text of the descriptions With the search box displayed, users will naturally use their mouse to select the search box and then type, they may then use their mouse again to select - so not really save any time.

My other thought was - is it at all possible that this type of interaction might (in future) added to other parts of Moodle; perhaps for presenting course listings or filtering student lists etc...? If so a more generic interaction would be benificial and univerally scalable (interface wise). It's a slightly wider issue but....the multiple search boxes that are displayed through the site that each search discrete and different areas of moodle is one of the main issues our users have with moodle (not sure what they are searching for)- so adding another that is permanently on display will only add to it.

There's no obvious filter text applied to dropdown select boxes but many people have learned that you can search those in a similar fashion themselves. Initially this would only apply to chooser dialogues, and at present there is only the activity chooser. Plans are afoot already to replace the existing question bank chooser so that would also become searchable. I've also been looking at creating a block searcher. I'd like to work on a few other areas to improve the interfaces, and this would likely be a part of that. I've been specifically considering the manual enrolment pages so far, but I've not done any work there yet (all pie in the sky thought). Thanks, Andrew",

We definitely should not base it on the qualit of a plugin - that doesn't really matter (if it's bad, then it may need to be re-written to get into the core). We could also have similar process for removing things from core Moodle. If something is not popular and rarely used maybe it should be removed from the core? cheers, Tomek",

Generally we are including fewer and fewer new plugins in core, as we move towards pushing everything into the Moodle plugins database and using manual/automatic means of installing/updating plugins in any given Moodle.   Soon you will be able to click a button in Moodle plugins database to install a module directly in your own Moodle, for example. This is similar to platforms such as operating systems, web apps and mobile phones, which ship with a basic set of core functionality but make it easy for you to extend your platform in whatever direction you want. The exceptions in my view are: Plugins that almost everyone in every education sector would find useful and fills a gap in Moodle without overlapping on existing functionality much (eg Book). Plugins that are small and optional but flesh-out a list of options, such as new authentication plugins or grading methods. Maintenance is always a concern.  Moodle Pty Ltd has resources for maintaining our core code but they have a limit and I have to be careful not to stretch us too thin.  We love volunteers but the fact is they do often move on after some time.",

We also have to modifiy some icons who arent not included in afterburner. We finally transform some icons from gif to png 24 to avoid the problem of white bordured icons. Thats these modifications that I would like to share. its simple but if it could help.. But now , after reading this page : http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=126543 The work that could be done could be far more complex that only replace the actual core icon. I think if there is a willingness to review the entire system icons , the use of vector icons would be much better . In this case , the icons I wanted to share with you are useless . Otherwise, Let me know .",

          "Text": "Hi Martin, the answer to quiz question 1. ( Do you consider icons to be) is c : c) styling / usability aids Icons cannot benefit accessibility, but when used correctly can benefit usability and make things look pretty. I know from previous posts there is a great deal of confusion about the terms accessibility and usability with the two being used together and interchangeably on the forums by many people, so i'll set out the difference between accessibility and usability. Web accessibility designing for accessibility on the web means enabling users with : Visual impairment ( poor eyesight, color blindness, blindness) Motor/Mobility difficulties Hearing problems Other difficulties If are using a screen reader you should not have to be read out anything (alt, title or src) about a decorative image - the link text itself is all you want to know about. An inline icon is just another dom element you have to navigate past to get where you want. It your turning off css, there is probably a good reason - decorative inline icons will be an impairment rather than useful to you. Decorative icons do not need the accessibility standards you would apply to images which provide content. Trying to make any decorative icon accessible (e.g. title, alt etc) is just adding noise. You would as likely put a title and alt tag on a rounded corner as you would a decorative icon. Web usability designing for usability of the web means enabling all users. Presenting information to the user in a clear and concise way Give the correct choices to the users in an obvious way Remove ambiguity regarding the consequences of an action Place important items in an appropriate area on a web page or a web application (yeh, that list is from wikipedia Icons exist on the web to make things look nice and aid usability. Hope this helps Stuart",

          "Text": "Wow - that's horrible. A really big usability downgrade. I very frequently need to edit settings for things and this would make it so much harder. My suggestions to improve usability would be to keep the icons basically as they are but: 1. Remove icons for tasks which are infrequent and only really needed as part of detailed configuration of the activity, so it would be okay to just go to the edit screen (group mode, assign roles). 2. Make it fade out all the icons, not hide them completely so you can still see to go to them but use say 20% opacity, except when you are hovering over the line. The kind of 'settings' menu shown in the example screenshot here is OK for infrequently used, complex tasks but shouldn't be part of the normal interface for manipulating the item. I'm sure different people have different usage patterns, but for me 'Update' is the top priority item, followed by 'Delete', then uh maybe 'Hide', 'Rename', 'Duplicate'... By the way, when the AJAX interface is in use, it would be sensible if the 'move left/right' feature was handled by drag/drop instead; in other words, when you drag something into a line, instead of just being one drop target there could be, say, four different left/right slots. --sam",

Actually, I think it would be perfectly ok to hide them completely. I've seen it done in a theme (I don't remember which one). The icons were hidden and they became visible (the whole row of them) only when the cursor hovered over the line. That was wonderful. The problem with the suggestin in Helen's post is that - if implemented, more clicks would be needed to do a task. Right now you're only one click away from e.g. editing a resource. If you have to click the gears icon and then one of the icons which appear, that's two clicks. One click more is a lot when we're talking about such frequent tasks.",

          "Text": "Contextual actions are, for our staff and tutors, one of the most commonly used part of moodle. A nything to make the cms side of moodle they use every day easier is very much a major feature for them. Reducing the display of complexity, until it is needed, mak es all operations easier Moodle often currently suffers from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick's_law . The sheer volume of options displyed to users makes it overly confusing to use. Progressive disclosure is a well documented pattern for solving this and in this instance the contextual actions pattern is a best fit solution. From our own experience using the context actions design pattern in moodle ( http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/elearningteam/2012/04/20/editing-activities-labels-resource/ ) we found that the benefits of adding a contextual actions menu and that extra click far outweighed the cognitive load and related decision time users face when all the options are shown at all times. We found that this use of progressive disclosure and the contexual actions pattern greatly contributed to reducing the overall visual busyness of moodle and thus, as Hick's law might indicate, enhances usability for moodle on a far wider level than simply this use case. Onclick vs onhover Triggering contextual actions on hover was something our users found seriously iritating. Menus were frquently triggered by accident, causing anoyance and confusion -no matter what time delays were in place. This corresponds to some general usability issues around onhover where accidental mouseovers are more common than any actual intent by users to trigger an action by hover. Hovering is fine for showing extra information (tooltip etc) but our user found the noise of their many accidental hovers a greater distraction than convinience. Information architecture for actions Our users also agreed with Sam in that only the most frequently performed tasks should be part of a contextual actions menu on this page. Those actions which require the user to have supplemental information and are better performed in a context where this information is all available  e.g. a settings/editing page for groups/roles etc. Again, prograsive disclosure is a best fit for these actions. Ordering by most frequently used actions also helped users. The more relevant, expected and simpler the contextual actions can be, the better. Other contextual actions patterns in use? Not sure what experience others have of this, but take a look around the web at where else contextual actions are used (dropbox, g+, fbook etc) and have a look at how why it works for that system. Microsoft have some nice guidelines for developing what they named context menus here - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465308.aspx hope this helps! cheers Stuart",

          "Text": "Hi all, We ran into this problem when we (UCLA) were in our pilot phase of Moodle 2 a while back and we'd like to share our solution. Our users did not like the icons at all.  Understandably so since they are all squished against the name of the activity/resource making them look more like clutter than useful tools.  Our approach to fix this problem was also to reduce the complexity, but not by hiding it away as a previous post does with a singular 'edit' button. Since we're not hiding the complexity, our other option is to order it and make it manageable.  One of their main complaints was that users had, was that they always  to evaluate what each icon did for every activity.  So we tried to remove the guess work for users by making alignments consistent and grouping icons into logical partitions.  This allows users to always know where an icon is and what it does by infering from the group.  We also moved the delete icon far away from the other icons.  It's far too easy to click it when you mean to duplicate or hide an item. I've attached a small presentation where we outline the problems and some solutions that we eventually implemented.  We achieved these changes purely though CSS modifications.  We did not implement all the changes since we did not want to touch Moodle core.  Our changes, however, have simplified the problem for our users. I'm including our CSS in the form of a github branch.  This is a copy/paste from our format to the topics format.  There might be some flaws lurking, but I'd be happy to fix these if the community finds it useful: https://github.com/alroman/moodle/commit/b61713e028ae547537d9bb24064e4d4a4951997c -Alfonso",

Just a note on the layout though - If you give someone a tool which suggest they should structure their content as lists of links and documents, they will often create a lists of links and documents. The past - A file repository The layout you posted above harks back to something our students used to hate about moodle - The image above is from a real one of our moodle course in 2009  - its probably familiar to lots of moodle users. Its just a list of stuff without much context. You might as well give tutors google drive or dropbox which do this in a more convenient way than moodle. From watching our tutors in their offices using moodle we noticed how a standard moodle leads tutors to build this kind of repository. Rather than using our budget to train tutors in web design, we set about making interface changes to break this pattern. Today - An engaging learning environment The interface and workflow in our moodle now seems to encourage tutors to create something more akin to normal web sites. This is the same course section today - Inline creation of text, images, videos etc make it simple for tutors to put them directly on the page, rather than as disparate links, and it certainly doesn't look like a file repository. Our changes to the interface alter the tutors workflow which in turn has a direct impact on how they build their sites. There was a great talk at a moodle moot called From Messy Repository to Quality Interaction and Engagement - which i'm sure is something we all want to aim for with our moodles. I'd be very cautious of the route you are going down - the table style layout, striping of the list and emphasis of the block layout all contribute to your tutors thinking of and creating that file repository look moodle so often suffers from. The tool you give people to create with hugely influences what they create. If you are anything like us - with over 1,500 rather un-web savy staff making courses - you'll want an interface which disuades tutors from the file dump approach, and encourages them to make rich, engaging learning environments. Hope you take this advice in the spirit it is intended, and not as a critisism. Cheers Stuart p.s. nice responsive design!",

          "Text": "This is very cool and inspiring. I'm going to try to implement some of this, aiming for something between what you finally did with CSS and the top of part 3. I double checked and there's no easy way to do this with renderers as it's not implemented yet. Stuart mentions he knows a hacky way to do it with renderers, but the only things I can think of are pretty hideous (i.e. watching out for a specific icon being requested and injecting a whole string of HTML into where that single icon should go), but maybe he's got something a bit more sophisticated in mind. In the meantime I'll see how far I can get with CSS, one improvement to take it closer to your original design is to insert a inactive faded left arrow when the activity is as far left as it can go, with the following: \n```text\n.editing_moveright:before {\n    content: url(\"location of your left-pointing arrow\");\n    vertical-align: middle;\n    opacity: 0.5;\n    padding-right: 2px;\n}\n.editing_moveleft + .editing_moveright:before {\n    content: none;\n}\n```\n It's not the most elegant thing in the world but it works. Note that IE generally sucks at opacity, so a production implementation of this would probably create a second, faded version of the icon and point to that, but using opacity illustrates the idea, the other two style for padding and vertical align are just a repetition of what has been applied to the other icons so that it fits in visually. That might need to be customised for each theme. Have you investigated using position: relative and left: -280px (or whatever is appropriate) to shift all the movement icons to the left of the activity name? I think it might be tricky, but could probably work.",

          "Text": "Hi Guido, The media capture repositry *IS* the repository that will become core I think. So you would be pretty safe with that. Just to answer the PoodLL question. For audio you can choose the PoodLL MP3 recorder which does record straight into Moodle. Only the video recording repository needs to use the tokyo server. There is not really a good serverless solution for video, though there are some java efforts. So ( perhaps predictably) I think a free, albeit far off, server solution is pretty good.  For people that doesn't work for, we usually help them set up their own server. But I think we need to look beyond the \"recorder\" itself. Thats just a part of a bigger picture. Moodle really needs a seamless framework to handle recording from multiple sources and going into different locations. By that I mean, recording from tablets and phones, from desktops via flash, and from desktops via uploads. And not just recording into the repository. But also recording into assignments, questions, database activities and forums. That is really what PoodLL is aiming to be. Yes its a lot for one plugin.  In fact its a total of 5 plugins, and soon to be 6. But it does do all of the above. And nothing else does that yet. But I've appreciated your feedback over the last few days, its been very helpful.",

          "Text": "Dan, what a question and what an opportunity!! A complex, deep and hard question. Probably why it has been put on ice for several years.  Ramble follows. I try to avoid the term Thread.  I'm assumng we have multiple attachments and non-teachers inserting images in posts. Philosophical preamble: where I am coming from Where Moodle is concerned I personally work in the areas of course design, staff development and teaching with Moodle.  Staff development includes online teaching generally, helping staff become good designers and helping with setup of Moodle sites (ie everything except tweaking servers).  Recently I have had to work with hosted Moodle instances where it costs lots of money to get small items fixed, to install plugins or even get good themes. Hence I have two specific interests: Improving the effectiveness of teaching tools and processes for teaching and learning online Advocating a Moodle core that does as much of this as possible. I guess at the heart of all this I see the need for a good forum .  Whether you have 6, 60 or 600 in a course. communication is critical: timely clear and accurate, and easy to find.  As well as that, there is supporting online collaboration, groupwork and knowledge creation.  I am not always agreed with here: some of my buddies wonder why Twitter, Wordpress.org, Wikispaces and Google groups are not enough, but that is another story. What do I mean by a \"Good Forum\"? Lets start with something like this: a forum that is easy to use (for students and teachers) supports learning, idea sharing, dialogue, knowledge creation supports routine and special communications Plus . . . Taking a few aspects at random, listing here a few features that contribute to either ease of use or learning or good communication Forum views. If you have worked with the ForumNG, with the collapsed/them expand view is great.  It is a time saver, and improves efficiency.   See http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/forumng/discuss.php?d=4025#p14888 for a quick look. Think of a student working over several forums in their course (not to mention blogs). I could point to a couple of other LMS systems. Permalinks. Scenario: Trying to write and think over a couple of forums/discussions basically is easier if you need to point to other posts with a quick permalink.  2007: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-12529 Merge discussions (Split discussions) Useful tools for a moderator function. Sticky discussions. These would save a lot of time in Administration type forums in a course. (These could also save a LOT of time in Moodle.org)  2004: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-1997 Thread closed/resolved option. Subscribe at the discussion level. [One of the oldest tracker items. http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-1626 ] With options: Mail to everyone all the NEW discussions only, Mail THIS post to everyone, Follow/unfollow Link. Export posts. Scenario: a student is posting regularly and wants to capture a bunch of material for inclusing in an assignment.  A teacher wants to give feedback.  NG has the option to export selected posts. Clean forum search. \"Show all posts by person X\" in this forum Save Draft. Obvious for a busy student/teacher. (Opps, need more info, save, then come back later with the data) 2008: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-15855 Social side: \"Me to\" button.  Voting. Tagging. This is a wider issue. Scenario: you are scanning 35 incomng posts.  Click \"Read later\" those you need to attend to in detail. \"Watch\"  . . . \"Vote\" Mail NOW option for Admins. Link to show attachments .  ALL the attatchments in a forum. Scenario: Assignments are submitted publically.  Click to see them all. Scenario: \"Where is the file I posted?\" in a forum of 46 discussions and 1053 posts. Romantic stuff, what we had in 2004. \"Promote this student to admin of forum\". Plus??  list abandoned for now . .  if you want to Marginalia functionality (cut and paste from one forum to another) automatically adds a link to the source post. I can be a lot clearer on a scenario for following threads (which can become a can of worms).  The discussion in the tracker is great, but just abandoned. ForumNG stuff is scattered all over the web: Sam's blog , OU Git , Docs (My attempt to focus the stuff in 2010), Forums Forum (eg Glenis's useful comparison here; http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=169857 ), Googe sites .  . .  OU now has their own wiki, their own blog and their own forum . Conclusion for now: \"compelling features in core\" I'm not a programmer, I'm a user and a designer.  A lot of these features I comment on above are in ForumNG.  It may be quicker to implement ForumNG with the new AJAX stuff behind the scenes already done than to fix current forums. Ignorant non programmer optimistic stuff: We could treat forums as a separate item: \"New posts\" block quite separate from \"other new material\" ie a little less integrated may be easier to implement - except gradebook of course: Link Forums <> gradebook may be a problem, but on the other hand new code in 2.0+ may mean this is easier than we think. Tim says it is good code, needs all the checks. it IS a big job I know. -Derek As I said, keen on having a very good forum in the core.",

I am particularly concerning on how a forum can construct knowledge. That sounds theoretical, but it is not. A comment or post can be transformed into knowledge when it deals with a common problem and becomes commonly understood by all members of a group. That happens slowly and through several stages.  This is how I see it happening: Stage 1: group member posts a question. Other group members post replies which answer the question or expand the context . This stage might be called, Open Forum. Stage 2: a group member summarizes what has been learned. This summary is posted at the top of the forum (it may need to be be also posted within the sequence so the commenting on the summary can continue. This stage might be called Sticky Forum. Stage 3: At some point when what has been learned seems stable and needs to be preserved, the sticky forum summary is promoted to a 'knowledge wiki'. This stage might be called Wiki Preservation. Stage 4: Not sure where the next stage goes, but it has something to do with passing on the knowledge to the next cohort group. Knowledge grows and should not die and have to be recreated after every course (semester). Some knowledge should pass on to the next generation.",

In particular there are a few missing functions that make it very difficult to use with students: Lock topics: The only way to stop a bad thread is to move it to another forum where students cannot reply. This is confusing for user and adds additional work for moderators who have to message offending posters to let them know what has happened. Merge topics: Students will quite frequently post topics which have already been discussed. Without a merge option this is very difficult to clean up. Report to Moderator: This is very important as it allows regular users to flag inappropriate messages to a tutor or moderator. Whether it happens in the form of ForumNG or not I think this is something that really needs looking at in Moodle.",

Unfortunately, in autumn 2011 there were problems in the then current version of Moodle 1.9 (messages not being sent as email) on two different servers. I had to revert to the standard forum - Sam Marshall did try to help but it's normal that developers can't spend a lot of time on versions other that 2.x. I only mention it to show I'm not some besotted Sam Marshall groupie - if he were perfect he would find the time. But ForumNG just is so much better. Going back to the standard forum is like going back to driving a Mini after a year of driving a Porsche.

          "Text": "Damn, still no groupies? Maybe I should have become a musician instead of a programmer. Re what's holding it up - I definitely hope ForumNG can be included in core at some point but there are challenges beyond just 'uh you can install it' (which you can). 1. Some parts of ForumNG code probably need updating before including in core - particularly, the message-sending needs to be changed to use the new notification system. 2. There are several parts of core code that currently integrate with forum. These would need to be reimplemented which could be complex (see 3). Two examples: a. When you go to somebody's profile and there's a 'forum posts' link b. The 'news forum' that's automatically created (maybe we should release the OU's news block as well, or did we release that already? hmm). 3. ForumNG includes a 'convert from old forum' option, but apart from the fact that this probably has a few bugs at the moment as we haven't used it on 2.x, this is a bit of a challenge in general. Do we try to make Moodle 2.whatever automatically replace all the existing forums with ForumNG? Or do we leave users to convert them individually? If we do it automatically, what happens if there's some kind of failure, or some minor features from the old forum that aren't included in NG, or the behaviour isn't identical? (Might imply new work on NG - work to add potentially undesirable features/behaviours, in some cases.) And how do we handle upgrade - upgrading forums takes time, and if you have a site with a million posts it could be, I dunno, hours at least - we can't just do that during an update step... Or could we increase performance of the conversion perhaps by using the existing tables instead of new ones? If we let users do it manually, how do we educate them about this - probably needs a nicer new conversion interface (like every forum has a big 'convert this to NG' button for editing teacher+) AND probably something more complicated because in the next release, maybe we would remove the old forum, so would need some way to warn people about that and blah blah. Basically even though the module already works in Moodle 2, putting it in as a new standard forum has additional difficulties. In terms of development time, HQ staff are usually busy and so are OU staff So scheduling it might be a challenge too. --sam",

In the first year ForumNG was running at the OU, there were more posts made on our VLE than all the posts ever made on Moodle.org (by a considerable margin) so it seems to cope with load. Forum NG is certainly no harder to use than the standard Moodle forum. It intentionally tried to copy the good bits. On the other hand, Forum NG has more features, which means a few more buttons in the UI. Potentially confusing? For me, the biggest usability win is the fact you reply inline in the thread, so you can see all the other posts while composing your reply. I also like the fact there is a clear permalink link. I often have to use Firebug on moodle.org to get permalinks, which is definitely not good usability. I think both standard Moodle forum and Forum NG have very few bugs, because they have so many users who are prepared to report bugs.",

          "Text": "John, have you ever worked online (seriously, with several different conversations/forums, a steady flow of input and having to engage with it) with the standard Moodle forum, maybe in a course or a conference? Here are a few limiting factors of standard Moodle: If you want to reply, you ONLY see the post you are replying to. You cannot subscribe to a discussion, only a forum There is no collapsed view which gives post summaries, the scroll of death all over again. There is no drafts option (so you can go away and finish a post later) There is no way to find a post in a forum with a particular attachment There is no easy way to get a permalink to point to a post you are trying to respond to There is no (easy) way to \"show all posts by person X in the forum\" There is no way for an admin to push a post out to all participants and override an optional subscription There is no annotation tool for forums There is no export function for teachers who may have assessment needs There is no \"search this forum\" option If you are unclear what I mean by any of these, just ask.  These are both from the student point of view and the teacher point of view.  I am working from \"What I want to do\" (post, mark, keep up with things, dialogue, respond, create new links, debate . . .) to \"functionality - needed tools\" (simple permalinks to another post, something between \"threaded\" and \"nested\" views, subscribe at discussion level etc).  I want to use a forum for it's purposes and no more as I listed in my second post.  I don't want it to manage Happy Birthday messages, do an analysis of word counts by student, manage automatic reminders of deadlines, or anything.  Just the core.  My belief: a few of these would vastly improve the power of the forum. John, you say: \"In my experience, most teachers' first intro to moodle is through the implementation of the forum activity. It is simple to set up, offers few features to confuse the novice user, is bullet proof and easy to conceptualize. I would be worried that forumng would be bit daunting for new users\" Few features (yes) but it is not fair to assume new features = confusion.  \"Daunting\"?  Ask those who use it.  Have you seen ForumNG? And: \"Finally, I'm not sure that you can make the case for it simply by re-stating its good features. Sure, it has nice features but it is not a new activity, it would replace an existing one. So, (again just in my opinion) it needs to be head and shoulders above the standard forum in all areas, not just features. I'm not restating as far as I know.  There are no other forum discussions that I know of looking at forum development.  I'm trying to cast a view of some attainable features for a forum tool to make it really a 21st century tool, and so that the rest of us without the resouorces of the OU don't have to try to code out own.  What I am trying to say is that ForumNG is \"Head and Shoulders\" above the standard forum.  We can either improve the standard forum or add an alternative.  I'm another huge admirer but non-groupie of Sam's - and the OU work.  Why are they bothering with tyheir own forum?  Because I suspect it works better. Your other four questions: I quote: (1) Is it faster than the standard forum (or better)? (2) Is it as easy to use (or better)? (3) Is it as bug free (or better)? I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they should be considered, (4) don't you? Yes.  Thanks to AJAX. At lease as easy to use.  Buttons are well placed.  Descriptions and flow of actions is clear and nice.  See the link to the forum to look at if you want to see for yourself. Is anything bug free?  OU will deploy it for 351,023 students.  It is stable. Of course. Hence my question to you about whether you have used forums: I have seen these features in other settings DRASTICALLY improve teaching, administration, learning, save time; that's what Glenis means (moving from a porche (forumNG) back to a Mini minor (regular Moodle forum)).  I'm postulating an improved forum as a really beneficial use of programming development time in Moodle, trying to describe something I suspect many people either have not experieinced or don't believe is possible, while trying to make this a relatively simple product. Ramble again over.  I appreciate the opportunity to post here, but I do wonder: is anyone who actually makes decisions actually listening? -Derek",

          "Text": "It's an API parity issue. In Moodle 2.x, all the core components are supposed to use the notification system; hardcoding just to send email is deprecated. It still works, but wouldn't be appropriate for a core component. To put it another way - standard forum was updated to do this as part of the change to Moodle 2 - so ForumNG should also really be updated to do it. We didn't change because it would have been more work and at the time (pre Moodle 2.0) we were a bit concerned about notification system performance (we regularly send tens of thousands of forum emails) but I think they have probably resolved the worst of those problems by now. The only issue I have with it is, I think the facility in ForumNG where when you are subscribed it tells you your email address right there on the page is nice for usability as it makes it super-clear what 'subscribed' means, and also avoids helpdesk queries if people subscribe to a forum then don't get emails because their email address in moodle is some old one they don't actually read any more... However, maybe we could still do that (depending on the notification method the user/admin has chosen). --sam",

On our old learning platform the discussion takes place on one page so there's no need to click through to view initial discussion contributions and responses. What would be great is if the whole discussion could take place on one page with all postings and responses visible if expanded. See screenshot below from our old VLE, this format works really well but I can't see how to achieve it in standard Moodle: I'm not sure this can be achieved with ForumNG either as I understand students still need to click through from the Forum page to read initial posts and responses.

But it would be the other way up though (newest last) so you wouldn't like it. Basically the answer is, no that can't be done in ForumNG at present. I think your users might eventually find, once they get used to it, that using multiple discussions each on their own page is a better way to organise a forum. Bearing in mind that it always tells you if there are new posts to read, there's not really a great hardship involved in clicking into a discussion. The style you've shown looks a bit ghetto; it's kind of reminiscent of those Japanese-style (2ch, etc) BBS systems that are inexplicably popular for posting libellous gossip and pictures of under-dressed cartoon characters.

(In the handbook for multimedia form Meyer - Cambridge Press- you find support for this approach: You can lower the workload for the student on a task by removing the navigation issues from the core task. On this moment I have three versions of my wish: 1. I still like the old D3E/Ubiquitus: the resource on the left, the connected forum on the right. (in the Royal version there is a paragraph conncetion between left and right, but this time the links initiated by the forum user.) 2.When I want to discuss a timeline like the one from MIT, I can connect (dynamicly) the pages of a moodle wiki to that timeline, but it would be easier to have here also a window with two frames, but now a frame with the timeline on top and the discussion in the bottom frame. (Again: In the Royal version the student can connect timeline instances to threads of the forum below: a variation on this one: having a movie with a timeline at the top and the student can mark spots on the timeline and attach a comment in the forum below) 3.

Most  of our settings follow the site default settings.  I would rather click than scroll any day, score one big plus.  And the second thing is MoodleDocs will be a lot easier to write because of both the collapse groups and the selection form. I did note that there was a pause of the old, while I assume Moodle determined that I had the things required to display the \"new\". Later, I would be changing the function of the \"Show Advanced\".   That could be used by the site admin to designate which groups would always be hidden/displayed .   I notice Lesson has this button and Quiz does not. yea!  Chris",

          "Text": "Hi Nadav, Thanks for sharing your work there - it'd be great if Moodle had some larger versions of the various icons and I like the idea of being able to separate out the activities into different groups in the manner you suggest. I think it would be interesting if users could list 'favourite' different modules which they use frequently and to be able to show that list by default. Interestingly, I had been toying with the idea of putting the 'Add' link on the left-hand side margin as you have in your example but I felt in the end that having them on the left made it feel more like it should add an actual section, rather than content to a section. One of my other colleagues was looking at a quick-add button to add additional sections in this manner. It's also interesting that you mention about hiding the 'command' span (the one with all of the move/delete/duplicate/etc buttons). I was looking at doing so this morning using CSS . It's extremely easy to do with CSS, but I'm not convinced that it's a great idea as it's not immediately apparent how you can make modifications until you start moving your mouse around the screen. As an alternative, I've been wondering about two alternatives: * rather than hiding the icons entirely, having them greyed out slightly so that they're visible but not intrusive; and * limiting the options shown there to move, indent, and outdent; then adding a dropdown menu with all of the other available options including a brief textual description of each (e.g. Assign Roles, Remove, Duplicate, Change Group Mode). The dropdown text could be greyed out until you mouse over the section box. It's really good to get your feedback, and we've submitted these features for review and inclusion into Moodle 2.3 in tracker tickets:",

          "Text": "Hi Andrew Thank you for your detailed answer! The icons are from a demo i used : http://razorjack.net/quicksand/ ( i found it here ) it uses jquery, so i was not even sure if it is wise to use at all, after reading all the jquery vs yui discussions, here in the forums. (but, last Moodle HQ dev meeting, it was decided to include an option for jquery in core. so it seems it is relatively an option, once again ) I forgot to show in the video that we also (like you) hide all the extra (and very confusing) advanced preferences or settings in each Form Moodle has. Since most of the teachers use only 20% of the features and are intimidated by all the settings they need to fill (or decide upon) when starting a new activity. On the same subject (Forms), I would also like to add that we consider adding a \"submit\" button right after the two or three most needed fields in each Form, (and color it green, maybe?) so teachers could submit the Form after filling the basic necessary info for the activity's initial state. later, they can go back and tweak it in a more advanced way. (i think) Regarding the hidden activity/resource Action icons: I was inspired by the Foodle theme, which implemented this very easy CSS \"trick\". it is an old theme from 2009 and no longer available but here is a link to my archive: Foodle theme I also agree that it can be confusing, at first. and i like your idea to make it grayed out. or make only one button/icon that opens up a small window with all the options. similar behaviour to a right click context menu. but with left mouse click. (maybe) Getting back to the new activity/resource menu... We are currently developing and looking for ideas to solve our following needs: 1. Activity Chooser: make a clear list of activities and resources with short description of each (like you did) 2. A wizard that take the teacher through a pedagogical decision making flow, and eventually, recommends the use of one or more resources and activities that he/she needs to create in order to fulfill his/her pedagogical agenda. ( A pedagogical add activity and not a technical add activity, like we currently have) 3. A quick add file(s)/resource(s). (there are some 3rd party solutions) maybe drag & drop? 4. First time course generator, that asks for subjects (topics/sections) with images and text that is generating the entire front-page of the course 5. Complete course template generator, which will probably import all activities and resources from a Course Template which is placed in some other Hidden category on the system along with several other course templates. We would like all of these ideas/needs to be, some how, combined into a single UI. not sure how, yet. I would LOVE your (and anyone's) opinions on those needs/ideas. Nadav",
