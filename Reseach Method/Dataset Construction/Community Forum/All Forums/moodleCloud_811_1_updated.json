This was the answer I was given: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - By default, I believe only the 'Manual enrolment' and 'Self enrolment' methods in Moodle include an option to send a custom welcome message to users when they join a course. The 'Enrolment on payment' method doesn’t currently provide a built-in welcome message feature. It may still send users a payment confirmation (depending on the payment gateway used), but that message isn’t managed by Moodle itself. I’d recommend doing a quick test enrolment through the payment method to confirm what notification, if any, is sent automatically. If no message goes out, one idea could be to include your own welcome text or course link in the payment confirmation email.",

In parallel, I 'road tested' my latest course as if I was a fresh registrant (to make sure that authentication, enrollment, payment, etc were all working smoothly. In short - yes, everything works, but there's no visible option to automatically send a confirmation email. In my case (using PayPal), I got a 'payment receipt' email, which closes the loop on the financials (allowing course participants to claim the registration fee back from their employer, for example). But, in terms of the automatic 'welcoming' from an academic/pastoral point of view . . . seems we are back to good old manual methods (daily check of the list of participants, then send an email). Not too bad, but not slick. All the best / Ian",

But I will leave it here since one possible solution involves plugins which you can't add to Moodlecloud. There is no standard way to be certain that a student has completed one course before moving onto another. A popular workaround is mentioned in the Moodle documentation : Can I make access to a course conditional upon completing another? where basically you set up course B with an enrolment key and  in course A you use Restrict access and Activity completion to conditionally display the enrolment key in a Page once every activity in course A has been completed. This works, but if you have  a group of students who communicate with each other it would be easy for them to pass on the enrolment key to course B. But then - you would know - because the logs will show that they have not completed course A.",

          "Text": "Hello MoodleCloud Community, We’re reaching out to update you about the recent performance issues that have affected some MoodleCloud sites. We understand how frustrating this has been for you and your learners, and we want to assure you that resolving these issues is our highest priority. After a thorough investigation, we can confirm that these problems are not related to any security breach or external attack; your MoodleCloud site remains secure and protected. Our technical team has identified several underlying causes that have contributed to slower performance in specific situations. In simple terms, we’ve found that some parts of the system have been handling background tasks and caching less efficiently than intended. These inefficiencies have, at times, increased load on our servers and caused slower page response times. We’re actively working on a set of fixes that will: Reduce unnecessary background activity, helping pages load faster. Optimise how data is stored and retrieved , especially in courses with more complex structures. Improve memory management for users who access sites without logging in. Ensure commonly used information loads more quickly and consistently. These improvements are currently being finalised and tested. They will be included in the upcoming Moodle 5.1.1 release, scheduled for 8 December 2025 . We’ll send a follow-up update on that date to confirm the release and share any further details. Thank you for your patience and continued trust as we make these improvements. We’re committed to ensuring MoodleCloud remains a reliable, high-performing platform for you and your learners.

However, this may be a misunderstanding. It sounds like the $230 figure comes from the reference pricing shown in US Dollars on our pricing page . It’s important to note that MoodleCloud plans are billed in Australian Dollars (AUD) . For customers outside Australia, the amount charged in local currency will vary depending on exchange rates set by banks or card providers. Currently, the Mini plan is 340 AUD per year , which is approximately 230 USD at today’s exchange rate. This plan will increase to 380 AUD per year starting 13th August 2025 . We hope this helps clarify things! All the best, Christian",

All tables in pages, books, questions, etc. are shown without borders around their cells . Only the borders around the tables in their entirety are displayed correctly. When I created my pages, the cell borders were perfectly visible without any specific action on my part: all I had to do was tell the page editor (TinyMCE) to create a table, selecting its size and choosing the background color, and the table was shown with all the cell borders, both in the editor and on the final page. Now the pages lose readability and the contents of each cell seem to touch the contents of adjacent cells. I'm so frustrated... 😧Fortunately the school year is almost over, so my students will not have to deal with these confusing pages, but my job now is to fix everything. I would like to submit a few questions: is there a way to fix my content (pages, books, questions, ...) by working on some setting in MoodleCloud , or do I have to edit every single table, on every single page, in every course I have created all these years to add borders around the cells? if I have to do this, is there a search that I can run on my site to locate where the content has HTML tables in it, or do I have to open every single page (and book, and question, ...) to see if that content needs to be edited or not? I hope someone can answer my request, and I hope I don't have to work all  summer season to fix my Moodle site 😨. Looking forward to any (good) news, I thank you in advance and wish you a nice day, Luigi",

Are you able to provide any information about when we may expect our course pages to return to their original state? I appreciate that this will be in the hands of your developers, but this is impacting our efforts to recruit new students to our courses in addition to potentially causing existing students to reconsider their continued enrollment. It would also be useful if you could point me towards a mailing list that we could subscribe to so that we could be made aware prior to any updates to MoodleCloud and their potential impacts. Does Moodle provide a User Acceptance Test environment that we can subscribe to, so that we, as end users, can prove our Moodle courses prior to updates going live?

My mistake was assuming that the problem was with the iframe element and failing to examine the Bootstrap 5 migration guide properly ( https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration/#helpers ), whereas it was in fact three deprecated classes used by the container: - embed-responsive - embed-responsive-16by9 - embed-responsive-item Using the replacement ratio classes present in Bootstrap 5 resolved the issue for me.",

I know they exists, but are they considered additionnal plugins, or included in the \"unlimited activities\" ? like unlimited numer of all the different possible types of activities ? Can I SSO in a moodlecloud, like having a separate website on which student may purchase the course and access directly the moodle course they purchase ? I don't necessarily need/want all the bells and whistles, and to be honest, I can't list my needs, because I don't know exactly what to ask for... And I'm (extremly) limited in budget, that's why I'd like to know what I'll be able to do / not do upfront instead of trying the cloud version for exemple, and then discover it's not enough, or that there is a feature I thought would be included, but it's not, and have to upgrade, ie pay more, or migrate to a partner (which equal pay more) or try to selfhost my instance (whih was my original plan). In other words, if I see the cloud version doesn't include things I may want from the start, then i can look for more expensive options straight away, and start to look for maybe crowdfund my project, etc... Or, I can evaluate if the missing feature(s) is not a big deal in the begining (like SSO) and that's something I might improve later on, by upgrading. I'm more a \"hands on\" type of person, I already selfhost my nextcloud, and I plan to host my videos and documents in here, and link it to moodle, hence why a comprehensive list of what is and is not included would be very helpful to make the right decision for me.

So, yes the information exists, somewhere in some places, but it's a lot of dig around to find something which seems quite important in order to make some \"informed decision\" (at least partially informed, but more than just about price, user and data storage...) In antoher (older) video, it shows for exemple that the automatic backup is not inclded, which obviously is something I would really need to know before hand, so I can plan for that too.....

Any Moodle Hosting requires an in-depth understanding of the usage pattern of Moodle sites. The choice of an ideal Moodle hosting service depends on the purpose of your Moodle site, the max number of concurrent users, amongst other such factors . Once you have zeroed in on these specifics related to your Moodle site, you will be in a much better position to choose the best-fit hosting provider . 2 things you won't see which could bite ... these are technical and below the water line of what makes a Moodle server: Inode Limits. Disk space ... where one is hosted, do they offer detachable data devices of a size you choose? Could list a few more, but think you get the idea? Then there is what access one has to those things 'below the water line' of the iceburg that is a moodle (and how much hands on you really want to do). A biggy ... DB server config and tweaks.   The more one can fit the DB for a moodle into memory of a server, the better. If you were to ask a hosting provider about those make sure you are talking to someone technical and not a sales type.  Sales will promise anything ... Techincal might not be able to provide with 'package XYZ'. Anyhoo ... 2 cents more? 'SoS', Ken",

But that's good though, cause it is clearly pointing me on the direction of finding some crowdfunding first, and if moodlecloud really is enough, that probably means I don't have to ask for too much to be able to start.... @Ken , Great questions !! For now, I don't have anything setup on Moodle. I use to have some content on a friend's server (who had installed Moodle on his own), but one day, the server was not responding, my friend was on holiday with no way to restart or gain access to his server, so.... well, I went on to other unrelated projects. Back now on this courses project, I'm still very much interrested in Moodle, especially for it's open source and self hosting possibilities. I looked at Open Edx but it seems the hardware requirements is far more important and somehow the 'bricks' to make it all work together seemed more complicated (I don't remember the specifics but there was a pretty big differences). Now, the real question is about how hands on I'd like to be : I enjoy techy stuff, but, I also know it can quickly take me away from what I should probably be focusing on, i.e. developping my content and make it available to the world !! (ADHD brain here.... New stuffs are exciting until... they're not...) That said, I indeed have some more information I can provide : - in terms of users, a basic 50 will be enough in the begining, but maybe I should aim for 100 from the start. And then, as (paying) users increases, I guess I should be able to afford upgraded plans - My main topic is Non Violent Communication, with a lots of asynchrone content, lot's of videos (I'm trying to make it fun with short sketchs and real life scenario), some cheat sheet and summaries, and I'd like to add mini games and quizzes to help remember some of the main notions, and also, some free flow (text or video) experience sharing. And from time to time, synchrone get together for practices and feedbacks. As far as tech stuff : my Nextcloud is currently on a raspberryPi and working fine. I have 2 USB HardDrive of 4To each attached to it. And I've been offered another 4To, which is not in use for now, but will be.... For that Moodle project, ie if I really go with the selfhosting solution, I manange to find a Belkin Mini PC, A100. I don't remember the whole specs now, it's nothing big, but it seemed decent for the price (16 Go RAM, 500 Go SSD). My main objective was to have a x86 processor, since arm is fun but kind of limited. My plan is to reinstall my Nextcloud on the Mini PC, + Moodle (I was thinking doing this in separate VMs on Proxmox, don't know if it's a good idea....) and use the Raspberry for the \"security\" aspect of things (Fail2ban, NGinx, Pihole... and/or to have something like pfSense on it for firewall - but proxmox also has very decent FF setup capabilities....). I also know that USB HardDrives attached are not the best nor the fastest and most reliable option, but hey, that's what I currently have And I also know I won't be able to RAID them if their attached with USB... With three 4To HardDrive, I should probably consider a NAS, but I hate Synology (all this proprietary things - for the short story, I had to literarlly dump an old NAS because I couldn't update it anymore and some of synology proprietary stuff made the motherboard unusable for anything else). Qnap might lead to similar issues in the long run, and I cant really afford to built a NAS from scratch (I probably could technically, I can't financially, so I won't). ' So as you can see, very DIY stuffs. Anyhow, while I would probably enjoy the server admin side of things, I might actually as well lose my time and patience fixing things... Now as I said, I'm currently unemployed, so I have zéro financial ressources to invest in a monthly plan (which has to be paid in full for a year, which again, is not something I can afford.... for now). Is it giving you some ideas/directions to go ?",

I did, since I had a previous life where I was making pretty good money, I even qualified to become a trainer/facilitator, but... anyway, not goign into details.... I've not seen anything like I'm offering, and I've already beta tested with a dozen coaches who asked me to continue : they wanted to learn and practice more, and gave me some valuable feedbacks to improve what I already had. Now maybe they insisted because it was free for them )) As for the vettng or \"clearing house\", it's me, myself and I. That said, I have a pretty strong and diverse background, so it's not like I'm going completly blind or freestyle I don't plan on becoming rich with this (I don't plan on becoming rich, period), but I know the quality of what I'm offering, so at minimum, I'd like to cover my costs, and if there is a little more, that's great !! So I guess my (difficult) balance is here : I have no money to start, I'm not doing this for the money either, I like the diversity of what such project entailes (tech IT setup, video recording and editing, role playing for sketches...) AND, at the same time.... Each of these things are proper jobs on and by themselves, and while I build the server to eventually host the whole thing, I'm not creating and delivering my content.... I know it sounds like a \"junior fun project\", and in some ways, it is, but the reason I'm starting with DIY is actually because, first, I enjoy it, and then, I can't afford perfect and polished professional stuffs, knowing I might not cover those costs, because of competition and because I don't want these trainings to be so expensive that they are only accessible to middle and upper class (as NVC is today). So step by step, few learners, which hopefully will allow me to improve my courses, get better hosting plans and a little more bells, and a little more whistles, and maybe at some point go with a hosting provider, and/or video professional editor, and/or training designers.... Just one step at a time. Just to loop back on my initial question, that is why I needed a little more than what was shown on the official Moodle site ;)",

And your LD won't have any users/nor stats, etc.  Is there a max for size of mbz files you can restore? You mentioned videos ... that would be an excellent question to ask MC support folks. Keep an exit strategy in mind though .... Who knows, you might stay with MC a long time, but when/if you begin to think about DIY/other hosting, ask about that ... you can always download course backups and restore those ... the whole site ... think MC does what a MP would do ... you get a DB dump and an archive of moodledata.   Moodle version would then become important to know as that will determine PHP version/+extensions and DB version.  Restoring 2/3's of a site is doable.

          "Text": "Hi Andriele and other MoodleCloud Customers, Thank you for your honest feedback and for holding us to the standard you rightly expect. I want to apologise for the continued performance issues and the unacceptable impact they’ve had on you, your customers and all other MoodleCloud Customers. You are right to be frustrated. The lack of stability, slow load times, and lack of updates on the status page are not acceptable. I understand how critical this is for your business, and that this isn't just an inconvenience, but a real and urgent disruption. Here’s what’s happening: We are facing a combination of high user activity and unexpected traffic patterns that are overloading our infrastructure even as we scale it. Primarily, AI-driven crawlers and bots have been aggressively scanning and hitting your MoodleCloud instances' public pages. We don't believe at this time that the activity is malicious, as the web as a whole is increasingly seeing this issue. Previously, updating the robots.txt, a file which tells the web crawlers to ignore some pages, blocking certain IP addresses and browser agent IDs, and increasing resourcing has mitigated their impact. However, this time, each of these measures has been ineffective, the robot.txt is being ignored, ip addresses are being randomised, and each time the resourcing has been increased, the traffic has also increased to overwhelm the servers again. As it stands, the infrastructure is running 4x the resources we would otherwise expect to require for our normal operations, so this is financially impacting Moodle as well. This has been an ongoing cat and mouse game for some time as the traffic for most intents and purposes looks like normal user traffic. This led to our original incorrect conclusion that it was extremely large quizzes on a small number of sites, this delayed our ability to respond appropriately. Detecting this traffic and responding has been non-trivial. We have considered just completely block the pages which are being scraped, however, one of the primary pages is the policies that all your new users need to be able to access when they sign up due to GDPR regulations which has greatly complicated matters. We're now actively working on: Blocking and filtering out harmful automated traffic: We are continuing to make changes and implement additional filtering, and add further mechanisms to verify users on public pages are humans. You may see an uptick in the number of times you need to respond to a Captcha when accessing your systems. Infrastructure Scaling: We have already actively increasing server capacity, optimising database performance, and investing in more robust load balancing across regions. We will increase this further if required to provide the expected performance as further mitigation while the web crawler traffic still poses an issue. Optimising the platform’s performance: including how interactive elements load under stress, this is an ongoing task but we have already delayed other project work to prioritise this for the foreseeable future. Updating the status page daily: so you're no longer left in the dark. This has been a gap in communication between our engineering teams and the support team which has been recognised and will be rectified. Unfortunately, our team was so focused on fixing the issue that communications with you, our users, has broken down, we will endeavour for this not to be the case moving forward. Realistically, when will this be fixed? Our current projections indicate we expect noticeable and sustained performance improvements over coming days, assuming no unexpected setbacks. However, I understand that it hasn’t been soon enough for you, and I appreciate that you're having to take emergency measures — I don’t take that lightly. We have some indications that steps completed late last night by our team have had a significant impact on the web server loads as you can seen in the monitoring graph below and we are optimistic that if this holds performance will be back to acceptable level soon but we will continue to monitor and implement further changes to prevent a reoccurrence in the future. Moving forward: I will also ensure your feedback and the feedback from everyone else are discussed at the leadership level, it has already been shared with both our engineering and customer support teams. You deserve a platform that performs the way you were promised. I can’t undo what you’ve been through, but we are committed to getting this right and we will keep you updated at every step. With sincere apologies and appreciation for your patience, Frances The MoodleCloud Team",

I submitted a support ticket but this has a 2 day SLA so I might not hear back until Tuesday. Does anyone know if the site restore process should be instant upon adding new card details? I would have expected it to be, but it would be good to know what others have experienced, and if I just need to be patient! Unfortunately there seems to be nobody I can call about this, the only contact with Moodle Team is via the online message widget. Thanks very much",

There are a couple of ways to fix this, the first is the obvious and edit each page.  This is probably the simplest and long term probably the best option as it will work for the life of Bootstrap 5 (V4 was released in 2018).  The second option would be to add the required classes to the SCSS setting in the Custom theme settings options in the site administration.  This requires some HTML/ CSS knowledge to do correctly but it will potentially fix the issue site wide.",

What does this mean for your MoodleCloud site? After the 5.0 update, you will no longer be able to add new Chat or Survey activities to your courses. Any existing Chat or Survey activities will no longer function and will be removed from your site.

I looked at the log and it shows thirteen events with the same timestamp (March 20, 2025, 10:34:40 PM) made by me, with the same IP address (the right one), in that section. All events are tagged \"course module update\". The number of events (thirteen) matches the number of items in the section. On that day, I actually worked in that course and in that section, but only to assess a quiz taken by my students last week. I'm sure I didn't make any changes to all the other items.

We offer courses to our students and the current system (Filemaker) that we have give  student access to the module/subject only if they made their first payment. We are looking for a similar function on Moodle. We want the students to have payment invoices. The paid invoices must control the modules or subject in the course. For example lets say the student paid 1 invoice , they must have access to the first module/subject . No payment no access to the  module/subject. Also student must be able to have access to the next module if they only pay every second invoice, in other words making  1st payment , module/subject should be available to the student , 3rd payment = second module/subject , 4th payment = 3nd module/subject and so on. Should we continue using the payment system that we have and intergrate it with Moodle to get payment information or this can be done on Moodle.?",

We would like to send out weekly progress reports to all of our students to let them know which assignments they have completed and what they still need to complete. Currently, we manually e-mail every student individually. We run a course completion report and copy it into an e-mail to each student. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable as our registration numbers increase. I saw that there is a Participation Report where we can send a message for each assignment to students who have not completed the assignment. That means students who haven't started any assignments would get 26 e-mails, one for each of our assignments. That's not a great user experience. I saw the Pulse plug-in and believe that functionality is what we're looking for. However, we can't install plug-ins on MoodleCloud. Are there any options for us to automate sending out weekly progress reports? Or do we have to stick to doing it manually?",

I have set up enrolment on payment within moodlecloud and in the individual course. I h ave set up Paypal business. Now, how do I connect them, so that when someone pays from a paypal button (or QR code) on an independent website an auto-enrollment is generated per the enrollment on payment settings? The whole idea is to not have to manually enter the information and for users to have <nearly> immediate access to the moodle course. Adding that at moment students only see the courses they are enrolled in. If they do enter the specific URL for the paycourse, they are invited to pay, so that part works. I cannot be the only one with this issue -- I recall that several years ago, I did a small course for a group that set up an automatic enrolment on payment using paypal in this manner but now, post-pandemic, I cannot find them.

We like the Enrolment on Payment integration with PayPal, but we need to find a way to allow the purchase to occur before a user has been created. Registration is a huge blocker for course conversions. If I could find a way to support this, I'd just put a purchasing mechanism directly on our website. But I haven't found a solution that can connect the external payment to the Moodle course. And for our use case, it is vital that the purchase can be completed without a user existing in the Moodle site.",

You will need to fix that code, otherwise the site will keep being unaccessible. I would suggest either doing that on a local installation of Moodle, or - if you do it on this site - to keep the relevant admin page opened in a different tab (while you test in a different browser or incognito window), to be able to revert back to a working configuration when things break. Your site is back online now. Mathieu",

          "Text": "I'm using Moodlecloud to design a 6 week course. The course encourages participants to take part in some exercises each week and to set a goal which they can aim to achieve over the six weeks of the course. I want to create a function through which participants can set a goal at the beginning of the course and then come back to review/reflect on it (and even edit/add to it) throughout the course. However, I'm struggling to find a function that suits this on Moodlecloud. For example, the Feedback option is good for open entry text but participants cannot review it after they've submitted it. I've also considered using the Quiz option. This works well in terms of function but the language is misleading since it refers to things like 'quiz', 'result' and 'assessment', which are not relevant. I read that you can change this language under 'language administration', but when I try I see a message saying \"this feature is not available in MoodleCloud.\" I also read about other plugin options to help with customisation, or options such as the journal plugin - but it would seem these aren't available with Moodlecloud either? My questions are: 1. Am I missing some steps that would make the above options work with MoodleCloud? If so, what are they? 2. If these options don't work with MoodleCloud, is anyone aware of alternative ways I could create this goal-setting function? I basically just need them to be able to type in a goal and be able to refer to it throughout the course. Is it possible to code within MoodleCloud? Also just to note I'm working on behalf of an organisation so don't have control over what type of account they have. Thank you.",

Goal: To only show user profile information & course participant data to the matching Learning Centre Admin for for that centre. Overview: There are 8 different learning centres which share the same courses, so I am trying to restrict access so that each Learning Center Admin can only see the participants related to their centre as well as only see their user profile information including within reports. Other context : There are 130 courses under one Course Category and there is over 650 students assigned to multiple different courses. There are 8 different student roles which correspond to a different learning center names e.g \"Atlas Student\", \"Falls Student\" etc There are 8 corresponding teacher roles for the admins at each center so they can just view the users within their center. E.g  \"Atlas Admin\" should only see user participant & profile information who have \"Atlas Student\" role E.g  \"Falls Admin\" should only see user participant & profile information who have \"Falls Student\" role Hopefully that explains things enough but happy to share more info",

I will change the archetype for Center Admins to Teacher or Non-Editing Teacher role, as I wasn't aware of the limitation of changing admin roles to have less permissions. So all the Center Admins need to be able to to do is: - Ability to only see the user profiles who are affiliated to their centre - Ability to only be able to add the users who are affiliated to their centre as a participant to a course - Ability to add a new user to the system and be able to assign them the right student role - Ability to view and change the profile information of a user assigned to their centre (just the custom fields and possibly email address)",

          "Text": "Hello again David. To be honest I don't think you can do exactly what you want to do with standard Moodle LMS - of which MoodleCloud is an example. Teachers can't by default add new users to the system. Admins and those with the Manager role can do this, but it is not possible to restrict visiblity to just their centre. How difficult is it for you or one trusted admin to do a regular upload of users from various centres via CSV? In the CSV file you can include the Group field ( and if the group is not yet made, then Moodle will create it so you don't have to. You can then use a regular Teacher or non-editing teacher role in the courses and with the permission restriction mentioned previously, they will only see the users that they are responsible for in their centre. Look at the video How can I enrol groups into my courses? However, if you don't want to do this then to have complete restrictions of each centre,  you would have to investigate something called Multitenancy which is offered by Moodle Workplace, supported by Moodle HQ like MoodleCloud .

I did try to test this using Groups but it seems very tedious that groups only exist within courses and have to be manually created and manually assigned users to them when new courses get created as well as all existing courses.

          "Text": "Description of the issue: I have built a course in MoodleCloud with various H5P packages, predominantly using Course Presentations, Accordion, and Information Wall content types. There are no interactive videos included in the course. Until a few days ago, I was able to update these H5P content types without any issues. However, I am now encountering a \"Video source is missing\" error when attempting to open two of the Course Presentation files that I recently updated. The error persists despite several troubleshooting attempts, including: Editing the H5P content both in situ and via the Content Bank . Deleting and re-linking the files within the H5P activity. Re-creating a fresh H5P activity and linking to the files, or uploading the file. Replacing the files with fresh copies of the content or even newly created files. When attempting to copy the content from Content Bank > More , the editor displays settings related to Interactive Video , which seems unrelated to the content type in question. It feels like MoodleCloud is suddenly treating all H5P content types as if they were videos? Steps Taken to Reproduce: Open an existing H5P Course Presentation in the course. Make an update and save. Observe the \"Video source is missing\" error message. Impact: This issue has affected two of my Course Presentation files, making them unusable, and I am now hesitant to make further changes, as this course is set to go live soon. Additional Information: I do not have admin access to this MoodleCloud instance, but I am in contact with the administrator, so I can relay any site-level instructions if required. Request for Help: Could anyone suggest steps to resolve this issue, or at least determine what might be causing MoodleCloud to behave this way? I don't know whether this is a bug in MoodleCloud or a problem with the H5P integration. If this post belongs in the H5P plugin section instead, please (lovely moderators) feel free to move it.

When we log in (tried multiple browsers, clearing caches, incognito mode) we get this error message and can't click on any of the menus, it just refreshes the Site Administration page with this error message: She chose moodlecloud so we wouldn't have to deal with coding or servers.

On my Moodle Cloud trial instance (created today), I have 3 builtin policies (Privacy Notice, Cookies Policy, MoodleCloud Terms of Service). Actually, my customer sells the courses separately from his learning platform (Moodle probably in future), so they would already have all neccessary consents when enrolling new users to Moodle. So there is no need to have any consents, and especially so many of them. That could be also overwhelming for new users. I tried to inactivate these policies, but I cannot do it even on a fresh new instance, without any consents. Is it possible to inactivate / delete these policies? I am asking for on-premise Moodle, which I didn't install yet. Maybe merging those into single policy (single required consent) would be sufficient for us. What regards MoodleCloud Terms of service, I suppose it will be not present on on-premise instance, is it correct?",

          "Text": "All, I've been receiving really useful help here - maybe this will help others in the same situation as me: Ona typical course, I have 40 students, each has between 8 and 24 assignments to submit. Going through Moodle, opening each assignment one by one and checking for unmarked assignments is a real nuisance. I have made a spreadsheet with a bit of VBA. It cycles through all assignment windows in a course and opens each one in a separate tab. I then run through the tabs, and any where \"Needs grading\" is not zero, I know I have assignments to mark there. Where I see a zero, I just close that tab. In seconds, I'm left with only the tabs where I have marking to do. To make this: Create a spreadsheet, save it as an .xlsm (macro-enabled spreadsheet) Select a range of cells - single column. Into the cells, copy & paste the url's of each grading summary page (the one that shows Participants, Submitted, Needs grading), one under the next. Name this range - I called mine \" Assignment_URLs\" Copy & paste the following code in as a VBA module: Sub Open_Assignment_URLs_In_New_Tabs() Dim rng As Range Dim cell As Range Dim URL As String Sheets(\"Sheet 1\").Select ‘Change this to the sheetname where the links are [Assignment_URLs].Select ‘Named range where the links are ' Check if a single column is selected If TypeName(Selection) = \"Range\" Then If Selection.Columns.Count = 1 Then Set rng = Selection ' Loop through each cell in the selected column For Each cell In rng ' Get the URL from the cell URL = Trim(cell.Value) ' Open the URL in a new tab If URL <> \"\" Then CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run URL End If Next cell Else MsgBox \"Please select a single column containing URLs.\", vbExclamation End If Else MsgBox \"Please select a single column containing URLs.\", vbExclamation End If End Sub If you aren't sure how to insert VBA, ask ChatGPT - it gives a good explanation and examples. To use the spreadsheet: Log in to Moodle as teacher. Run the code; it should open as many new tabs in your browser as you have url's in the named range. Hope this is of use, Ian",

I very much like the fact that most of the functionality I see is familiar from my time with hosted Moodle. My students submit 6 Powerpoint presentations during a course offering, which I then grade. The whole grading side is the same as hosted Moodle, so all is fine there. One snag: I tried submitting an assignment; it was blocked, as it was larger than 1Mb. I reduced the size, it then uploaded without problem. I saw an options window - I forgot where -  setting maximum upload file size; the largest available was indeed 1Mb. Pretty much all PPT files that contain pictures are larger than this - 20Mb would be enough. Under \"Edit Course Settings\" I set maximum file size to 20Mb, thinking this would do it. Can I increase this 1Mb limit? If it's a \"feature\" of the free version, and paid versions allow larger files, fine - I'll simply upgrade. But I would like to know if this is possible before I upgrade. Ian",

The maintenance mode page is put in place to give students a nice page rather than an error when infrastructure work is required on MoodleCloud such as upgrades or more recently a database migration to ensure that the system was running on a supported and secure infrastructrure. This is why Admins can't turn off maintenance mode. Once the work is complete all sites should automatically be set back but on occasion one or two fail to do so. With 10s of thousands of sites its not always as easy as we would like to catch the ones that have not changed back. We are looking at improving monitoring to help mitigate this posibility futher.",

On Plugins / Document converters / Google Drive , set the OAuth 2 service to Google.

          "Text": "Hi Sarah, Student submissions can take up a lot of space. Understandably, it is easier to prevent this by restricting the assignment submission upload size. Find out more about assignments , using assignments , and assignment settings . In your case, you have a few options, depending on your organisation's needs and compliance requirements. You could perform a course backup or an activity backup , and download these for safe keeping, and remove the course/activity from your site. Please refer to our article on restoring deleted courses for more information (especially the 100MB file limit). However, backup files do not allow easy or quick access to student work, if that is what you also need. If you need the course for another cohort, please refer to our information on course copy and reset course . If the course is currently being used, and you only want to remove the file submissions, then you could download the student submissions (in a zip file) and then delete the submissions . However, deleting a student submission will delete the grade assigned to that submission too! As a workaround, you could create an offline assignment just to enter the grades and feedback, to keep these in the system if you're removing the assignment with the large student submission files. If you only want to delete the submitted files, but leave the student assignment submission with the grades and feedback, then it is possible to edit the student submission and replace the uploaded file with another file (e.g. an 'empty' txt file). The issue with this, is that even though it is possible from a system perspective, it compromises the integrity of the student submission from an educational perspective. Also, it is exceptionally time consuming to edit each student's assignment submission. There may be other options or possibilities, feel free to explore Moodle Docs for everything Moodle can do. FYI , other articles related to storage in MoodleCloud are: Delete unused media files in MoodleCloud , and Optimise your MoodleCloud storage . Hope this helps Kind regards, Barbara",

To be clear we are very confident that this is not directly related to the upgrades, normally for a very short time (hours or less) after an upgrade there can be some degredation in performace as caches are rebuilt, thats clearly not the issue here. At this point investigations have revealed that it is a combination of thing which is causing the issue, one of which was caused by a failure in our third party performance monitoring software causing webservers to become unresponsive. This has meant until our vendor can resolve this issue we have needed to disable this aspect of performance monitoring which is inhibiting our ability to quickly investigate any further causes. That said the initial changes we have made seem to have resolved the slowness and connection problems for the majority of clients but there are still a number that are continuing to experience this as you have observed and we are continuing to put our available resources on this issue.

These new in-course communication options will help educators and learners stay connected, foster increased engagement, and work more closely together!

For example, a bounce might occur if the user's email address is either invalid or the mailbox is full or unavailable (even an \"out-of-office reply\" has triggered this bounce). This information is supplied by AWS (Amazon Web Services), who we use to host all MoodleCloud sites and deliver site related emails. MoodleCloud appends a user's email with \".invalid\" when AWS tells us the email address bounces. This is automated to avoid repeated attempts to send an email that is bouncing back. You can manually remove \".invalid\" from the users' email addresses in your site and this should resolve the issue, unless the user's mailbox does not accept the email. The user should also check their email filters to make sure they accept (and not automatically reject) the email notifications from your MoodleCloud site. If your users use an institutional email, check your organisation's email server for filters that may have been applied that detect the email is from AWS/bulk email, and reject it.

This doesn't resolve the issue for learners, but did resolve the issue for staff. The main issue was that users aren't told that they are no longer going to receive emails, they just stop. So staff members missed assignments being handed in, and other announcements. We then do a monthly check on learners who have had .invalid added to their email address and see if something has changed. 98% of the time they have had an out-of-office on which has caused a bounce back.",

If there's a way to accomplish this, I'd love to know what it is. Thanks in advance. David",

It looks great in lots of ways but is still quite new and unfortunately does not integrate perfectly with Moodle yet. As a small-ish charity we also don't have the funds to spend a monthly amount on it (even though it is very reasonably priced). I'm just wondering whether there is any way of creating a similar type of acvitiy directly in Moodle, on the MoodleCloud server . The kind of course which we run is one where students are required to: - complete self-assessment forms, which they may want to refer back to over the course of the programme - create action plans, which, again, they will need to refer back to, potentially make changes to, etc. - keep track of their progress by rating themselves on a scale for various parameters. Over time, this rating should improve, and they should be able to see this improvement The \"Feedback\" activity type does not work for these kinds of activities , because once submitted, participants cannot see their responses. The only work-around I have come up with so far is to ask them to download , complete and submit a worksheet as an \"Assignment\" activity, but this feels clumsy and I would really like these activities to be integrated. An online workbook like Wobo seems to be the ideal solution, but as I say, Wobo itself is not quite there yet. Does anyone know of a similar tool, or a good work-around on Moodle?",

No one ever responds in last couple months. I have 512 MB of storage, but I'm almost maxed out with video. When I click on \"users storage\" I see duplicates of high MB videos which I uploaded. It appears that sometimes if you upload a video and then delete it and upload a revised video, it doesn't dump the old video out of the memory allotment. When I click \"see all\" I can view the duplicate video names and see the storage space they're taking. And I get a \"Component\" column which I don't understand, stating one of the videos is on the \"mod_page\" whatever that is. There is a column \"Filearea\" which will state \"summary\" or \"content\" which I don't understand and then there is an \"action\" column where there is a clickable \"view in context \" button, which is worthless, since it merely takes you to the general course content. Frustrating! Thanks for anyone's help. In short how do I clear videos duplicates out of my storage allotment, so that I don't max out my allotted storage?",

While I can't help with the specifics of your site without knowing which one it is, I can at least clear up a few things: \"mod_page\" is a \"Page resource\", in a course. In a page resource, you can have files in either of the \"General\" section (the \"summary\" filearea), or the \"Content\" section (the \"content\" filearea). You'll see these headers by editing the Page element in your course), which will bring you to a screen similar to what you can see in the screenshot below (depending on the editor used on your site). On each of them, you can use Tools->Media Manager to access the files that are saved in that specific section, and delete them (they'll probably be listed under the \"Unused files\" list of that page). Please note you will have to save the Page to confirm your changes (using either \"Save and display\" or \"Save and return to course\"). The quota will be updated right away. Alternatively, if using the Atto editor, the \"Manage files\" tool can be accessed using the second-to-last button, just left of H5P.",

It is correct to say that Moodle does not put itself in the position of data controller for students (or other forms of data subjects) but acts as a processor for the controller (be it a university, employer or other organisation or individual). However, we also aim to provide those data controllers with the tools to meet their duties as seamlessly as possible. In instances, such as yours, where a data controller does not rely on consent as the legal basis for processing data through Moodle, or where it does rely upon consent but collects it through another means, acknowledgement of seeing the Privacy Notice would be sufficient. However, the consent box does meet the needs of those data controllers who are required to prove explicit consent. It exists to collect those records ‘for the controllers’, and Moodle is, as always, acting as their processor. There is a balancing to be struck between a series of boxes, which would address the various legal bases independently of each other, and ease of use and understanding for data subjects. We have currently taken the position that the crucial record to be collected is that of consent, and that it will also serve to acknowledge that the requirements of transparency have been met for Data Controllers not relying on consent. This is always under review and we appreciate the opportunity to assess our current position that your query offered us.",

An ideal scenario, for my company as the controller, would be to be able to configure my own privacy notice and link to Moodlecloud's privacy information. Even if moodlecloud is my processor, Moodlecloud in reality has the best information on how personal identifiable information is processed. Would be easiest to forward this information to the data subjects. When complying with GDPR, you have to choose a legal basis for processing. (See GDPR Article 6). In most cases, legitimate interest or public interest would be the proper choice. If you are running some kind of business legitimate interest is usually the way to go. You simply conclude and write down that your reasons to process personal information is greater than the data subjects' need for privacy in order to run the education. Public schools could use public interest. There are few cases where consent is the proper way to go. Consent is only possible when the choice is completely free. If you have to accept the policy in order to take the class, it's not a proper consent in GDPR. Sorry for being picky about this but I am a data protection legal specialist running a education business and not being able to be 100% GDPR compliant might reduce customer confidence.",

These are ideal for small organisations requiring a simple, pre-configured LMS solution. If you require more storage or users on the MoodleCloud platform, your options are to upgrade to a larger plan, optimise your storage (only for resources, this is not possible for student assignment submissions), and/or suspend user accounts (suspended users do not count toward your MoodleCloud user quota). To keep records and evidence of student assignments, it is possible to download student assignment submissions and assignment reports. For more information read the '5. Keeping records' section in Using Assignment . If you require additional storage  and/or users than what our MoodleCloud plans offer, you can use the fully customisable open-source Moodle LMS either as a self-hosted solution or a premium hosting plan with one of our Moodle Certified Partners . See our website for more information on MoodleCloud . There you will also find a link to start a free MoodleCloud trial where you can explore all the features to see if this is a suitable solution for your organisation. Kind regards, Barbara",

Storing educational videos is not the problem, that can be done from other sources. But asking students to use Onedrive or Dropbox instead and linking would take away focus from the learing.

For example, I see that MoodleCloud supports four different \"course formats,\" two different \"course layouts,\" and two different ways to \"hide\" sections . This becomes 16 different arrangements if my math is correct. And then, there are different ways to group quizzes, assignments, and other resources. So, I am saying that a tutorial might be hard to find.  You might want to consider making one for your specific Moodle site. However, as an example, this is what I tell my students, via this Moodle Overview video, for my older Moodle 3.11. I need to revise this for my current Moodle 4.2. I will attach the PowerPoints I used for my 3.11 Moodle Overview video to help you think about what you might need.",

A common practice I've seen in Moodle and other LMS is to post a short video/text at the top of the course to orientate students to the course structure and expectation, this generally needs to be somewhat customised to the course content or structure. Larger institutions tend to try and standardise to some extent the course formats which can help in that regard",

MoodleCloud sites have a number of selected plugins installed, and to keep the platform simple and stable for all users, we do not allow you to install your own plugins. MoodleCloud sites also come preconfigured with the plugins that are made available in the standard Moodle version. View the MoodleCloud pre-installed plugins directory. If you still require this plugin to be installed, you might want to consider downloading our full version of Moodle to install on your own server , or a paid hosting service. Alternatively, you can contact one of our Moodle Certified Service Providers for them to set it up for you. If you would like to talk about your subscription, please log in to your MoodleCloud Porta l and contact our support team. Kind regards, Frances MoodleCloud Team",

However, according to your screenshot, the location is identified as 'core', so would you please raise a support ticket from your MoodleCloud portal for further assistance with this. In general, to delete files that are associated with resources and activities in Moodle, removing the resource would remove the files. If you want to view and delete unused files from resources (but not remove the resource): open the relevant resource, select 'Settings' from the menu, select 'Manage files' from the Atto editor toolbar (as per screenshot), which will open the 'Manage files' pop-up - here you will see used and unused files (unused files can be deleted). With regard to the PDF viewer on the grading page (Annotate PDF feedback plugin), this can be omitted as an option when setting up assignments, or the plugin can be disabled in Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Assignment - Feedback plugins - Manage assignment feedback plugins Kind regards, Barbara",

I'm used to that process which I already made in the past. Now it does not work. Dropbox is activated and when they want to connect, in the parameters they can only write the name of their dropbox but the Aoth2 does not work (though it is activated too) and they don't have the fields to write their dropbox's key and password, neither have they the redirection link . My dropbox is still connected but if I want to change it, I can't because the same fields are missing… What's happening? Has something changed? And what do I have to do to make it possible?

We have implemented a help widget in the MoodleCloud Portal to help guide you to find the right answers in our new knowledge base . To open the help widget click the help icon on the bottom right hand side of the screen in the MoodleCloud Portal . This will bring up a search box where you can search for answers to all of our most commonly asked questions. In case you cannot find an answer to your query, you can still contact our support team via the new widget by searching for and opening an article . If that article does not address your query you can click the “Not helpful” button that you will find at the end of every article within the help widget. This will open up a support request where our support team can assist you. You will then be able to submit a ticket using this form: If you need something larger or more customisable than MoodleCloud offers, you are still able to contact a Moodle Partner in your region from the “Change plan” tab in your MoodleCloud Portal.

          "Text": "\" we are thinking of hosting our moodle site online for free\" Hosting will cost someone somewhere some money, so the short answer is no. The longer answer is that there is relatively affordable hosting but that is really outside the scope of the advice you should seek here. You need to understand the essentials of what is required for Moodle and this is typically the LAMPP stack. To give you an example I pay around $USD12 a month for some hosting that might support perhaps 20 to 40 simultaneous users. But I have 20 years of Moodle and related technical experience. To economise on the technical support someone has to learn a bunch of stuff or you have to persuade them to work for free/cheap. The MoodleClouud offering mentioned in this forum is quite affordable and is delivered by the worlds greatest experts on the topic, so you should consider it.",

Y por otro lado, en la página principal, en el menú superior, aparecen dos botones: Academia y Página principal, al hacer clic sobre ellos ambos me redirigen a la página principal del curso. ¿Podría configurar para que una de ellas se quede como está (me dirija  a la página principal del curso) y la otra pestaña me dirija a un curso en concreto?

To explain - we are developing a child protection training, during which, at the end of each module, participants will produce a part of a child protection policy. e.g. in Module 1 they will be asked to describe the laws around child protection in their country, and to put this information into a \"feedback\" activity. By the end of the training, they will have filled in lots of these \"feedback\" activities and by doing so, will have written most of their Child Protection Policy. Is there a way of extracting the information that they give and collating it into one document? Ideally into a pre-existing template where their responses get slotted in at the appropriate points? If not, is there a work-around which would achieve the same results? Thanks!",

You will need to develop a custom report/function to collect al the responses from the user in that course and place it in one document for you. Seeing that Moodle already has the responses and information, I cannot see why this will be too difficult to develop. The bigger issue now is that you are on Moodle Cloud and it does not allow any custom development. You will need to host the site yourself or ask a certified Moodle partner to host it and help develop this for you.

Enter your site name and your MoodleCloud password (which is the same as the admin password for your MoodleCloud site). If you are in the EU or UK, please ensure your VAT number is correct (If applicable) Click on the Upgrade button to take you to the Change plan section. Select the plan you need. Confirm your payment details to complete your purchase. Click on Pay now. As for the price, that depends on the plan you subscribe to. Please note that our plans have a set limit for users and storage and we do not have any extra addons just for users. On the other hand, you'll have the ability to suspend users to not count towards your quota. If you estimate that your site will have 125-150 users, then you might be interested in subscribing to the Mini plan which comes with 100 users and see if you are able to fit all the needed account with the ability to suspend users. If that is not enough, then you'd be able to upgrade at any point to a larger plan that could fit more students. I hope this information helps.

But I might be able to help you with providing Francis team has information to solve the issue on your behave, and with that preventing you bump in another one - because this seems to be more likely a server configuration issue then Moodle software related.. So maybe you got time to answer these questions: If you go to a different course, and try to open the Question bank, do you get the same and/or other error? if not that it is isolated to this course, which I am doubtfull on but good for them to know. Are you able to turn on Debugging > debug message: Developer: extra Moodle debug messages for developers? (You can find this setting by going to Site Administration > Development > Debugging. You can also visit this page by editing this url to your environment: https://YOUREVENIROMENT/admin/settings.php?section=debugging) If you succesfull turned debuggin on, are there any messages showing up. If so share them with Francis and her team. With debuging on, try to go the question bank again within the course where it was not working. If you see any debugging messages please share them with Francis and her team. You can turn debuggin off now, by revisiting the page and switch debug messages to: Do not show any error or warnings. Can you know visit the \"Enviroment\" page, you navigate to this in the following way: Site administration > Server > Enviroment, or edit this url to your environment: https:yoururl/admin/environment.php? if you can visit this page: is every line showing status \"OK\" , if not please share which are not ok with Francis and her team. If you are in contact with Frances and her team through different channels, I would suggest sharing the outcome of these questions directly with her and not through the forum. I hope the team will respond quickly to you to solve this issue. -Gemma",

After a \"purge all caches\", accessing the question bank for the course I see on your site seems to load the question bank correctly as far as I can tell (meaning, I see a long list of questions on \"/question/edit.php?courseid=5\"). If there are other questions that are not loading correctly, or I misunderstood the problem, please let us know. This issue is known to the developers and a fix is being tested. All the details are available on the Moodle Tracker : https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-74762 . MoodleCloud will deploy the fix once the development team has confirmed it's good to go. Unrelated to this issue, the php XML -RPC extension can be safely disabled by going to \"/admin/settings.php?section=webserviceprotocols\" on your site. When MoodleCloud upgraded to Moodle 4, we chose not to force disable this extension on all sites, since a few of them might still be using the XML -RPC protocol. We will most likely disable it over all sites in a later upgrade, once everyone has had a chance to notice the deprecation and move on. Merci pour votre patience, nous sommes désolé pour les inconvénients, Mathieu",

To get started, my understanding of css and scss is extremely limited to being able to find the element I want to change in the Inspector and muddling my way through until I get the desired result...so you know where my knowledge level is at. Scenario : I have built an e-learning site using Moodlecloud. The hardware and browser the site is going to be accessed from is a Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 running MS Edge. The User profile is locked down so I cannot use another browser, and I cannot change the hardware either. Issue : When I access the site using Edge on the Toughpad, the hamburger menu and the custom drop down menus do not work. If I tap on them a box appears around the outside of the menu item, but the side-drawer nor the drop-down menu shows. I have narrowed down the issue to the pseudo-class focus-within, which I have found here: https://mysite.com/theme/styles.php/boost/1652874062_1649605921/all (The site is hidden behind a login page so I'm not sure how useful sharing the link to the site would be?) And it looks like this: .dropdown-item:focus-within {outline:0;background-color:#EEBC1D;color:#fff}.dropdown-item:active a,.dropdown-item:hover a,.dropdown-item:focus a, .dropdown-item:focus-within a{color:#fff} I think I may have found a potential workaround here , but I have no idea how to implement this to affect the hamburger side-menu and my custom drop-down menus. This is an absolute deal-breaker, as aforementioned I cannot change the browser or the hardware. Any help would be much appreciated.",

The status page also indicated everything was up and running - which was not true. Finally - it took communications via these forums to learn it wasn't \"just us\". I am happy to hear the updates were to improve efficiency, reliability, and stability - but communications on the site or to the user base would have been helpful so that we in turn could have communicated this to our end users. This was NOT a brief interruption, Again - thank you for posting - that was very appreciated. Lisa",

How it works is that each student or user will need to create an account first. You can read more here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/PayPal_enrolment You can read more about setting up PayPal on your site here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Set_up_payment You can read more about PayPal Side setup and enabling PayPal enrolment here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/PayPal_enrolment As for your question, you are not able to have different prices for the same course. For this reason, the best solution would be what you had suggested, creating a duplicated course instance with a different enrolment price. I hope this information helps.

You can check on the task for this in Site administration > Server > Scheduled tasks, and then do a browser search of that page for \"Send new user passwords\" to find the task \\core\\task\\send_new_user_passwords_task. It should be enabled and set to run ASAP (which actually means every time cron runs.) I am not sure how Moodle Cloud works these days or whether you can see that setting.

          "Text": "Hi Maria, Just checking to ensure that you have resolved your issue with users not receiving their email. A common issue we find in MoodleCloud is that when uploading users from CSV, administrators often don't have the data in the correct format. When logged in from Site administration / Users / Upload users, an example text (.csv) file is available. It includes can be downloaded and adapted to your needs. The sample fields are: username,firstname,lastname,email Additional fields can be added as below. If you choose to enrol in course/cohort then they must already have been manually created before the CSV upload occurs: username,firstname,lastname,email,course1,group1,cohort1 I have seen it where sometimes the order of these fields are changed, or additional fields are added in the first column that stops it from working. You can read more here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Upload_users#Valid_upload_file_for_testing I hope that this helps. Warm regards, Kelly",

          "Text": "Hi Jobst. You can setup Automated Course Backup in any paid or 45 Day Free Trial MoodleCloud sites (note that Automated Backup is disabled in pre-2018 free sites). To setup Automatic Course Backups: Go to Administration > Site administration > Courses > Backups > Automated backup setup. Set backup auto_active to Enabled. Make selections (below are some you may want to consider) Select the days of the week to run the backup Set the execution time for the backup process. For most servers, early morning will be the best time. Keep in mind the time zone your server is using. Select the maximum number of backups kept (default is 1) Select if you would like the course name in the backup title (default is No) Select if you would like to Skip courses not modified since previous backup. Click Save Changes After Automated Backup has run you will need to go to  go to Site Admin - Server Files and find the automated backup file/s (MBZ) and download to your computer. TO RESTORE A COURSE Go to Site Admin / Courses/ Restore Course to upload that file and Restore a course. You can learn more about backup and restore here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Backup https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_restore and about setting up automated course backup on MoodleCloud https://docs.moodle.org/en/Automated_course_backup#Automating_course_backups You will receive a regular email to let you know the status of your backups. You don't need to worry about those that are skipped (they have likely not changed since last backup) the important thing is to go to the Site's Server Files regularly and download the Backup files to your computer. This way if you site or course is deleted then you have the Backups. When you receive an email about your automated site backup, and some backups show as ‘pending status’ this indicates exactly that, a backup is waiting to be made. There may be an existing older backup though. There should be a report here: https://XXX.moodlecloud.com/report/backups/index.php listing all the backups.‘Green’ indicates everything is OK, ‘Skipped’ happens because nothing changed in the course. You can also click the icon next to the course name, and it'll say if it's OK or not. If you would like to confirm, you can browse to: https:/XXX.moodlecloud.com/backup/restorefile.php?contextid=1 (assuming that course ID for that course is 1) and click ‘Choose a file’ under ‘Import a backup file’, then under ‘Server files’ you can expand the trees to eventually see all the backups for a course. TO BACKUP TO AN EXTERNAL SITE - SITE EXPORT You are not able to download via ssh/rsync unfortunately, instead we offer an export feature. You can find your MoodleCloud export feature in your MoodleCloud Portal. The MoodleCloud Portal is where you manage your MoodleCloud account, billing details and access statistics on the usage of your site. Login to the MoodleCloud Portal Enter your site name and your password (the same as your MoodleCloud site) Click on ‘Tools’ tab 4. Click on ‘Export this site’ 5. You will receive an email when the export is completed 6. In your MoodleCloud Portal, Click on the \"your portal\" link to download the file. Kind regards, Kelly",

In addition, during correspondence with the technical department, I asked about it (complete quiz etc.)) and received the following information: \"Hi Dominik, There's no limit as to the amount of users using the platform at the same time. ​Our tech team is still investigating the root cause for this incidence, but we can assure you that this is not related to the amount of users within your platform at the time. [...]\" I believe they didn't lie to me and I hope it gets fixed soon. 😅",

          "Text": "I assume there is a conference length limit in BBB plugin or BBB itself. Is it configurable or resetable in any way? Some of our classes are multi-part and thus long, like [2 h lesson + 30 min break + 1 h lesson]. Sometimes, not regularly, we observe a message that the conference will be ended in NN minutes, and this message looks to appear in about 3 h after the conference is started. This issue is not reproducible on demand, it might not appear for months and then start to appear again. We'd like to have an ability to control it in some way, if this is possible. Any ideas? We are on MoodleCloud so can only access those configuration options that MoodleCloud allows. A thing that might correlate: our students are kids, and some parents login to a conference in advance, like in an hour or two, and leave the browser window open so kids could just switch to it at proper time. Could that play a role, and if yes, could we implement a kind of waiting room instead of direct connection to the conference room?",

It's probably worth trying purging caches in case there's something in the cache that's out of date. If it's still not working then if you open your browser's developer tools do you see any errors in the\nconsole or any resources that do not load with status 200 OK? For example on Firefox errors might be seen in the Web Console , and resources' loading status can be seen in the Network Monitor . Which theme does the site use? If it's not Boost or Classic, try switching to Boost and see if the problem still occurs. The F0/DA squares are probably supposed to be the ▸ (fa-caret-right) icon in Font Awesome so presumably there's some problem loading the fontawesome-webfont.woff2 file for your site.",

          "Text": "Hello. We are on Moodlecloud running Moodle 3.11.1. I believe the Boost theme is active on our site. I've noticed a change in the way the navigation drawer behaves. I can't say for certain if it started with our site upgrade, but it seem likely. Before the change, the bottom links on the nav drawer would allow us to directly jump to another course on the site. The menu included the course short names for the most frequently accessed courses, enabling a quick switch with one click of the mouse. Now those links are gone, and even the \"My Courses\" menu item is no longer actually a hyperlink. It can't be clicked. It just sits there taking up space. So now to switch to another course we have to go to Dashboard and then drop into the new course instead of moving directly there. My question is:  was this an intentional change, or is something wrong with our site? Thanks in advance!",

But then after maybe 5 minutes, I get \"video source missing.\" (Note: Even if I post a link to a youtube video, it will look fine, and 5 minutes later will say \"video source missing.\" and the link I pasted in, will be gone.) At that point I can't do anything for the rest of the day, because the video I uploaded is taking up most of my free moodle disk space. The video file is still there. I see it in 'User Storage' when one clicks \"see all.\" But no way to delete it until something behind the scenes deletes it by the next day. So frustrating. And here's the other thing. That video which I can see in \"user storage\" doesn't match the size in MB of the file on my computer. The 98.4 MB file on my computer, uploaded to moodle is now 93.88 MB. Yet they should be identical. When I take that file name which I can see in 'user storage' (renamed by moodle into a series of letters and numbers) and try to paste it as a link into HP5 I get a message \"video format unsupported.\" At first I thought I was getting too close to my moodlecloud storage limit. But that's not the case because I'm monitoring that. Thanks in advance for anyone's help.",

Video is 2 minutes long. I could compress it down more, but I wonder where my threshold will be. Like will I be problem-free at 50 MB or 80 MB. Also because the hp5 module also threw out a test youtube link, maybe I've somehow corrupted the hp5 module and should start from scratch. Another thing I might explore is using JW Player on my own server storage space that comes with my email account. I tried yesterday to simply upload my video into my www space that comes with my email account, and then pasted that link into the hp5 module: but that didn't work. LOL. I realized a player is needed, not just the file. I understand it's a tall order for an LMS to also be a video hosting site. I'm going to keep trying to figure out a solution. I like the idea of large video files, because then the user could click the expand button to get full screen which for me is 1080p. But first I'll try to get something small working.",

I would recommend to use this method if your MoodleCloud site has only few courses and not too many custom settings and users. You can also Export your MoodleCloud site , which will give you a zip file, which can be used to set up a Moodle site on another server . While this method will give you everything at once (courses, files, users, settings, etc.), it will require you know how to import a (possibly large) sql file into your server and move the files to the correct dataroot folder manually.

Our local Uni Moodle uses TurnitIn, and I absolutely need a similar feature in Moodle Cloud (anything is better than nothing!). From the options you have mentioned, I know only TurnitIn. And I don't like it at all. At least the version we use - a separate activity - has no way to incorporate extensions (like user/group overrides), it does not accept Html files, there is no cutoff date, there is no marking workflow, there is no offline marking option, no marking groups, etc. A nightmare to use for larger classes. Anyway, from my perspective it would be absolutely the best to integrate plagiarism detection directly into Moodle assignment activity (and if possible into the quiz, for the essay questions). Would any of these plugins work that way? Thanks, Marcin",

In our new 'MoodleCloud plans' (these are plans purchased or upgraded after November 200 and have a xxx.moodlecloud.com URL ) you are able to suspend users so they don’t count towards your quota, but you’ll still have their data and will be able to run reports on what they’ve previously completed. The suspend user feature has always been there but it's on the new plans we have been able to change the way the user count works to not count suspended users towards the user limit. This means that suspended users will still count towards your user quota if you are on a Moodle for School plan or a lone of our older MoodleCloud Plans . If you are unsure what plan you are on, you can find out in your MoodleCloud Portal. You are welcome to upgrade to our new Plans at any time, so that you can access this feature from your Portal. We have updated the FAQ to reflect this information. If you do choose to move from a Moodle for School plan to one of our new MoodleCloud plans, please note that the following features are no longer available: School theme & school domain (sitename.moodle.school) MoodleCloud theme Group Choice Activity Level up! Quizventure However you continue to have access to xxx.moodle.school (it will just redirect to xxx.moodlecloud.com). I hope that this helps. Kelly",

Moodle stores only unique files in moodledata/filedir/. \"Files\" in different courses are just links. Yes, I know the problem. Course backups need to have the files. So if the same file was linked from two courses, their backups get a copy of that file each. Is  this the thing you want to avoid? Then the easiest solution is not to transfer course-wise, rather transfer the whole site. See https://docs.moodle.org/en/Site_backup and https://docs.moodle.org/en/Site_restore - if it is a possibility. Otherwise upload the files to an external repository and put only links in your courses. Since you mentioned remote areas, fetching these files through Internet every time is not a possibility, I believe. I would go for a File system repository https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_system_repository . But then Moodle Cloud won't allow that. Why don't you develop you courses in a R Pi itself, then duplicate the site. You can either copy the SD cards and send them to the sites, or make an ISO file, send it to the sites so that the local staff (re)write their SD cards.",

          "Text": "Thank you so much. The goal is to use the Cloud site for collaborative development of Khmer documents., which can be download in a .mbz file in a sustainable, automated process. Due to limited resources, the R Pi's are used for more than Moodle, so Internet in a Box is a better platform, ex to allow use of the GPIO pins. Option 1) \"Course backups need to have the files. So if the same file was linked from two courses, their backups get a copy of that file each\" Given that teachers in different courses in the same subject, ex Physics, are uploading files, where should the shared Physics repository be? Where should the Repository be for a Moodle system-wide respiratory that provides the files to all courses? In these cases all teacher-limiited file access permissions would be disabled. Option 2) \"Otherwise upload the files to an external repository and put only links in your courses. Since you mentioned remote areas, fetching these files through Internet every time is not a possibility, I believe.\" I want to meet the needs of rural schools where wifi is not available. If wifi is available, teachers and students can use the Moodle app and the Moodle Cloud version. I want a design that accommodates both user groups, and where remote locations will not need to download files. I believe the Pi issue is designating in Moodle the file path for external file access. The Moodle Cloud archived .mbz has a repository file path,. The Rapsberry Pi Moodle config files for all courses would need a local path. As much as possible, I want an automated process. Is a single large repository for grades K-12 Khmer files the best solution? If so I could download all the Cloud repository files to the Pi Moodle's default system-wide respository, prior to delivering the SD cards to rural schools. In the \"Internet in a Box' world, teachers then use the USB stick to add local files. ** The disadvantage is every school gets a 128 GB SD card, which is expensive. Option 3) \"Why don't you develop you courses in a R Pi itself, then duplicate the site. You can either copy the SD cards and send them to the sites, or make an ISO file, send it to the sites so that the local staff (re)write their SD cards.\" I have done this, but to make this sustainable, I want teachers to collaborate, share content, and get training in Moodle Cloud.  Therefore the file repository issue remains. I need to either use the Moodle Cloud version as the primary version, or merge, on the development Pi box, the Moodle Cloud updated .mbz and external or internal repository files. Is the most automatible process, which allows teachers some autonomy, the Moodle Cloud as the primary source? Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this issue. I have now purchased and am building a version of Moodle on Bluehost, so that I can now install any plugin, and have complete control of the filesystem. Your response could also move to this platform, if Moodle Cloud is too restrictive.",

          "Text": "You're welcome! After your explanations the case is clearer to me: Presently you have a Moodle instance on the Internet where the teachers develop courses. You pull those courses as course backups and push them through course restore in to Moodle instances which are not connected to the Internet. You are happy with the process except for one thing: Shared files in the original site appear in multiple course backups, bloating the volume of data to transfer. Correct? Then, that is the price you pay for the convenience. If you want to transfer each file only once, you have to do the transfer site-wise - through site backup and site restore . You need to study the process first. Generally speaking, there is no mechanism to \"sync\" Moodle instances in the sense that you merge (only) the changes in one site in to the other. The site backup and restore process mentioned above overwrites the target site! This is not what most people want, but in your case it might be OK - you are doing exactly that course-wise, I understand. If so, the solution (site backup > site restore) is simple. If you want something sophisticated, the places to look are: a) Moodle partners, who are also the main Moodle developers. You meet them in the General developer forum b) Freelancers, in the General help forum , for example. Both parties give free advice in various forums on moodle.org. If you are looking for a paid consultant, either contact a Moodle Partner directly or make an announcement on Moodle jobs pin board.",

          "Text": "Hi All, Thanks to everyone who participated in the MoodleCloud Users Survey in September this year. You were all very clear about what you wanted, so now your wishes are coming true! We are excited to let you know that we have just launched new MoodleCloud Plans, and they’re pack full of what you were asking for! New Large plan By far the most requested improvement was larger plans, and today we can announce the MoodleCloud Large Plan, with 1000 users and 5GB storage. New User Count that excludes Suspended users on all new plans For new plans, we’ve changed the way we count Users to something that is better value for you. For all MoodleCloud customers on one of the new plans launched this week, suspended users will no longer be counted in your user quota. This works much better than deleting users, as you will still have their data and will be able to run reports on what they’ve previously completed. Storage increases on all new plans We’ve increased the storage on all new plans, and more than doubled it on others! Starter: Was 200MB, now 250MB Mini: Was 200MB, now 500MB Small: Was 400MB, now 1,000MB Medium: Was 1,000MB, now 2,500MB Large: 5,000MB New Free Trials Everyone not yet using MoodleCloud will be able to start a 45 Day Free Trial that includes all features from all plans. We thought it seemed fair that you should be able to try it before you buy it! Ready to upgrade? You can upgrade your plan from any existing Starter and School plans to the new plans at any time (the system will automatically give you a pro-rata refund on any unused time in your old plan too)! If you do choose to move from a Moodle for School plan to one of our new MoodleCloud plans, please note that the following features are no longer available: School theme & school domain (sitename.moodle.school) MoodleCloud theme Group Choice Activity Level up! Quizventure We have more information on important changes to read before upgrading from Moodle School to the new Moodle LMS plans . Moodle School plans no longer available for purchase They were with us for five years, but we’ve finally decided to retire the old Moodle for School plans, and they are no longer available for purchase. You can retain your existing Moodle for School plan if you are already on it (we’re not requiring you upgrade at this time, although we’ll highly likely end these plans entirely when Moodle v4 comes out in early 2022). Thanks, and happy Moodling! Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

From the video on student activity completion in moodle 3 11 ( ) it appears that it is now compulsory that it is there for the activity - if there is completion tracking. We have lesson activities that require students to watch videos and answer questions correctly to receive a certificate at the end of the lesson. An example of the 'To do' that is showing for one of these is: To do: Spend at least 55 mins on this activity To do: Receive a grade As you can imagine this is pretty pointless for our students and it also encourages them to just 'spend time' in the activity as opposed to watching all the videos and answering all the questions correctly. These requirements are made clear on the first screen of the lesson. As far as I am aware (and I do bumble along a bit), there is no way to force students to watch a video - other than setting a time limit for the activity. I'm really hoping that we are not forced to have the 'To do:' showing for every activity. Looking forward to a solution for this.",

We have students in cohorts that are already working in these courses - to change content is not possible. For students to receive a certificate of completion they have to have 100% for the questions and they have to have spent the required amount of time in the activity. If I do not indicate activity completion then I can no longer have these restrictions for the issue of certificates. As mentioned previously - the time indicator is behind the scenes - they are told they have to watch all videos. We don't want them to focus on time in the lesson but on tasks. Is it really that the 'To do:...' is compulsory if you have any Activity Completion requirements set? I'm surprised that it seems to be all or nothing. Is there no way around this? Regards Michelle",

          "Text": "Hi Mary, It is not an option to remove the required time completion. We put the time restriction on because people were skipping the video and completing the lesson in 5 minutes by jumping to the question pages of the lesson. As far as I'm aware I can't put a time restriction on a content page in a lesson to prevent them moving on to the questions. I know I could use H5P to control the watching of the video but the content has already been created and the students are already working on the lessons. To further add to this issue - it's not just the time being mentioned that's the issue. The option in the lesson is to say that a grade is required and I can also set the pass grade and then in the certificate activity I get to set the requirement that it be a pass grade. To display the 'to do' as a grade being required is misleading. I have already had students calling about it. Yours and Kelly's answers and your video about this new feature, all indicate that it is now an all or nothing situation. Can you please confirm that the this new feature cannot be hidden from the activity if there are completion requirements set? Can you also confirm that the wording of these 'to do' statements cannot be adjusted (e.g. the 'receive a grade'). If my understanding is correct and I now have no choice but to display the preset 'to do' if I have completion requirements on activities, then is there any way that moodle users could be surveyed so that if others would like this to be an optional feature it could be adjusted in the 4.0 release? Alternatively, if the issue with it being compulsory is because we are a hosted MoodleCloud user and if I moved to a private host it could be turned off, please let me know. Kind regards Michelle",

Here are a few pointers: It's not possible with the new 3.11 activity completion to hide it completely but still have it activated - it will always show within the activity even if it doesn't show on the course page. There is a long discussion on this subject in another forum here, which might interest you: How to use checkbox as student activity completion? (However, some of the suggestions won't work on a MoodleCloud site, for example using different plugins. Equally the wording of the 'to do' statements can be changed on non-MoodleCloud sites via Site administration >Language customisation) I very much recommend staying with MoodleCloud because of the reliablity of the service, but making your voice heard/opinion felt by, for example, voting in favour of supporting the pre-3.11 activity completion method in this tracker ticket : MDL-71856 and also joining the discussions on Moodle 4.0 features (where I believe improvement to activity completion will be made) in the User experience community .",

If it is assignment files you are trying to delete, unfortunately you cannot leave an assignment submission with no file after one has been submitted. This is a known problem in Moodle with a very long history in our issue tracker. There are a few ways you can work around this: Wait until your course has finished, export the grades if you need to save them and then reset the course - this removes all data that was in the course (including files). OR In the file picker, remove the PDF and upload a small dummy file (empty text file will do) and then save that as the students submission. An empty text file should only be a few bytes in size compared to the several megabyte PDF. I know this isn't ideal, but this assignment submission file handling comes from Moodle itself and is not specific to the MoodleCloud environment. Please note that, the cron clear up runs daily so these deleted documents may appear to be still there but if you leave it and don't check on it for a day or so, they will be deleted. If you continue to check on the files, it creates drafts and prolongs the deletion of the files. I hope that this helps. Warm regards, Kelly",

Event Monitoring If you are trying to send notifications on enrolment, please note that you are only able to do this on self enrolment method and you are unable to edit this email. You can however step up notifications of enrolment expirations. Please note that notifications do not go out for at least 30 minutes in Moodle, but even after that, it does depend on when your cron runs for your site. You can view the setting here: Site administration > Security > Site security settings > Maximum time to edit posts. Which reduces that 30 minute wait time, but ultimately it still depends on when cron runs for your site and if you have a MoodleCloud site, this is run by us here at Moodle HQ.

Eg I want to turn the top banner which is black to a new colour. Is there an optimal size for the logo upload? While I am here, with Moodle Cloud I am trying to set up so my users are automatically enrolled in my courses when they log into my moodle site. I have added self enrolment but when they get onto my front page with course outlines there is a notification saying they cannot self enrol into my course.

It is self paced and you can start it and work on bits of it at any time, so for example you could look at the section Add users right now. Your users can change their language from the language dropdown but that won't change the content you provide (unless you add the translated content yourself and use a special filter)",

If this is not enough, the custom SCSS fields will allow you to use CSS and SCSS to change the colour of anything on the site. They can be found by navigating to \"Site administration\" > \"Appearance\" > \"Themes\" > \"Boost\", under the advanced tab. Please be aware that it's possible to render the site unusable by putting malformed SCSS/CSS in these fields. If you're not confident about it I would recommend doing some research, or looking for a freelancer to help you with the customisations. Your logo is way too big, There's no \"ideal\" size, but it should be something like 100x75 pixels. Please refer to the documentation on email based self registration - if you're still having trouble then please lodge a support request through your portal, including as much detail us possible for us to reproduce the issue. Regarding translations, do you want translations for content you have written yourself? There is no automated way to do that, however Moodle has the multilang filter which allows you to provide translations for your content. Hope this helps. Cheers, Cam",

Under our free site retention policy, if your Moodle for Free site has been inactive for more than 14 days, it is removed in order to maintain a vibrant and active system for all users. We do send a reminder email message before the site is removed. To get the site back online, we are able to restore your site data but as this is performed by our technical team there is a fee of $100.00 AUD. Also, please note that to comply with our GDPR policies, as you are no longer as a customer, you will need to reply to this email for us to go ahead with the site restore within 14 days of the site deletion date or your site will be deleted from our systems. Your other option is to recreate your site. You can do this in the MoodleCloud Portal or by completing the signup. Unfortunately, the content of the site has been deleted. To ensure it does not get removed in the future you need to make sure it is accessed regularly or you can choose to upgrade your site to a Starter or Moodle for School plan where the inactive policy does not apply. I shall send you a PayPal invoice to the registered address and if you do decide to go ahead with the site restore then we will action this restore for you. If you have any further questions, please let me know or visit our FAQ page. Also, it's worth a gentle reminder that in order to retain your restored site you will need to login every 14 days. With that in mind, we recommend that you upgrade to a Paid Subscription (starting from $80 depending on which Plan you select). With a Paid Subscription there is no regular requirement to log in every 14 days.",

I try to upload them through google drive ( I put the sharing link in the audio source) but the audio won't work. I tried going through the google repositories process, I do have the google option now but if I try to login it says: Error 403: access_denied The developer hasn’t given you access to this app. It’s currently being tested and it hasn’t been verified by Google. If you think you should have access, contact the developer I tried authorising the app but I don't think it's doable in moodle cloud (I would need to upload an html, which I can't do I guess) What do you suggest?? thanks!",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, So I've encountered a bit of an issue while using some of the additional security features on Vimeo and the HTML5 embedding feature on a \"Page\" source. I'm wondering if anyone here can help with info on the matter. On Vimeo I have my videos uploaded as a \"Hidden from Vimeo\" video and the privacy setting to only allow for the videos to be embedded on approved domains. The only approved domain I have listed are my moodle pages \"_____. MoodleCloud .com\". After copying and pasting the embed code from the Vimeo video into the Moodle \"Page\" source under HTML5 I get a notification from the Vimeo player \"Sorry Because of its privacy settings, this video cannot be played here.\" I checked Vimeos information boards and found this: \"If you’re seeing this error in the player, the video you are watching has domain -level privacy enabled. The video’s owner can adjust the domains where a video can appear within “Where can this video be embedded?” section of the embed settings page. If the domain is listed in your video settings page, but the error is still appearing, the domain specified in your address bar may be different from the domain sent to the Vimeo player. In these cases, the privacy error may appear. Contact a web developer to confirm if there is anything in your site's HTML code that could be blocking the referrer from reaching our player iframe.\" Is the HTML player reporting a different domain back to Vimeo? I am using a trial version of moodle to evaluate Moodles efficacy for the task. Will this issue persist after I move from the trial version to the paid version of Moodle? Is there a way to have my site report the proper URL back to Vimeo to reach the player iframe? Thanks in advance for any insight, Josh P.S. I'm new to the forum so if I posted in the wrong thread let me know and I will remediate the issue.",

          "Text": "Hello! I was a Moodle Admin for over 10 years at a previous university and am now trying to use MoodleCloud at my new university. I just need it for a couple of chemistry classes (for the quiz engine), and I plan to publish the Moodle chem quizzes as LTI for use in Canvas. I can configure the system, train, document, create classes, etc, as I have in the past. I am just looking for a PaaS model. THE PROBLEM I can't get answers to a few Terms of Service questions that are not addressed in the MoodleCloud ToS doc. When our security team poses Terms of Service questions to Moodle support, they get the stock, \"You need a Moodle Partner\" answer. Why do I need a Moodle partner when I just need Terms of Service answers? Our UWM security team simply needs a few questions answered and our tool interoperability agreement signed before we can sign up and pay for MoodleCloud. The university won't move forward with the purchase without the Terms of Service answers. Is there really *nobody* at MoodleCloud who can answer us? Any advice?",

However as it is done manually by our Technical Team, you would need to submit a support ticket (as there is currently no way to move it yourself other than backing up and restoring every course one by one from one site to the next). Let me know if you need anything further. Thanks, Kelly",

I've looked at other Moodle community threads saying that this could be a Moodle problem, and people have offered solutions like customising the CSS under Site Admin settings. But I can't seem to find this option in MoodleCloud. It doesn't list CustomCSS in the dropdown. Any ideas on how to get rid of this extra scroll bar? Is it possible in MoodleCloud? Thanks.",

Moodle can cache themes, language strings, filters and other bits of information that have been calculated and stored by the web browser. This link forces all user web browsers to refresh their screens of any information that Moodle has cached. Several modules that use cache have settings which will turn off caching for that module. Eliminating or purging caches slows performance. For more information, check out Purge all caches: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Developer_tools#Purge_all_caches You might also want to double check that all the fields in the CSV are valid.

If you have access to the Course that the Backup was created from you can go into the course, remove any large items (videos, pictures) and then recreate the Backup File and do a Course Restore again. You will then be able to upload them to the newly created Course. You visit each individual course and click on Settings, then Backup to create the Backup. You will need to go to  go to \"Site Admin/Server Files\" and find the automated backup there and download it to your computer. You then go to Site Admin / Courses / Restore Course to upload that file and Restore. You can learn more about backup and restore here: ​​​​​​​ https://docs.moodle.org/en/Backup https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_restore I hope that this helps. Warm regards,",

As a pronunciation teacher I need a tool where my student can record themselves and the tool will automatically check for their pronunciation mistakes. SpeechAce does this quite well, however it is a plugin which cannot be installed on MoodleCloud. I wonder if there are any alternative ways I can do to achieve the same outcome (Let my students speak + Check their pronunciation) on MoodleCloud. If not, how can I install an external plugin on my site? (Even with extra cost) Thank you.",

To keep the platform simple and stable for all users we do not allow you to install your own plugins at this time. You might want to consider if H5P will do this for you. H5P is a plugin that is included for free in all our MoodleCloud sites. There is a list of all available content types here: https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications I wonder if this particular one might do what you require: https://h5p.org/speak-the-words-set The plugin list will grow and continue to be updated. So if MoodleCloud currently does not support the particular plugin you are after, we will record your plugin request and other feedback to inform future work and additions to the system. If however, you require this plugin to be installed immediately for your MoodleCloud site, I can pass you onto your Moodle Partners to discuss your custom needs. Please note that if you want to have plugins added to your site, you will need to move to a Moodle site hosted by our Moodle Partners or a self-hosted site.",

A little background; we are a digital curriculum company for CTE related courses. We would like to share our curriculum with our Moodle customers. We would be importing our Thin Common Cartridge (Thin CC) files and hopefully sharing our courses so that our customers can copy them. Would this be the best method?

Unfortunately, I forgot to cancel the service so that It did not enter a new payment, and the reality is that if I had had some kind of notice, I would have done so. I ask that you please tell me how I can do to cancel the server and recover the payment, or most of it.

          "Text": "Hi all, We are committed to providing open source, free e-learning tools for educators. That’s why all our software is free and open source, and this will never change. Hundreds of thousands of institutions have downloaded and are using Moodle on their own servers worldwide. MoodleCloud is one of our official hosting services that makes it simple for anyone to get a Moodle site without needing to install it on a local server .  Since 2015, MoodleCloud has provided a number of simple packages for smaller users, including a 50-user Free plan with 200Mb. Announcement 1: New free trial with larger quotas We are happy to announce the launch of a new MoodleCloud Free Trial with four times more users (200) and double the storage (400 MB). Everyone will be able to use their MoodleCloud Free Trial for 45 days before deciding to move to one of our inexpensive paid plans. Announcement 2: NGO and nonprofits program As part of our mission we are now offering our larger MoodleCloud plans completely free to registered NFPs and NGOs. All you need to do is apply here , and if accepted, we will give you a full-size MoodleCloud plan for no cost. Costs are subsidised by donations we've received. Does this replace the existing free plan? Yes! This new Free Trial upgrades and replaces our old Free plan (that expires if unused for 14 days). Will people keep their existing MoodleCloud free sites? Yes! Sites currently on the old Free plan will remain unchanged (so long as you use them at least once every 14 days!). Your support is welcome If you, or someone you know, would like to make a donation towards paying for deserving institutions to have free MoodleCloud sites, please visit moodle.com/donations .

Be mindful that you have to select whether to include student data etc when you create the backup. If you don't select it then it won't be in the Backup. You visit each individual course and click on Settings, then Backup to create the Backup. You will need to go to  go to \"Site Admin/Server Files\" and find the automated backup there and download it to your computer. Once you have signed up for a MoodleCloud site then go to Site Admin / Courses/ Restore Course to upload that file and Restore.

Otherwise.... I recently created a MoodleCloud site for the online school I'm building for use in the Dominican Republic. I have previous experience with Moodle however, have been away from the platform since 2012 and there have been a lot of changes. Now that I am back, I am finding the documentation to be as convoluted as before, if not more so. While I have found some information on making changes to the boost and classic themes by adding code to the raw scss, I have been unable to adequately identify which sections of the front page to adjust to bring my width in from full screen to only a percentage of the full screen. By that, I mean I want the background image to be full screen but the text boxes (card boxes?) to be a smaller width - similar to the login box on the login screen. I've been trying to identify which sections to adjust using the developer tools available with the Brave browser and have had some success changing the color for the free trial message that appears once you've logged in, but I haven't identified which css code to override on the front page when not logged in. I would also like to override the logo sizes. The default sizes are way too small. Any assistance you can provide is appreciated. Thank you, Mike",

I had this same question and began playing around with the raw scss for the boost theme. If you're familiar with using the firefox or chrome developer tools, you can identify the code to change using those tools. You simply override the code by inserting new code into the raw scss area for the boost (or classic) theme. I hope this helps, Mike",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm using Moodlecloud, based on Moodle 3.8.1 (Build: 20200113). if I go into Site administration - Server - Files , I see many files that I thought shouldn't have been there. Specifically: 1) Files delivered by my students years ago, answering Assignments I asked them. The Assignments are still online, among the courses activities , but I deleted those student accounts years ago, so I thought that the files sent by those students were also automatically erased. Since it isn't so, I'm doing in this way: I duplicate each of those Assignment resources (Duplicate tool); and then I delete the original resource. In this way, those orphaned files disappear from the list and I can keep an empty copy of the original Assignments, if I want to use them in the future. However I think that this workaround is a little intricate, so I would ask you if there is a better one. 2) I found two copies of the same resource: Filename Size Type User Component Filearea Action TCP.pkt 1.58 MB application/octet-stream Luigi mod_resource content View in context TCP.pkt 83.58 KB application/octet-stream Luigi mod_resource content View in context If I click the View in context button I land in the same course. Well, the right file is the second one: I first uploaded in the course the 1.58 MB version of the file, then I replaced the file with the 83.58 KB version. Indeed, if I check all the course resources, I find only one occurrence of the TCP.pkt file, and this is the one whose size is 83.58 KB. So the larger version of the file (1.58 MB) shouldn't be in the list. What  can I do to delete it? Thanks so much for reading and for your reply, Luigi",

          "Text": "Using MoodleCloud to host our online school's moodle site. This morning we upgraded from the Moodle for School 'Mini' package to the 'Small' package. Since doing so we began experiencing several bugs and errors. I'll attach the different error messages we've received so far, but essentially it's preventing our students and teachers from accessing their course pages, often when clicking a link it'll just return them to the homepage and show one of the errors I attached below. The only other change made to moodle this morning other than upgrading was changing the wording of a question in a moodle quiz and reducing the number of lines in the answer box. I doubt this caused the issue and I have deleted the quiz just in case, but this hasn't fixed the issue. E2 (Cannot create property 'stack' on string) is repeated 3 or 4 times, I have to close the error popup that many times for it to go away. Would really appreciate some help! Many thanks, Sam",

I've done the initial registration, chosen a site name, and entered my mobile phone number, but when I get to the page that reads: \" Verify your identity We have sent a temporary verification code to +my.mobile-number. Enter your verification code below.\" I never received a verification code. I also tried this 3 days ago with the same result. I've searched the web for this problem and found the possible explanations that maybe my phone blocked it or I entered the wrong phone number. Nope. I entered the correct phone number, the SMS didn't arrive and immediately get filtered out as spam. What do I do now? I tried clicking the \"resend sms\" button, but 3 days ago I found out that I'm allowed to do that no more than 3 times before the opportunities for doing it again cease for the subsequent 24 hours. Is there someone I can send an email message to for help with getting past this? I did fill out a web form moments ago, but perhaps someone in the community has some other ideas?",

They (Google Fi) helped me successfully switch MCC/MNC numbers on my mobile phone in case that could have been associated with my non-receipt of SMS messages from MoodleCloud. After switching, I tried again to set up a 45-day free Moodle server using MoodleCloud.com, and again I received no SMS. I imagine that your logs will show this attempt about 2 hours ago, but all records accessible to me and Google Fi indicate that my mobile number received no SMS messages during our troubleshooting session. So Google Fi tech support feels confident that the problem is not with my setup, but instead with your setup, but I imagine you've done testing with your setup which has probably led you to the conclusion that it is operating perfectly. Also, I've had no problem receiving other automated SMS verification messages from other services like banks and others that try to do a form of 2FA using SMS. This also tends to support the assertion that the root problem is with MoodleCloud, not with my service, but I'm sure there are many uncertainties that I'm not aware of too. However, I'm unclear on one particular issue. Although I'm no expert on the SMS Protocol, for many years I have had the impression that, like the User Datagram Protocol, the Simple Message Service Protocol provides no \"message accepted by phone\" feature. Your log entry gives me the opposite impression, but I don't understand Amazon SNS messages, so maybe the SNS Protocol expands upon the SMS Protocol? Can you elaborate on this?",

This course will give at the end, after a final examination, the possibility to get a certificate issued by the local authority (Ministry) to start your own activity in Slovakia. The classroom has usually between 7 and 15 students. We have just 1 teacher so we run just a training session at one time. The course has a theoretical and a practical part so i can imagine a wide use of camera during the practical part. We have been investigating Moodle and i would like to ask you about your opinion; do you think it could fit to our needs ? We would like to move to a cloud based solution; we understood Moodlecloud has almost the same features of the on-premise installation (and less installation and technical stuff to setup, it seems to us much easier to get-it-ready). Is there something we should consider before making our decision on a moodlecloud solution ? Thanks in advance for your kind support Regards, Massimo",

This change is performed by our technical team and there is a fee of $50 AUD to go ahead with the site name change. You are only allowed to modify the first part of the URL - ncat.moodlecloud.com -- the domain must stay the same (moodle.school or moodlecloud). It may require some downtime (up to 30 minutes) of the site and needs to be scheduled. Please provide the details of the sitenames and a preferred workday you would like the change to occur and we can schedule it in. If you do decide to go ahead with the name change then we will produce an invoice and send it through to you for payment with all the confirmed details. And here is a list of resources you can use for help on any other Moodle topic:",

We've been running upgrades on and off for the past few days to deploy some additional server capacity and this will certainly be the cause of these delays. We should be finished with these upgrades before end of day today and all outbound emails will catch up. Sorry for the impact here (we do try to minimise these events as much as possible), but I think this draws attention to how we could better communicate when there are known delays to outbound emails (such as getting this information up on status.moodlecloud.com). I'll pick this up with the team. Thanks! Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

While I use limits of my paid Moodlecloud account for my regular courses, I also want to deliver some free webinars. For that, I created single-activity/BigBlueButton course and a kind of 'guest' account that only has an access to this course. As I have limit of 50 users in BigBlueButton session, I expect that up to 49 visitors (plus me as a 'teacher') could login with this account simultaneously and participate in BBB session. I tested this locally, joining BBB session from four devices under this 'guest' login. Sometimes this works. Sometimes however I can't login and receive a message that this account is logged in already and should logout first. This message seems to happen randomly. Is there a better way to provide guest access to BBB session?",

I can delete them off the course page, but I want to make sure they aren't stored on my server and end up taking up data space. I am in the Admin block, and i found the Files area, but I don't see the option to delete the files. What am I doing wrong? I'm sure it's a simple fix--I'm just pretty inexperienced and don't want to end up deleting more than I intended! Thanks, Sarah",

You can optionally configure a time limit by setting a parameter on the create call. Note that this applies to the open-source BigBlueButton only. Companies\nthat host BigBlueButton for you may set limits - you'll have to ask\nthem about that. ===== How could this be solved? There are no such parameters in course or activity settings.",

          "Text": "Hi Moodlers, First things first, thank you for this opportunity to become part of the community, I am new here. A bit of background, we are a Spanish online school, on the early stages yet, targeting Chinese users in Mainland China (other geographies will come later, hopefully). We had an LMS with an integrated virtual classroom until very recently, which worked fine mostly, but at times, users in China had problems logging in, loading documents, etc. The company that provided this \"white-label-solution\", based in India, had the servers in the US, and used AWS to deliver content globally, the closest to China being Hong Kong. After reading a lot online, we came to realize that the best solution for us would probably be to host our e-learning platform (LMS+ web conferencing tool) inside of China, to avoid being blocked or slowed down by the firewall. This is where MOODLE comes into play. A few days ago I discovered MoodleCloud, which with the paid option for schools would be quite interesting for us (easy set up, no technical requirements and affordable). We are a small team, with a limited budget and no IT department, so we need a ready-to-go solution, which MoodleCloud seems to offer perfectly (with its limits of course). PROBLEM? MoodleCloud can be hosted only in Australia, US and Ireland (we chose Ireland for our free account, just to play around and become familiar with the system). Not having our own domain is not a huge deal, since the Moodle LMS could be accessed from our own WordPress, so students would not need to type \"example.moodle.school\" to access the system. We have already contacted the only Moodle Partner in China, to consider what the options from their side are, but haven't got much info yet. We have our website hosted with \"Mochahost\" in the US, and they use CloudFlare (linked to our website) to reach 150+ data centers worldwide, including a few inside of China. The question is, considering all these things: our limited budget, technical ability, time, and users location (China mainly and other countries too) would it be possible to host MoodleCloud inside of China or host it with our WP site and use cloudflare to try and deliver content to mainland China? We also need it to be integrated with BigBlueButton to have the actual live classes, and recordings as well (does BBB need to be hosted separately to have disk space for recordings or is it hosted together with MC?). I know this is a tricky situation, so any help we could receive from the community would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance, Alex",

However, the GFW works by preventing users within the mainland from connecting to IP addresses and if a closely related IP address has content judged to be unsuitable, a whole range of sites can be blocked. You would be the innocent bystander. In addition there are times when there is an internet  crackdown - usually a party conference  or times when the Party feels vulnerable to criticism. If the unrest in Hong Kong leads to action against the protests, a lot more sites may get blocked. It is a real risk. All you can do is change IP addresses if you are blocked.  If you are the target, your new site will be blocked as  well. Otherwise your site will be able to be accessed from inside China. Getting a .com.cn  address would probably help but Moodlecloud does not have that option. My sites have usually been in the US or Singapore and I have had to switch IP address a couple of times. Check with your provider how easy it is to do this. The US West Coast is a good option. with lower costs and fat cables across the Pacific. What do the engineers say? Cheap, reliable, requires little technical knowledge. You get 2 out of 3 with Moodle.",

There is a limitation to the file storage (400MB) in my current MoodleCloud Plan. Given that there is a limit imposed, it is necessary and critical to give customers the option and ability to housekeep and delete the uploaded files so that we can stay within the limits. Imposing a file storage limit, and not giving customers the ability to delete files is illogical and a major inconvenience. I hope there is a plan in place to allow customers the ability to delete the files manually, is this in the roadmap for implementation in the near term (within the next 3 months)? Thanks, David",

Subsequently, a vendor I am working with (not Proctorio) was able to integrate their tool with MoodleCloud via LTI integration. As your reply suggests, it seems there's a lot of fuzziness in this area---it may/may not work, but in either case Moodle can't help. I also haven't found any Moodle partners that offer support just for MoodleCloud, you have allow them to build your Moodle site and/or host with them. I hope there's a more robust support option from Moodle at least for MoodleCloud in the future. Thanks, A",

          "Text": "Hi Margherita, Based on other replies, I believe there's some confusion here. The file upload limit, in Moodle, is set to 1 MB per default. This can be increased by editing your course settings (look for \"Maximum upload size\"). You can also update the default in the admin section of your site (search for \"maxbytes\" or go to https://YOURSITE.moodlecloud.com/admin/settings.php?section=coursesettings ) Please note that some modules, like Assignement, have their own \"maximum submission size\". This one can be changes, system-wide, on https://YOURSITE.moodlecloud.com/admin/settings.php?section=assignsubmission_file The 1 GB limit for file storage has nothing to do with the database . It only applies to files \"on disk\". As suggested by William in this thread, you can use Youtube and embed the videos. If using a public system like youtube is not acceptable, I would suggest setting up Google Drive as repository (involves more work, but the files are private and do not count in your quota).

But no, if it is me, the admin, to upload a video, I can upload whatever I want, if it is the students, it is always 1 MB.... so what can I do?

My students are left without a course and we have several submission deadlines coming up. I have a back-up of my course, except for all the forum discussions going on in the class. I have read in previous discussions that there could be a way to retrieve my content and put it back up on my cloud (which I have re-created through a subscription).

I was hoping that  I would be able to use the File Picker without having to upload a file into the site (and also being able to expand the window so I can get the \"lay of the land\" in terms of my files).

We were at the time evaluating moodlecloud as an option for hosting our site training for employees. We moved and spent a month+ creating content and designing. At which point, operations came to a pause and no one came into the office. Upon returning, it appears our site has been deleted because it was a free account and inactive. I understand this is a part of the terms, but I really hope we didnt just lose ALL that work we put into it because we were inactive for 21 days? Is there anyway to save it? To get it back? At least maybe export the data and have a copy of it to upload into a new or paid account?",

Also, please note that to comply with our GDPR policies, as you are no longer as a customer, you will need to reply to this message for us to go ahead with the site restore within 14 days of the site deletion date or your site will be deleted from our systems. Your other option is to recreate your site. You can do this in the MoodleCloud Portal or by completing the signup. Unfortunately, the content of the site has been deleted. To ensure it does not get removed in the future you need to make sure it is accessed regularly or you can choose to upgrade your site to a Starter or Moodle for School plan where the inactive policy does not apply.

This has resulted in performance degradation for all sites in this region between 00:00 and 08:00 (GMT+0) on Tuesday, Wednesday and today. New capacity was succesfully provisioned on 2020-06-04 03:00 GMT+0, and services are in the process of returning to normal performance now.  The ETA for completion is 2020-06-04 07:00 GMT+0. This is the second time in 3 months we've had customer-impacting performance issues within specific regions of MoodleCloud, and I again want to acknowledge that we're not meeting our expectations or yours. We're nearing completion on architectural changes that will allow us to be a lot more responsive to performance/capacity issues in our ecosystem, and when these are in place in early July, we will be able to respond to events like this in minutes (rather than days). I want to thank you for your patience, and to let you know that every month we're working on both short-term and long-term changes to get closer to the kind of offering we and you expect from us. As always, you can get the latest information on active incidents over at status.moodlecloud.com . Cheers Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

In terms of support or raising tickets for issues, is there an official channel where we can raise and track support tickets? 2. Is there an established SLA for turnaround time for resolving these tickets? Understand and appreciate MoodleCloud's teams' effort on supporting this, but as this is a paid package, certain expectations are put on us from Management to ensure that systems are up and running for students. It is also quite frustrating as we aren't sure whether the issues are being worked on or not, as the dashboard usually shows green and we aren't sure where to report these issues. Can we improve on this?",

We purchased the Moodle cloud subscription thining that it was a plug and play package. Initally all went well with our anility to build our courses and use the other tools. The textbook manufacturer assured us that their test bank was compatible with Moodle and that Respondus 4.0 would allow for us to upload their test bank without issue. Moodle is included in their Profiler and as such, we assumed it too would be fairly easy when the time came for its usage. We are now at that time but the usage does not appear to be readily aavaiable. We have over the last month moved the installation to another PC thinking it might be a configuration compatibility issue but achieved the same results. We are considering upgrading to the Moodle cloud for school edition but fear that we will encounter the same issue (if all packages contain the same plugins across the platform). Our question i thought was simple, does Moodle Cloud support Respondus 4.0 and if so, under which pricing plan? Or, has anyone in the Moodle Cloud Forum experienced the same problem and if so, how did they resolve it?",

Also \"mouse-over\" the question mark there. But there is no reason for panic. Taking a Moodle site from one server to another is quick (for the routined). It is called https://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_migration . If you upgrade you Moodle to a Moodle Partner they will handle that for you. They are the same company. It is worth clarifying with your content providers whether the Respondus component is a must. Moodle has a complete work-flow in itself for on-line exams, from the very simple ones to higher education. No programming is necessary. Neither does the Open Source component Safe Exam Browser I mentioned. It is a stripped-down browser and a kiosk system for the students computers to restrict many ways of cheating.",

I have contacted Moodle several times over the past month and haven't received a response. I did see the post about the nonprofits plan, which is fantastic! So I submitted an application. But if for some reason our application is denied, my team needs to know how much it would cost to host a site for 500-800 users. I am guessing the Moodle team has been swamped with requests lately, but it's still surprising that I haven't received a response. Is there a Sales email address separate from the Support email?",

It confuses many first time users, particularly if they are not particularly computer literate.  I think it is overly intimidating without the ability to at least presenting a screen that explains what they will see next and what they need to do. Alternatively, it would be nice to, like many software providers, have a less intrusive way for users to accept the EULAs without having to physically scroll down each and click accept. So my question is if there is currently a way for organizations that use Moodle as a platform for delivering content to allow for adjustments to the default way new users see the Moodle EULAs, and if so, where can I find documentation on that?

You can avoid the issue entirely by using the atto editor.

As the subject says, my Moodlecloud website was deleted due to inactivity because I had to stop teaching the children I homeschool since I had a research project that had to be finished (University Student here btw ). By the time I was done with my research, physical distancing and stay-at-home orders were enforced because of Covid-19. I then received instructions I need to compile the children's outputs and grades (conveniently stored in Moodle) Two weeks ago I tried to access my website, it prompted that my site no longer exists! I immediately posted to support.moodle.com asking if it was possible to recover my website since I also had instructions to prepare to teach the children online, and until now, no reply from Moodle Support. Yes, I acknowledge that Moodle does send emails reminding me that I should frequently log in to my website, and I did receive those emails it didn't prompt since I sort them using the tabs in Gmail (crazy and lazy, I know). Any help from anyone is appreciated. Thanks! Alfonso",

As you have found - if your \"free\" site isn't used it will be deleted - and unfortunately there isn't a process that allows you to recover this. The cost of maintaining backups for all the free sites and a process to restore them is just too high considering the massive number of free sites the moodlecloud system hosts. The best way to prevent this from happening in future would be for you to upgrade to one of the paid plans - the other thing that would be good for you to do is to use the Moodle course backup process and store a copy of your course backups locally. all the best!",

          "Text": "Hi Katie (and everyone who posted here). I wanted to close this one out by sharing some information about the incident, what we learned, and what plans we have for this to not happen again. 1. Outage We had a failure of a single-point dependency in our US region's infrastructure. At the time of failure, the automatic notification to our on-call engineer also wasn't picked up immediately by our on-call engineer, exacerbating the respond/resolve time. 2. Notification Ideally in a situation like the above, the internal incident notification system will contain a step for automatically notifying an engineering manager when an incident goes unacknowledged by the on-call engineer. This was not configured correctly for management notifications. 3. Communication Ideally in a situation like the above, non-engineering staff are brought into the loop to manage public-facing communications like status.moodlecloud.com and the forums here. Due to the above breakdown in communications, neither of these steps were taken to let the community know about the issues we were having. 4. Outcomes As Product Manager for MoodleCloud, I've taken on 17 discrete changes as a result of this. Some are already in place, others are longer term goals that will make more incremental improvements to how we provide this service to our users. I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the impact to your services, and I hope that this transparency goes some way to giving you confidence that we're working hard to improve every day here at the MoodleCloud team at Moodle HQ. If you have questions or concerns, please reach out below. I'm always keen to hear your views. Thanks heaps Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

Infrastructure Uptime - We have succeeded in keeping all services up during this period by staying one step ahead of the hard bottlenecks that would have otherwise caused outages at specific threshholds of users/sites. This has been our focus (to the exclusion of all else) over the last 10 days. 2. Infrastructure Performance - We have not succeeded in maintaining fast page load times during this period (as this has been secondary to #1 above). We are now at the final stages of testing and expect to add capacity for more sites and concurrent users in the EU and US regions today and tomorrow. We expect these upcoming changes to substantially improve performance to usual page load times, but until then, users in EU and US regions will see slower page load times during their local business hours peak times. 3. Customer Support - We have not succeeded in maintaining our usual ticket respond/resolve times during this period. We have added support staff to the MoodleCloud team and are training them as we speak to assist with bringing down support ticket respond/resolve times. I understand this experience is challenging for you at a time when you need Moodle most, and for that I would like to apologise. Please know that the MoodleCloud team are doing everything we can right now to get back to providing a great service to you, and to the 20,000+ new schools and businesses that have signed up to MoodleCloud in the last 10 days alone. Hit me up below if you have any questions or concerns, I'd love to hear them. Cheers Lee Goldsworthy Product Manager - MoodleCloud",

I am deeply regretful that we have not met your expectations on this occasion. The whole MoodleCloud team are working hard to resolve these performance issues as soon as possible for you.

If they are not able to offer the band width, then they should not charge us for the service as we should at least be able to connect in under 60 seconds, not 25 minutes!!

The display of the image of all students and groups below the image of the author of a post (see below). It is visible when posts are open. The most disturbing is that images of people who do not have access to the forum are visible, which raises questions who has access. The space taken by the images is proportional to the number of students and groups so that it extends the vertical size of the post. I see this on Chrome: Is this a known issue with the latest version of MoodleCloud? If not what could be the reason?

          "Text": "Hi all, From February 18th, 2020, we’re changing the idle timer for all MoodleCloud Free sites to 14 days instead of the current 60. This means that if a Free MoodleCloud site remains inactive for 14 consecutive days, we’ll e-mail the site Admin and ask them to log in to their site. If neither the Admin nor any other user log in to the site in the following 7 days, we’ll delete it. By shortening this idle period, we’re reducing infrastructure costs from maintaining many Free sites that are created to try MoodleCloud and later become dormant.

On the mini-package, if we record a class session with bigbluebutton, where will this recording be saved? Will the saved file count towards the File Storage limit of 200mb? 2. As our class sessions are 90 minutes long, am pretty sure that any video recording will exceed 200MB, has anyone encountered this issue, and can you advise what to do to work around it? 3. We may run concurrent classes at the same time, and will require concurrent Web-conferencing sessions. Can anyone advise how many sessions could we run at the same time? 4. Is the file storage limit of 200MB site-wide for all users? It seems very low and easy to hit the limit. Thank you!",

In any case, Moodle allows for extensive use of 3rd-party hosting services (Google drive, Dropbox, etc.) and can embed content from Youtube and other video hosting sites. I recommend taking advantage of these features to save on disk space. Looking forward to seeing your site on MoodleCloud! Mat",

The reason I hid this HTML Block previously is that the content of the Block needed changing for Public view and I have not been able to find how to edit this HTML Block which I created some time ago.  Can you suggest how I can find this Block where I can edit it?  When I turn editing on in either Manager/Course Creator/Tecaher roles, this custom HTML Block appears but there are no control icons around it to edit it.  I know this is very embarrassing that for a Block I created I cant remember how to edit it.  I have all the Manuals printed out for 2.7 version so if you can direct me to the best section that may help. It is possible that I accidentallyturned off some control in Site Admin which effected this. Regards Bruce",

You are correct, MoodleCloud is basically standard core Moodle (with a couple of chosen plugins) but no ability to add other plugins, such as the Lightbox Gallery plugin ( working example ). However, with a little work, you could use a Database activity or a Glossary activity as a sort of Lightbox. Glossary might be quickest and easiest (although Database would give you more display flexibility if you are happy putting some work into designing  the templates?) A key advantage of the Glossary however is that you could then use a Random Glossary Entry Block - which could be set to show a different image every time the page is revisited or refreshed. That can work very nicely if the Block is top left / right so the users see the changing images all the time Stu",

On a Moodle level, courses from 10 years ago can definitely still be restored in Moodle nowadays, so that's already a good thing. I feel this is a discussion as much about formats you use in your course as it is about the platform itself. In both cases, \"I sure hope so and I'll do my best to make it happen\" is the best I can say. You can definitely load videos in a free MoodleCloud site (though the space is limited). For both of these questions (videos and access control), since they are not MoodleCloud-specific, I strongly recommend you ask in the relevant support forum (have you tried the Assistance technique and Assistance pédagogique ?).

Most/all our users currently access the content offline through the Moodle app. We're in the process of determining whether Moodle Cloud is the right place for the site for the next year, or if we need to move it elsewhere (depending on a number of factors). Due to red tape, it could happen that a final decision is not made by the time the subscription comes up from renewal. How will users accessing content offline through the app be affected? Will they still have access until they go online again, or will their access stop the same day subscription is suspended (if it isn't paid). Having all the facts will help prioritise decision making.

I suggest you turn the wifi & data connection off on your phone and see what works and what doesn't once you're \"offline\". I am unfortunately not sure if the app reacts differently in the case where the connection is not \"offline\", but the site is suspended. Either way, I would strongly suggest you download both a course backup from your site, and a full site export from the MoodleCloud portal (under the \"Tools\" tab in the portal). Mathieu",

The very special irony of Google Analytics is that Google doesn't have to do anything actively, it is you, the webmaster, who sends data on each click of your users to Google. So you are sending other's data to Google. The law is catching up with this abuse and it is on the way to become illegal. Even now the major browsers have mechanisms built-in to block this communication. This is too broad a topic, or rather a whole bag of issues, to be discussed here. But unavoidable we touch it many forums on moodle.org. Here is a random short explanation I found: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/50824/what-are-the-security-implications-of-using-google-analytics . Please inform yourself. Generally people don't like to be tracked. There are so many tools and methods to find out whether a site is tracking. So finally the tracking can back-fire depending on the awareness of your users. If you have the trust of users, why don't you collect data transparently? Everybody knows that each click is \"trackable\" if one is logged in.",

Hello, We use Microsoft Azure AD sign on for our Moodle Cloud site (version 3.6.4). However, for many of our users (including me and I have site administrator permissions), it often does not work. Occasionally it will work for me, but I often get a message that says \"Your session has most likely timed out. Please log in again.\" When I click on Continue it takes me back to the log in page, and then the cycle repeats over and over again. Occasionally I can see the left hand menu as well as the error and then I can enter the Moodle site through the menu, but not always. It's often this cycle: Click on the Azure AD sign on, select my account, get error, click continue, repeat. When I click on \"More information about this error\" it takes me to this site: https://docs.moodle.org/36/en/error/moodle/invalidsesskey . Should we be checking out these options or is this likely a different kind of issue? One more thing I've noticed is that for some people, the authentication method shows as \"OAuth2\" in their profile. However, we always select \"Manual accounts\" when we create users, so I'm unsure how some say \"OAuth2\" or if that is in any way connected to the issue we are having. Thank you and please let me know if you require any further information. See screenshots of our OAuth 2 services setting and the error I receive.",

Well till last May I worked well, and the editor worked well for me and I used it nicely. Now (November) I noticed some significant changes in the Moodle GUI (although the theme is always the same: the Moodlecloud theme). No problem, the new GUI is nice too. But using the HTML editor is another thing. The font display size is too small for me to write easily: the paragraph style is 5 pixels high (height of the lowercase x letter). This is simply too much small for me. I've an 1920x1080 display too. Also, the <h5> headers, which I often use, are only 4 pixels high! Those sizes are shown to me only in the editor: when my students open the page I wrote, they see the paragraphs of 8 pixels high (lowercase letters) which is OK for them. Now, can I restore the previous font display size in my HTML text editor? Thanks in advance, Luigi",

The user cap is more fluid. There are no hardcoded user limits in BigBlueButton so the biggest factor is server specs and then client bottlenecks. For the current HTML5 client build I would recommend not going over 100 users in a meeting and to reach those numbers requires a server that is beyond the minimum specs in the documentation. We're trying to raise the number of users that the client can sustain, but it's an ongoing process. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bigbluebutton-users/6hjfvfWNAsY/fwnu_CeNCAAJ",

I am wondering if I could just migrate it to moodle cloud to get it up to speed.  Is it possible to migrate an existing legacy moodle instance to the cloud and work on it there? Or c an I configure a Moodle cloud account to accommodate this older version of the training module?  Specifically run an old version of PHP to accommodate an older version of Moodle?  As I write this I am thinking this is probably not possible as it is probably some kind of shared hosting, but I am hoping that using the cloud version will be an easier environment to updgrade it to ver 3.7. Thoughts on migrating an old Moodle app to the Moodle Cloud? Hopefully I am making sense and thanks for any help you can give me. - Joe",

As you found out, since Moodle 2.6.1 does not support php 7, you will have a hard time finding a commercial host that will offer you this service. At this point, you can contact a Moodle Partner (find yours on https://moodle.com/partners/ ) to ask for support. They should be able to provide help. Otherwise, if you have a backup of your course, you can try to upload it into a MoodleCloud site  and see how things go­. If you do not use contrib modules, your content should be upgraded and work in the up-to-date Moodle version MoodleCloud provides. Let us know how it goes, Mathieu",

I went to Participants > Settings (gear icon) > Guest Access > Allow Guest Access > Yes I've tried this with and without a guest password. I've also tried disabling guest access and re-enabling. Both of these icons also appear to the right of the course name on my homepage: Could there be another setting somewhere that would potentially interfere with this one?

          "Text": "Hi Brittany, A small point of confusion to begin with: \"guest\" may refer to both \"authentication\" and \"enrolment\". Previous questions on this topic referred to \"authentication\" (which controls access to the site, usually with a username and password), while the screenshot you pasted is about the \"guest enrolment\" (access to a course). Unfortunately, as you saw in other threads (but mostly this one - linked here for whoever comes next with this question),  this option is not available on the free version of MoodleCloud , mostly as a way to prevent abuse. You can use autologinguests to achieve a somewhat similar result, but it's probably not a great behaviour for your site, as explained in the linked thread. You can still enable guest access to courses, but in your case (and unless you enable autologinguests ), it means that logged-in users will be able to access the course material, even though they might not be enrolled in that course. Hopefully this helps, but I'm aware I might not be explaining this in the most simple way. Let us know how it goes. You may also find more help in the General help forum . More information about enrolment is available on https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/Course_enrolment Mathieu",

Do you simply mean a hyperlink as I made above with the link to the other forum thread? Or do you mean another kind of link? When you ask about the steps to transfer all the formats from MoodleCloud to your new hosted Moodle site, do you mean you want to move your courses? You can move your courses by using the back up and restore features. Watch the videos in these two documentation pages: Course backup Course restore",

If that's the right error, there's an old issue related to this, MDL-30812 (2013), which makes me think that if you still have access to the site that created this backup, you might be able to fix the section names that contain html code or \"extended\" characters (in that issue, it was the use of Scandinavian characters that Moodle didn't properly deal with). Otherwise, you might want to submit a request and send us the backup file so we can have a look. Mat",

Now, when it comes to my particular need to add a meta-tag in the head element, it is because i need this verification of the subdomain (nsd.moodle.school). Because otherwise I cannot leverage the full potential of Google API plugins. Forwarding an external, verified domain towards my MoodleCloud site will not solve this. Thanks for the comment, though.

Prompted by your reply I have played around a little more and find the 3.1.1 installation to be a little inconsistent — sometimes it is working and sometimes it isn't. I cannot figure out a pattern. On one occasion it wasn't working so I opened up the pdf using the direct link in another tab then refreshed the moodle page and it displayed correctly.

This is MoodleCloud and I have no access to the server. The connection log records the login attempt as successful and I have to log out to be able to log in under my name in the same browser. The issue affects four students, three in South Africa and one in Europe who have used Moodle intensively in past weeks, including to open another website containing course content.

We are currently on the 100-user package and it is estimated in about 3 to 4 months' time we will hit the 100% quota. Courses run by us are not long - 3 months to 6 months on the average. And some students will not continue with us after they have finished their chosen courses though they can opt to continue with other related courses. Can we delete such students from our users database and re-use the empty slots without breaking the courses that these students were enrolled in (in terms of grades and contributions from such deleted students)? Or would all information (grades & contributions) of such students be wiped clean as well? Would appreciate guidance on this so that we can make decision whether to increase the quota when the time comes. Thank you.",

It's unlikely at this time that such an integration would\nbe made available on MoodleCloud right away. Note that Moodle is free software, you can host it yourself. You could then use any modules you like, though I'll admit that's not a quick and easy task to complete and deploy. Mathieu",

In moodle, the 'course modules' database table is what links all the different activities and resources (quizzes, forums, pages, labels, ...) to the course. This part of Moodle has not changed in years, and normally works fine, so it is hard to guess what might be causing this error. We need more facts. It would be very helpful if you could turn on Debugging , and set it to 'Developer' level and trigger the error again. Then copy and paste the full error message here. That would tell us exactly where in the code the error is coming from.",

I suggested he use \"autologinguests\" and showed my MoodleCloud site as an example. This then prompted us to discuss here the strange fact that, if your site has forcelogin - yes, as all the MoodleCloud sites do, then you would expect not to be able to do this, but in fact, the autologinguests setting means you can have guest access on a site where you are not allowed to see the front page before logging in. I looked in the tracker and found several very old issues about this: for example MDL-35359 and MDL-10850 which seem to suggest that this is the expected behaviour: Sites with forcelogin can indeed still have autologinguests. (I am about to edit the documentation to clarify this)",

So I used that authentication method to collect accounts from my students. Well, some of them were successful with the registration, but the rest of the class encountered a problem: when they pressed the button \"Create my new account\" (immediately after reCaptcha recognition), the email wasn't sent and the authentication process has been restarted automatically (from the \"privacy notification\" page, onwards). I told them to try again, but they continued to experience the same problem. During these attempts, some students successfully completed the procedure. Finally, first one student, then another student, all managed to register on my Moodle site. I thought the \"Email-based self-registration\" plug-in failed when more students try to use it at the same time. Anyway, a few days later, I tried the registration process with another class: still the same problem. The first 3-4 students immediately completed the registration successfully. Others after several attempts, one student at a time. My questions: Have you ever experienced this \"strange\" behaviour of the \"Email-based self-registration\" plug-in? What could be the reason? What can I do, in the future, to manage the email-based registration process without proceed with one student at a time? Thanks in advance, Luigi P.S. I use Moodle 3.5, hosted by MoodleCloud.",

Moodle for Free and Starter site URLs have this format: [yoursitename].moodlecloud.com. Moodle for School site URLs have this format: [yoursitename].moodle.school. Second, locate the link: forgotten your username or password? You will be redirected to a page that asks you to enter your username or email address. Once you’ve entered your information an email will be sent to the email address you registered with, instructing you on how to change your password. It’s important to remember if you are the site admin user, a password reset applies to the admin user on your MoodleCloud site and the portal login. They will always have the same password. I hope this information helps. If you are still having issues, I suggest you email the support team at support@moodlecloud.com Happy Moodling! Frances",

So after I get to 50 students (2 to 3 Classes) I suppose I will have to contact a Moodle Partner . Is that correct? I have already created the basic Moodle Cloud version (for 50 students) and it looks to be excellent......although I would love to run H5P.....is that possible on a Moodle Cloud site? Is there a Moodle Partner willing to deal with a small player as myself. If all goes well it could grow to 700 to 800 student at best.",

You can upgrade your site to a Moodle for School site easily in your MoodleCloud portal. Please take a look at our pricing page which will give you an idea of prices: https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/ Our Medium package for example caters for up to 500 users. At the moment it is not possible to install your own plugins, such as H5P, on your MoodleCloud site. We wouldn't be able to advise on what specific partner best suits your needs, however if you take a look at https://moodle.com/partners/ you will get a list of all our Moodle Partners.

Not knowing what's in that scorm file, it's hard to suggest other things, but sometimes it's possible to host some bigs files (often videos) elsewhere and have the scorm file link to these ressources. I know this breaks the \"self-encapsulation\" of the scorm package, but it could make it possible to use MoodleCloud for you. Mat",

I plan on using Moodle as more of a training course for our company rather than a classroom setting.  With that being said reports are very important to us. It’s great that Moodle can generate completion reports for each course. But what we need to be able to do is have Moodle generate completion reports across multiple or in our case all courses. There is a plugin that I think gives us this ability but it is not accessible to Moodlecloud . ( https://moodle.org/plugins/report_completionoverview ) Is the only way to generate these reports to buy a version of Moodle that allows this? If so what would the best version be and how much would that cost? Lastly are they any other options we could take into consideration for this issue? In addition we would like to generate  a report to see all courses a single user has taken. Hopefully this all makes sense. I’d be happy to try and better explain if need be!

I've looked at the plug-in code and it's looking for $_SERVER vars that should be provided if Shibboleth has authenticated correctly. It's not even finding the HTTP_SHIB_APPLICATION_ID/Shib-Application-ID variables. I have no access to Shibboleth logs so I have no idea if the authentication is failing.

MoodleCloud Starter only provides the \"custom certificate\" extra plugin and does not allow installation of custom themes or plugins (which is possible when self-hosting). You can view the list of extra plugins on https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/ , by clicking on the \"+\" sign right of \"Extra plugin pack\". A list with more detailed descriptions is available on https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=80 - note that most of them are only available on \"school plans\" (which are available to anyone, don't let the name confuse you). Since MoodleCloud offers a free tier from which you can later upgrade, I would suggest you get started with it. You can later export your courses and import them into your self-hosted site if you wish. Hopefully this helps make sense of it. Mathieu",

Wouldn't H5P need to be accepted and supported as part of the standard distro to be on MoodleCloud or are there other considerations? Rather than being yet another summative assessment tool, which H5P can be used for, I see it as more of a replacement for other presentation formats, e.g. Flash and multimedia slideshows, which often include in-line quizzes and games in an attempt to improve students' recall of the content. I don't consider any of the modules in the standard Moodle distro as serving that function particularly well (e.g. Quiz and Lesson modules) and this is where H5P excels. I think the main usability issue with the H5P Moodle module, i.e. authoring content, still needs to be resolved. At the moment, users have to use another platform to author content rather than doing it all in Moodle. This replicates the editing problems with using SCORM packages. It'll be interesting to see where this goes.",

In a free site, accounting for one teacher (which in such a case would probably be the admin account), this means you can have 49 students taking a quiz at once. (For completeness, I'll add that the teacher could do it too, since that account can also be enrolled in the course as a student, but I'm guessing that's not what you're after.) Mathieu",

You can get rid of your 200 MB by putting some of your files somewhere else  and then you can keep the free site. But if you prefer to have more storage space then, according to the MoodleCloud rules you will have to pay. I just want to add by the way that Moodle software IS actually entirely free and open source to anyone who wants it and is able to install it on a server . You do still have to pay for the hosting. MoodleCLoud is just a quick and easy (official) way of having this done for you so you can focus on the teaching.",

All I want is to educate the visitors to my site about our self, services we provide, Terms and Conditions etc. Just like on any other wordpress website. I was pondering, should we make a guest login and prompt the user to enter the site using that; and using Label resource add text and multimedia content. This way the content will be visible to the visitors. But, problem with this is, there is too much content and it will not be organised and presented well with this solution. Another aspect: Not everyone will be familiar with the icons we use in Moodle. So adding our content within a particular resource for example, book or page, or making a course to educate them about us, and asking them to go thru it, will perhaps be quite contrary to what I am thinking. Let's see. Thanks once again.",

I see a request for mobile support on the project's github page, but not development seems to have been done (yet). I understand how it would be useful to have native support of this plugin in Moodle mobile, but this plugin is developed by a (volunteer, afaik) developer outside of Moodle HQ and is not part of Moodle core, so I'm not aware of the developer's current circumstances.

          "Text": "Hi Rajesh, Are you asking about the plugins that are included as part of a Moodle for School package? I am going to assume so. Those plugins are safe in that they have been tested extensively by the MoodleCloud team to work. If there were some known security issue related to them, I am very confident that the team would have pounced on it for sure. As far as useful goes, a hammer is not so handy for sewing, but pretty good for smacking in nails ... these plugins are very useful for many a teaching situation, but as we all know, not all teaching situations are alike. In my circumstances, the Attendance module is not so useful as I have been required to take attendance using another system; if I didn't have that requirement, it would be extremely useful to me. Group Choice is spectacularly useful with my students. I have rarely used a teleconferencing solution such as Big Blue Button with my classes, but it might be a daily occurrence in your case, so extremely useful to you. When I *do* want to offer an interview with an expert to my students, however, having the option available is really valuable. Do you think that Checklist could help your students (and you, and even their parents) keep track of their requirements, progress and completed material? I do. And if you are teaching with material that needs the Equation or Chemistry editors and they weren't available, how many hairs would remain on your head? Maybe we would all love a few more plugins to suit our particular situation, but these ones have been tested with the MoodleCloud themes, and they are stable - is \"reassuring\" the safety that you are looking for? At the end of the day, I think that I might be saying that it's not just what we've got through Moodle for School, but how we use it ... or am I saying something like beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

In the case of Moodle cloud , you can use any server or service that allows you to publish public files. For example, in one of our testing sites we use a gist in GitHub, so the URL is something like: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/.../moodlemobileapp.css I think you should be able to use some services like Dropbox or Google Drive as long as the file is public and you provide the download link in there. Please notice there shouldn't be any \"intermediary\" page when opening the link, it should be a direct link to the file.

However, there is some good news.  We are about to include some changes to how BigBlueButton works with MoodleCloud in the 3.4 Moodle release. This will include some exciting changes to the number of users per session included on your site and how you can get more users. We are working hard on getting this to all MoodleCloud sites in the next 2 weeks.  So If you can wait for these hopefully it will give you what you need. I can't give you the exact details yet, however there will be an email to account admins explaining all the changes, so keep an eye on your inbox. You are able to use other conferencing software on MoodleCloud, however it won't integrate as well as BigBlueButton. Thanks Chris",

I know there isn't much support on moving from MoodleCloud to a local instance.  Got all of it taken care of, just curious in anyone had some info on the password section.  Thank you kindly in advance. -Jeff",

Even when using a partner there are several issues to deal with, such as lack of tech support and communication issues. My question is, what is the ultimate goal of Moodle Cloud ? Is it to essentially to do away with Moodle Hosting? In the near future, will Moodle Hosting be a thing of the past? Will Moodle Cloud eventually cost money? I am all for moving away from Moodle Hosting partners and going directly through Moodle Cloud when it becomes powerful enough. Just wondering if I am on the right track with this assumption.

The goal of MoodleCloud is to help as many users as possible get started with a Moodle site. It's a service that allows anyone to experience Moodle within minutes and helps users build a Moodle site to a certain level (500 users and 1Gb of file storage). As we offer limited support, we feel once you get to that level, you are ready for that next step and Moodle Partners can offer a more tailored solution and provide the necessary support and assistance for hosting a large site. As Tim mentions, the flexibility of Moodle means you can shape the solution that's right for you and choosing an appropriate hosting option is part of this. So it's likely that Moodle hosting will continue to will come in many shapes and sizes from many providers. Thanks Chris",

Access to the editor is allowed as there are some customisations that will work. Unfortunately, there is no definitive list for the customisations that will work across the many language packs.

I can add files from Google Drive to Moodlecloud directly using the filepicker. What I would like to be able to do is to add them without the files being added to the file storage limit. I appreciate that I could just create a shareable link on Google Drive and copy/paste that into the Moodlecloud site but this seems to defeat the advantage of using GDrive as a repository. Is there something simple that I've missed - I thought it might be in the Internal/External/Internal and External options in the Repository settings but this seems to make no difference. cheers Colin",

Make sure to connect a \"System account\" (on the OAuth2 services page in Moodle). As explained on the \"Google Drive repository\" page (linked above), you should use a dedicated account for this purpose (this is the account that will keep a copy of your files on google drive). Depending if you are using an enterprise (vs personal) Google account, the screenshots might be different from what you get on the site, but the process is the same. Once this is all done, you may want to enable the Google auth, by following the documentation on https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/OAuth_2_authentication Mathieu",

          "Text": "In the simplest terms: if you install free Moodle on your desktop you can't easily run courses for students on it because  it is just on your desktop and not on the internet. (Some people will try to tell  you that you can, but it's very complex) People do this to test Moodle. MoodleCloud is a service offered by the people who make Moodle and they (we) set up a Moodle site online for you so you don't have to do the technical stuff and can just get on with teaching your class. There are longer answers and more details  but hopefully that helps. Also - I see you are currently in our Learn Moodle MOOC. You could get yourself a MoodleCloud site to try restoring your practice course, if you wanted to.",

When I \"sign up\" again for a new account - since using my current account no longer works - I am allowed to use my old site name/ URL and \"claim\" it.  When I do all that, what I get is the site name but the content is gone!  Anyone else have this experience?  How can I retrieve the course content?

In future I WILL do as Craig suggested re \"inputting your colleague's mobile/cell phone numbers during signup and asking them to SMS or email you through the verification code for you to enter on their behalf.\" I can also understand the idea that  \"upgrade your current (FREE) site to a starter site which then allows you to have a new free site, whilst also supporting MoodleCloud \"  (and I certainly will ...continue to introduce your colleagues to the world of MoodleCloud ) OK, BUT this the current situation - HERE is my current 'problem'  that I need to find a solution for ... END Result I am trying to achieve is handing over the moodle portal and associated free moodlecloud site that I set up for the colleague.  (I acknowledge I did this wrong and will not do it this way again) To set this up I used a) A Gmail email account I set up for them (which can be 'handed over') and b) My mobile phone number. IF I upgraded this free moodle cloud account to a starter account then the account is still 'attached to' my portal account (via the mobile number) .... Is this correct? I 'guess' I could do the following ......  ???? 1. Export the whole Moodle Site (Login to your MoodleCloud Portal, and in the Tools tab, there is an export button.) 2. REMOVE the moodle cloud site (as this is the only site associated with the portal that is attached to the mobile number I assume then the portal will be deleted aswell) 3. Set up a NEW Moodle Cloud Account - Doing it as Craig suggested  re \"inputting your colleague's mobile/cell phone numbers during signup and asking them to SMS or email you through the verification code for you to enter on their behalf.\"  - AND I assume that given the previous one was removed / deleted - the gmail account will be able to be used (again) to set this up - AND I will be able to use the same name? 4. THEN - import the whole site (I have developed on their behalf)  to this new 'account' - which will then be attached to their mobile phone number .... JUST a question on this last part ... The mobile number will belong to a person.  What happens in the future, if that person is no longer employed by the company?   They will be unable to ever 'set up' their own moodle cloud account as their mobile phone number is forever 'attached' to the company's account? I KNOW I could do as Chris suggested and 'upgrade' this currently free account to a starter account - BUT again, the account is still attached to my mobile number and would appear 'on' my portal account rather than as a stand-alone separate account. .... So ....   again, I know I have made a mess of this.  (Big Learning Curve and I will never set up an account on behalf of anyone else -using my mobile number - BUT there remains a possible FUTURE issue for the person / employee that does have their mobile number 'attached' to the business account?? )  ..... so THANK YOU for your suggestions to try and solve this problem I have created for myself .....

          "Text": "Hi Kathleen Thanks for explaining the situation further and highlighting the difficulties in transferring a site. Free sites do require the phone number to be verified so its not possible to change the mobile number on an Free site account. Paid plan sites can be validated via email so the phone number becomes less important to the verification process and ongoing account ownership. Currently we do not offer the ability to change your phone number, which I can see causes a problem for you when trying to transfer ownership once upgraded or you move on from an organisation. The MoodleCloud team are investigating the best way to handle this scenario. In the meantime I've opened a support ticket for you so so we can go through specific details of your account and sites to get this all sorted out. Thanks Chris",

Also I note your comment ... \"Currently we do not offer the ability to change your phone number, which I can see causes a problem for you when trying to transfer ownership once upgraded or you move on from an organisation. The MoodleCloud team are investigating the best way to handle this scenario.\" (my bold and italics) Given the free Moodle cloud service is relatively new (and it is FANTASTIC!) - I can see how this type of situation may not have arisen to date but could become more of an issue over time and at a later date, for others I really appreciate your openness and willingness to understand this situation and help me 'sort it out' :D By the end of next week I WILL be upgrading their currently  free site to a paid site.  (& I am just going to pay this myself for 1 year)  -   Once this is done I will then follow up with the support ticket ....  I just need to talk to them and let them know what is going on ....   to be frank, they were a bit 'hesitant' in the beginning - and this has all been a learning curve for me too (BUT a really good one! and one that will enable me to more fully understand the intricacies of the ownership / setting up process and make sure i take all of this into account  and explain it much better to any future colleagues :D) Anyway, from this point on I will progress this issue, for them, via the support ticket system. I just wanted to publicly respond in here and thank you again for all of your support and assistance.  and who knows, maybe this convo may end up being of value to another .. Warm Regards Kathleen",

From the get go, I am pretty sure that I was told that I could use Big Blue Button with Moodle's Free MoodleCloud.  Since I have heard some pretty unclear implications that might not be true.  I have heard some discussion that BBB is only available if this or that, but all that discussion seemed to be referring to some special cases and not the average.  But even before I heard these unclear seemingly small arguments, I felt it had been clearly stated that BBB was integrated with moodlecloud and was available with the free service (for try out) and could handle six (6) participants at a time.  With that info., I bought over 100 megabytes internet speed.  I expected to be able to use BBB with moodlecloud to tutor six students at a time.  If all went well, I planned to pay for an upgrade to moodlecloud - probably taking a bit at a time and buying the $80/year plan. So anyway, today I tried to set up the plug-in for BBB.  It didn't seem like much to do, but if there was something I missed I think it would have been hard to know what I missed - maybe a setting in the glossary for all I know.  Q:?). Then I went to one of my courses, set the edit with the gear menu, and tried to add a Big Blue Button session through \"Add an Activity or Resource.\"  This also seemed pretty easy, but again, if I missed something, I think it would be pretty hard to know what it is I missed.  After submitting with \"Save and display,\" I got an error message.  I followed some link to learn more detail, but it was unhelpful to me.  I have tried over and over. I hope someone can help me set up BBB?  As I stated above, I felt so confident that I would be able to get it with moodlecloud that I bought more internet speed.

I first started with Moodle by signing up for a Moodle account, then discovered MoodleCloud.  I was able to sign up for the free account, but when I've tried to go back in today it's not working.  At first, it didn't give me a 'forgot your password' option, but then I was able to get on my site login page and it did ask me that. I requested it using both my username and email, but nothing has come to my email.  I did this on moodle (I didn't realize I wasn't on moodlecloud at first), and I did get links to my email, but somehow it logged me in as \"admin\" and just a sample course. I've tried to login to moodlecloud, but it says invalid login and nothing comes to my email when I try the login name or my email. I've looked in the forums and at various thread discussions and the closest solution I found was that a guy had two logins as \"admin\" and his personal username and that was a conflict that kept making his login fail and moodle had to fix his account directly, but the only way I can see to contact someone to get this fixed is by posting in a forum.  I hope that was enough detail to explain my issue and get a solution.

It appears you have created a MoodleCloud site, as  you said you could log in as \"admin\" and there was a sample course there. That's correct - you are the administrator of the MoodleCloud site you asked for, and there is one little course there already just to show you a few things.

At that point, I was \"in\" the course mode (of the free admin class) and to me it looked like I was stuck in this \"admin\" course and couldn't get in to actually create my own courses or do any specific changes to the site.  Somehow I figured out how to get out of the admin course, turn on editing, and add a new course.  From there, I've been able to add courses and start to build them with videos and resources.  I also saw how to change my username from admin back to the unique username I had originally created. I'm still not sure why I wasn't getting an email to reset my password, but it doesn't matter now. Thanks so much for your reply!  This will probably help new users as well. Also, is there a better forum specifically for MoodleCloud? I made sure to be in an appropriate topical thread, but everything I read took me back to moodle for the community forums to get help.",

At the moment, it seems like the easiest thing to do will be to have the 2 sites attached to my account (portal) - mine upgraded and paid for and then the 'example' site we are trying to develop as the free site (I will make my colleague an administrator) ....  But if there is a way now or in the future - to be able to set up a new separate 'account' ...  that would be great - cheers & thanks again,  Kathleen",

You can download Moodle from https://download.moodle.org/ You can perform a Site Export of your MoodleCloud site from the Portal by visiting https://moodlecloud.com and logging in using your site name and admin password, then going to Tools -> Export my site. You can restore your site export to the database on your home server and with a few minor tweaks of the provided config.php you will be up and running in no time. If you need help along the way be sure to check https://docs.moodle.org as we cannot provide support for sites hosted off the MoodleCloud platform.",

The student has to first complete a SCORM course (developed using Storyline 2) before they can complete the assessment in Moodle Cloud. There is no results slide in the SCORM package.\n\nMy client wants it so that Moodle records the SCORM package as complete and when this has been met, then the assessment will be availble to them. I have set up the Restrict Access to be like this, but it isn't working.\nAre the settings I have used correct? Are there additional settings in Moodle or Articualte that I need to change?",

          "Text": "Hi Natalie, sorry that you are encountering some troubles. The IT professional you consulted with is correct, http LTI tools can't be used on an https moodle instance. (but the reverse case would work: https tools can be used on http moodle instances, but I digress) You are correct, moodle cloud doesn't offer an option to disable SSL/https. Even if it did, you would not want to because of the security risk that would pose to your site. Basically, https on your cloud instance ensures that all content is encrypted and verifiably from your site. But if an http tool is used on that site, the content from that tool would not be encrypted, which would allow attackers to gain access to information about your users passed over LTI requests. So all modern browsers will not allow http content (such as LTI) on an https site. So your best option is to contact the provider of your tool and ask them to start using SSL on their site so you can use it via https. This is in their best interests as well as it protects all their clients' data. SSL certificates are cheap these days, and the extra processing power required is not really a problem. If you haven't already you might want to just double check that the tool is definitely not already working when you use https instead. If the tool provider really refuses to start using SSL, your do have the option is create a proxy server on top of their tool which allows you to send the LTI requests via https and then forward them to the original tool. But I would recommend leaving that as your last option",
