An example of one of my queries is below. \n```text\nSELECT prefix_page.name as PageName, prefix_page.content as PageContent, \n  prefix_course.id as courseID, prefix_course.shortname as CourseName\n\nFROM prefix_page\n\nINNER JOIN prefix_course ON (prefix_course.id = prefix_page.course)\n\nWHERE 1=1 %%FILTER_SEARCHTEXT:prefix_page.content:~%%\n```\n Prior to upgrading to 4.5 and TinyMCE, I was able to download a JSON format file which delivered the raw html source, but this workaround does not appear to be working on all content anymore. Plus it was a clunky approach and I am hopeful there is a more simple way to do this! Best case scenario is to be able to download a csv containing the source code so I can pull the url content out directly. Sam",

However, there are very few questions that have been created in course categories due to incorrect permissions, which can be problematic in our case. Due to the large number of categories and courses, a manual search is very time-consuming. I have therefore thought about a DB query ( MariaDB ) via configrable reports plugin. However, my DB knowledge is not so good. Has anyone already carried out such a query and can post the SQL query here? Basically, I just need the ID of the course category in which the questions are located. There is a similar query: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=370896 , maybe that will help as a starting point. The context level would probably be 40 (course category context level), but as I said, my DB knowledge is not so good to find a useful result. many thanks best regards Anton",

          "Text": "Hi - We had similar issues. The simple fix is to get more RAM on the server for database operations - Configurable reports have a tendency to hit tipping point where intermediate steps in your query produce virtual tables that are too big to be held in RAM and the result is a sudden massive slowdown. Of course the better solution is to examine your query and work out what is the root cause. Most likely you are starting off joining tables together in a way that produces a huge number of virtual rows, much better to start with a limited table. EG don't join all users onto all course enrolments, start with course enrolments on the course you want and link users in later. If you are using phpmyadmin to run the query on the server directly then you can use \"explain sql \" to give you a clue where the problem is.

Ive been using the custom reports feature built into moodle so far , but ive reached the limits on  what that solution is capable of. I have a \" dashboard \" of key data-points of my students program journey. It looks like this... If you ever played a roleplaying game like DnD this is the beginning of a\n\"character sheet\" lol basically gives students a report of their\ncurrent progress in the \"game\" The custom query i want to pull is for submitted assignments, but specifically submitted assignments LABELLED with a specific tag( activities ). This is where Im at today. Not exactly sure which one of the assignments queries from the adhoc list best suits my needs here. Also, I dont even know how much added complexity filtering by tag adds, or if there is a better way to get this done. I know what my students need to know, thats about it Chat gpt has led me this far but when you dont even know the question you want to ask its not so useful lol if you have any insight its appreciated.

To get the course final grade you will need to join to it the table grade_items and grade_grades and course (at least). The total time connected to course is not really doable in my humble point of view. Define Online progress, start date and end date. If it is the start and end date of the course, you have in the course table. If it is the date when the student started the course, then you will need to join the logs table, and God help you with that. If you go in a roundabout way, you could consider start and end date, the completion date of two certain activities , for example. That will require you to join also several more tables. I don't think you can get all this in just one query. I wouldn't try, really. Best,",

I need the user who has permissions to see the report (teacher role without editing permission ), to only see the students of the group to which he belongs (not to filter it, but only to see those students). I think this block has no options in its dropdown menus to achieve this. I understand that perhaps I could achieve it through a user field (for example \"assigned inspector\"): if I put the same user field for the students and the one who views the report (assigned inspector: inspector 1); is there any way to get it? I have tried to do it by putting a condition of type inspector assigned=CURRENTUSER, and I have tried with like%%, but I can't; The condition that I intend to set is that the report only shows users that the value of the \"Assigned Inspector\" user field matches the value of that field of the user who is viewing the report. Somebody could help me? Thank you very much in advance",

General speaking you need three main tables to do that, the Course table, the course_module table and the activity or resource table to get the course and activity/resources/module details.

The course is completed, when 95% are reached in the course all together. When the course is completed, the status of \"certificate\" becomes \"valid\". So the grade shown in \"grade\" should be consistent with users having 95% or more having a valid certificate. If less than 95% or no attempt at all, it would have to be < 95%. (If not set or 0, don't show grade).... I got the \"gg.finalgrade\" column from the ad hoc reports, but the values don't match what is seen in the grade book under \"course total\" for a user - and they also don't match the validity status in this report.

Second, you need to connect grade_grades with the user and items at the same time, like this (JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id AND gg. itemid = gi.id). I need to say also the above way of connecting the user with the course will show just students who have a record in the completion table, so I think my previous reply will solve part of the problem. However, you still need to find a better approach to connect the user with their courses. The following is another approach for connecting the user with the course. FROM prefix_course_categories AS cat JOIN prefix_course AS mc1 ON mc1.category = cat.id JOIN prefix_context AS context ON context.instanceid = mc1.id JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS mra ON mra.contextid = context.id JOIN prefix_user mu ON mra.userid = mu.id YOu can use subquery if that helps to optimise your code and enhance the query time. I do not think you can retrieve the results in the grade book in SQL code. Many of those calculations happened in the background and were not saved in one table. I hope that will help; please let us know how it that will go with you. Best wishes Mo",

For example: WHERE ra.roleid = 14 The thing is that these IDs change between Moodle systems and also may repeat a couple of times in a query, in different lines/statements. Is there a way to define a constant in the query, and then use the constant name instead of the number itslef? It would be so much easier. I'm thinking about something like this: 1) At the beginning of the query I would write something like this: constant role_id = 14 2) If I would want to use the constant in a line/staement, I would write: WHERE ra.roleid = role_id Is it possible somehow?",

          "Text": "Hi, For people reading french, you'd better look at the same discussion in french . I've found a solution, using CTE (Common Table Expression) ; this is available since MySql 8.0 (in 2018) or since MariaDB 10.2 (in 2017). You can look at MySQL's help page and MariaDB's help page . So, the application for my use is: at the begining of SQL, i add some lines to define my values at the begining of tables, i had my values table in my query, i use my values table An example, going from this : \n```text\nSELECT\n  cc.path,cc.name,c.fullname,FROM_UNIXTIME(c.startdate)\n\nFROM prefix_course            AS c\nJOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc   ON cc.id   = c.category\n\nWHERE c.shortname LIKE '%law%'        -- To filter courses\n  AND cc.path     LIKE \"%/1055/1057%\" -- To filter category\n# AND cc.path     LIKE '%/1055%'      -- To filter category\n```\n To this : \n```text\n-- Define values to use in query (since \nMySql\n 8.0 or \nMariaDB\n 10.2)\nWITH my AS ( SELECT\n  '%law%'        AS Course -- To filter courses\n ,'%/1055/1057%' AS Cat    -- To filter category\n#,'%/1055%'      AS Cat    -- To filter category (replace line upper)\n)\n\n-- Main query (no need to modify values)\nSELECT\n  cc.path,cc.name,c.fullname,FROM_UNIXTIME(c.startdate)\n\nFROM my                       -- To be able to use my values\nJOIN prefix_course            AS c\nJOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc   ON cc.id   = c.category\n\nWHERE c.shortname LIKE my.Course\n  AND cc.path     LIKE my.Cat\n```\n The main gain is to have personnalised values defined at the beginning of the query , and not inside it. Not visible with thie example, but with big long queries, it's more useful. Séverin",

For example, an institute has 3000 courses, and 20,000 students and each course has 5 to 10 activities on average, if you just talk about the summative activities, the number will be 7 to 10 digits. No ad-hoc neither Configruble report block will be able to handle that. Maria, If you want to know the activity completion settings in each course as a course facilitator or teacher, then you can navigate to the Gear button in that course, then course completion, then navigate to the Bulk edit activity completion tab, you will see a list of the activity in that course with the current completion configuration and you can edit the configuration for one activity or for bulk.

So I don't see any other way of getting that other than parse the string with things like SUB, etc. There are some key things to help: \"custom sql \" tells you it is a a sql report not a standard report \"querysql\" indicates the code is starting \"s:132\" or \"s:\" plus some number indicates the length of the data (which could be very useful for parsing) the fields are always in the same order It's going to be a fair amount of parsing. I wonder if it might be easier to just take the export xml file and parse that with some tool locally if is has some sort of xml to csv converter, for example?",

But I would like to share with you this example that has been shared by Randy in the ad-hoc contributed reports. If you reconstruct the tables after FROM to identify the group id first based on the userid for the student who explore the report, that would make it easier and you need to notice that in some stage probably you do not need to use the INNER JOIN. For example in Randy's syntax \"FROM (SELECT groupid FROM prefix_groups_members WHERE userid = %%USERID%%) AS GRU\" in this line we used the variable %%USERID%% to get the user who explore the report, but in this line of code \"JOIN prefix_groups g ON g.id = GRU.groupid\" we idintified the group id based on the userid that he/she explore the report. Then we joined the other tables that we need to use to get the data from in your case the completion and user tables. If you looking to get this report for the course that this report open in you need also to use the course variable \" %%COURSEID%%\". Here the list of all the variables and filters that you can use in Config reports block. I hope that's help in some how and thanks for sharing. Regards Mo",

Moodle reporting is not and never has been on a par with its competitors in the LMS world and we all feel its lack. Fortunately, Juan recognized this over a decade ago and did something about it. Although updates of features to the plugin have languished in recent years since Juan moved formally to work for Moodle HQ, it is still the one good user-facing reporting tool we have and still fills this gap admirably. I have written well over a hundred reports now in production on Moodle sites around the world, and it is thanks to Juan and this plugin that I was able to help so many people get more out of Moodle. We also owe thanks to Sara Arjona Téllez as well for taking her own time the last couple of years to help keep the plugin updated for more recent versions of Moodle. Your work is very much appreciated. Thank you both. Randy",

You could add this logic to the where clause or you could integrate the joins in the main section. There are two main ways to do this: go through the user_enrolments table or go through the role_assignments table. Normally, either will work for students since they will always have both an enrolment and a role assignment. There are examples of both methods over in the ad-hoc reports. Just search for the table names to see some ways to do it. Here's one simple way to do it for role assignments: SELECT u.username, c.shortname FROM prefix_course as c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid",

          "Text": "No problem The real SQL gurus (and gurinis) say as a general rule that JOIN is faster than a sub-selects. It has to do with how the interpreter builds the actual query internally. But sometimes a sub-select or a sub-query is the only way to do things. Or can save a lot of code. And it can be good as a first approximation too. For IN(), I have read that it is basically a shortcut for OR where for example u.id IN(1,2,3) is the same logic as u.id = 1 OR u.id = 2 OR u.id = 3. So u.id IN (SELECT....) is the same as u.id = ORs with all the results of the subquery. Also, in general I find that just checking role_assignments for finding teachers and students is all you need. You don't usually need to also check the enrolments tables. Normal course users will have both but the role_assignments is where the information is stored about which role(s) they have. So unless your query is just counting all the enrollments regardless of the roles, you are going to need role_assignments anyway.",

I need help in doing the following: Display the Grade as a Letter (as set in Moodle) i.e Pass, Fail etc. rather than the numerical value Force the user to select which Month they want to run From Month to Month (so they have the option to either look at ALL of March or Jan to March as an example The date being displayed to be the date they were issued the grade i.e. I did an examination and my course total is populated, the date on the report should be that date the grade was issued. And how to make the report auto pickup the category I am in to run the report ONLY on that category (and thus anything below that point) - if not possible how to prompt the report user to select the category level they want, i.e. be it say Category 1 (and everything within/under) or Category 2 (and everything within and below and so on. What I have thus far: SELECT u.lastname AS \"Lastname\", u.firstname AS \"Firstname\", u.idnumber AS \"SCC\", c.fullname AS \"Course\", ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2) AS \"Grade\", DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(gg.timemodified), '%d %M %Y') AS \"Date\" FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'course' # students only role id is 5 AND ra.roleid = 5 ORDER BY Course, Lastname Jayden",

New problem, that I don't know if can be sorted or not: The numbers you have used in your post, I take these as a score... rather than a percentage. I tested this by adding a line for a grade that is technically Honors (in our system) with a dummy name and it now shows. Is there a way to make it use percentages rather than a score value, i.e. 100% = Distinction, 90 to 99 = Honors etc? Or is that now falling into the realm of the complex scenario you mentioned? Basically our system is (as set at the Site Admin level for ALL courses/exam activity results: 100 = Distinction 90-99 = Honours 70-89 = Pass 0-69 = no grade the just have to take it again. However, how each course is set is not consistent, i.e. some areas use grades out of 100, others use a set grade system, i.e. out of 20 (but it is not then scaled, its just out of 20). While Moodle can for the most part work out what 70, 90% of things are, I know some areas it doesn't or at least uses score over scale/percentage. The current coding is now: SELECT u.lastname AS \"Lastname\", u.firstname AS \"Firstname\", u.idnumber AS \"SCC\", c.fullname AS \"Course\", gg.finalgrade AS \"Grade\", DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(gg.timemodified), '%d %M %Y') AS \"Date Completed\", CASE WHEN gg.finalgrade IS NULL THEN '' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)=100.00 THEN 'Distinction' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=90.00 THEN 'Honors' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=70.00 THEN 'Pass' WHEN ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2)>=19.00 THEN 'TEST' ELSE '-' END AS \"Grade\" FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'course' # students only role id is 5 AND ra.roleid = 5 %%FILTER_STARTTIME:c.startdate:>%% %%FILTER_ENDTIME:c.enddate:<%% ORDER BY Course, Lastname Jayden",

          "Text": "Hi all Desired outcome: A configurable SQL report showing assignment items that require grading ( note we've tried all such supplied reports and none fit the bill ) We only want to see the latest attempt from the student in this report. We have the following query established (we obtained this from the 'submitted SQL reports' on the Moodle site but it didn’t work in the supplied form and required rebuilding) : \n```text\nSELECT\n\n\nasub.id,\n\n\nCONCAT(u.firstname ,' ',u.lastname) AS User,\n\n\nCONCAT('<a target=\"_new\" href=\"%%WWWROOT%%/course/view.php',CHAR(63),'id=',c.id,'\">',c.fullname,'</a>') AS Course,\n\n\nccat.name AS Course_category,\n\n\nCONCAT('<a target=\"_new\" href=\"%%WWWROOT%%/mod/assign/view.php',CHAR(63),'id=',cm.id,'\">',a.name,'</a>') AS Assignment,\n\n\nasub.status,\n\n\nagr.grade,\n\n\n# agr.grader,\n\n\nCONCAT(u.firstname ,' ',u.lastname) AS User,\n```\n \n```text\nFROM prefix_assign_submission AS asub\n\n\nJOIN prefix_assign AS a ON a.id = asub.assignment\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = asub.userid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course AS c ON c.id = a.course\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course_categories AS ccat ON ccat.id = c.category \n\n\nJOIN prefix_course_modules cm ON cm.instance=a.id AND cm.course = a.course AND cm.module = 1\n\n\n# note: cm.module equalling 1 represents the Assignment module\n\n\nLEFT JOIN prefix_assign_grades agr ON agr.assignment = a.id AND agr.userid = asub.userid\n```\n \n```text\nWHERE agr.grade IS NULL AND asub.attemptnumber = asub.latest AND (asub.status = \"submitted\" OR asub.status = \"new\")\n\n\n# grade is null because there will be no table entry here at all until graded\n\n\n# WHERE 1=1 \n\n\n%%FILTER_CATEGORIES:c.category%%\n```\n \n```text\nORDER BY asub.timecreated DESC\n```\n This produces a result as follows: Our Issue: Records are appearing in the report (e.g. Valerie Christie) stating the status is “submitted”, yet when we view this in the user interface, we see this: The item in the report has a submission date of 25 October (when Valerie originally submitted), and we can see above it has a last modified date of 27 October, when the marker has accessed the submission, found it lacking, and provided feedback to Valerie that more detail is required (hence status of “reopened”). So, given this submission has a status of “reopened”, it should not be appearing in this report whatsoever (the SQL asks only for status=submitted or status=new). Looking at the database for Valerie’s submissions on this particular assignment we begin to understand why we are seeing this record flowing into the report... ...namely, it’s showing the first submission (the first row), yet there’s a later version. We don’t want this! In our SQL, we set the clause asub.attemptnumber = asub.latest to ensure we’re only seeing the latest submission (but it's clearly not working). I do not understand how “attemptnumber” and “latest” are actually working in the system. I would expect the following: attemptnumber latest Additional action: First submission : 0 0 none Second attempt 1 1 First submission record “latest” is updated to 1 Third attempt 2 2 First submission record “latest” is updated to 2 Second submission record “latest” is updated to 2 Can anyone shed some light on the mechanics of this? And we'd really appreciate any advice as to how to best alter our query to get the result we’re after, that is: Only show us assignment items requiring grading Don’t show us items that have been subsequently updated and are not the latest versions Kind Regards Lee Cujes",

The grade is always the latest and seems to have the attempt number there as well. Finally, in the WHERE clause you are filtering on the statuses for new and submitted but there is also a value for reopened (as well as draft.)

In the WHERE clause as you've rightly pointed out there are four possibilities for 'status' (new | submitted | draft | reopened). We've specifically excluded 'draft' (not ready for marking) and 'reopened' (we see this typically where the marker has provided feedback for the student and the ball is in the student's court (also not ready for marking). There may be some fine tuning to do here.

          "Text": "Lee and Motasem, I've been lurking a bit but wanted to test out some things before I posted. I think this is how the sequence works. 1) The student submits This creates the entry in the submissions table, with status of 'submitted' - but there is no grade table entry created yet (so agr.grade IS NULL). 2) Cron runs The task \"Background porcessing for assignments module\" runs on the next cron and it creates a new entry in the assign_grades table. It sets the grade to -1.0000 and sets the grader to -1. This is how you know that the assignment has not been graded yet. -1 is not a real user for sure, and probably -1 is not a real grade (but you never know;) 3) The teacher grades it The grader value in assign_grades is set to the grader's user id and then the grade is entered. The submission status stays as 'submitted' the whole time. So, there are two possible conditions for an ungraded submission: it is NULL until an entry is made in the assign_grades table by the cron task, or later it has an entry with a grader of -1 and grade of -1 after the row was created. So, you would want to cover both of those conditions to find all the assignments waiting to be graded. Something like WHERE agr.grade IS NULL OR (agr.grade = -1.0000 AND agr.grader = -1) should cover both cases. Attached is the report xml which I used to do some testing on this so I could follow the path of the submissions. Don't run it in production without adding some where filters to it! since it is written to show you *everything* in the submissions and assign grade tables ;) which is probably a lot of data. So far, I have only tested this out on assignments with one submission. Let me know if that is how you see it working too.",

When the cron task runs and creates the row in the assign_grades table, it set the timecreated to the time that this happens, as normal. However it sets the timemodified to the time that it copies from the submission row in the assign_sumbissions table. Therefore, the timemodified is always EARLIER than the time created for the grades. There may be some obscure reason why this is so; I have not looked into the code. Perhaps it needs to check the time modified date when creating any entry, or for some other purpose to exclude those until graded. But, it is logically impossible for the time modified to be earlier than the timecreated: and in most other cases, for example creating enrolments, Moodle devs do the logical thing and set the timecreated and timemodified to be the same when it creates the entry. But apparently, not for assignment grading. When a grader actually grades the submission, then the assign_grades entry does the proper thing: sets the timemodified to the time of the grading just as we expect. So, the timemodified on ungraded entries is inaccurate and should not be trusted. If you are doing any time comparisons on that, you need to take that problem into account in those cases of ungraded submissions. Only after a real user has graded the submissoin will the timemodified in the assign_grades table be accurate. In the example below, you will see in row four an ungraded entry with a modified time that is three minutes before its creation time. It will stay like this until actually graded.",

Why \"the new grade should not have a more recent timemodified value than the submission\" is not clear to me since the timecreated time is the actual time of modification. Perhaps this date is used later on in some logic when comparing the two entries. To sum up: assign_grade timecreated means the time the grade entry was created by cron assign_grade timemodified means the time the submission (not the grade) was last modified when the grader is -1 assign_grade timemodified is updated to the actual time of grading only when it has actually been graded by a grader as indicated by a real userid",

WE need to notice the following - there is two stakeholder creating records in more than one table AND we need the last record has been created by any one of them - This report just deal with assignments but what about other modules which has weight in the course -WE need to think about some other tables such grade_items and grade_grades to add another restriction to get all weighted modules (assignment but they also could be Quizzes or Forums..) - There is also a case where the student did not create any record, I mean did not access the assignment at all, this record probably will not be there unless the teacher access the student grading area (not sure, please correct me if I am wrong) I have tried the following code SELECT ####Grade_Grages mgg.id, mgg.userid, mgg.finalgrade, mgg.timemodified, ###USER mu.firstname, mu.lastname, ###grade_items mgi.itemname, mgi.itemmodule, CONCAT(' ',mgi.courseid,' ') AS Courseid, mgi.aggregationcoef FROM prefix_grade_items AS mgi JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS mgg ON mgg.itemid = mgi.id JOIN prefix_user AS mu ON mgg.userid = mu.id #JOIN prefix_assign_grades AS mag ON mu.id = mag.userid #JOIN prefix_grade_grades_history AS mggh ON mu.id = mggh.userid WHERE mgi.courseid = xxxxx AND mgg.finalgrade IS NULL AND mgi.aggregationcoef >0 #this condition to get all graded items has a weight in the course. It is Ok, but I found two issues, first one that show the teachers, second some students did not submit or graded but still they do not appear in the report. WE fix the first issue by restrict the report to show just students. But I could not find any reason why the other students dose not appear in the report. I checked the logs for each students has no grades in the assignment looking for any logic reason but I could not find a thing. Please try this and let me know what do you think. Mo",

That is because asub.latest is a boolean where 1 = true and 0 = false. It is not coordinated with the asub / agr attemptnumber and only has those two values. The code always marks the most recent attempt at latest =1 and then immediately marks all the user's previous attempts as 0. That's how it tracks the most recent one. If there is only one attempt allowed, you will always see that the latest =1 and the attemptnumber = 0. When multiple attempts are allowed, then looking for latest =1 that will tell one of the user's attempts the most recent. So, if you want only the most recent submission, then something like WHERE asub.latest=1 is all you need.",

          "Text": "Motasem, Also, the submission status is interesting. When you say, \"I tried this condition and I got a record where the student has new status but in the module he got his marks. \" I am not sure if you mean a status of 1 for the latest column on the attempt, or if you are referring to the submission status of 'new' in the asub.status field. For the submission status, I am seeing that a status of 'new' is set in two cases: 1) For the student, it is created the moment they go into the Assignment to start work on the submission. If they do nothing and leave, then the row is still there in the database waiting for them the next time they come back. The status will only turn to 'draft' or 'submitted' when they save it as a draft or actually submit. This will automatically also get a latest =1 as well and therefore any earlier attempts will get latest set to 0. This is how Moodle tracks that the user has started the attempt. It works the same way for single attempts and multiple attempts. 2) When the teacher creates the Assignment, it adds a row to the submission table with a 'new' status. Nothing ever seems to happen to this row at all. It just sits there. Perhaps it is used in some way by the code to set things up, but it does not seem to change at all. So, when dealing with a asub.status of 'new' it matters what role the user has. You can skip all the teacher roles. Also, if you only care about what has been submitted for grading, you can skip both 'new' and 'draft'.",

Similar for grading: the grade will be in the assign_grades table, but the details can be elsewhere depending on the grading type, eg scale, marking guide, rubric. I am not sure what your column for \"resubmit\" does. What matters in the data is the asub.status field and how that is control by whether the assignment has an attemptsreopenmethod and a maxattempts > -1. The key is how many attempts are allowed in the assign setting and if there is more than one, then tracking which one is the current one (asub.latest.). For groups, the assign.tempsubmission and the asub.groupid tell you all you need to know about group submissions: it's just one submission and you have to get the actual members from the group itself. I think - but haven't tested this for sure - that then when the grading is done, it will set the grades individually for each group member. So, in case of a group submission you have to take that into account to align the grades even though there is only one submission.",

I have also seen a status of 'new' then the student is actually working on the assignment: it creates the 'new' entry and it stays that way until the student either 1) saves it as a 'draft' (if the settings allow that) or 2) they submit it. So, the roles matter if you are looking only for the student ones. I see admins in mine all the time when I am testing as an admin: it just records the user id of whoever makes the new assignment. It may not be the teacher at all. Usually I don't bother with adding all the roles checking: I just ignore a status of 'new'.

You can't grade a 'new' status anyway. Also, 'reopened' status is used when \"Additional attempts\" is set to manual or until pass. The additional attempts get the 'reopened' status after the teacher has allowed a new attempt or if using until pass then the assignment did not get the passing grade. In either case, a new submission entry is made with the 'reopened' status. This marks a new, additional attempt and it will have the 'reopened' status until the student actually makes a submission.

This is the query that I am using: (SELECT d1.data FROM prefix_user_info_data d1 JOIN prefix_user_info_field f1 ON d1.fieldid = f1.id AND f1.shortname = 'businessunit' WHERE d1.userid = user2.id ) AS 'businessunit', (SELECT d1.data FROM prefix_user_info_data d1 JOIN prefix_user_info_field f1 ON d1.fieldid = f1.id AND f1.shortname = 'location' WHERE d1.userid = user2.id ) AS 'location', Moodle version: 3.10 Thanks in Advance.",

You need to do the following: 1) In your code, you must add a identifier to your filter like this FILTER_SEARCHTEXT_ID1 where ID1 is just any arbitrary identifier you want. I usually just use _1 or _2 but you could use _username or to make it clearer just _U. There must be an underscore. So, %%FILTER_SEARCHTEXT_U:user2.username:~%% will work for you. 2) In the filter tab for the ID, add ONLY the identifier part without the underscore line, so 1 or 2 or U or whatever you use. This method allows you to have two filters to search with, so: %%FILTER_SEARCHTEXT_U:user2.username:~%% %%FILTER_SEARCHTEXT_F:user2.firstname:~%% then you would have two filters with IDs of U and F and Labels of \"Username\" and \"Firstname\" Etc.",

But that's because David Saylor added some fixes last year to the serach text filter. The standard filters like USER and course don't have any flexibility. Another possible solution would be to clone the SEARCHTEXT filters and instead make it appear as a drop down list of the possible values. That would be nice. Only someone actually editing the plugin itself could do this, but it does have the ability to have extra filters added in the code.",

The row for the submission then shows up on the next page refresh. We're also pulling Submissions and Grades into our central SRS via Web Services, and the submissions are coming in via that route, leading me to wonder if some fields relating to Grades/Assignment Submissions only populate once they've been viewed by a user with grading permissions?

The department field has not been used consistently so I can't filter by this.

As John Gall says, \"All complex systems that work can be shown to come from simpler systems that work.\" - Study some queries that are similar to what you need if not exact and get those running first: do those above queries on completion and the ones on groups run and work on your site?

We're wanting to download the Feedback File a tutor provides for a student for each assignment into our central SIS or at least for now just make it available via Configurable reports, but I'm struggling to create a relationship between the tutor's feedback file and the grade item for the student which the file was uploaded for. It's complicated a little by us having multiple tutors within each course with their own private student groups, so not all feedback in a course belongs to one tutor, although I'm hoping there's a way of matching a feedback file against the tutor who uploaded it/graded the student. We have a separate report that lists links to a student's assignment submission (which contains the report file) against the marking tutor, but we need to be bringing the report files into the same report as the grades.

As of today, less than 300 users are running this plugin on 3.11 which is 10% of the user base on Moodle 3.10 with this plugin. To those 300, have you seen any issues or is it working out of the box? To the developers, not sure how often you release new updates or what the timeframe is for the next release, but do you think the current version of Configurable Reports will do fine on 3.11 or should us end users wait for a new release officially supporting 3.11?

SELECT \n```text\n    cat.parent AS topic,\n    cat.name AS topicname,\n    cat.name AS lesson,\n    q.name AS title,\n    format(q.defaultmark,0) AS words,\n    SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(qa.responsesummary, ' -', 1), ' ', -1) as time,\n    SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(qa.responsesummary, ' WPM', 1), ' ', -1) as wpm,\n\tdate(from_unixtime(qa.timemodified)) as date\n    \nFROM prefix_question q \nJOIN prefix_question_attempts qa ON qa.questionid = q.id\nJOIN prefix_question_categories cat ON cat.id = q.category\n\nWHERE cat.contextid=164 and qa.responsesummary <> ''\n```\n I am sure this is something really obvious and simple that I'm overlooking but I've banged my head on my desk so much trying a gazillion different variations of my select statement that I just can't think anymore. So ... how do I get the parent category name to display in the \"topicname\" column?  Any help at all is appreciated ♥",

Actually we insist that the students disconnect \"the right way\" so we do the emargement correctly and they are responding to this demand at a pretty high rate. I don't mind if in rare occasions someone miss it, we can then check manually the logs for the latest action. BUT, if missing logout time can compromise the query (errors), i'll go with your advice for latest action before latest login (latest action time + 30 minutes can be ideal since we have long review activities at the end of the course). For the second point, I actually need the first login and the last logout on course days (lets drop the week criteria, after rethinking it I don't find it very pertinent). I think there is a setting within the plugin to run the query everyday at night, that should be ok. Thanks for your time again, really appreciate it !",

Why there are no built-in (in core functionality) most naturally needed reports (e.g. for all courses for all users, for course statuses and many-many others)? Don't tell about ad-hoc SQL queries - half of them just doesn't work or gives nothing, another half - partially useful for those who wanna teach SQL.

However, I'm trying to now display only the ungraded items for a teacher, where they're in the same course group as the student, but can't work out where to start on this. We use separate groups for each of our courses as we can have a dozen or more teachers per course, each with their own students.  Can anyone give any pointers for this? Many thanks, Paul",

          "Text": "Stephanie \"I temporarily assigned this user the manager role, which is inherently a system role and appears should be able to see the block, but this user still can't see the block.\" Yes, this is so. Did the user in the Manager role actually add the block to their Dashboard ? It will not just show up as it does for the site admin. The user will need to Customize their Dashboard and use Add block to get it to show up. You suspect correctly that basing your role on the non-editing teacher is probably interfering. I find that the cleanest way of doing this is the following: Create a new role called something like Config Report user Rule archetype: None Context type: System Set these three permissions in the section Block: Configurable Reports Add a new configurable reports blockblock/configurable_reports:addinstance = Allow Add a new configurable reports block to MY HOME pageblock/configurable_reports:myaddinstance = Allow View reportsblock/configurable_reports:viewreports = Allow Save it and then add the user to this role in Assign system roles. If you only want the user to be able to add the block to their own Dashboard, and not to courses, then leave out the first permission. If at some point you want all users to run reports, you could add these particular permissions to the Authenticated user role and add the Block to the Default dashboard if you wanted to. But for a limited number of users or for testing things out, I prefer this method as it is safer. You still control which reports show up for whom using the Permissions tab on each specific report (about which, see https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=411546#p1659798 ) Randy",

          "Text": "Hello, I am using Moodle 3.6.10 and am working with Configurable Reports for the first time, having used the Ad-hoc reports previously. I am trying to duplicate the Activity completion report that is run within the context of a course at a global level so I can get Course completion status for all courses for all users. In trying to use a user report to take advantage of the features in the course builder and it looks like the column \"User course completion status\" is the correct one.  However, the report is showing a completion status of \"Not yet started\". I did find a SQL report that does list completion \n```text\nSELECT  c.shortname, u.firstname, u.lastname, \n\n\n DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(p.timecompleted\n\n\n),'%Y-%m-%d')  \n\n\nAS completed\n\n\nFROM prefix_course_completions AS p\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course AS c ON p.course = c.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user AS u ON p.userid = u.id\n\n\nWHERE c.enablecompletion = 1\n\n\nORDER BY u.username\n```\n It does return a list of all users that have a completion time, but not those that have not completed. I have gone into the courses and verified that the Course completion report is showing students as being completed. Is the \"User course completion status\" column not functioning correctly? If I need to use the SQL query, how would I modify the above to show both completed and not completed?",

Does it also set to NULL the previous timeenrolled and timestarted when a new attempt is starting up again? (It should, otherwise your progress stats will be way off.)

Up until recently, the courses with the recompletion condition had a very small training audience, that was easy to find the \"reset\" in the course events logs. Now, that we turned on the recomplete condition for courses with large enrollments, and students with a wide range of start dates, it is a little challenging without a query. So far, I have never needed to ventured into the table data. However, the plugin does have the option to \"Archive completion data.\" I always select the option, so the data row should be preserved in the tables. Additionally, the \"attempts\" can be viewed on the student's quiz history and individual student quiz attempts page, which verifies the attempt is retrained. Also, since we use learning plans and competencies, we are able to view each time the competency is awarded. Your last statement, makes me wonder how the \"Archive\" data is being stored if only one row can be for the same user/course combination?",

          "Text": "Right. Really, for the big picture, it depends on how much you need to save that older completion and other information. Since it is removing a lot of data so the user can retake the course, then as long as you have a copy of that data you need - grades, completion dates, etc. - then you are good. You can extract that in reports. Or maybe you need all the student data via a backup for audit compliance of some sort. Regarding the report, where you can't be sure if a NULL completion means the user is doing the course for the first time or second/subsequent time. One quick and dirty way to work around this would be to show the dates. You could probably figure out from the dates in the timeenrolled and timestarted columns whether this is a current \"re-attempt\" or an old one. So, for instance, if you are doing a re-enrollment once a year for certification type re-compliance, it may be clear the user is re-taking it. Try just adding those dates to the columns and see if that is of any real help. Another avenue to look at is exactly what you say: is the plugin's archive option saving something somewhere that tells you for sure that the user has done the course before? Does it do this each time they redo the course? Does that have date and time stamps? You can try this experiment in a test course: do the re-enrollment with the archive off once and then again with it on for some test users, and then look in the database to see what it does.

The value to put for time and date fields such as current login, last login, etc is the original Unix timestamp. For example, Sep 30, 2020 at midnight is 91715259481 and if you create a condition such as currentlogin > 91715259481 then it will show you only those current logins after that date and time as expected. If you are familiar with Unix time stamps, that will make sense. If not you can use this online tool https://www.timestampconvert.com/ to convert real dates to the magic timestamp you need. And of course, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time will help. I am sure that Juan had planned one day to add some human readable options here, but the basic math seems to work as long as you use the timestamp itself. Try that out for now and see if that works for you. Randy",

I know that this isn't usually the place for IOMAD questions, but it's hard to get answers on the IOMAD github repo, and this is more to do with how we can extend the functionality of the configurable reports block (or work with it's existing functionality) to achieve what we want, rather than a query with IOMAD itself.

Correct me if I'm wrong (I probably am) but your minimal extra code example: JOIN prefix_company_users cu ON cu.userid = u.id WHERE u.id = %%USERID%% ...will always only return the current user, just with extra data from the company users table available to be SELECTed? I changed the WHERE clause to the following: WHERE c.id = (SELECT companyid FROM prefix_company_users WHERE userid = %%USERID%%) ..and that seemed to give me the results I wanted. I'm not convinced that that is the correct way to do things though - I'd rather do it without a subquery as you did. Mark",

All you need to do is make sure in your WHERE clause that all the users in the report belong to in the same company as the user running the report. In fact, if you have turned on the Iomad syncing of company to the standard user profile institution field, you can use that. Actually, I just posted some code on how to do exactly that for someone else a few days ago, here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=410885#p1657522 . That limits the report to showing only users with the same institution as the user running the report. Randy",

And 2) you will need to change those CASE statements into sub-select statements, one per slot, otherwise they end up on separate lines instead of one line. At least, that is how I have gotten it to work for me. Attached is a Config Reports XML file that you can import into your Config Reports in the \"Import report\" area at the bottom of the Manage reports page. After you do that, take a look at the code. You will see that I have changed the slots into subselect statements, one per slot. You can add more slots as you will probably need and obviously edit their names for the columns you need (Nombre de alumno, etc.).  These will show up all on the same line now in the report. Also, you will need to change the course and quiz names in the WHERE statement to what you need. See the attached image of the output, which has one line per each set of responses with all the slots on one line. Let me know if this works for you. I tested this in 3.8 but it should work in 3.9 as well. -- Randy",

I would like a report that shows students' last login to the course - by group and cohort. I would also like a report to list all of the items that need to be graded by the teacher per course and group. Are there zips or xml files that can be installed with these specifications anywhere? Or instructions on how to create such reports Thank you all so much!",

If it gets changed or edited after that for some reason, then the modified date holds that. You can use either one of those dates and add a WHERE clause to check that those dates are within the last seven days. There's a similar snippet of code you can use in this query https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports#Users_loggedin_within_the_last_7_days over in the query repository page.",

So, something like \n```text\nWHERE ue.status = 0\n```\n checks for this. It may be different for different courses, of course. So what your boss thinks is \"an active user\" may vary from course to course. If you mean that a user account as a whole is active or not, that is shown in the mdl_user table in the suspended column, where 1 = true and 0 = false, meaning active. So active users will have a 0 there. \n```text\nWHERE u.suspended = 0\n```\n means all active users, leaving out suspended accounts.",

The issue is that JOIN to the Groups tables is an INNER JOIN, and therefore it excludes any data that in not in those tables. Therefore it leaves out all users who belong to no Group since there will not be an entry for them in the Groups Members table (for that one course, that is.) A LEFT join instead of an INNER is probably the solution here.",

It would have to listen for those user login events that would trigger the email. Then it would have to generate the .csv file and attach it to an email. You don't say who the emails must be sent to, so that needs further clarification too. What log history do you want to include? Moodle logs can get pretty large! So, in addition, it would probably be wise to build in some logic that checks the size of the .csv files and restricts them to some maximum size, to prevent trying to send really large .csv file attachments via email that could \"crash\" your email server or exceed any \"maximum attachment file size\" limitations that your email service may impose. So what you need seems more like a custom plugin. Configurable Reports wasn't really designed to do all that.",

Maybe it was just Monday; whatever the case, I could use a hand with understanding why my LMS goes to a white screen when I attempt to configure  a report. Sometimes it does this even before I click Update or Add, etc. I just choose an option, and bam, white screen of...nada. Here is my workflow for someone to try and repeat: I choose\nto create a new Users Report. I choose 10 for Pagination, the Javascript ordering tick, and export to csv. On the\nnext page, I choose User statistics, then \"logins in the platform\". I\nname the column Col001, then hit Add. White screen of death.

If you recently did an upgrade was the Configurable Report working before the upgrade? Moodle and PHP have debugging options that enable Moodle to display extra information when a problem like this occurs and record the problem details in a log file. When the debugging options are not enabled (they aren't by default) Moodle just displays that \"white screen\" (because it was not able to recover from the error). Have a look at https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Debugging#Enabling_debugging and then enable the Debugging options in Moodle. Then try to reproduce the problem again in Moodle so that details of the problem can be displayed. You should then see an error message in Moodle (or in the PHP log file) when the problem is triggered again. Share those error details here so we can try to decode it. What version of Moodle and PHP are you using?",

You can download the new version (3.8.0) from https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=20829 . It's compatible with Moodle 3.4 onwards (because an issue with 3.3 downwards with the Privacy API has been reported and fixed). That's why the 3.3.0 version has been also released for Moodle 3.3 downwards: https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=20828 It fixes some of the issues you've raised since the last version was published and also includes an improvement: Order the list of users in users filter by fullname considering language - #130 Other fixes and improvements: Fix template array error - #132 Fix DB mismatch between install. xml and upgrade.php - #123 Fix LIMIT error for MSSQL - CONTRIB-7891 Remove \"_\" from the table header titles - #137 Review supported Moodle versions, because the core_userlist_provider interface is only supported from 3.4 onwards - #125 Thanks Daniel Neis (danielneis), Mike McDougal (mcdoogs), Tuan Ngoc Nguyen (tuanngocnguyen), Mike Henry (mhenry79mnet), safatshahinsd, kristian-94 and all the contributors who have sent several fixes and improvements.  Let's continue working on it to make it better day by day (or project week by project week) Kind regard and all the best for 2020 :-*",

Fields returned are: As our modules are split in to multiple moodle courses, each person has multiple rows with a different module name and the percentage attended next to it. How would i then be able to take that result set and return a total attendance for each student\nusing an average of their module attendance percentages? something like: I understand i should probably be using a subquery but i'm a bit stumped as this would be my first jump in to that level of sql .

The Moodle and the PHP versions are both 3.4, the Moodle database is MariaDB and the operating system of the Moodle server is linux (CentOS).

If there is no prefix on the tables then the config.php setting should say something like $CFG->prefix = ''; and so the variable in the code for this should basically be empty. The code for this in CR which handles the prefix_ in the query and replaces it with the actual one on the site is: \n```text\n$\nsql\n = preg_replace('/\\bprefix_(?=\\w+)/i', $CFG->prefix, $\nsql\n);\n```\n So, it replaces prefix_ with what the prefix setting has. If your Moodle instance is working with an empty prefix already, then CR should work too.",

I've managed to create someting which looks like this (see below), but there is 1 issue: ROWS DUPLICATE (attachment), and with having many students attending many courses at the same time, this becomes really problematic.

When the data in this field is exported to a report it is labelled module name:  E.g. SCM01 Course Dedication Time.   However, I cannot find any field in the database schema which is labelled 'Course Dedication Time' can someone please provide me with an answer of where this data is stored, in what data table it can be found and how it is calculated. If I can find the answer to the above questions I can then extract the data I need via the MySQL configurable reports block Many thanks in advance. Kind regards Mark Jones",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm using moodle 3.6.3 and configurable reports latest version as well. We use SCORM based courses (each has a minimum of 5 modules) and with the help of this plugin i created a custom sql reports showing (name, course name, module name, progress percentage, time spent, last access date..) along with filters, however when trying to retrieve large number of rows for all users for example, the browser takes a lot of time and even crashes sometimes. My question: is there that we can use the filter fields as a first step and once clicking apply depending on the fields of course a report would be previewed instead of showing all the values of the query and then filter? meaning choosing the filter criteria before showing the report table not vice versa or maybe choosing default values so that onload the report would show according to the default values. If not, then can i detect that the rows or the report is too huge to be previewed so only leave the download report button and give a message like (report too big to be previewed please download to view) so i can download and check the values without previewing the report onscreen since its either taking a longgg time or crashing? I know i can always divide the report into several reports but imagine 5000 users that means the number of rows would be a lot greater than 5000, dividing the report into 10 or 20 reports isn't practical at all. Thanks in advance for your help. Regards,",

You just have to replace your shortname profile field and the title you want in your table, you chose the shortname while you created it. Here is how i get a custom profile field : SELECT u.firstname as 'firstname', u.lastname as 'lastname', (SELECT UID.data FROM prefix_user_info_field UIF, prefix_user_info_data UID WHERE UID.fieldid = UIF.id AND UIF.shortname = ' shortname ' AND UID.userid = u.id) as ' Special profile field ', FROM prefix_user u Hope it helps",

If you search the contributed reports page https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports you will see many examples that look like this: \n```text\nWHERE c.id=16\n```\n which means restrict the results to the course with id number 16. You can also use the course shortname or fullname here too, but since the course id never changes, it is the most reliable way.  Some examples there use a placeholder like \n```text\nWHERE c.id=##\n```\n which means the query is made for you to put in the course id for the course you want on your site.

          "Text": "Forum Members, a very good morning to you, My colleague and I are working in Moodle v3.5 soon to be v3.6. We have to create multiple courses and digital content ahead of the NHS Patient Electronic Health Record software deployment project; which is scheduled for delivery in autumn of this year going live.   The impacted audience size is a little over 7,000 staff members across multiple hospitals sites in the UK Kent region, and the training team is tasked with delivering the training strategy and all subsequent reporting. We have created 10 courses, where each course has a module of eLearning in SCORM 1.2, a Confidence Report Choice Activity (Pre and Post Course), PDF Activities and other references materials, including processes and workflow maps which define patient pathways and treatment plans as links to reference materials. The problem we are experiencing is, when running reports, our exported data is not giving us all of the information we so desperately need.    We can produce multiple reports that have the data which, is stored in different parts of the LMS database and we have made arrangements so that we can connect our Excel App to the ODBC LMS Databases on the server directly.  However, when connecting to the database and having access to all of the tables, we struggle to source the information and data we need, to create the desired report. Therefore, we are calling upon the good will of the Moodle community and those who wish to receive and take credit for helping us in our plight, to assist us in creating a Single SQL report which collates the data from all courses and user profiles in addition to data from the Category, Course and Learner reports.    If it pulled just one record we could figure the rest out for ourselves but we really are struggling as none of us are SQL coders. Your reward for helping us, would be recognition both locally and nationally across the UK NHS Trust community via all social media outlets promoting your professional services, helping you to generate future business. I know this is somewhat of an unorthodox request but we have exhausted all avenues available to us and only have until the 16th April to get the matter resolved before it starts to impact the projects delivery data as all Ward Managers and Team Leaders are going to need this reporting to track and follow their staff progress. My sincerest thanks in advance for any contribution you can make.

I'd like to be able to collect the feedback from one student, across multiple feedback sections , and show it all at once. It seems like the Configurable Reports plugin can probably do this, but I can't see an obvious way from within the existing available selection options. Which leads me to believe it would require some SQL knowledge to extract this information, and unfortunately I'm not a SQL person. It seems like it probably needs something like \"Select all feedback values from all modules for a given course (I only have one) for user ID FOO\" But I'm not sure how to structure that query.

If you have a bunch of courses you need this in, you could create a bulk upload for group creation (not population) and that makes the group creation super fast (I used to have 12 groups I used and I just dropped in the group upload when I first created the course, if I wasn't copying it--it takes about 15 seconds once you have your file created).",

Juan, the developer, now heads up the Moodle Mobile team at the Moodle office in Spain and it seems he doesn't have time to update the plugin... You can get the latest official version from https://moodle.org/plugins/block_configurable_reports . Download the .zip file from there and then extract it to the Moodle folder on your server . Some people say it still works - but with some issues. It depends on what functionality you are using... If you have any major problems with it, try the forks that have been released by other developers who depend on Configurable Reports but couldn't wait two years and five Moodle versions for an official release. Example: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-block_configurablereports . Look in the Moodle Tracker for issues relating to reporting in Moodle and you'll find issues like: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-63233 https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-62080 Read the comments in those MDL issues for interesting suggestions. If you don't want to rely on hacky fixes to unmaintained plugins then consider joining the Moodle Users Association ( MUA ) and vote for the Customizable Report Builder proposal. If you can't afford the risks of using an unsupported version of Configurable Reports and you can't wait for any unconfirmed solutions from the MUA then try the Ad-Hoc Database Queries (custom sql ) plugin from the Open University. It does roughly the same thing as Configurable Reports (lets you run your own sql queries) and has been around for a long time.",

Moodle (HQ) asks more and more from plugin developers (tests, compatibility with new version, GDPR , mobile...), and Moodle HQ employees should be the most informed people, and giving exemple. And at least, as you wrote, give an answer! I find nothing more frustrating than knowing someone is connected on Moodle, certainly knows the problem, but gives no answer at all. Reading the Plugin adoption program , and knowing that no answer as been given, even at private message on Moodle, i think this plugin could be considered as abandonned.

I'm sure this could be done using a custom SQL approach, however, I'm not sure how to do this. Such as what do I need to access in order to report on the SCORM variables? You can access these directly if you enter the SCORM course / REPORTS / Interactions Report, however, I want to add these into a custom report that I can allow users of specific permissions to access. I'm looking for a report that basically includes: FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME |SCORM COMPLETION | INTERACTION RESPONSE Is this possible?",

The error console reports the following errors (same message x 3): \n```text\nFailed to load resource: the \nserver\n responded with a status of 404 (not found)\n```\n The faulty links appear to be: \n```text\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/styles.php/adaptable/blocks/configurable_reports/js/datatables/media/css/jquery.dataTables.css\n\n\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/styles.php/adaptable/blocks/configurable_reports/js/codemirror/addon/display/fullscreen.css\n\n\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/styles.php/adaptable/blocks/configurable_reports/js/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css\n```\n Looking in the page source for the included stylesheets I found this one: \n```text\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/\ncss\n\" href=\"\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/styles.php/adaptable/1493297224/all\n\" />\n```\n Then I opened the \"all\" stylesheet in a new tab and found these import clauses: \n```text\n@import url(../blocks/configurable_reports/js/datatables/media/css/jquery.dataTables.css);\n\n\n@import url(../blocks/configurable_reports/js/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css);\n\n\n@import url(../blocks/configurable_reports/js/codemirror/addon/display/fullscreen.css);\n```\n (that is, the same faulty links in the error console, mentioned above). Further tests: uninstall and reinstall Configurable Reports: the errors persisted. change theme: I purged the theme cache, then deactivated Adaptable and activated the Clean theme: the errors persisted, only replacing the word \"adaptable\" with \"clean\". change browser: the same errors were shown in Chrome, Firefox , Opera and Safari. created the folders \n```text\nhttp://mymoodle.mysite.com/theme/adaptable/blocks/configurable_reports/js/\n```\n and loaded the missing stylesheets in the appropriate subfolders: the errors persisted. Hence I conclude it is not a browser-related issue, neither a theme-related one. My question is - how to fix the problem? I would like to see the report as it was designed by its author and then possibly customize it to the look and feel of the entire site. Thank you.",

Whilst it may be OK in your experience now on 3.3, that will not necessarily be the case for 3.4, 3.5 etc. and if the plugin is falling out of support, then one has to consider support implications one takes upon themselves for contracts that are being signed for two, three or even five years hence.",

You can see from the threads that issues vary with others folks using 3.0.x-3.3.x  with spurious results. I believe most of their issues is with their specific configurations which we cannot account for here. I have a pretty generic build with mostly CORE plugins. I think that Configurable reports officially breaks with v 3.4.x. I'm going to test this and see what are the specific API calls involved which are no longer backwards compatible. Cheers, Scott",

          "Text": "Hi all.  I'm using meta course enrolments for many courses and I want to report on these.  The very excellent progress report from the ad-hoc contributed reports does a great job of showing progress in all courses by user, but if that user is enrolled in a course via a meta course, they are not included in the report. I've spent some time playing with the report and trying to work out why it only shows manual enrolments, but I have to admit defeat.  I'm just not familiar enough with the Moodle schema to work it out. I'm hoping someone can look at the query and pinpoint where it excludes meta-course enrolments.  If that can be done then hopefully a tiny change to the report will be all that is needed.

Looking at some sample data, I see that when a user is complete, i.e. a time is set in course_completion.timecompleted, then the course_completion.timeenrolled is also set to 0. So, if you add the timecompleted column to your query that correlation should show up. That may explain the data in your query, since it is showing only timeenrolled. But, also, I see other instances where this is not so and all three completed times, enrolled, started, completed are filled in. I am not sure why.  There is a complex relation of the user enrollment times and the course completion times and I don't understand it completely yet. Cron is part of the equation, for sure though. And there is clearly at least one condition under which the timeenrolled is not set to 0 when the user completion time is  stamped.",

Everything but the 1969 is as I expected it to be posted.

I've seen any number of instances where different processes do not agree how to handle data for similar or closely related processes, one process using nulls, another whitespace, another 0. So an inconsistency like this would be par for the course. Enrolment times and start of completion times don't match up. The code probably holds the answer, and/or it's a bug.",

But, from my list of students: Hopkins is an active student and sometimes instructor. Sherwood, long time student, very limited activity in the LMS Lynch is an active student and sometimes instructor. Richardson, long time student, very limited activity in the LMS Dilucchio, long time student, very limited activity in the LMS Wolski, brand new student and this is the first course he was enrolled in. I know this is a small sample of students, but from this course I do not see anything that jumps out at me in regards to trends. I do see this issue with other courses on our LMS as well as two other LMS's that we maintain for our company. In one LMS we have had 7,857 enrollments. Of that number from 2011-2017, we had 7,550 enrollments and 307 enrollments from 1969. I haven't looked at each student and course to gather more info as to what kind of enrollment, whether they were brand new students or not, etc. I guess that is my next step in trying to figure this out.",

          "Text": "Right, I see similar inconsistent dating in a live site that is four years old. It is all over the map. Looking at the code, in /completion/completion_completion.php I see logic in the function mark_enrolled() that says, if the time enrolled is NULL, set it to the current time (lines 96-107 in v. 3.1) but then when it actually saves it, is has logic that says if it is NULL then set it to 0 (lines 177 - 200). I see both of those sorts of times in my live user data. Then in completion/cron.php it also has some complex logic for how to figure out the enrollment start time based on possible multiple enrollment plugins that may have the user start date in more than one place (lines 126-176).  But in the middle it calls mark_enrolled() without an parameter at all so that seems odd. That code seems to be the only place it is set. It's pretty obscure to me how it works. But clearly sometimes it sets the earliest enrolment date, sometimes the current time, sometimes it sets 0. And some methods, like Cohorts, don't put proper start times anyway. But I see widely varying data with simple manual enrollments in my data too. Something is not right in that code, but I am not sure exactly how it does what it does.",

BIG_SELECTS is one and there's one for maximum joins too.  I would guess that here it is the number of wheres it the issue but perhaps one of those would solve the issue. A possible workaround is to recast those joins as sub-select statements instead. I think that might work better, since it might handle the memory for those subselects differently than having a large main query.",

Structure is like: \n```text\nSELECT u.username\n\n,(SELECT d1.data FROM prefix_user_info_data d1\n JOIN prefix_user_info_field f1 ON d1.fieldid = f1.id AND f1.shortname = 'favcolor'\n WHERE d1.userid = u.id\n) AS thefavcolor\n\n\n,(SELECT d1.data FROM prefix_user_info_data d1\n JOIN prefix_user_info_field f1 ON d1.fieldid = f1.id AND f1.shortname = 'musical'\n WHERE d1.userid = u.id\n) AS themusical\n```\n Repeat as needed for each profile shortname. Then \n```text\nFROM prefix_user u\n```\n Put as many as you want there. It reduces the WHERE and JOINS to one at a time. That should do it. Let me know if that works for you. If so, I will update that wiki page with this as an alternate code for large numbers of fields. Randy",

In most cases, a 500 Internal Server Error is due to an incorrect permission on one or more files or folders. In most of those cases, an incorrect permission on a PHP and CGI script is to blame. These should usually be set at 0775 (-rwxr-xr-x). A PHP Timeout. If your script connects to external resources and those resources timeout, an HTTP 500 error can occur. Timeout rules, or better error handling in your script, should help if this is the cause of the 500 error. A Coding Error in .htaccess. While not as common, be sure to check that your site's .htaccess file is properly structured. If you're running WordPress , Joomla , or another content management or CMS system, be sure to search their support centers for more specific help troubleshooting a 500 Internal Server Error. If you're not using an off-the-shelf content management tool, your web hosting provider , like InMotion , Dreamhost , Bluehost , 1&1 , etc., probably has some 500 Error help that might be more specific to your situation.",

I can get it working with a SEARCHTEXT filter, but I need to use the User Field dropdown.

If not, you can skip the custom view and just use or add the filter directly to the custom profile fields from the original user table.

I need volunteers for testing the block before release a first version in the plugins database . This block is a Moodle custom reports builder. It is designed in a modular way to allow developers to create new plugins in less than an hour. What type of reports can I create? - Courses reports, with information regarding courses. - Users reports, with information regarding users and their activity in a course. - Custom SQL Reports, custom SQL queries. This block can use the same SQL queries that Tim Hunt's Custom SQL queries plugin. Note for developers: You can create your own type of reports. Who can view the reports? When you create a report you can select which users can view it. Links to reports are displayed in a block in the course or site frontpage.

This is a great tool with tons of possibility and the addition of the user profile fields to the filter function will take a huge step forward for me. I know there is an ongoing issue with being able to update your contribution via CVS so maybe you are waiting that. I don't mean to rush you, just wanted to check and see how things are going with this addition. Jason",

For people who are looking to add or need Custom Filters in their reports you will have to write PHP code and write your own filter. So there is no easy workaround. I have managed to add a custom filter but had to edit a couple of files in order to get it working. My custom filter was a 'userid' filter as I needed user specific data. Great Module I must say.

Lo ideal supongo que sería hacerlo en una consulta SQL pero me estoy volviendo loco con las tablas de grade y no sé cómo sacar esto, ¿alguna idea? Otra cosa, si un módulo tiene distintos tests ¿es posible sacar la información de cada uno? In english. Does anyone know how can I make a report in which one column is the time spent to make a test? Any SQL query? Concretly, the time spent in the test which has the highest qualification. If a module has different tests included, is it possible to extract the information for each one? Gracias / Thanks!",

When i' am using the Detailed ACTIONs for each MODULE query out of the ad-hoc contributed reports for Example. I set the x-axis to the module, the line series to the actions and the count to the y-axis. I want to have a graph to show wich action is done how often in which module. As result i get a blank graph, even the axis are only counting from 0-1(y axis) and 0-4(x axis). So it is not only he dosen't print the graph. It seems to me he don't calculate how much the scale has to be too. Does anyone have similar experience with the line graph? By the way the pie chart works fine so it is not a Problem with printing at all. May be something in the calculation of the line chart itself? As suggestion to enhance the plugin i would like to have more plots like a bar chart and so on and make them more customizalbe. Regards",

          "Text": "Hi all. I've installed this on 1.9 but not really had a chance to try it (until now) but my sql knowledge is from 20+ years ago and isn't up to much so need some help. We have roughly 50 students enrolled across 6 courses. I have been asked to produce (by Monday !) a report on each student showing what resources they have looked at (number of times and dates) for each course. Each student is enrolled on 3 courses. The standard Moodle activity report for a course is not bad but the only way I seem to be able to use this is to grab a screenshot and then convert it to a pdf. When doing so the results are very small and hard to read. The other issue is that for each of their assignments (we don't use gradebook as our criteria are HND pass/merit/distinction) I set up a forum with posts of useful info for them to read. The Moodle activity report just says they haven't made any posts (and I'm not expecting them to) but doesn't say which posts they have looked at. My question is, will this plug-in allow me to create the required report and show all the relevant info .... and if so, how ? (help !) Many thanks Kevin",

But I'd like to add custom filters of the colums I'm showing on the report. Also, if possible, not to show a dropdown on the filter but a textbox instead. I'm asking you this because I need to place the block on the front page and make full site reports. Using the premade user reports don't work for me because it takes more time to load and it doens't show the info I need. For example, I need an Academic Performance report where you can search for a particular student by his/her ID number or, by his/her institution, course, etc; and by merging two reports I take about a minute to load that report and still don't have all the filters I need to set. That's why I need to set my own filters. Greetings from Venezuela!",

It does not seem to work(it returns a \"0\" when trying to calculate a column. When setting up SQL reports, most of the add-hoc SQL code provided does not work ( \"Query Fails\" when trying to save). Is there something I need to change in general for them to work? I was very interested to get the grade related reports working. We are using Moodle (currently 1.9.12) to anable an entire corporation to take eLearning. Has anyone been able to setup permission for these reports in such a way that managers can see their own progress as well of their employees under them?

Me encuentro un problema: Al hacer el tutorial llego a un punto en que me da este error: I'm testing Configurable Reports and seems just what I've been looking for, but I'm having an issue doing the tutorial. I get this error <code> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 100663296 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 82 bytes) in /usr/local/moodle/moodle_test/lib/dmllib.php on line 728 Fatal error: Class 'ADODB_Session' not found in Unknown on line 0 </code> If I simplify the demands for the report, it gets done. I'm testing this module on a real course, 20 students, 4 months long. It seems strange that requesting \"apparently\" so little memory I get this error. Does it ring a bell? Thanks a lot Luis Bou",

I wanted to create a reporting feature which lets different users at different levels to view advanced reports (high level, overview level, individual)down their hierarchy. The report data would be based on organization hierarchy i.e. say a manager can view a department report, within a dept he can select any of the sections , within a section, he can select any area and eventually any individual within that area. Do you think your module is editable/modifiable to achieve this or does this require building a whole new module from scratch.

If its possible, could you maybe just try n outline the important steps that should be kept in mind in order to build this plugin? (Maybe you can email me a rough outline on ivnvai@yahoo.co.uk pls.)

          "Text": "Hi Juan, Yesterday I upgraded from moodle 5.2.1 to 5.2.3 and re-activated configurable_report again. I noticed that in debugging mode a message appears in every course frontpage with a visible configurable_reports block: Warning: First parameter must either be an object or the name of an existing class in /var/www/moodle/blocks/configurable_reports/block_configurable_reports.php on line 124 It only appears at the frontpage of those courses but when I move to the block to work with it (building reports, view them,...) the message goes away. I also noticed that cron stops when executing the configurable_report task reporting this error message: \n```text\nStarting blocks\nProcessing cron function for configurable_reports....... started 12:58:55. Current memory use 47.9MB.\n!!! La tabla \"blocks\"no existe !!!\n!! \nError code: ddltablenotexist !!\n!!

To pull a second field, use JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ab ON u.ID = ab.userid AND ab.fieldid=5 And again, ab.data will contain the information.

I am trying to create a configurable report that simply replicates the\nCourse Completion report (found in the Course Completion block) for a single\ncourse, but with the addition of some custom user profile fields.  So the columns would be: idnumber firstname lastname profile_field_employmenttype (Custom user profile field) department profile_field_dept (Custom user profile field) profile_field_subsection (Custom user profile field) profile_field_section (Custom user profile\nfield) profile_field_directorate (Custom user profile\nfield) Course completion date Course completion status The SQL I currently have seems to be pulling the right kind of info but\nthere are issues... 1) The report is returning course completions for all courses across\nthe site.  How can I restrict this so the\nreport only returns course completions for one course? (the course where I add\nthe configurable report block) 2) The report is returning 896 records which is not the full number\nrecords I am expecting, 3) I'm getting a lot of duplicated records in the report, by up to 4\ntimes. Here's my current code: SELECT  u.idnumber AS 'ID' ,\nu.firstname AS 'First' , u.lastname AS 'Last', \naa.data AS 'Employment Type', ab.data AS 'Department', ac.data AS\n'Dept', ad.data AS 'Sub Section', ae.data AS 'Section', af.data AS\n'Directorate', ag.data AS 'Area', CASE WHEN gi.itemtype = 'course' THEN CONCAT(c.fullname, ' -\nTotal') ELSE gi.itemname END AS 'Item Name', ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2) AS Grade, FROM_UNIXTIME(gg.timemodified) AS TIME FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS aa ON u.ID = aa.userid AND aa.fieldid=1 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ab ON u.ID = ab.userid AND ab.fieldid=2 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ac ON u.ID = ac.userid AND ac.fieldid=3 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ad ON u.ID = ad.userid AND ad.fieldid=4 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ae ON u.ID = ae.userid AND ae.fieldid=5 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS af ON u.ID = af.userid AND af.fieldid=6 JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS ag ON u.ID = ag.userid AND ag.fieldid=7 JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id AND\ngg.finalgrade>10 and gg.finalgrade<100 JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid JOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE  gi.courseid = c.id ORDER BY Last Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If you still end up with duplicates, which is possible, dry using a SELECT DISTINCT instead of SELECT. Hope this helps. Cheers Peter",

Creating a new report with almost no data comes up the same. Already-created reports ARE viewable but some of their editing pages are blank now, too. It is inconsistent. Is my server just full of data or is something up with the installation? How do I tell?",

I think this is the download from facetoface that provides sessions information.  Configurable reports cannot change this report. As for the underlying question, which is can this report be changed in facetoface...if you dig into the underlying code, you can probably modify what user data shows on the download.  Just by using the module, probably not.  Can you use a CSV to 'create' registrations and sessions?  Sessions, maybe (but it is a lot less work to just build them), but certainly not sessions for several different activities in different courses.  Registrations/bookings, highly unlikely. Look at the table structure for f2f.  It would take longer to fiddle with the csv than to just sign the people up.  This should really be in the F2F forum...but you already posted the same question there, I think, in December (twice).  And another one in the Scheduler forum in January.",

I want to provide a \"special\" user in a course the ability to run ad-hoc reports queries. Therefore I need the ad-hoc queries to dynamically use information from the \"special\" user's profile (i.e. their institution). For example, the ad-hoc report I want to create would let the special user see all students from their institution in a course (and their respective grade). Problem is, unless I hard code the institution it doesn't seem to dynamically assign based on the special user logged in. \n```text\nSELECT u.firstname AS 'Name' , u.lastname AS 'Surname', c.fullname AS 'Course'\n\n\nFROM prefix_course AS c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user AS u\n\n\nWHERE u.institution='%%USERID%%'\n\n\nORDER BY `Name` ASC\n```\n The above query, when run by the \"special\" user will not show any report results. If I hard-code an institution value, then I get users from that institution; but I want it to be dynamic since I have special users from multiple institutions. I'm sure what I'm failing to do is fairly simple, but it's been a while since I've written in MySQL (and I do realize the above query would not give me grades, I'm just trying to get it to pull the correct users first).",

          "Text": "Roshan, Are you doing this in Configurable Reports block? If so, you can use the Start and End time filter to do this if you need to pick the dates. There are two steps: 1) Add the filter placeholders to your SQL code. See this query for an example: https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports#SCORM_Usage_by_Course_Start_Date , where you'll see near the end: \n```text\nWHERE\n1\n \n%%FILTER_STARTTIME:c.startdate:>%%\n%%FILTER_ENDTIME:c.startdate:<%%\n```\n You should replace c.startdate in that example to the column in your own query that holds the date time you want.  Since you're using the log table in your query, put whatever column in the log the timestamp is in. (Aside: the WHERE 1 (or as some do it WHERE 1=1) statement is a peculiarity of the filters in Config reports: if you don't have a WHERE statement in your query already, then you must add this dummy WHERE to keep the statement valid.) Save that code. Then: 2) In the Filters tab for the Report, add the \"Start / End date filter\" to your filter list. When you run the report, it will now show you two pull downs that you can pick for start and end dates for the query. This is a good solution for an interactive picking of dates. If you have fixed dates that won't change, then as Stuart mentioned, you could use a BETWEEN operator on the dates, or math on the dates, or any number of date functions in a WHERE clause.",

Your solution with the IN statement doesn't work completely because when you have more than one custom profile field, while your query joins those to the user id properly, it does not distinctly join the profile field and its data. The solution is in the link above where you will see there's a separate JOIN and table alias for each field you want with an AND restriction by the profile field shortname. Randy",

          "Text": "Hello, Using Moodle 2.9, I've created a course which is made out of multiple topics. Once in every couple topics I give the participants a short, consistent Moodle Questionnaire that looks something like this: I want to track the average response to each question across the course. I've started with the first question, and was able to produce the following report (Sorry about the Hebrew): The survey column contains the name of the questionnaire (formatted lie this: \"feedback for section [section number] - [topic]\"). The module column contains the section number, that I extract using some very ugly SQL from the name of the questionnaire. The Average column contains the average response for the first question (how much did you enjoy this learning unit) in this instance of the questionnaire. I want to generate a chart, plotting the average result over time (or, more accurately, over the progress across the different modules). So, I tried adding a Line Graph using the Plot - Graphs section, choosing \"module\" as the X Axis, and \"average\" as the Y Axis, and got this: There are multiple problems here: Obviously the chart area is too small (the point are painted in the correct height, but are out of the grid) The points are distributed equally across the X axis, despite the fact that the rapid feedback questionnaires aren't placed regularly, and the values in the \"module\" column reflect that (please refer to the screenshot of the query result for clarification) Is there anything I can do to fix these issues, or is my only option exporting to Excel and generating a Scatter Chart there? Thanks!",

I want to try and plot the graph myself using javascript (by turning the html table generated by the report into a 2d array and painting the graph manually on a canvas). Problem is - I can't find a place to input my javascript code - the \"report description\" (which allows displaying notes above the report) doesn't support js scripts, unlike any other field in Moodle where you are allowed to enter html directly (it also doesn't allow attachment of files, for that matter). Another solution would be to embed the report page in a separate site via iframe, and run the javascript on that site, but Moodle doesn't allow iframe embedding for a security reason (it can be turned off, but that is strongly advised against). Any suggestions? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Currently, your report shows the grade each student received to any \"grade item\" they attempted to complete. Grade items are anything in the Moodle which can assign a user a grade, most notably, quizzes (exams), and assignments. Your report shows you the results of both quizzes and assignment, currently - which makes displaying the relevant dates a bit tricky: Assignments have three defined dates: 'Allow submissions from' date - before this date the assignment will be unavailable to students 'Due' date - after this date passes, any submissions made to this assignment are considered \"late\" 'Cut-off' date - After this date the assignment will be unavailable to students My guess is, for assignments, you'll be interested in the due date. Now - for quizzes, you have just two dates to worry about: 'open the quiz' date and 'close the quiz' date, which determine the time period in which the students will be able to attempt the quiz. Because of this difference, the dates for a grade item aren't stored in the prefix_grade_items table, but rather separately in the prefix_assign and prefix_quiz tables. Now - to your question, my suggestion is: SELECT CONCAT(u.lastname , ' ' , u.firstname) 'DisplayName', u.idnumber AS 'sztsz', u.address AS 'cim', u.institution AS 'osztaly', u.department AS 'beosztas', u.email, u.lastip AS 'IP cim', cc.name AS 'Kategoria', c.fullname AS 'Kurzus', CASE WHEN qz.timeclose>assignment.duedate THEN FROM_UNIXTIME(qz.timeclose) ELSE FROM_UNIXTIME(assignment.duedate) END AS 'Date', CASE WHEN gi.itemtype = 'Course' THEN c.fullname + ' Course Total' ELSE gi.itemname END AS 'Vizsga', ROUND(gg.rawgrademax,0) AS elerheto, ROUND(gg.finalgrade,0) AS elert, ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) AS szazalek, IF (ROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) > 79,'Sikeres' , 'Sikertelen') AS Eredmeny FROM prefix_course AS c JOIN prefix_context AS ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments AS ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades AS gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items AS gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid LEFT JOIN prefix_quiz AS qz ON qz.id=gi.iteminstance LEFT JOIN prefix_assign AS assignment ON assignment.id=gi.iteminstance JOIN prefix_course_categories AS cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemname != 'Attendance' AND c.id =  %%COURSEID%% ORDER BY 'Name' ASC This should add a \"date\" column to your report, which shows the close date for the grade item if it is a quiz, and the due date for the item if it is an assignment. You will occasionally see the date 1.1.1970 - this signifies that no date was set for that activity. You might also see on some occasions that the date field is empty, this means that that row contains a grade for a grade item that isn't a quiz, nor an assignment. I might have completely misunderstood you - maybe you meant you want the completion date for the quiz and the submission date for assignments, rather than the closing and due date respectively. Let me know if this is the case, or better yet, try adjusting the query yourself - you may find this helpful: http://www.examulator.com/er/ Good luck!",

The main issue I have is that despite the fact that I feel I am a pretty capable Moodle administrator, I don't feel I have the knowledge of the database tables in Moodle for which I might be able to write custom SQL . That being said, I'd like to request your advice (and possibly hire you) on designing a very special configurable report. I'm working on a virtual exchange project connecting students in Japan with students in other countries. We use Moodle Forum for online discussions. The students and teachers from these countries are grouped in 20~40 student groups for any given forum in the course -- currently, there are 5 forums. There are hundreds of threads and discussions happening at any given time because this project has over 1000 students enrolled and continues to grow. What we are looking for is a way for instructors to get an overview report for a group of students including statistics like: For each forum for each student: number of initiated discussions (originated posts?) number of replies to all posts in the forum total word count per reply last access date/time to the forum",

All this could be done though in basic reports that could be emailed out. A lot depends on who you think would be seeing these reports and how often they need them. Getting the data is not so hard, so if you are flexible with being able to download some of that into spreadsheets instead of online then getting all the info is doable.",

Could you please elaborate a bit on your post ? \"However, I found a nice workaround - under the\n\\blocks\\configurable_reports\\components\\filters directory is the code\nfor each filter. If you make a copy of the filter, rename the directory\nand rename the class in line 31 and the element in line 37, you can\ncreate as many filters as you like. (I have about 5 filters which\nspecifically search for different fields)\" I'm using Moodle 2.6 and unsure about the following:- which filter to copy - user or users? the changes you mention in lines 31 & 37 refer to what file exactly? - I had a look in the file (plug.class.php in user folder, but see the attached lines (screenshot attached) Any help would be greatly appreciated!

          "Text": "Hi, I am attempting to find out our Student to Tutor Ratio, based on logins over time. To achieve this I have borrowed mysql from the ad-hoc contributed reports . The code I borrowed was this, but made some small adjustments: Log Activity Reports Detailed \"VIEW\" ACTION for each ROLE (TEACHER,NONE-EDITING TEACHER and STUDENT) \n```text\nSELECT l.action, COUNT( l.userid ) AS counter , r.name\nFROM `prefix_log` AS l\nJOIN `prefix_role_assignments` AS ra ON l.userid = ra.userid\nJOIN `prefix_role` AS r ON ra.roleid = r.id\nWHERE (ra.roleid IN (3,4,5)) AND (l.action LIKE '%view%' )\nGROUP BY roleid,l.action\nORDER BY r.name,counter DESC\n```\n My Aim is to find out each roles Logins over a date range. By comparing the tutor roles with student roles and calculating a ratio based on logins. I altered the code to this, which provides the data I need (See the parts in bold for updated commands) : \n```text\nSELECT l.action, COUNT( l.userid ) AS counter , r.name, \nl.time\n\n\nFROM `prefix_log` AS l\n```\n This outputs the below table: ############## action counter name login 2916 Manager login 1419 Non-editing teacher login 11758 Teacher ############ I then use Excel to total the login counter for all tutor roles, in this case it's: 16,093 Logins since the unix timestamp (date) specified: 2016-03-01 00:00:00 I then compare this with another report, containing student roleids. This gives me student and tutor logins over the same time period and then I product a ratio of Student to Tutors in Excel. The Student to Tutor Ratio for my example then calculates as: 7.18:1 Now What I actually want is to have a date range, so I can input From Date to a To Date . I have attempted to modify the my sql several times to get a date range. I have used many different techniques and I'm really struggling to get the output I desire. Can someone see how I might achieve this? , i.e. Adding a date range and providing the Date From, Date To in the table output of columns. As soon as I can do this I have a fantastic metric for showing if we have the right number of tutors for our many thousands of students. Many Thanks for ANY assistance Steve - SHEilds Ltd",

Now, after being dreadfully discouraging, I'll ask.  What specifically are you looking to get out of scorm data?  Or do you just want a grade (that's possible and probably easy).",

          "Text": "Diego, Right, because Moodle does not go back and create rows for the data for already existing users when you create a new custom field. So there's no entry to return data from until the user adds something. (On the other hand, if you add a new user, they do get any entry in the table for already defined and existing custom profile fields, and the data there is empty. That's the behavior in 3.1 anyway.) This is a job for an OUTER JOIN. Use outer join in the query to include all users even if they have no data in those fields. Here's the most basic way to do that: ﻿ SELECT u.username, uif.shortname, uid.data FROM prefix_user u LEFT OUTER JOIN prefix_user_info_data AS uid ON uid.userid = u.id LEFT OUTER JOIN prefix_user_info_field AS uif ON uid.fieldid = uif.id ORDER BY u.username This gives you the basics of what you seem to be looking for (see attachment).

Since you have manually set the View Reports permission for Students and Teachers (as seen in the third screenshot), maybe try changing the permission in the permissions tab (second screenshot) from 'Anyone' to 'Report Capabilities'? It should have the same effect in this case. If that doesn't work, could you specify exactly how you test whether or not the report is accessible? For me the feature (permission: 'Anyone') works as expected on Moodle 2.9, but I've only tested that by changing my role temporarily to student using ' switch role to... '",

Is this can be done? One more issue As Adele indicated, by login as a student I am able to view the report which is configured by adding the report block at individual course level. But I am unable to view the same report from other courses even when I set Display on page types to Any course Page Or Any Page in the Configuring a Configurable Reports section, below is the screenshot. To view the report from other courses, do we need to add the report block and create the report to each course multiple times? Thanks, Varma",

Since this is the case, your problem probably has nothing to do with permissions - permissions are related to user roles, and user roles only exist in relation to courses - that is, no user is defined in the Moodle universally as a student. Rather, users are defined as users, and they are connected to courses through roles (student, manager, teacher, etc.). Anyway! try this: As admin, go to your Moodle dashboard, navigate your way through: Administration>Site administration>Appearance>Default Dashboard page You'll see a page that looks just like your dashboard, only with some blocks (including the configurable reports block) missing. Click on the \"blocks editing on\" (top right of the page), and scroll down to the \"Add a Block\" form. Add the configurable reports block and position it according to your preferences. That's it! should work. Have a great day, -Yaniv",

Thanks to Adele, I think you may have another solution, or at the very least another thing to check - as an admin, you can access the block and the reports within, right? how about you access one of the reports, and copy the url (directly from the url bar). It should look something like this: http://yourmoodlesite.org.il/blocks/configurable_reports/viewreport.php?id=reportid&courseid=1 (the &courseid=1 is unnecessary I think). Now, try navigating to this url while logged in as a non-admin user, and see if there is any error message or something like that. If so, please post said error, maybe it will tell us something about the problem. Otherwise, you could try, instead of embedding the configurable reports block directly in the dashboard, embed an html block or something like that, and in that block include links to the relevant reports. Not nearly as elegant, but hopefully functional for your situation. But please, make all these checks after you make sure to click the 'Reset Dashboard for all users' as mentioned in the previous post. Otherwise, the changes in the dashboard will only affect new users (by the way, another good check - if you create a brand-new non-admin user, can you use it to access the reports?) -Yaniv",

However, you want to know which students don't have a BADGE, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled in a course, so checking course completions isn't going to give you the information you want. You should be looking at the info in the mdl_badge_issued and mdl_badge tables. Presumably, any mdl_user.id who does not have a record in the mdl_badge_issued table should show in your report. So you could do something like: \n```text\nSELECT id, firstname, lastname\n\n\nFROM mdl_user\n\n\nWHERE mdl_user.id NOT IN (SELECT userid FROM mdl_badge_issued)\n```\n And maybe include the mdl_badge_issued.dateexpire column in the WHERE clause to give you just the badges that have not expired.",

When I make a new Report of Type SQL,  I get an odd looking page which will not show or let me edit the actual SQL (pics attached in both Clean and Standard themes). It looks like the editing box is not loading ? On already existing reports that I had put in last week, I also can not see the SQL code at all on this page. I just get a blank line number. However if I run the report, it works properly. (Same as screenshot 2 attached.) I am using Firefox 24.0 on Mac, Moodle 2.6. build 20131118. No messages at all from Dev level Debugging on. This is a definitely a new behavior in this build different from the last build I tested a few days ago.",

Anyway, unchecking the above setting has allowed us to enter SQL into the editor when editing an existing report. This is great! However, there are three fairly big issues that are standing in our way at the moment: 1) Whilst we are able to update the SQL code in an existing report, we are unable to change the name of an existing report. When we enter a new name on editreport.php, and click 'Add', we get this error message: This page should automatically redirect. If nothing is happening please use the continue link below. Error output, so disabling automatic redirect. 2) We are also not able to Add new reports. When we click on Add report, then enter the details for the new report on editreport.php, we receive this error: This page should automatically redirect. If nothing is happening please use the continue link below. Error output, so disabling automatic redirect. 3) For existing reports, on viewreport.php , the page displays all of the SQL code above the actual report. This looks quite messy and I'm not sure how to remove it. Thanks again for this great block. Look forward to hearing from you.",

          "Text": "Hi Juan, Thanks for your reply. That is all fixed now and working great! I was wondering if you might be able to advise us on a few things: 1) My developer has created a a couple of new columns in the groups table in Moodle (region and network) and we are now embedding those fields into our SQL report. But we are not able to use the Filter fields to filter these custom columns. Would you be able to point us in the right direction to be able to add these filters as drop-down menus at the top of the report, like the existing filter options appear? 2) I'm having an issue with setting up a template for an SQL report. I can put plain text in the Header, Record template and Footer. But as soon as I try to insert a table into the Record template section, I get the attached error regarding permissions. I tried adapting your sample on the plugin page, and incorporated the 'Available marks' listed for my report,  but didn't have any luck. Here's the HTML code from my Record template section: <table style=\"width: 100%;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td> network </td> <td> <h2> region </h2> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The file editcomp.php currently has 644 permissions and I tried changing it to 777 temporarily, but even this did not help. So I'm unable to edit the template in any useful way to present the data. 3) In the footer, I see your sample has '##graphs##' and this works fine. But I am wondering if it is possible to separate the graphs one by one, so that I can insert a title for each graph into the template? I hope you might be able to shed some light on these issues for us",

(I had about 5 reports previously duplicated across 15 courses, with more requests coming all the time). I have a couple of issues. I have a report set to run via the CRON, and the settings set to run at 5am each day. However, when I run the report, it runs the queriy new. (I know because it takes a few minutes to run). Unfortunately the documentation on using the CRON reports is not done - so is there a trick to setting it up? When Java script ordering is on, it appears to put a second heading column over the first one, which is a different size. (As per the below image) Any ideas on these two? CheersPeter",

The output report is expected to have the following fields : |firstname|surname|quizname|grade|sumitted|graded| The fields submitted and graded can either have the date of submission or grade or be empty I started with the following code SELECT u.firstname AS 'Name' , u.lastname AS 'Surname', q.name as 'quizname', qg.grade AS 'grade', DATE_FORMAT( FROM_UNIXTIME( qa.timefinish ) , '%d-%m-%Y' ) AS submitted, DATE_FORMAT( FROM_UNIXTIME( qg.timemodified ) , '%d-%m-%Y' ) AS graded FROM prefix_quiz_grades AS qg JOIN prefix_user AS u ON qg.userid=u.id JOIN prefix_quiz AS q ON q.id= qg.quiz JOIN prefix_quiz_attempts AS qa ON qa.attempt=1 WHERE q.course=14 the main issue here is the submit date. I want to fetch only the latest submitted attempt. currently I have mentioned attempt number but that's not how it should work. I will need to sort the data as well per user. Please help and guide. Thanks, Sumanta",

If a plugin is in the official Moodle plugins database then it has been run against various coding tests and should work for a given version of Moodle - there is no guarantee it will work for the next version of Moodle or if it will be maintained in the future or even it won't conflict with another 3rd party plugin you may have installed. It would be highly unlikely any plugin was \"tested in hospitals\" specifically unless it was written by someone working for a hospital. Re RTL and QA, you really should set up a test server and as part of your workflow, test any and all updates/new plugins on the test server prior to implementing on your live server. Probably not the answer you want ... but it's reality. Regards H",

Just one quick question. I have custom profile fields that I would like to show - line manager for example,  within the report. I think I add the code u.xxxxxx where xxxxx is the profile field name but can you maybe offer me a pointer on this? Also, is it then possible to add a filter on this? Can you add multiple filters on the user field filter? Seems like you can only add the one as once you add the username option, it doesn't allow you any extras? I could switch the username one to the line manager field I guess, but would be nice to have multiple user based filters Again, thanks so much for this. Great help Darren",

If you just return the raw integer (uid.date) does it have any negatives in it? I think that is a custom field as well so I'd suspect that it isn't going in properly. For the times being returned you probably wouldn't change those here. It will be in the timezone settings for the server. Now it could be a couple. Could be the MYSQL or possibly the PHP timezone setting. Google for how to change both of them to oz.",

The short version of my question is, Can I use Configurable Reports to delete automated backup files after I have identified them?

And I’ll ask forgiveness ahead of time, as well, for what may be a poorly worded post (I am not a sysadmin or anything close to that, but I do most of our Moodle administration). The longer version: I would like to delete the automated course backups from our Moodle installation. After installing the Configurable Reports block I’ve identified almost 48 GB of these automated backup files. I’ve been working in our test server (Moodle 2.9.2+ Build: 20151014) - a clone of our production server) and have done the following:",

If it were me, I would leave the files there, if they are not causing any issues for you. There is no telling what type of issues you might create deleting files you do not really know (all) the purposes for. You wrote, The report returned 47.5625 ( space taken by backup files\nin GB, right?) I will also guess that is MB not GB, in my opinion........ 48 MB is not a huge amount of space on a server. I do database related work all the time. I would not think a report is going to have delete rights to the database files. A report generally would only have read rights. If you really want to see the actual file sizes, have the database admin give you read only access to the actual database and write a query to bring the file data you want back, then you can really see file size and etc..... If I mis-understand your reasoning.........just ignore. haha",

          "Text": "﻿ Rick, Thanks for the rapid response. I’m wanting to remove them for a couple of reasons. I would like to start directing the backups to a location outside of Moodle, but I would like to try to “reset” the pickup process, if possible. We have a few hundred courses that are not being backed up correctly - “Error”, “Unfinished”, or “Automated backup pending”. Or, even if I am not given a new directory location, I’d still like to restart the backup process. I know that the automated course backups are not the thing for disaster recovery, but they seem convenient for the scenario where a teacher has a problem that can only be solved by turning the dial back on her course to the previous day. I have tried backing up some of the affected courses manually, through the Administration block backup option - with debugging turned on - and get the following (on all courses I've tried, not just the problem ones), but I believe that I’ve read that this is not a problem (although it does have the word, “warning”) The backup file was successfully created. Technical information and warnings setting controller status to 700 saving controller to db calculating controller checksum 9a81a46157dab1d2605466f56e7d923e loading controller from db setting controller status to 800 setting controller status to 1000 saving controller to db I think the 47.5625 is GB. We have over 3000 courses and the report script includes 1024*1024*1024. I thought the same as you about a report - that it would only “report”, not make changes/deletions - even with the report listed on the Ad-hoc Contributed Reports page as “Delete all the automated backup files”. But I am noticing something. As I visit courses and click on \"Restore\" in the course admin settings,  there is no longer an Automatic Backups section at the bottom of the page. This has been true for every course I’ve examined - but only 6 or so at this point. There is no discernible change, however, in the size of the /filedir directory. Maybe this is one of those one- or four-day processes and Moodle will clean the files out over time? I did disable automatic backups so that new backups would not be created, but I don’t think that would eliminate the Automated backups section in individual courses. Thanks, again for the reply!

I see it much like the Course Completion Report, only that it would gather all Course Completion Dates from courses site-wide for a specific Group from a pull-down menu at the top of the page. Does the fact that it exists in a Metacourse mean anything to the reporting function? Can I set up an independent, site-wide report that can be accessed (with permissions) by others? And keep in mind, courses have already started for the year so I don't want anything that will damage the integrity of the existing data. Any help of direction would be appreciated. Thank you!",

Also, is it possible to report on documents posted to the forum? Thanks! Erin Moodle 2.7.3",

I'll explain you my case: - I created special roles to allow certain users to view certain blocks (these roles are valid in system and in blocks) - the users are added in the roles as soon as they register in the platform - users are not added automatically in cohorts.

Send him the error message and ask him to higher the maximum filesize you can upload. It is not related to configurable reports. Try uploading a file into your private folder of Moodle, which is at least the same size as the zip. It will fail too. Alternatively, if you have access to the server, you can unpack the zip file and place the folder \"configurable_reports\" directly in the \"blocks\" folder. Good luck! Michael",

Ideally I'd like the report to generate a file (e.g. XLS) and then send it to a specified email address (ideally configurable but I could hard code it too). The other option is to generate the file (again, XLS) onto some known location on disk and the client can organise a ftp pickup or whatever. This doesn't look to be a feature either.",

          "Text": "Hi all, During these last days I've been thinking about the future of the plugin. As you may know, Moodle 2.8 will come with a new report builder based on Totara Report Builder. (See https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-30193 for more info) When the news came out my first thought was to discontinue/deprecate the plugin and create a final version including a tool for migrating reports to the new system. The last comments in the previous tracker link has raise some new points to consider: - The new report builder will NOT support SQL reports - There is a lot of people using Configurable Reports (CR) with lots of reports created/contributed - It seems that the new report builder tool will not suit all the user needs in its first version Also, my personal and professional position has changed. Until now, I was able to \"maintain\" the plugin thanks to projects in my former employee and spending some spare/free time but now I don't have time for that. I was toying with the idea of starting a crowd-funding project to guarantee the maintenance of the plugin during the following year, including upgrades to Moodle 2.8, Moodle 2.9 and bug fixes. I was thinking rewards like fixing bugs pointed out by the contributors. The estimate for a complete year maintenance project is around 3000€ ($3800 approx.) What do you think? would you be willing to fund it?",

I think the whole area of logs and reporting is not yet right, but maybe it will get better over the next few releases. If enough people feel that CF is able to offer something valuable, and it can do things better or different to the basic functionality of the in-built report builder, then HRDNZ might consider sponsoring the ongoing development of this - as long as we can clearly show our sponsorship.

I'd agree with what Stuart said: it will cover what most people ask for in reports and do a fine job, even if not all the advanced features it has will make it to core at first. It's already a rich and mature tool. Clearly people who are now using CR for the user/course/category type reports will be able to replicate those in the new Report builder, if not right away, then eventually by rebuilding them. I think a bridge converter from CR to Report builder\nwould be very useful thing , but those who do have a lot\nof standard reports now in CR should raise their voices to be heard on\nthis issue if they want to continue CR for a while until they can\nconvert over. Since the OU Ad-Hoc plugin handles only SQL and already has good scheduling abilities, it can continue to fill in that gap which the Report builder will not have. Though I work a lot in CR, I happily use AD when I need the scheduling and email notices.  Almost all my client reporting work, though, is with direct SQL, not the standard type reports. So, although I really enjoy CR and have promoted it whenever I can, if it was discontinued, AD would continue to serve most of my SQL reporting needs.  (I suspect I am not in the majority situation though.)

Overall, the ability to control access to the reports by role (beyond just the single \"Report user\" role that grants access to all reports) is critical. CR provides some interesting ways for users to build reports using a form-based interface, but we don't use that as much, and I suppose the solution that will eventually be included in Core may take over that functionality. CR provides its own display block, but that's probably not critical, since everyone gets the Administration block in some form or another. The other feature I appreciate in CR is the ability to import contributed reports from a repository. If we were going to make Ad-Hoc Reporting a more general-purpose tool, this could be a helpful addition.",

At the moment, we regularly run the following query (from http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=205564 ) which tells us which courses have quizzes and how many submissions there have been in each, but we'd like a better picture of the types of questions that are being used in each quiz. \n```text\nSELECT prefix_course.id id, prefix_course.shortname shortname, prefix_course.fullname fullname, prefix_quiz.name quizname, Count(prefix_quiz_attempts.attempt) attempts\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_course prefix_course, prefix_quiz prefix_quiz, prefix_quiz_attempts prefix_quiz_attempts\n\n\n\nWHERE prefix_course.id = prefix_quiz.course AND prefix_quiz.id = prefix_quiz_attempts.quiz\n\n\n\nGROUP BY prefix_course.id, prefix_quiz.name, prefix_course.shortname, prefix_course.fullname ORDER BY id DESC\n```\n It would be great if an SQL guru could extend this query to provide the extra information about question types. Hopefully, it will be useful to someone else too.",

In and of itself it won't provide the complete picture but we were hoping that it would give us a better idea of the spread of question types being used. We'd like to be able to identify courses which make heavy use of particular question types so we can use those teachers as mentors for others, say, or proactively identify quizzes that might cause performance concerns if delivered summatively as an online 'exam', say.  So, a little uncertainty in the actual numbers is OK. Good point about random questions though.  I have no doubt that some of our quizzes use them, resulting in different attempts in those quizzes having differing numbers of particular question types, so, for each quiz in each course, rather than counting just the number of questions of each type in the quiz, if it's possible to count the number of attempts of each question type, as well as the number of quiz attempts per se (because there will be some questions that won't be attempted), that would give us a more detailed picture. Any advice you, and others, could give about constructing these queries to help us paint a better 'big' picture would be gratefully received!",

          "Text": "I can't help thinking that it would be worth your (or one of your colleague's) while to learn some basic SQL, so you can explore the data yourself. It's not that hard if you have that sort of mind. There are various SQL tutorials online, but I don't know which one I would recommend. Anyway, here are some queries you can try. Note that they are all untested. However they are right in spirit, so should only require minor changes to fix if they fail. Number of questions of each type in each quiz (if you are using Moodle <= 2.6) \n```text\nSELECT c.id, c.shortname, c.fullname, quiz.name AS quizname, q.qtype AS question_type, Count(1) AS num_questions\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_course                  c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz                    quiz ON quiz.course = c.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz_question_instances qqi  ON qqi.quiz    = quiz.id\nJOIN prefix_question                q    ON q.id        = qqi.question\n\nGROUP BY c.id, quiz.name, c.shortname, c.fullname, q.qtype\nORDER BY c.id, quiz.name, Count(1) DESC\n```\n The same, if you are using Moodle 2.7+ \n```text\nSELECT c.id, c.shortname, c.fullname, quiz.name AS quizname, q.qtype AS question_type, Count(1) AS num_questions\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_course     c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz       quiz ON quiz.course = c.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz_slots qs   ON qs.quizid   = quiz.id\nJOIN prefix_question   q    ON q.id        = qs.questionid\n\nGROUP BY c.id, quiz.name, c.shortname, c.fullname, q.qtype\nORDER BY c.id, quiz.name, Count(1) DESC\n```\n This is the questions used in the quiz definition, so you will see 'random' in the results. If you want totals for the whole course (not split into quizzes) it would look like: \n```text\nSELECT c.id, c.shortname, c.fullname, q.qtype AS question_type, Count(1) AS num_questions\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_course     c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz       quiz ON quiz.course = c.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz_slots qs   ON qs.quizid   = quiz.id\nJOIN prefix_question   q    ON q.id        = qs.questionid\n\nGROUP BY c.id, c.shortname, c.fullname, q.qtype\nORDER BY c.id, Count(1) DESC\n```\n (I have only given the 2.7+ version of the query. If you need a 2.6 version, you will have to work it out yourself.) If you want to do it by actual questions attempted instead (so random does onto show up) then it would look like: \n```text\nSELECT c.id, c.shortname, c.fullname, quiz.name AS quizname, q.qtype AS question_type, Count(1) AS num_attempts_at_question_of_this_type\n\n\n\nFROM prefix_course            c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz              quiz  ON quiz.course        = c.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_quiz_attempts     quiza ON qs.quizid          = quiz.id\nJOIN prefix_question_attempts qa    ON qa.questionusageid = quiza.uniqueid\nJOIN prefix_question          q     ON q.id               = qa.questionid\n\nGROUP BY c.id, quiz.name, c.shortname, c.fullname, q.qtype\nORDER BY c.id, quiz.name, Count(1) DESC\n```\n There is a third possibility, which is to count the questions in the question bank, but this is probably lease useful (since people may have imported banks of questions, and then only used a few). Also, it is slightly tricky, so I won't try to give it now.",

Here's the SQL I'm using: \n```text\nSELECT u.firstname, u.lastname, c.shortname, \n\n\nDATE_FORMAT(DATE(FROM_UNIXTIME(ue.timestart)), '%d/%m/%Y') start_date,\n\n\nSEC_TO_TIME(SUM( TIME_TO_SEC( t.value ) ) ) total_time,\n\n\nROUND(gg.finalgrade / gg.rawgrademax * 100 ,2) AS final_grade\n\n\nFROM prefix_course c\n\n\nJOIN prefix_context ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_role_assignments ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = ra.userid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_grade_grades gg ON gg.userid = u.id\n\n\nJOIN prefix_grade_items gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid\n\n\nJOIN prefix_course_categories cc ON cc.id = c.category\n```\n My question is, is it possible to extract / calculate the percentage of the course that's been completed for each user? I've been looking around the query examples and the database schema but I'm a bit lost... if anyone can help me and point me in the right direction it'll be greatly appreciated! Many thanks Dave",

Ideally, the line should be DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(prefix_grade_grades.timemodified), '%e %M %Y') However, it appears that this is always blank. Is there a reason you include AND (prefix_grade_grades.timecreated IS NULL) Another thought, do your courses have completion tracking set? If so, you can pick up the time the courses are complete with the following: In the select statement DATE_FORMAT(FROM_UNIXTIME(cc.timecompleted), '%e %M %Y') AS 'Date Completed', Then in your your from component, use INNER JOIN prefix_course_completions as cc ON prefix_course.ID = cc.course Hope this helps.

We are seeing issues with time tracking on all configurable reports in our various Moodle courses. There are many users who have 0 as their recorded time spent, although they have received certificates in the course and completed all modules. I have a report that I can share with you that shows several examples of this.  The report also has a separate sheet where I've pulled all the users with 0 time showing incorrectly on the report. Looking at the code from the configurable_reports block (/public_html/moodle/blocks/configurable_reports/components/columns/userstats/plugin.class.php), it looks like it should be summing the time differences between consecutive records for a user in the mdl_log table and excluding any that exceed 30 minutes. I've simulated that logic in the attached \"Moodle Log Times\" spreadsheet with data for userID 201 and course 38 (CA: Pre-K -> Contra Costa). It seems like it should be showing 2.8 hours of time for the user, but instead it is showing 0. You can see the database query I used in the second worksheet of that spreadsheet. From just inspecting the code, I can't see why it would be returning 0 for this user, so perhaps this is a bug?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Morgan",

I've been trying to modify it to include a date column but that's not been going so well, and I'm not exactly well-versed in SQL. And I should mention that I'm running SQL 2008 rather than MySQL. What I have right now is: SELECT u.firstname AS 'Firstname', u.lastname AS 'Lastname', u.firstname + ' ' + u.lastname AS 'Display Name', c.shortname AS Course, cc.name AS 'Category', ROUND( gg.finalgrade, 0 ) AS 'Final grade' FROM prefix_course c JOIN prefix_context ctx ON c.id = ctx.instanceid JOIN prefix_role_assignments ra ON ra.contextid = ctx.id JOIN prefix_user u ON u.id = ra.userid JOIN prefix_grade_grades gg ON gg.userid = u.id JOIN prefix_grade_items gi ON gi.id = gg.itemid JOIN prefix_course_categories cc ON cc.id = c.category WHERE gi.courseid = c.id AND gi.itemtype = 'course' ANd u.deleted = 0 ORDER BY lastname ASC, Course ASC What I would love to get is a date column on the report showing the date of course completion as mm/dd/yyyy. I've tried a number of different snippets of code from other reports but they all seem to generate errors such as: ROUND(gg.finalgrade,2) AS Grade, DATEADD(ss,gi.timemodified,'1970-01-01') AS Time I tried that with and without the ROUND statement since the aforementioned code already had it in there. I've also experimented with the CONVERT() function with no success either. Any ideas??? Thanks!!!!",

The other courses should be simply providing the enrollment information that syncs to the main course. You don't normally enroll users in the main meta course directly: that's what the children are for. (That's the basic scenario; there are variations.) So, running the report should do just that: give you completion for that main, meta course. So it is working properly. So if you enroled everyone in the meta course but not in any of the 20 child courses, then there was no point in making it a meta course because it has its own enrolments directly and not via synching from the child courses. You are not going to get an activity completion report in one course to know about anything in other courses. You'd have to do a custom report in something like Configurable reports to do that.",

I've installed 2.6 for Moodle 2.4+ (2014020700) of this plugin and still seem to have issues when we allow report/customsql:view to another role. A similar issue was mentioned earlier ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=177111#p867509 ). The only way we can get another role to access the Custom SQL reports is by allowing the report/customsql:view capability in Authenticated user role. Then other roles can also access the reports (Custom SQL report link is added to under Site Administration in the Administration block). However, the undesirable effect of this is that everyone gets access to this. When this capability is removed from Authenticated user, then nobody can access the report, even though it is allowed in other roles. Accessing via direct URL gives a \"You do not have permission error\". Is it possible to have the Custom SQL reports accessible only to teachers in courses? This would be super useful. Does the current plugin allow for this? I couldn't get it to work. I played with the code (view.php) a bit and checked for course context instead of system context. This allowed a teacher to access the report via direct URL. Is code changes the only option? I would be grateful for any advice to guide me on the next step. Thanks, ...RT",

The main difference with the contributed one is that it start with role_assignments, not user_enrollments.  The reason is that user_enrollments doesn't have the actual role.  It has a like to an enrol record for the plugin instance which shows the current default role, but that could have changed, or could be overridden depending on the plugin. Caveat: it's certainly possible that I don't fully understand the structure of some of these tables.  In particular if a student was enrolled in a via more than one enrollment plugin, with overlapping dates, it probably double counts that student. We use the enrol_apply plugin for enrollment, and it seems to work fine with that. Anyone is welcome to use these: Total students in a course (uses role assignments, not the user enrollments table, so I think it's more accurate) select count(ra.userid) as \"Total Students\", c.fullname as \"Course Name\" from role_assignments ra, prefix_context ctx, prefix_course c where ra.contextid = ctx.id and ctx.contextlevel = 50 and c.id = ctx.instanceid and ra.roleid = 5 and c.visible=1 group by ctx.id Current students in a course (links back to the user_enrollment, which as far as I can see is the only place with the date range for the enrollment): select count(ra.userid) as \"Current Students\", c.fullname as \"Course Name\" from role_assignments ra, prefix_context ctx, prefix_course c, prefix_enrol e, prefix_user_enrolments ue where ra.contextid = ctx.id and ctx.contextlevel = 50 and c.id = ctx.instanceid and ra.roleid = 5 Feel free to give any comments, suggestions, or if it doesn't work properly with your configuration I will try to improve or fix it.",

          "Text": "At first glance, it seems that the inner joins are building the desired result table but the Left join is stacking two separate tables into the result table that is not related to the previous joins. For e.g. student john smith has a record in the enrolments table, match his record in the enrol table based on the enrolments table, then match his course he's taking in the enrolments table to the courses in the courses table,) this is where I believe the query breaks down -> then match anyone with a last access to  anyone that has a userid limiting the result set to the where clause. To prove the thought remove the where clause and you may have duplicate entries for everybody who has a userid and last access. As Tim mentioned you may be able to union the two queries or what I have found success in is creating views. Create a view of all users enrolled in the SCORM courses then run a query against the view limiting to the date ranges you have specified.  There is also the approach of creating a temporary table to hold the result set from the inner joins and then running a second query all in the same script that filters the table by date. Hope that helps. Phil Templeton",

In case this helps, my intent is to list all users that have been enrolled into a course but within a given timeframe, have not logged into the system, accessed the course or, finally, have not completed the SCORM activity in the course. So the logic I am looking for is: If the user has not logged in within 60 days - display name If logged in but has not accessed the course within 60 days - display name If logged in and has accessed the course but has not completed the course activity- display name Query A does list all users that started the activity but have not completed within 60 days. Query B does list all users that have not logged in or accessed the course within 60 days or at least it appears that way.  The problem with Query A was that it also lists users that started the SCORM activity but are no longer enrolled in the course. Query C did correct the problem with Query A and did exclude those users that did not complete and were unenrolled.",

The issue is that the original activities have quite long names, and the text doesn't wrap so we get overly wide columns when the actual content in the middle is very small. (See image).

Comprendo que es realmente moodle el que almacena la información, pero me preguntaba si alguna vez alguien se hubiera encontrado con este problema antes y si puede ser debido a algún tipo de filtro, proxy o similar. El único dato que no se almacena correctamente es el tiempo de conexión. Muchas gracias por todo y un saludo.",

Currently the STUDENT ACTIVITY LOG only records \"start times\" when they click on that lesson (even if they don't watch the video immediately).  We need to calculate \"end times\" when they click on the next lesson, time out, or log out. [1] The REPORT must list the calculated time spent in the course (the State of Texas requires minimum contact hours). Subsequent client requests (separate topics?) include: [2] auto-generated \"Pass/Fail\" for each lesson based on whether the student's calculated time is < or is >= to instructor-set minimum time for that lesson. [3] Ideally the report could GENERATE AUTOMATICALLY and be EMAILED TO THE INSTRUCTOR when the student clicks \"SUBMIT\" on a \"course completion form\" we've placed as the final section of the navigation tree. I am attaching a PDF of what I think the report might look like (created in Excel), providing the instructor with a complete summary of a student's course participation. [4] There is also a State of TX requirement that the student's IDENTITY be periodically verified by correctly entering the same answer to a randomly-pulled PROFILE QUESTION as they had entered during the registration process.  The REPORT would need to access that \"pass/fail\" table as well. I have two subcontractors collaborating on this solution and awaiting your insights.  Thank you.",

Each lesson but the first one contains a dependency from previous lesson based on elapsed time in minutes. 2. Defined a summary query on the table 'prefix_lesson_timer'. As far as understood (unfort did not found documentation) the 'prefix_lesson_timer' is used to track the time spent in lessons in order to check the time constraint (1) and it may contain multiple records for lesson/user. My query (I'm using configurable report to run sql queries) looks like: \n```text\nselect \n     c.id as courseid,\n     t.lessonid, \n     t.userid,\n     u.username as UserName,\n     c.shortname as CourseName,\n     l.name as LessonName, \n     sum(((t.lessontime-t.starttime)/60)) as SpentTime \nfrom \n     prefix_course c, \n     prefix_lesson l, \n     prefix_user u, \n     prefix_lesson_timer t\nwhere\n     t.lessonid = l.id and\n     t.userid = u.id and\n     l.course = c.id \ngroup by userid, courseid, lessonid\n```\n Ciao Massimo",

If a column has a name ending in 'date' and contains integer values, then they will be assumed to be unix timestamps, and formatted as dates. If a query placeholder has a name ending in 'date', then users will be give a date-time selector to input the value of that parameter. Thanks to Mahmoud Kassaei of the Open University, UK. Laura McLeod (OU) also deserves thanks for incredibly patient testing, and finding lots of things that Mahmoud and I missed during development. Ability to change the limit on the number of rows returned. We still won't let you increase beyond hard limit of REPORT_CUSTOM SQL _MAX_RECORDS = 5000 (unless you edit the code) but you can now make a query to return the top 10 of something. Thanks to Troy Williams or The University of Waikato, NZ. If the report you are trying to create returns an error, then the full database error is displayed on the editing form. Thanks to Tim Hunt, the Open University, UK. This should work with all versions of Moodle 2.2 -> 2.5. As ever, let us know if you encounter any problems.",

I am predominantly working in SQL queries - I find I can get exactly what I am looking for there. I have used the templates for some reports - they are handy for being able to format the report a bit easier. However, I have some larger reports that the Java Sorting is fairly cruicial on, so therefore cannot use the template. When I print the report, it has no heading on it, so there is no identification as to what report it is. Is there a simple way to put the title of the report at the top of the report when it is printed? Cheers Peter",

          "Title": "Configurable Reports in French + other features",
          "Text": "Hi Juan, First, thank you for Configurable Reports! It's an essential tool for anyone tailoring Moodle for a particular situation. Configurable Reports as it stood did not completely fill our needs so I modified the code. We would like to share these features with the community. If you believe any of these changes could be useful to other users I'd be very happy to assist in integrating them to the plugin's main branch! Here is the patch in diff format: http://pastebin.com/csgh3fQk If I can share this in any other form which would be more pratical to you, don't hesitate to say so. We've added the following features: We had Configurable Reports translated to French! I modified the User Field filter so that it may be used in custom SQL reports. I would particularly appreciate your review of that change. I added a User Field Search Box filter which behaves similarly to the User Field filter, except that the value is entered in a text field instead of being chosen from a select box. We built that to search for a particular user by username in a database bound to eventually contain thousands of users. I modified viewreport.php so that redirection does not happen after output has started. In custom SQL reports, I added support for a %%WWWROOT%% keyword, which is subsituted for $CFG-> wwwroot . In custom SQL reports also, I added string replacements on SQL queries so that \"?\" does not break the query (necessary to allow for hyperlinks as column values). I modified the button label that applies a filter to a report to \"Apply\" and the first option for the selection menu to \"All\". These may be somewhat debatable changes but we found more natural to \"apply\" a filter to a report since \"add\" sounds like we are adding data. Similarly, choosing the first option in a filter's select box displays all data, so we preferred \"all\". The following changes are nitpicking application of some good practices I thought relevant: Defining SomeClass::__construct() and SomeClass::SomeClass() issues notices. I removed all SomeClass::SomeClass() constructors. Some StdClass objects were used without declaration, which issues notices. I added declarations when appropriate. I removed ?> from the end of all PHP files so that response headers aren't sent when they aren't supposed to.

I need this report (desperately!) as coursewise reports are cumbersome to take out, and an overall progress report is needed.. Something like: Course 1         Course 2    C3   C4    Total Student1         70                  50           60     40    220 Student 2         90                    0          80    20     190 I have made a report using the sitewide code in the configurable report plug in, and have got a listing of the course totals in the first column, and can also restrict the users to a particular category, but am unable to put the various courses across the columns. I could export this to excel, but would prefer to have a single report here itself, without any external processing. i am not well versed with SQL or PHP and am struggling to get this report up...any ideas or help would be highly appreciated!! regards",

One thing we found was that when we exported a report to an XLS file, cells that we thought should have been formatted as numbers in Excel, were treated as text instead. To fix this issue, we made one small change to the /configurable_reports/export/xls/export.php file around line 60, changing the line from: $myxls->write_string($ri,$ci,$cv); to: $myxls->write($ri,$ci,$cv); This allows the Moodle library's Worksheet class to determine the data type itself. I don't know if this change causes other problems or not, but thought I'd pass it on in case others were having this problem, and also to see if you'd like to change this code in the master version of this block.",

Since students don't truly \"log in\" to a course, they only login to the entire Moodle system, I need to write a SQL query that will approximate the \"course logins\" for me. One approach that comes to mind would be to count the number of times a student has entered a course starting from a page not within that same course. In other words, when a student views a main course page by navigating from a different course or from the MyMoodle page. I can count the number of times a student has viewed a main course page by writing something like SELECT COUNT(log.id) AS 'Session Count', c.fullname AS 'Course', u.lastname AS 'User' FROM prefix_log AS log JOIN prefix_course AS c ON c.id=log.course JOIN prefix_enrol AS e ON e.courseid=c.id JOIN prefix_user_enrolments AS ue ON ue.enrolid=e.id JOIN prefix_user AS u ON u.id=ue.userid WHERE log.action='view' AND log.module='course' AND log.userid=u.id GROUP BY u.lastname but that includes all the times a student has returned to the main course page from an activity in the same course.

I understand this plugin has a downloadable version and a version in the Moodle CVS repository, but not git. I have successfully checked out the configruable_reports plugin (not the whole contrib section) and can update it to the MOODLE_23_STABLE tag using the command  cvs update -dP -r MOODLE_23_STABLE.  Using cvs status to check tells me that everything is up to date using that tag.  However, the version.php file lists an old version 2007101509, and as such moodle is complaining when I try to update plugins... keeps telling me a new version is available.  If I download the plugin manually, the version.php file is indeed different-- on the updated version. Is the version.php file missing the MOODLE_23_STABLE tag in the CVS repository? The age of the file in the ViewCVS is 17 months.  Is CVS being updated at all anymore?  I can't find a git repository link. I would rather not download and install plugins by hand-- 100% git would be the goal, but I am currently stuck managing 3 different repository systems. Thanks in advance.",

I noticed there was nothing in the \"rawgrade\" column of the table for uploaded grades... they only appeared in the \"finalgrade.\"  When I changed the grading method, it seemed to remove anything that was in final grade and replace it with whatever was in rawgrade. Maybe gg.rawgrade > 0 is keeping your uploaded grades from showing, as an uploaded grade of \"100\" would show \"0\" in gg.rawgrade, but \"100\" in gg.finalgrade -Mark",

I hope anyone can help me. I'd like to get an overview of which users and/or how many users started a scorm training for the first time ever per month. I guess the querie needs to filter the minimum/lowest date for the scorm launch activity before choosing a specified month, but I'm getting stuck with even setting up that bit of code. I think the display should include the course name, Activity name and the amount of the first time ever launches by the users.

          "Text": "Here's how we do something similar. I'm using Windows with IIS and MySQL database . The default prefix we use is \"mdl_\". 1. On the server should be a folder \"C:\\Program Files\\My SQL \\MySQL Server 5.5\\bin\" 2. Take the SQL commands you have written and copy-and-paste them to a text file in this folder called 'XPORT.SQL' (make sure to change \"prefix_\" to \"mdl_\" in the file) 3. Create a batch file in that folder called 'XPORT.BAT' with the following command: mysql.exe -- host =HOSTNAME --user=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --database=moodle19 < XPORT.SQL > OUTPUT.DAT Where: HOSTNAME is the servername (or could be 'localhost') USERNAME is the name of the user of the database PASSWORD is the password of the above-named user moodle19 is the name of the database (yours could be different) XPORT.SQL is the file you created above with your SQL commands OUTPUT.DAT is the TAB-DELIMITED file to be created (it will still open in Excel) 4. Execute XPORT.BAT at the command line. This will create OUTPUT.DAT 5. Once you have the OUTPUT.DAT created you can create an FTP command file. It will have the commands needed to send the file to the recipient. You only need to create this file once. It should look something like this: OPEN ftp.whatever.com USER username PASS password HASH BINARY SEND OUTPUT.DAT (other commands necessary) CLOSE BYE Where: OPEN <site> - makes the connection to the recipients server USER <username> - the username they probably gave you to login PASS <password> - the password for the account HASH - will show \"#\" characters as each block is sent (this line is optional) BINARY - indicates to the recipients FTP server that the file you are sending is binary SEND <filename> - this command tells the receiving FTP server that you are sending a file (use GET if this is a file you are getting from them) CLOSE - disconnectes from the remote server BYE - quits the local FTP program 6. You then execute this file by using the following command at the command line: FTP -S:XPORT.TXT This can be added to the end of the XPORT.BAT file, if you like. I'm unsure of your general skill level so if you have problems with any of this, let me know.",

Currently (under Moodle 1.9) we use a custom script to generate a report as shown below: This allows us to view each category of courses and monitor student use in each individual course over a 10-day period. As we move to Moodle 2.2, this script will unfortunately have to be retired, and so we're looking for alternative reporting tools. Consequently, my question is: can Configurable Reports generate something similar and, if so, how? I've experimented quickly and the nearest I can get is a course report with the following columns: c1 - course field; fullname c2 - no. of users with role...; student c3 - course stats; active (last week) enrolments c4 - no. of users with role...; teacher This is similar to what we need, but not really accurate in terms of column 3, since it includes *all* enrolled users - both students and teachers - and, additionally, we really do need the names of the course tutors listed in column 4.

So I'm going to change from a block to this new type of plugin - I'm cleaning and refactoring some parts of the code in order to follow the Moodle codelines style guide. My objective is a 100% compliant code - There is a big issue that prevents this plugin to work with Oracle , it will be solved - I'm adding new types of columns and reports (cohorts, rubrics) - Moodle 2.3 will include (hopefully) support for multi-tenancy (multi sites), so I wan be sure that this plugin will be able to work cross-site for building reports with aggregated data I will commit in my github account the new development version in a few days",

I am not sure if I should include quotes in the value on the condition screen for a text field, but I have tried it with single quotes, double quotes and no quotes - whichever I choose results in 0 records found. Setting a condition on a numeric field also results in 0 records found. When I add a filter, when I view the report I can see a dropdown box but it does not contain the fieldname of my filter - it just says choose, nothing else. I suspect that these problems may be due to the fact that my database is PostgreSQL ....?  I am using Moodle 1.9.8. Thanks Barbara",
