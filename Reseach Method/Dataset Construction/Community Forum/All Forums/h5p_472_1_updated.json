          "Title": "Should you use the H5P plugin, or H5P core functionality in Moodle?",
          "Text": "We see numerous discussions in this forum (and elsewhere) around this topic. In simple terms the question is \" Should we use the H5P plugin, or use the H5P integration that now exists in Moodle Core? \" The core H5P module is the one that belongs to the core H5P, which has a BLUE icon in Moodle, from the Moodle HQ. HVP module (or just HVP) refers to https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_hvp , and has a BLACK icon in Moodle, and this is an additional plug-in from the developers at h5p.org. There is an official migration tool from Moodle HQ: https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_migratehvp2h5p . The answer to \"Which to use?\" is not entirely simple, and in fact may be different for different Moodle sites. However, H5P recently released an important statement on H5P.org [ https://h5p.org/moodle-plugin-vs-moodle-core-vs-h5p-com ] ALSO note that since this thread was initially started the status of H5P.com is now a commercial option. Please do read the full  press release (it's not too long) but here is the summary: Comparison of the three options [for Moodle users/sites] The H5P Plugin (recommended) Includes the full version of H5P including the H5P Hub, making it compatible with the OER Hub and future versions of H5P. Maintained by the H5P Core Team. Available as a plugin on Moodle.org, allowing for self-hosting and managing of the H5P content. H5P.com (recommended) The best version of H5P delivered as a service; hosted and supported by the H5P Core Team, integrates via LTI . Will soon include premium features allowing for a better authoring experience and several unique H5P dimensions that need special server side technologies to work. Includes the full version of H5P including the H5P Hub, making it compatible with the OER Hub and future versions of H5P. This is a paid service, so if you use H5P.com you also help fund the development of H5P. The Moodle core integration Partial integration of H5P as an optional feature in Moodle core, developed and maintained by Moodle HQ. Offers a tighter integration with Moodle and the Moodle Mobile App. We currently do not know if and when a full integration of H5P will be in place. So what does this mean in the real world?  I suggest... If your site is not currently using the H5P plugin, and you will be upgrading to Moodle 3.9, use the core functionality. Even though there are issues, and maybe some missing H5P features, the core H5P functionality is likely to get better in Moodle 4.0 released next year. If H5P is not a big part of your plans, if it's being used a little bit, or just here and there, and it's not critical, then you should probably just use the H5P in core Moodle. However, if H5P is a major part of your Moodle site already, and you see H5P as a critical and central part of your e-learning within Moodle, then you may want to continue to use the H5P plugin, and disable the core H5P functionality within Moodle (it would be confusing to have two ways of adding and managing H5P). It's also important to note that if you are linking your Moodle site to H5P.com (paid service) the LTI integration works well (I've set this up and it's not too hard for admins) and H5P.com also provides some data and metrics not available with just the Moodle plugin or the new H5P core in Moodle functionality. I don't believe there is a \"one size fits all\" answer here. But I look forward to this discussion, because it will help organisations and administrators make the best choice for their organisations right now, with an eye on the future. Stu.",

My advice, and I think we will have more useful opinions as people transition to Moodle 3.9, is to only use one. I've heard about the spinning wheel, which means a resource is not loading. However, I've not experienced this with H5P in Moodle, and not in the Interactive Video. But it's possibly related to the actual file size, the network speed, of the browser.",

          "Text": "Thanks for the summary and suggestions Stuart. Here's my take! First and foremost all these ways of using H5P are positive for both the H5P and Moodle communities, all content creators, educators and ultimately students etc.. because it allows H5P to be used in a variety of ways across numerous platforms not only Moodle and that's important because it is free and open source software like Moodle. However, this Content Bank implementation from Moodle does not seem to be fully in line with H5P's visions to make interactive content accessible to everyone because it has chosen not to implementing the H5P Hub as they designed and how it is implemented in every other platform. Therefore, it's clear that at present, Joubel, is recommending the H5P Plugin over the Core integration because the Core Integration doesn't include the H5P Hub and thus all its features and including its upcoming OER Hub integration and is not not maintained by H5P. It seems like the Content Bank solution was not done collaboratively with Joubel which is disappointing. Though, I hope this will not mean that Moodle go its own way and that the H5P OER Hub will be integrated within the next release of Moodle. Clearly though, the Core integration as it functions now using the Content Bank still works well, on the Moodle side, for creating and managing H5Ps because you can insert H5Ps from virtually anywhere you can find the Atto editor. Also, the ability to use the alias/shortcut feature to link to H5Ps within your course and or across your site is a really nice and of course the other integrations such as grades and activity completion are too. So, for me to get the best of both worlds would be for Moodle to include the H5P hub natively from H5P. But all that said, I would say the best option is using H5P.com for the  reasons listed above but mainly  for its premium hosting and LTI platform integrations just to mention a couple. But I will leave it there for now. Regards, Ben",

          "Text": "Thanks for posting Ben, and expanding on this conversation. I think you are correct, that there is a political dynamic here. \" Moodle does not seem to be fully in line with H5P's visions to make interactive content accessible to everyone because it has chosen not to implementing the H5P Hub \" H5P have a fundamental strategy to enable sharing of content, and the H5P OER Hub is central to H5P. Moodle also has a similar aim, to make course sharing possible, through MoodleNet . Although there are differences in intentions, it's clear that at some level these two 'sharing standards' are competitive. I believe there will be some Moodle Net sites that will be really productive and positive. But I think the H5P standard, which can work across many Learning Management Systems, WordPress, Drupal, etc. is fundamentally a more portable and sharable format (similar to SCORM in some ways). So, to some extent, it may depend on the 'integration mention' of the Moodle site as to whether the core H5P functions, or the H5P plugin, would be the best option. However, given that every new Moodle installation will have the H5P core functions, I expect 99% of people will use the H5P core functions out of the box, and miss out on the H5P OER Hub possibilities - until if/when Moodle HQ integrate this.",

          "Text": "Hi Stuart, Ben and all, For the H5P integration in Moodle we set out to find a tighter integration which has resulted in some of the benefits mentioned above. Needless to say this has not been a trivial task and we've taken an iterative approach - starting in 3.8 and with more work completed in 3.9. We have been working with Joubel as much as possible during the process. Of course, at the same time both platforms evolve and Joubel is moving forward with their vision of the HUB, just as Moodle is working on other aspects of our platform. We will be considering how to incorporate the Hub within Moodle's H5P integration - it's something that requires a bit more thought. I'd be keen to hear people's ideas on this. With regards to MoodleNet ; it has a broader view of educators sharing any OER content and curating collections of high quality resources. This could even include H5P and potentially there is an integration pathway between the H5P hub and MoodleNet. At the same time the team is working towards the UX improvements for 4.0 - I hope within that we can also deliver some further improvements for the H5P integration. I'd love to do everything, but we do have to make choices where we focus our efforts. In summary; definitely keen to look at best ways to include the H5P hub, at the moment this requires some more thought and feedback. And we have to balance our efforts on the H5P integration with other work on the platform.",

Here is my scenario: We work with a Moodle Partner and therefore saving some money by replacing the plugin-in was a great thing and we decided to go for the core feature without any doubt. ❤️Thanks❤️ to Sara and her team for making it possible (gràcies!!! 🙌) for me, the use of the core H5P has two main advantages: it can be seamlessly integrated into any resource it can be better tracked (I know there are issues, but I can live with them by now) I actually like the idea of the Content Bank and I'm happy about any improvements, such as the possibility to directly download activities. From my experience, having access to OER is not a requirement. I usually spent much more time looking for inspiration or for an appropriate OER resource than creating it by myself from scratch - so I'm happy without this feature.",

Although having a content bank is a great idea, at present it will cause too many issues. With core we have found: Creating an H5P activity is more difficult, for staff as they have to go into the content bank then link to it Editing is a nightmare as again you have to find it in the content bank, but with our testing it is not automatically updating the activities its linked to. The changes do not appear and the only way to update is to deleted and relink. Then results becomes a little meaningless as you are able to add questions and new marks and therefore the earlier students will say out of 10 and the rest on the updated on out of 12. (it needs to lock it like moodle quiz does) Grading is better in core in that you can assign a scale however you cannot set a time limit or how many times the student can repeat the activity which would have been a better step Once these niggles have been ironed out then we can see the advantage but if you have any insights about why the activities don't auto update once edited in the bank that would be great.

Although there are of course issues - like the content cannot be moved from one course to another as the links break. I agree the current H5P implementation in core is clunky, and not consistent with any other method of adding standard activities in Moodle. I hope that can be improved. Just to add to the discussion... We have migrated quite a few clients from the H5P plugin to the H5P core function now. That makes sense for us as a hosting provider , as it's one less plugin to maintain and update. General feedback is there is a bit of pain for teachers initially learning the new ways. We have used the migration tools, and although it had some issues at first, it seems to work well now. However, I have recently noticed that if the H5P plugin is disabled, then activities still show in the Gradebook. I expected these would be hidden too. Again, it's a plugin, and isn't following core Moodle operation here. Stu",

          "Text": "Hi all. So my organization decided to stop using the H5P Plugin several years ago due to issues with interactive videos. We found that Moodle didn't really seem to support the Plugin when we reached out for help with these issues, and encouraged the use of the LTI approach. So we have a large number of partners using H5P.com and LTI Integration, which is working well, but isn't free . My question has to do with this new Core H5P functionality. Can the new H5P Activity type still be used if we turn off the Content Bank somehow? It seems like that adds tracking and grading options pretty seamlessly for H5P content. It would be nice if this new H5P Activity Type allowed for the H5P Domain to be selected somehow under the File Picker, like the Content Bank currently is. Hopefully that may come in the future. Thank you for any insight on the above. Loving that H5P is coming to Moodle, and hope to see it added to other LMS' too!",

However, the H5P module (with blue icon) included in the Moodle core is still young and needs some improvement. The one managed by the Core Team H5P would seem to work better and in a more user-friendly way. For example: I have two similar installations with both plugins installed, one installation with Moodle version 3.10+, the other with version 3.10.1+; well, on version 3.10+ of Moodle both components work without problems, on version 3.10.1+ the one distributed with Moodle freezes, without releasing apparent errors, asking to wait for the editing of the H5P component chosen in the library.",

          "Text": "Each approach has advantages over the other. In total, I think that moodle's core integration is the winner, currently. Choosing one over the other may depend on what your (long-term) requirements are, however. It's so hard to predict the future ... Obvious plus for moodle's core integration: admins don't need to take care of one extra plugin. The moodle core integration is more versatile when it comes to integration with moodle's gradebook. You can, for instance, set whether to use the first or the latest attempt, an average, the best, etc. The plugin integration will store the latest only. Both solutions keep all attempts in moodle's history, however. Plus for moodle's integration: The default score to scale to is 100 and not 10. The moodle core integration is better in handling H5P libraries. The option to automatically install the latest version via a cron job is particularly neat in my opinion. As far as I know, doing backups of moodle courses works way better using moodle's core integration. People that I have talked to don't like the extra steps involved in H5P creating and adding content via the content bank of moodle's integration. I assume it's a matter of taste and of what you are used to though. Being able to organize content can be useful. Being able to copy existing H5P content and paste it to create a clone of the exercise or to include in as subcontent in other content types is not possible on moodle's integration for some reason. A feature that I think is not yet supported in moodle's core integration is resuming tasks - called \"save content state\" in the options of the H5P plugin where it can be activated. If I am not mistaken, only the H5P plugin has a dedicated development mode that allows to patch H5P content types easily if you want to/need to. Since the moodle core integration does not use the H5P Hub, users cannot use the H5P OER Hub which is a global repository of openly shared content that people can use, reuse and contribute to. That's really a nice feature. The moodle team has, however, not ruled out to use the H5P Hub in some way in the future. Having the H5P Hub (or some replacement) will eventually be important, because it is planned to use it more extensively for other things, too, e. g. for adding subcontent to compound content types like Course Presentation. If the H5P Hub is not supported, then it might become impossible to use compound content types like Course Presentation or Interactive Video in the future.",

Here is a comparison: with the H5P plugin view existing content \"H5P my exercise\" click Reuse Select Copy content Add content Interactive content Under the \"Select content type\" title, from Create Content / Upload / Paste select Paste ... et voila! with the H5P integrated activity In the Content bank Select and Edit an existing content \"H5P my exercise\" At the top right, click the Copy (Copy H5P content to the clipboard) button Exit content \"H5P my exercise\" In the content bank, click the Add button and from the dropdown list choose any content type, I suggest the very first one, which usually is Accordion In Edit mode for Accordion, Click the Paste and replace button in the top right corner ... et voila! 2.- \"A feature that I think is not yet supported in moodle's core integration is resuming tasks - called \"save content state\" in the options of the H5P plugin where it can be activated.\" That's correct, and IMHO this is a pity, since the \"save content state\" option is a vital feature for those H5P activities which should allow the student to quit an un-finished state and come back to it later on, e.g. Dialog Cards. 3.- \"The moodle core integration is more versatile when it comes to integration with moodle's gradebook.\" Yes, that is a strong point of the core integration. The integrated H5P activity also allows more detailed attempts results to be displayed, when several attempts are allowed. 4.- IMHO, in order to avoid confusion in the end-user (teacher) a Moodle site admin should probably not enable both the H5P plugin and the integrated H5P activity on a Moodle site.",

          "Text": "Our team from Service Center for Teaching (Hochschule Hannover, Germany) is currently evaluating the integration of H5P activities into our Moodle LMS. We have been discussing a lot about the pros and cons of the core integration and/or the usage of the H5p-plugin. Now we’re wondering what are the future plans for the integration of H5P question types into Moodle core and will the question types already integrated be maintained from Moodle 4 onwards? Might there be any problems arising out of the implementation of the OER hub regarding the compatability and/or regarding several question types? How about the motivation to keep H5P up to date following the H5P development? Sara mentions in this comment ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70925 ) that Moodle will evaluate the integration in core after the release oft he H5P OER hub. May this be interpreted as a sign for future support and maintenance of H5P question types within Moodle HQ? Still, we don’t see any evidence of H5P in the Moodle Roadmap for now ( https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Roadmap#Moodle_3.8_and_beyond:_planning_in_progress ). We’d be more than happy to hear any statement „priority-wise“ concerning the ongoing maintenance of H5P question types in Moodle core by Moodle HQ (Sander?). Looking forward to a reply or discussion in this thread. Thank you very much!",

          "Text": "Hi Jean-Pierre, I just wanted to comment here after using Moodle's implementation of H5P for the past 1.5 years. There are a number of limitations and caveats. The first one, I did mentioned in an earlier post that this implementation doesn't take advantage of the H5P Hub which now includes the sharing of H5P globally. Here are my other observations - my day-to-day practical take on using H5P in the Content Bank. No sitewide centralised Content Bank to develop and share H5Ps (i.e. no collaboration and sharing). I think the Admin has this feature/functionality, with a Content Bank site wide but other uses don't and I am not aware of the ability to change this in the settings. While the idea of a course context for creating H5P seems good but ultimately you are working in silos. It is very unproductive to have to download or export H5P in to multiple other courses many times when you want to share content across courses.  Sharing of H5Ps is one of the cornerstones of the technology but unfortunately in Moodle is it not the case. The lack of a H5P Hub for sharing is a real shame. Also there is no way to collaborate with colleagues unless you are working in the same course. Because what I am finding is teachers/ed designers in other teaching areas are developing similar content without any knowledge of this happening and this is partly due to the fact that there is no central place to develop H5P sitewide and manage content with other people. Duplication of content because of above & bloat in LMS over time It is not uncommon to me to have 20 plus H5P activities in a single course these days the more I create and use H5P activities. The duplicate is just ridiculous and clearly not an efficient way to manage this content. This is strong argument for hosting your organisations H5Ps externally and using LTI to bring in your content in to your LMS. Creating H5P in the Content Bank is not an intuitive way to develop. Here I want to mention that fact that every other activity you create in Moodle starts with creating an activity or resource then when choosing that activity, it opens immediately for you to create. This is an exception and is not the workflow for creating H5Ps using Moodle's implementation. You are can't create a H5P when \"creating\" an activity, you are only 'adding' a H5P, that you have already created to the activity. Documentation Tool does not have the 'save the state' function . I can't really use or recommend using the Documentation Tool in Moodle because it doesn't allow for saving the work of your users as you write text into fields. This might be changing and pls anyone who knows comment here. Also this limitation may affect other content types but that have text inputs but I can't be sure. I hope that gives you some ideas of what you will have to contend with using Moodle implementation of H5P but I am sure you will cope. It is just not ideal and there is room for improvements. Best regards, Ben",

Honestly, I would like to use the core version more often as the content versions are kept very well up to date. But unfortunately, there is still the one knock-out criterion that makes me avoiding it, it's the bug that makes that pre-existing Metadata copyright information is destroyed when a H5P is imported ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-74129 ). I really hope that it's possible to fix this quite soon! Unfortunately, I'm not a programmer, but if anyone here tries to fix it and needs someone to test it, I could do it, just contact me.

          "Text": "To share the experience of 4 different organisation in different Moodle versions: h5p core in M3.9 - M4.0 Switching from H5P black to blue - Manage content types as a teacher organisations that are switching from black to blue, are obvious compairing the two. reason for switchting was: creating an effective workflow proces in creating,reviewing, releasing and evaluating content - main painpoints where: Course Resetting did not clear the 'save content state' + attempts of students in H5P. Making small changes like an image or text could not managed well between courses. They re-used alot of the content in different courses, so the smallest change (like a typo) needed to be done in every single activity and course where this content was present. They work with contenttype templates for the employees that placed content in, duplicating and coping in the black H5P seemed time consuming. Switching to the blue h5P made it easier for them to manage their content. They solved issues in a pragmatical way, and looking forward to upgrade to the latest version to experience the improved searching in the content bank. Of course they also mentioned pain points: They had prefered that the could build their own folder system in the content bank, and managing the \"access\" instead of following the Moodle structure. They solved this issue by creating \"content bank courses\" if you use a non boost theme (prio to 4.0) you had no way to navigate to the contentbank since there is no link in the administration block to the content bank. We encountered various bugs in contenttypes due to not updated PHP files in Moodle 3.9, these won't be fixed until they move to m4.1 - we had to find 'smart' work around to avoid this. There is no Save content state, which gave 'complains' from students because they don't see if they have went through the content. Summary : The new contentbank prevents a  painfull proces of clicking and going through courses to by example replace an image, or correct a type. Reviewers responded postive because they where no sure that they just have to check on 1 place. Course builders found that it saved time because now they did not had to use the import functionality to pull out the contenttypes. Working with 'templates' became easier. They would had like the save content state in H5P core BUT also point out that this should work with Course Reset.   ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-67789 ) H5P core for new users new users need to be explained carefully on how to use the content bank. It is already a 'steap' learning curve on finding your way in Moodle, and the way the content bank works feels counter initituive. This is until they start to realize that the content bank gives them the flexibility and much easier use to add content typesto the Moodle Book, Lesson , Page - we even find them as part of Quiz questions. As siteadministrators and implementors we realized very quickly that with the way the content bank works now, teacher/content creators that start are more aware of the fact that h5P is met to be an 'interactive addition to your content' and not ment to be for quizing or anything formal in reporting. View as a site admin Postive: we saw a reduction in using the H5P activitity, more and more contenttypes where appearing as 'embedded' items in other Moodle activities like pages, books and even part of quiz questions. Positive: a more effective workflow proces goal was achived. Needs investigation:  how the cron taks that pulls in new updates of contenttypes works vs the way we update in H5P black. Where we not only updated the contenttype, but also had the option to see 'upgrade' created contenttypes. Concern: within 1 year of implementaton the hvp_xapi_result table in the database is 3x large then the question attempts, current size: 144GB. We do worry that there is no simple way to 'clean' this data. We would had loved an option (like with the logstore) to say we only want to save this data for by example 6 months or 1 year on a sitelevel from a GDPR point of view. Concern: implementing Save content state in H5P core integration Will the option to 'remove attempts' will be forgotten to add to the course reset? And how will this be implementated, as an option or 'as is'. In the latter we will find ourselves again searching for a work around. Concern: how will Moodle HQ deal with 'regressions' due to an update H5P framework handler in still supported versions of Moodle. I might bump into more things, and will added in a later time, noting the time / date of the change. Gemma PS: we also have organisations that build their content in Lumi to avoid unnecessary access to Moodle. They send the file to the organisation, so they can upload it either in the contentbank/H5P activity and have full control of maintaining the content themselves.",

          "Text": "Things are getting complicated. There are two things under discussions, as you've broken them in to two paras: Para 1. The recent (1-2 years) changes in the H5P landscape related to Moodle I have no clue. Asking me what I believe won't produce anything. Please note that I haven't made any statements for the simple reason above. I was quoting what I saw in other places. That doesn't mean I believe them or endorse in any way. As already explained, it is (they are) meant as questions asking for the learned audience here for corrections, if anything in those is wrong. From your and Joseph's counter questions, I believe they contain wrong information. It would be great if you and others explain what exactly is wrong and provide the correct answers. Para 2. \"policy changes\" in H5P as compared to Moodle Lets take the case of a DIY Moodle site. From its beginning, over two decades ago until today, Moodle is Free and Open Source Software in two parts, the Moodle core and plug-ins. Other than the pertubation we had in going from GPL 2 to GPL 3 nothing has changed. I said DIY Moodle to exclude the official service providers, specifically Moodle Partners and the Moodle Cloud. Apparently H5P was different. There was (is) the org and the com. Both hosted H5P content(?), or was it com that hosted, org combined with the H5P plug-in allowed the sites to store content locally(?) Those policies have been evolving, it sounds. Unlike the FOSS Moodle software the user can not avoid following those changes. I know, the comparison is not fair, Moodle for DIY is only software, H5P is software and the produced content which are not necessariy hosted in the server like the common Moodle content. I am not complaining. The H5P creators must have their reasons, e.g. end of funding. AFAIC they are dedicated to the spirit of FOSS. But the user, I believe it is not only me, is confronted with those changes. So it is important to keep this thread, \"Should you use the H5P plugin, or H5P core functionality in Moodle?\" alive. I think, it was pinned to the top some years ago - now no more. My posts here also serve as \"pings\" to keep the thread afloat. It would have been ideal, if that wasn't necessary. But the world is less than ideal. On a general, future note: I have a whole faculty of teachers who produce and share (among themselves) H5P in an astonishing scale. See my posts in this forum. The latest is, I'm myself involved in creating H5P for an exciting application. To my amazement, I discover one H5P activity after the other that come from you! Great many thanks and appreciate you attending to these petty, confused posts yourself.",

          "Text": "I think I understand the basic comment here. For many years, in fact as long as Moodle has existed, the \"policy\" and perspective was always, and excuse my paraphrasing: \"Moodle is open source, and so the strategy is to make it as open as possible , using API's etc. to ensure it has interoperability with any external systems.\" Think: a) Support for SCORM b) Support for payment systems c) API'S / LTI to allow for Turnitin plagiarism detection, etc. etc. H5P was treated fundamentally differently by Moodle HQ when the decision was made for Moodle developers to integrate, and therefore maintain, it's own version of H5P within Moodle. We have then had many years of ordinary teachers confused by the presence of two H5P activities when the plugin was installed (!) and it's not the job of an average teacher to try and understand the pro's and con's of each, and make complex decisions about this. And the whole H5P file picker / repository idea has many frustrated comments from teachers in the forums here. Moodle HQ did some good work in creating the conversion process, so content created by H5P plugin could be changed to H5P Moodle native. But of course the more recent sale of H5P to a completing LMS provider is worrying. It's quite possible that H5P will develop in a way that is not optimum for Moodle. It's also possible H5P will try really hard to ensure it works with Moodle - as the most popular FOSS LMS. I don't know their strategy. But personally, I believe the sensible solution is probably to remove H5P from core, and reply on an official H5P plugin.  There could be a script to convert from Moodle HQ to convert 'core H5P objects' to H5P plugin objects. And then, there is one H5P activity, it's optional, like any other plugin / integration , and it adhere's to the long-held and default Moodle mantra of \"build Moodle as easy to integrate with other systems\" It's a somewhat complex position we are in now. But I don't believe it should be allowed to continue, and someone, somewhere, should be making a strong high-level decision - with input from relevant stakeholders. But it's above my pay grade Stu",

I think MoodleHQ did a great job with integrating H5P - in fact I have mentioned that I like Moodle's integration better than the plugin many times here on the forum (despite some things still missing). I totally agree that the two-way approach situation is confusing for users, and I totally understand that MoodleHQ themselves probably were never too happy to embrace H5P that closely without being able to control its direction - even more so now that a competitor owns it. I also don't know the strategy for the Moodle plugin. It has not been really worked on for a long time and many pull requests lie dormant on github ... BUT that was already the case long before the D2L takeover, so it is not linked to that. D2L founder John Baker repeatedly said that they had no plan to limit H5P to Brightspace or make it an exclusively paid version in a different way. He also mentioned that he wanted to talk to MoodleHQ directy, but I don't know whether that conversation ever took place or what the results may have been.

          "Text": "Oh boy. To be clear: I do fully understand that one might worry about the future of H5P, but connecting this anxiety to the video that you linked to is absolutely unjustified. That video claims that in 2023 H5P Group had changed a policy regarding h5p.org. The video also claims you were supposed to be able to store your content, but that is said to have changed and that you now had to host things yourself, e.g. on Moodle. The video even speaks of a \"free hosting service\" (2:30). The whole premise is wrong! The site h5p.org was never ever intended to be a place where you could create and host all your content for your courses. Whenever you created content on that site, you saw this box on top of the editor: Hard to misunderstand, at least in my humble opinion. But let's dig a little deeper, maybe back to 2018? During the Easter time, the h5p.org shut down because it simply could not cope with all the load that people generated by creating and storing their contents their - not for testing, but for production. There's a whole blog post by Joubel on that topic: \"H5P.org Easter outage\" . To quote from one paragraph: H5P is currently designed exclusively for self hosting. H5P.org was never meant to be a free service for creating and embedding H5P content on external web sites. We are however aware that many uses H5P.org this way, and for those that rely on H5P.org, especially for embedded content, we are incredibly sorry for this service outage. In other words: Despite h5p.org not being meant for hosting your content, people did and Joubel not only tolerated that, but excused for the outage and paid better servers out of their own pockets. H5P.com was introduced in 2018 as well, and that free 30 day testing period on H5P.com was introduced quite soon after. So, I really do not understand what policy that video thinks it is addressing or what is supposed to have changed late in 2023. All the source code of H5P's core, of the content types and of the various H5P integrations has remained openly licensed, has been maintained and improved since then. Summarizing: H5P.org was NEVER a free hosting service for your content. H5P.com did NOT change the open source nature of the H5P project. If you just wanted to discuss some issue that you may have with H5P regarding its licensing, strategic roadmap or whatever - which is totally valid - why would you merely post a more than general question \"Evolving more and more..?\" and complement it with that bogus video?",

Recently, H5P has updated the versions of most of their content types, including an update to the CKEditor. As a result, these content types will stop working unless you upgrade your Moodle sites to the upcoming releases for versions 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5, which are scheduled to be released on October 7th 2024 . Recommendations : All Moodle instances should disable the “ Download available H5P content types from h5p.org” scheduled task until you either upgrade your Moodle version or install the upcoming plugin. Plan your upgrades accordingly to ensure a smooth transition and continued functionality of your H5P content. For Moodle 4.2 instances, a plugin will be released soon to upgrade the H5P libraries. However, please note that there are currently no plans to fix or backport this update to Moodle 4.1, as it involves core changes. For more detailed information, please refer to the issue tracker: MDL-83268 (thanks Gemma for raising it!! 😘). Thank you for your attention to this matter. Best regards, Sara",

I kindly ask you if it could be possible to have some forum for news like this, that are applicable to any Moodle instance. Why am I asking this? To improve important communications like this to the whole Moodle community of users with any role. In my case, I am not subscribed to this \"H5P\" forum, so I were completely unaware. Probably, we would face this problem in our production site unexpectedly. Therefore, a forum for this kind of news, similar in essence to that of \"Security announcements\", but for other kind of generally applicable issues to any Moodle site, would be very welcome. After that, we could always reply to any other forum (like this \"H5P\" forum) with the link to the issue in the \"general forum\". We then would be able to be subscribed and get alerted from any incoming issue. As a proposal for the new forum, it could be named like \"Issues with broad affectation\" or similar, and without overlapping at all to the \"Security announcements\". Maybe this forum already exists and I am unaware. Thank you so much for your great work and complete reporting.",

          "Text": "I wanted to clarify that my reported issue was not due to an update of the content type library while H5P core did not support version 1.27. I manage several Moodle sites that are not yet on version 1.26, and so far, I have not encountered any issues, and I am doubtfull if that even will happend but even I will surely disable the automatic task. From my perspective, it seems that the challenge only arises when H5P content is created on a third-party platform with a more recent API version and is then uploaded into Moodle. In this particular case, the content was created in WordPress. Having encountered a similar situation before, I knew exactly what to report. I also noticed that the H5P Plugin version was updated on September 13th, which prompted me to share this information with Moodle HQ to help ensure Moodle’s H5P core continues to function seamlessly. This all said - while I believe this isn't directly a Moodle-related issue, my reasoning comes from another case we encountered this week that mirrors this issue, though the notification appeared in reverse. In this instance, a teacher had used the CoursePresentation content in the H5P Plugin (not core) and attempted to copy/paste it into the Interactive Book (also using the H5P Plugin). The notification indicated that CoursePresentation supported a higher API version than Interactive Book. But it would be great if there is a different way of handeling thise API Version upgrade from H5P within Moodle H5P core, so that admins can easily switch. Gemma",

          "Text": "That \"reverse\" case is nothing dangerous in contrast to the issue at hand which potentially can be. It is also not related to the version of H5P core. In general, if a compound content type expects a subcontent to be using library version X, you cannot put subcontent of library version Y in. We get three cases which should have this behavior: X = Y The content from the clipboard can be pasted without any issue. X > Y Should yield the message: \"The content in the H5P clipboard is of a lower version $Y than what is supported in this context ($X), if possible try to have the content you want to paste upgraded, copy it again and try pasting it here.\" The content from the clipboard (local storage to be precise) was created with an older version of the content type than expected. The content that's in the clipboard/local storage must come from a content on the platform, so that content would need to be upgraded to the version that is required by the parent content (cmp. H5P and not upgrading existing content?! and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70918 ) before it can be pasted. This case could in theory be covered by automatically upgrading the content as it will when you upload it to the platform. That's not done in H5P core (yet), however. X < Y Should yield the message: \"The content in the H5P clipboard is of a higher version ($Y) than what is supported in this context ($X), if possible try to have this content upgraded first, and then try pasting the content here again.\" The content from the clipboard (local storage to be precise) was created with a newer version of the content type than expected. The message is a little ambiguous: Here \"have this content upgraded\" refers to the parent content, not the one to be pasted. Hopefully, there already is a version of the parent content type that can host the content that is supposed to be pasted. It would need to be installed on the platform, and the parent content instance would then need to be upgraded (cmp. H5P and not upgrading existing content?! and https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70918 ). I don't think there's a practical way to resolve this automatically.",

          "Text": "Hi Oliver, Thanks for your message! I can confirm that the scheduled task, along with any library updates or content creation using the core H5P integration, are indeed checking the core API and taking no action if the Moodle H5P core version is lower (you can refer to h5p/classes/core.php#L184-L186 for more details). However, as Gemma mentioned in MDL-83268 , a few content types have had incorrect dependencies, leading to some inconsistencies. Fortunately, some of these issues seem to be resolved now. For example, the interactive-book version was updated recently , though verifying this across all possible combinations remains challenging without testing. Additionally, we're encountering issues with the latest version of the third-party plugin mod_hvp , particularly when trying to create content like Course Presentations on a vanilla site. Although the necessary libraries are installed, the system still complains that some are missing, causing ongoing difficulties: Given your expertise with H5P, it would be incredibly helpful if you could guide us on where to find detailed information about these core API changes. This would give us a clearer understanding of any remaining H5P content types that could potentially impact Moodle sites. I apologize if my previous message came across as too cautious, but we felt it was better to flag the issue early rather than regret missing something later. Thanks in advance for your support!

          "Text": "Thanks, Sarah! I am very glad that I did not understand correctly. Otherwise, I am sure many people would have run into trouble next week. Better safe than sorry! An H5P library that requires a version of H5P core that is not yet available on the platform should not be installable in any way, IMHO . This includes to check for the core API version requirement when a user uploads H5P content, because that may trigger installing newer library versions from the file . The same goes for installing a library directly, of course. I'd even extend that rule to users with an admin role or at least warn them in that case and require them to actively confirm. Having incorrect dependencies is something that can mess up your day easily, but first and foremost that's the content type maintainers' responsibility, of course. Example: We could assume that H5P.Column had dependencies to H5P.CoursePresentation 1.0 and to H5P.TrueFalse 1.3. That version of Course Presentation could have a dependency to H5P.TrueFalse 1.2. There would be two different versions required for a True False Question. If an author put a True False 1.3  into a Column and a Course Presentation that included a True False Question 1.2, that could cause trouble - H5P cannot handle two versions of a library at a time. The dependency of Course Presentation to True False Question would need to be updated to 1.3, in turn the minor version of Course Presentation would need to be bumped, then the dependency from Column to Course Presentation would need to be updated accordingly, and then, finally, the minor version of Column would also need to be bumped. Sounds confusing? It is. It's hardly possible to keep track of all the dependencies manually. That is why the H5P CLI tool has a `h5p utils find-inconsistencies` command. It will check the dependency tree of H5P libraries for conflicting dependencies that would cause trouble. I'd assume the release manager of H5P Group run this check when releasing (or some automated process to be in place), but I don't know. Also, I believe that the command does not check the coreAPI dependencies (yet?). Here, in the dependency tree, no leaf node would be allowed to require a higher version of H5P core than it's parent node. I'd assume that's why recently all (or close to all?) content types have seen an update of the coreAPI dependency regardless of whether they required it themselves directly or not. So, in theory you could integrate something similar into moodle core: a dependency checker that runs whenever an H5P library is about to be installed in order to detect those kind of inconsistencies that may have been introduced out of your control. I think this would rather be suited for being included in H5P core though. Makes more sense to have it in there, doesn't it? Guess that might be worth a feature/pull request. The issues that sometimes occur with the plugin when trying to install/update content types via the H5P content type hub are not limited to moodle.  They are a general problem with the H5P content type hub. It does not serve all versions of content types ever created separately, but uses pre-built packages (POST api.h5p.org/v1/content-types/H5P.CoursePresentation for instance will get you the package of the latest version of Course Presentation). If the package is not packed properly, then something like this may happen. This takes place on H5P Group's server , however. They would need to bullet-proof their processes. There's nothing that a client could (sensibly, there's a hack-ish way) do here. As for the H5P core API changes: Unfortunately, there's no information at all. No change log, no info to external developers on upcoming versions, no nothing. Yes, that's bad! Unless something changes or you take action to ask for changes and are successful, you would need to monitor the repositories of H5P core to anticipate a new release. As a heads-up maybe: It's possible that the upcoming theming feature for H5P will lead to version 1.28 and in that case, many content types will see an update of their coreApi dependency as well.",

But as an LTS this is likely to hit a large number of installations, especially if they're using external tools for creating H5Ps. I think this may be hitting us in particular because we've started converting mod_hvp to core h5p. And mod_hvp was using v126, and with the latest update v127, so it's creating a disparity within Moodle itself. I managed to backport the changes in core M4.1 to use the v126 plugin, there was a bit of cherrypicking involved, it took a few hours, but it's not a massive job. I really would recommend changing MoodleHQ's standpoint on this issue for M4.1. Will you be releasing a v127 plugin, like you did for v126?",

Update on H5P content types We've prepared a plugin (h5plib_v127) , that has already been approved in the Moodle directory (thanks, Mikel and Helen!). This plugin can be installed from Moodle 4.2 onwards. Versions 4.5, 4.4.4, and 4.3.8, which will be released on October 7, will include this plugin by default. Some clarifications: Based on our tests, we believe no Moodle site (regardless of version) should be broken, even if the scheduled task is not disabled. There are/were some inconsistencies with the libraries (for instance, with Course presentation ), but we believe they shouldn’t have an impact. However, we still recommend keeping the scheduled task disabled (at least this month), to confirm everything is OK. Regarding Moodle 4.1 (which uses h5plib_v124 and cannot be upgraded to h5plib_v126 or h5plib_v127 because it needs changes in core): Users will not be able to import H5P content created in h5p.com or higher Moodle versions. That's not new (although until now, only a few content types were affected). Most H5P content types won't be upgraded, so users won't benefit from improvements like the new CKEditor. However, they still be able to use, edit and create the content with old H5P content-type versions.",

It is a very dynamic web site, a lucky one, which can boast of a team of enthusiastic teachers who are creating content all the time. I would say that the push coincides with they discovering H5P - somewhere Moodle 3.5 LTS. On mod_hvp those days. Now they work in both mod_hvp and mod_h5pactivity. Their creations must run! That Moodle is, as already said, version 4.1 LTS. Updates are applied regularly. mod_hvp is 1.26.1 2023122500, mod_h5pactivity 2022112801. The site will be upgraded to 4.5 LTS only in Spring 2025. If the site's H5P won't break till then, I apologize for my shouting.",

Or maybe there is something outside of the Moodle system that need to communicate with Moodle, and at some point would prevent the H5P on that system from working, unless the Moodle system or the H5P lib on that system would be updated?

A question; from what you say, it is not possible to apply the update to version 1.27 (with the h5plib_v127 plugin) in Moodle 4.1 environments because they have version 1.24 installed, and it would be necessary to modify aspects of the core. On the other hand, you indicate that the update can be applied via the plugin, in environments 4.2 or higher. We have a 4.3.2 environment, but said environment comes with version 1.24 by default... The question would be... is it possible to apply the update to the 1.27 library via the plugin? On the plugin page, Mikel Martín Corrales indicates that it is not, but I would like to confirm it 🙂 Thanks! Jaume R.",

          "Text": "Hi Drew, The ability to customize the appearance of H5P activities in Moodle depends on the version of Moodle you are using and the active theme. Moodle 4.5 and later versions allow direct access to the CSS of H5P activities through the administration interface, enabling style customizations without altering the source code. For earlier versions of Moodle, this functionality is not natively available. In such cases, using a theme like Boost Union is a viable solution, as it provides the capability to inject custom CSS specifically for H5P content, offering flexibility in style adjustments. If neither the Moodle version nor the theme supports direct CSS modifications, the ultimate solution is to alter the CSS of the H5P activity directly within its codebase. This involves modifying the CSS files within the specific H5P library, typically located in the plugin directories on your Moodle server , such as `/moodledata/h5p/libraries/branching-scenario` . While this approach allows for complete customization, it requires caution as updates may overwrite these changes. HTH --C",

H5P provides different hooks for customizing semantics (options available in the editor), for adding your own JavaScript to the content type context , and for altering the visual appearance by adding your own CSS. This has been possible with the H5P plugin for moodle right from the start (see the official documentation btw : https://h5p.org/node/2692 ), and moodle's own H5P integration in moodle core also has been supporting this for quite a while.

That won't help much though, because that file is stored within moodle's storage solution and you'd need to use moodle's FileAPI to find it. Moodle is usually configured to bundle assets first and to then send one large (CSS) file to the browser instead of sending multiple small ones, so again, you most likely will not find that file being accessed (and not found) via the network tab of your browser or similar. That's why I suspect that someone would need to investigate this on your server directly. Since some videos are working and some are not, my best guess would be that these are using different versions of H5P.InteractiveVideo and that for one of the versions the CSS file was not installed correctly.

An alternative (and less good) way of doing this, is to make the quiz available but not shown on the course page, you then (again using h5p interactive video) add a summary screen which includes the link to the quiz. I have done this with a client who specifically wanted this, but this isn't great for the person to revisit the quiz in the future, and if you create a new course based on this one, you would have to remember to go into the H5p to update the link to the quiz.",

          "Text": "Message: Hi everyone, I hope it's appropriate to post this here. We're experiencing significant problems after migrating from mod_hvp to mod_h5pactivity that seem related to the version bump issues discussed in this forum. Our Environment: - Moodle 4.5.1+ (Build: 20250109) - Successfully migrated using the official \" Migrate content from mod_hvp to mod_h5pactivity\" tool Migration Journey & Current Issues: We originally had problems with missing icons and input box borders in mod_hvp, so we decided to use the migration plugin hoping it would solve these visual issues. 1. Initial Problem: After migration, H5P uploads showed infinite loading icons - couldn't create new activities or access content bank - Solved: Deactivating WIRIS plugin resolved the upload issues 2. Current Major Problems: - Many migrated activities don't display at all - just blank pages where content should appear (like Interactive Books that show nothing) - Browser console shows: Unable to find constructor for: H5P.Column 1.18 - Visual/styling issues with content that does load - the original missing icons and input box border problems persist, plus general styling inconsistencies Technical Analysis: Looking at the database and content JSON , we found library version mismatches: - Content JSON contains hardcoded references to \"H5P.Column 1.13\" - Available Column versions: 1.16.2 and 1.18.8 (no 1.13) - JavaScript tries to resolve to \"H5P.Column 1.18\" but fails to find the constructor Questions: 1. Has anyone experienced similar constructor/library loading issues specifically after hvp→h5pactivity migration? The migration tool completed successfully, but much of our content is unusable. Our teachers are understandably frustrated with content that worked perfectly before migration (apart from the original styling issues we hoped to fix). Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!",

It's possible that your Interactive Book contents were created with Interactive Book version 1.3 (which depends on Column 1.13) but that the migration does not migrate/copy the dependencies. Then Column 1.13 would be missing, and contents requiring it would fail while others (newer ones) work. On the other hand, that would not explain \" Unable to find constructor for: H5P.Column 1.18\" - I'd expect 1.13 to appear here. You could try to ensure that all the H5P content type libraries are up to date in both H5P integrations, upgrade your existing content that was created with the plugin, so it uses the latest libraries, and then migrate. That should at least rule out library issues. Missing borders, however, rather sound like CSS customization anyway.",

          "Text": "Hi Oliver, Thanks a lot for your reply and suggestions! Unfortunately, we still haven’t been able to resolve the problem. Here’s what we tried so far: Deleted all cached libraries and re-uploaded them. Used the H5P CLI tool (h5p-cli) to check for inconsistencies. Cleaned the database tables related to H5P libraries and forced reinstall of all required libraries. The result is that I now have multiple versions of the same library (example: Column 1.13.1, 1.16.2, 1.17.0 – screenshot attached). When I try to open certain migrated activities (e.g., Interactive Book), I get errors like the one in the console screenshot (uncaught TypeError, destructured parameter is undefined, and “Unable to find constructor for: H5P.Column 1.18”). From your reply, I understand that the best path would be to upgrade all content to use the latest library versions before migration. My problem is: we have many courses and a large number of activities, so manually editing and re-saving each one is not really feasible. My question is: Is there a way to trigger this upgrade process for all H5P content in bulk (via CLI or script), so that all existing activities are updated to the latest library versions automatically, instead of having to open them one by one? That would really help us make progress. Thanks again for your help!",

What am I missing? Moodle 4.5.5, mod_hvp 1.27.2 from 2024120900. The framework handler is \"H5P framework v1.27 (h5plib_v127)\". PHP ( CGI ) is 8.1.33.

If there are a large number of users in a course, and a small number of attempts, there seems no way to easily navigate to those attempts. I have courses where there are hundreds of pages of users listed. The quiz attempts page shows only the attempts, rather than all users whether or not they have attempted it. This would be much more useful. We use groups, and for teachers within groups they only see their own groups, so at least for those teachers it is easy to find the attempts. However, the page only tells a teacher how many attempts there are across all users, which is of no interest to them - they want to know how many attempts there are for their own groups. Again, the quiz attempts report does this very well as it states the total number of attempts and also the numbers from the teacher's own groups. It would be great if these features could be added in the future.",

It's a moodle case because of the proxy is not used when trying to download contetent types. I already tried to import manually the content type but it is not a suitable solution (upgrading content types is complicated). And some content types needs specific versions of libs. The easiest way is to use the proxy. The line ++ Blocked https://api.h5p.org/v1/content-types/: The URL is blocked. [user 2] ++ says that the url is not reachable. But a manually curl using the proxy is working: `* using HTTP/1.x` `> GET /v1/sites HTTP/1.1` `> Host: api.h5p.org` `> User-Agent: curl/8.14.1` `> Accept: */*` `>` `* Request completely sent off` `< HTTP/1.1 200 OK` And a manual test using the cURL lib in php works too. How could I force the use of the proxy in moodle. Set the proxy adresse/port not work. Alternatively, could you tel me which file is used for the job ? Maybe I can try to set directly in it the proxy ? Thanks.",

I want to prevent a learner from advancing the audio or video , like in Interactive Video. I want Course Presentation to stop on every engagement activity , and not advance to the next slide until the activity is completed and passed. I want Course Presentation to support transparent video. AVI and WebM allow an alpha channel. I want to create an avatar speaker to mimic an instructor, and have that avatar overlay the slide. This lesson is H5P Interactive video , and demonstrates what I want to accomplish in H5P Course Presentation. Why? Because it will be easier to revise individual slides and avatar videos. Because the avatar video is lower bandwidth. Thx",

The downside of this approach would be that you'd get multiple attempts registered inside the gradebook, one for each transmission. The other downsides would be those implied by patching and forking. Note that all involved H5P contents (the main content and its subcontents) send out xAPI statements (\"results\") individually. The respective H5P integration (e. g. the plugin for Moodle or Moodle's own integration) could pick those up and store them as they see fit, but commonly do not. They only keep track of the main content, which in this case is Interactive Video. In other words: This could also be done by changing the code of the H5P integration (Moodle) without the need to change content types (and would help for some other content types, too). You'd probably have to introduce the concept of preliminary scores though, if Moodle's gradebook (or other host platforms' grade books) don't have that in order to make clear that the user has not completed the exercise. And, of course, there would be some variations, but long story short: You won't make that happen without changing code. Alternative: Use a Learning Record Store instead of Moodle's Gradebook, but that's likely not want you want.",

From what I can tell H5P doesn't progessively load the video, it loads the whole file which is why seeking doesn't work.  This will be due to the web server not understanding \"partial content requests\".   There is some disucssion in this here ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8088364/html5-video-will-not-loop/9549404#9549404 ) I strongly suspect that you have a couple of issues which some changes might help If you dont have direct control over the web servers talk to your provider to ensure that partial content requests are being handled correctly, otherwise investigate this. you bandwidth on your hosting looks to be way too small, you should be able to test this directly by downloading a large file to verify or talk to your hosting provider . The quality of the video may be too high for what you are using it for.  Consider reducing its resolution and re encoding it to a lower quality/bandwidth. Reduce the length of the video or break it into several smaller videos. The last 2 will be important if you cant resolve the first 2 === https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=463795#p1862129 Now the direct video www.CASP.ca/ video.mp4 (without the space) is delivered trouble-free, the people here could compare it with the H5P videos you posted in the OP . For example this NS_BINDING_ABORTED doesn't look right.

RESOLUTION: the issue is not with Moodle, but with Plesk, and specifically nginx. Moving the slider causes the video player to send html code 206 (Partial content) to the server. However Plesk's nginx.conf file does not recognize code 206, so it restarts the video from the beginning. To fix this, the following lines need to be added to \"location /\" section location / { proxy_set_header Range $http_range; proxy_set_header If-Range $http_if_range; } This fixes the problem. Plesk might fix this in future releases, but this is the solution.",

          "Text": "There was a problem a few versions back, where the 'container' that contained the H5p content was dynamically reacting, so it would load, then resize itself slightly to fit, but that then changed the dimensions, so it resized again - and it basically got into a repeated loop of making itself slightly bigger then slightly smaller which appeared to the user as flickering. If my memory is correct it only did it on certain browsers (sorry I forget which) and it only did when the screen width was within a certain range (e.g. it didn't happen on narrow screens or very wide screens). The solution was to add some CSS to change the way the container behaved - but as this was a few versions back, I no longer have that code, but if you use the inspect tools to inspect the page as it is doing it, you may be able to work out the culprit, and make the necessary tweak to stop it from happening. Apologies for being slightly vague here, but it was 4 or 5 years ago that this happened - I thought it had gone away for ever so didn't keep the code that fixed it.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We have a problem with embedded H5P files in moodle 4.1.7. These H5Ps are embedded in pages or other activities . Some of the H5Ps are displayed, others are not. In the latter case, you will only see an empty box instead of the H5P. If the H5P is not displayed, the following error message appears in Chrome DevTools ( <name> is a string of 40 digits and lowercase letters. It is different for each H5P file): `Uncaught TypeError: H5P.isEmpty is not a function at new H5P.QuestionSet(<name>.js)` I think these JavaScript files are specific to the content type “Quiz (Question Set)”. This is also the content type of all H5Ps we are currently dealing with. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the content of <name>.js is not always the same: Some files contain calls to H5P.isEmpty() , namely in H5P.QuestionSet() and in this.getCurrentState() . H5P.isEmpty() is precisely the function that was not found according to the error message. In other files, the code that calls H5P.isEmpty() is missing. The string “isEmpty” does not occur at all in these cases, although both of the above functions occur. Can someone explain what the <name>.js files are all about? In the browser, these are accessible via paths like /pluginfile.php/1/core_h5p//cachedassets/<name>.js . The error seems to have occurred a few days ago, after the H5Ps had been working until then. I wonder if we can (and should) make sure that in all cases a JavaScript file is created that does not call isEmpty() . I have read recommendations to empty the database tables h5p_libraries and h5p_libraries_cachedassets . However, this involved error messages of the type “H5P -> Unable to find constructor for ...”. Could it also be useful in our case? I assume that the tables will then be filled again - which brings me back to the question of why there are different versions of this JavaScript file.

          "Text": "H5P was created at a time where HTTP/2 was not available and where each file that had to be loaded increased the overall loading time of a page significantly. That's why the H5P integrations bundle all of all the content type JavaScript/ CSS files that are required (unless explicitly told otherwise by setting `$CFG->mod_hvp_aggregate_assets = '0';`, don't know if moodle's custom H5P integration features something similar). Think of Course Presentation for instance - it has multiple subcontents which themselves have different dependencies that all need to get loaded. Those bundles are the files inside the `cachedassets` directory. Each file represents a bundle of all the JavaScript/CSS files required for a content type, so only two files need to get loaded per content type instead of dozens or even more. Those files are usually created the first time a content is viewed if I recall correctly. If you remove the files from the `cachedassets` directory (and ideally from the `h5p_libraries_cachedassets` table in the database, not sure if it gets cleaned up), the files will be recreated if missing. Do never delete anything in the `h5p_libraries` table, however! Don't understand why anyone would suggest that. Those table holds the list of all the content types that are installed including all kinds of information on them. You will need to reinstall them without their respective entries - that is why you get the `Unable to find constructor` message. Regarding `H5P.isEmpty`: That is a function in H5P's core that is run to detect (de facto) empty objects. If it is not found, then H5P core is not loaded properly - which has nothing to to with the cached assets.",

They contain a directory H5P.QuestionSet-1.17 , with the following lines (among others) in library.json : `\"title\": \"Question Set\",` `\"description\": \"Put together a set of different questions that has to be solved. (Quiz)\",` `\"contentType\": \"question\",` `\"majorVersion\": 1,` All buggy H5Ps use version 1.20.12 of the same content type, while our moodle has both versions 1.17.6 and 1.20.26 installed (As I understand it, the latest patch version replaces older ones, while major/minor versions are installed side by side). About H5P.isEmpty() : Initially, I wondered if files with incorrect content could have been generated during caching. Now, I see that H5P.isEmpty() is used in version 1.20.26 of „Question Set“, but not in versions 1.20.12 , or 1.17.6 . Potential Compatibility Issue: Another observation is that in version 1.20.26 of the content type, library.json specifies coreApi version 1.26, while our Moodle uses h5plib_v124 . I wonder if this might cause compatibility issues. Fortunately, our h5p_libraries table is intact.

The `isEmpty` function was introduced with version 1.26 and is not available in H5P core 1.24. I can't tell, however, how you were able to install version 1.20.26 of Question Set as it requires H5P core in version 1.26 since version 1.20.20. The H5P Hub does not signal \"Update available\" if the H5P integration does not meet the core requirements. From what I know, Moodle's custom H5P integration (which does not feature the H5P Hub) uses the very same guard mechanism when fetching new libraries from the H5P.org server . And as far as I know, installing a library by uploading H5P content as an admin also would yield an error message - hence many people wondered why they could not upload someone's H5P content (that had been created with a content type using H5P core 1.26). The most obvious solution would be to use h5plib_v126, but I assume you would have done that already if you could - still Moodle 4.1? A simple patch would be to add the `isEmpty` function ( https://github.com/h5p/h5p-php-library/blob/master/js/h5p.js#L2143-L2164 ) to the h5p.js file that is hosted by h5plib_v124, but I am not aware if some other changes were introduced with 1.26 that might still be required. Instead of patching that file, pseudo-polyfilling that function in some extra JavaScript might also be an option. Once the H5P object is created, usually once `document.readyState` is `interactive` or later you could inject the `isEmpty` function as well. Here, you'd need to remember to remove that side-loaded JavaScript when you update H5P's core, or at some point it might cause trouble when the `isEmpty` function changes. You could also \"downgrade\" to Question Set 1.20.19 which is the last on to use H5P core 1.24 . That's possible \"quite\" easily, because the parameter structure of the content type is still the same. That would require to get the respective JavaScript files from the 1.20.19 tag ( https://github.com/h5p/h5p-question-set/tree/1.20.19 ) and replace the current ones, to change the entry in `h5p_libraries` (patch version from 26 to 19), and to clean the cachedassets, so they can be rebuilt. That should be it in this case, but I might have forgotten something. I'd not think this is a good solution though unless you can make sure that Question Set 1.20.20 won't find its way onto your platform. Seems to have happened before even though it should not have been possible.",

          "Text": "H5P is not a plugin for Moodle only, but a framework that can be put into all kinds of integrations, and in order to be able to make it flexible to use in different contexts, it was split into different components. If you have a look at H5P's architecture , you will notice the term \"H5P integration\" which is what is commonly called a plugin, but Moodle's native H5P integration is yet another one. On top of that integration there's the \"H5P core\" which has nothing to do with Moodle's core. It supplies common functions that H5P content type libraries may require. The function `H5P.isEmpty` is one of those functions. It was introduced with H5P core 1.26. If content types need at least that version to run, but the respective H5P integration does not supply it, then those content types will not be available for use. The H5P integration would need to be updated to support that later version of H5P core. I don't know whether you're running the H5P plugin for Moodle (doubt that, because its latest version supports the latest version of H5P core and you'd probably have tried to simply update that one) or whether you're using Moodle's own H5P integration (with the blue icon and the content bank). The latter provides the H5P core as part of a separate plugin (H5P integration library) with v127 being the latest. It will give you - you guessed correctly, H5P core 1.27 which is required by a number of younger content type versions to run. Moodle 4.3.8 and 4.4.4+ provide it automatically, 4.2 is the minimum requirement for it to run. You can check what version of Moodle's H5P integration library is installed at \"Site administration -> H5P -> H5P settings\".",

So far, this method does not appear to be working.  I've written the following code in our renderers.php that should be reading our css file.  I've attached both below: The above CSS was lifted from inspecting the exact elements we wanted to change in Chrome's Developer Tools.  In short, we want to change the color of the \"Start\", \"Proceed\", and \"Finish\" buttons in the Branching Scenario H5P object.  Lines marked with \"!important\" are lines that are different from the default CSS. Delving into the comments from that guide to find out why that implementation wasn't working, I discovered a post linking to this thread from elsewhere on the Moodle forums.  Our organization uses the Almondb theme, and while I'm not sure if it's Fordson-derived like this user's post, it does feature the same theme/[themename]/classes/output structure where they needed to write a new renderer.  I did as such, primarily using the same code I wrote in renderers.php, but specifying a namespace of almondb\\output.  This similarly did not implement our H5P elements, and in-fact appeared to interfere with the H5P editor and preventing it from loading.  I've since deleted the mod_hvp_renderer file since it was preventing our trainers from doing their work. Has anyone else had success with implementing CSS for H5P using Almondb or a similar theme, or is anyone able to see potential errors with my CSS or renderers.php?",

From what you have described, sounds like you developed the h5p content on local computer and the video used for the interactive is coming from your local computer - video not included in the h5p file.  Thus, you are the only one who can see it. Think the .h5p file is really a zip.  So on your local computer, put the .h5p file in a test directory, change the extension to .zip, and unzip it to see. Reason am thinking that is what you said: 're-implement my h5p content backups (MBZ file)' That, I think, would basically ' upload ' the video to your moodle. 'SoS', Ken",

          "Text": "Hola Carolina! Thanks for re-posting your question here (as advised on the H5P forum). You say \" I am using the plugin (blue icon) installed by me \". Actually the Moodle core H5P activity (the blue icon) cannot have been installed by you, it's part of the standard Moodle plugins so it's already installed when you install your Moodle site. Then you say \" I have been trying to use the Bank content in Moodle to create activities ( black icon ), ... \" Again you are wrong, H5P activities created in the Bank content can be used in your Moodle course by using the blue icon. OK, don't panic, you are not the first Moodle user to experience difficulties understanding how to work with the H5P activities. In my opinion (and I'm not alone) things are un-necessarily complicated. Here is my advice to take things from the beginning to get it to work. 0.- Are you the admin of your Moodle site, or do you have admin rights? 1.- Forget about the external H5P plugin (the black icon). If you can see that black H5P icon on when you try to add a new H5P activity, then it means that you installed that plugin. There is no need to use that . 2.- Take your time and read carefully the online Documentation for H5P here: https://docs.moodle.org/en/H5P and also here https://docs.moodle.org/en/Content_bank 3.- After you have understood the concept of \"Content Bank\", in one of your courses of your Moodle Site, go to the Content Bank page and check that you can see the whole list of H5P activities available here: the H5P Interactive content drop-list looks very short, but use the scrollbar to display the full list. If you can see (approx.) 40 h5p activities in the list, then you are set to go. Just click to select one activity, create it, and follow the Documentation help to put your H5P activities inside your course(s). If this doesn't work, come back here with more information... IMPORTANT Have you read this important notice: Important update: H5P content types version bump - Recommendations to avoid issues ? And finally, could you possibly update your Moodle site to version 4.5? One more thing, have you tried to create more simple H5P activities, such as Multiple Choice, or Drag the Words, etc. before trying the \"complex\" activities such as Interactive Video or Interactive Book, etc?",

I think the most important difference in the options is how the package files are stored and managed. The content bank provides a convenient place to store a content package so that it may be used in more that one place with out duplicating the file. A package in the content bank can be included with the filter in multiple locations or the file can be linked into activity using the Moodle file system using the content bank repository which is searchable. If you edit the package, changes will appear every the package is linked. These features are unique to the content bank implementation. If you do not need these file management features, it does not matter as much which implementation you use (the other implementations may be more straight forward because that lack these features).",

I am only mentioning this as we know there are user account issues for teachers inheriting H5P content, and this could be a red herring I just want to mention was thoroughly investigated already. I created multiple H5Ps in the course level content bank, and then used the H5P activity itself to add them as an activity to the course in question. I then had to take a few of the activities to another course and had a reason I wanted put them in the course level content bank, so I downloaded the originals, went to the new course, uploaded them to the content bank. I made my edits, added them as H5P activities, and all was fine. Now, when I as a site admin attempt to click the Edit H5P Content in either course, I get the below debugging error. 1.

If your server is running a PHP version earlier than 8.0 (like PHP 7.4 or earlier), this function doesn't exist, and any calls to it will result in an error. To resolve this issue, consider upgrading your server to PHP 8.0 or higher to ensure compatibility with the latest functions used by Moodle and plugins like H5P.

Students who score below 80% should not have access to any feedback or see which questions they answered incorrectly.

          "Text": "Hi Danny from Catalyst, Short answer is : it can't be done with H5P alone. But... if you combine an H5P activity with the power of Moodle, you can get a workable result. Here’s a detailed approach to achieve this goal: First, create the quiz using H5P and integrate it into Moodle as an H5P activity. Make sure that the H5P content is set to record attempts (using xAPI if necessary) to accurately track scores. Then, use Moodle’s grading feature to record the results of the H5P quiz. This will enable you to use the grade as a condition for accessing feedback. Next, create an additional activity or resource (such as a page or file) that contains the correct answers or feedback on the students' mistakes. Use Moodle’s \"Restrict Access\" feature to ensure that this resource is only available to students who have achieved a grade of 80% or higher. To configure this, go to the resource settings, then to \"Restrict Access,\" and add a condition based on the H5P quiz grade (e.g., Grade >= 80). By default, students with a score below 80% will not be able to see the resource containing the feedback, as the access restriction will automatically exclude them. Finally, make sure to test this setup with a student account to verify that the access conditions work as intended. This method leverages Moodle's conditional access features alongside the flexibility of H5P activities to meet the specific feedback requirements. By ensuring that grade tracking is enabled for the H5P activity, you can precisely control who has access to the feedback. HTH --C",

The version of Column that moodle is trying to install today is 1.17, no longer 1.16.7, which was the one that included the patchVersion reference. The download task works fine and downloads this content types on moodle 4.3 and 4.4, but not on 4.1. I'd say there is something else. I hope someone can check it. Regards",

          "Text": "Good morning everyone, I work on a 4.1.4 (production) and 4.3.3+ (testing) platform. The theme in use is Boost. The course formats I use are the standard one ( sections ) or Tiles format. The text editor in use is Tiny MCE. I use the H5P plugin ( black icon activity ) The problem I describe below occurs in both versions and with the different course formats and even if I change the type of text editor. On the previous version of the platform (3.7+), on the other hand, everything worked fine. I would like to understand how to solve it and if there are alternatives. Details In my courses, for ease of navigation, instead of putting H5P activities directly into sections, I decided embed those presentations into labels (or text or media areas) . This way the user can do the activities and then simply scroll down without having to first exit the activity and return to the course. The problem is that the embedded H5P activity is displayed cut off and thus missing the movement panes or the media progress bar, etc.. I have tried 3 types of embedding code. The first one: <p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;\">short description or subitle.</span> </p> <div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\" align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> I've already tried changing the dimensions defined within the code , but nothing changes. However, if I put scrolling =\"yes\" the user can at least scroll down and see the rest of the activity...but it's annoying. The second: As the first one, but adding: <script\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/library/js/h5p-resizer.js\"\ntype=\"text/ javascript \"></script> In this case the activity appears cropped, but with a click on the activity it is resized. The third: (which worked on the 3.7+ platform) <div\nalign=\"center\" class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe\nclass=\"embed-responsive-item\"\nsrc=\"https://[my_site]/moodle/mod/hvp/embed.php?id=2683\"\nwidth=\"900\" height=\"506\" frameborder=\"0\"\nscrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> This format, which should facilitate viewing with mobile devices, remains \"cropped\" and does not resize or I have to set scrolling to yes (as the first). The goal is to have the H5P window fully displayed. Can anyone help me or provide a better code, please? THANK YOU. 😀 David.",

Here's what I've done: I created an activity using the \"H5P Interactive Content\" tool, for example, a multiple choice quiz. I saved the activity and returned to the course. In the same course, I added a text and media field and clicked on the H5P icon in the toolbar of the editor to browse repositories. When I navigated to the \"Content Bank,\" it appeared empty. Additionally, when I download the H5P file that I just created and try to upload it through the same H5P icon in the editor (by browsing repositories and then selecting 'upload a file'), the content bank still shows no files. Is it no longer possible to upload an H5P file and access it in the content bank for the purpose of duplicating an H5P activity? Has anyone else encountered this issue or have suggestions on how to resolve it? Thanks for any help you can provide! cheers, Boris",

          "Text": "Helllo everyone, First of all, we are using the H5P core activity in Moodle 4.2.4. When adding an H5P-file from the content bank to an H5P-activity in Moodle I want to change the default setting from 'link to the file' to \"Make a copy of the file\". I seem to remember that \"Make a copy of the file\" was the original default setting, but we presumably changed that some time ago.  Now that we would like to revert to the original setting, we can't seem to find how or where to do that in the site admin settings. Is there a way to do that?  And, if so, where could you do that? Many thanks in advance! Joost",

This plugin integrates seamlessly and provides a user-friendly interface to work with H5P content without leaving your course environment. Additionally, as of Moodle 3.8 and later, H5P support is included as part of core Moodle. This means you have the capability to create and interact with H5P content directly within Moodle without the need for any additional plugins. This core integration also supports the tracking of student interactions with the content, which can be incredibly beneficial for educational purposes. HTH C.",

Going back to the previous hvp was a good suggestion. I replaced the current hvp/ (in 4.1) with the one which was in 3.11 and it works! Initially it said something about a newer version installed, I forged the date of the plug-in in version.php until it was accepted. Now it goes. The plug-in screen says: Notice the wrong date 2023033000 which I forged. What does all that mean? I should NOT take (for my 4.1) the suggested version 1.23.2 (2023061200) as shown in https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_hvp/versions rather take this 1.22.2?",

On the Moodle platform I have published 8 case studies using H5P's Interactive Video tool. The video source is Vimeo. All 8 are configured the same way, but the first 4 are displayed normally while the next 4 are not. The error displayed is \"Vimeo video cannot be uploaded.\" In a test done both from the corporate network and on an external network, the error shows up only from an iPhone device (with both Safari and Chrome). However, someone reports to me that the latest 4 videos are not available from any device at all! I also have other videos posted with the same system around the platform, in other courses, and everything works fine. Since the videos were viewed sequentially, I thought it was a working memory/cache issue, but it doesn't change even after deletion, and if I'm not mistaken, Vimeo doesn't do caching. I've tried changing the video links (SD, HD, etc.), but it doesn't solve the problem. After manipulating the activity I noticed two more errors appearing (see attached image): SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate. Unable to communicate with H5P hub. Please try again later. I don't know which way to turn. Can anyone help me with this? Thank you very much. David.",

When you upload a new Interactive Book or try to edit an existing one (or a duplicated one) you get an error message: The version of the H5P library H5P.CoursePresentation used in this content is not valid. Content contains H5P.CoursePresentation 1.25, but it should be H5P.CoursePresentation 1.24. And then the Course Presentation disappears from the Book, but in a weird way. There is a blank activity without a type replacing the presentation, so it is there but not at the same time. As far as I know, it only happens when a B ook contains a Presentation . I have tried to update the libraries, but it didn't help. What else can I do? Our sandbox settings look identical to me, is there anything I can double-check/remove/add to make it work again? See attached screenshots and plugin list. We are on Moodle 4.1.6+ (Build: 20231110) Thx Ferenc",

So I created an  h5p - activity with the content type \"transcript\" in Moodle and added a youtube-video. To that video I added a sample question and a submit screen. Before I'd did so also for an activity \"interactive video\". The users are now able to submit their answers to the videos. Having enough points, the users are in case of the \"interactive video\" able to pass the activity. So I can use the passing as a criteria for making other hidden activities visible. Unfortunatelay that does not work for the \"transcript\" Although they are very similar. My Settings for the transcript are: In the beginning I also had probs to unlock the completion of the \"interactive video\". But you can do that via the activity report. So my question is , what must be done use a trancript in order to have a switch for other activities to be visible/hidden or in other words how can I make an h5p-activity with content type \"transcript\" be passable?

It looks like your content got \"corrupted\" at some stage, and is missing the Behaviour settings. I notice there is a mix of Spanish and English languages in the content.json file (inside the H5P archive, which is not accessible). Anyway I have re-used your original text in a working version of H5P Drag the Words, and am attaching it to my reply. Please check that it works on your Moodle site. If there aren't too many H5P Drag the Words contents  that have the same problem, you can easily edit them, copy the Text field, paste it inside the Text field of a  newly created content, and save.

          "Text": "Hi all! I have a question regarding moodle's custom H5P integration. Does it really not feature a batch upgrade process for existing H5P contents? H5P libraries can exiist in different versions. Let's assume the latest version of \"Mark the Words\" was 1.0. I create some \"Mark the Words\" contents now. Then version 1.1 gets released and installed. If I now create new \"Mark the Words\" content, it will automatically use the 1.1 version. The existing content will not be touched however. It will still run version 1.0. So far, so good. If I wanted to upgrade my existing content to version 1.1, usually because the newer version has new features or relevant bug fixes, I have two regular options (with H5P Group's H5P integrations for moodle, WordPress or Drupal): I can edit the content and save it again. That will automatically migrate the content to the latest content type version available. The same happens if you upload content of an older version to a platform that already provides a newer library version by the way. I can run a batch upgrade to convert all existing content of some type to a later version. Now, while moodle's custom H5P integration implements 1), I can't find a way to do 2). Am i just too tired/stupid, or does moodle really not implement a batch upgrade process in its custom H5P integration? I mean, the general code is available, of course. It's inside H5P's core that every H5P integration uses, but an H5P integration must supply a user interface.",

He is not asking about the automatic handling of updating H5P libraries, which is a task automatically run by the Moodle cron. He was asking about the absence of a feature to automatically update existing H5P contents when a newer version of the library/ies they use has been updated by cron. That is a different issue... To answer your question, as far as I understand (and with behaviour observed on Drupal and Wordpress), older versions of H5P libraries are kept available (and get displayed on the Moodle site / Manage H5P content types) for as long as they are used/needed by contents which are using them. On Drupal , libraries which are not or no longer being used are clearly marked, so they can be deleted without fear of causing problems. On Moodle , it is not clear, because all content types and libraries have the Delete icon available! This is a real interface problem.",

Basically, until a couple of days ago, H5P activities were displayed correctly whether they were embedded in a label or displayed directly by clicking the activity. Now I see them all very small, positioned in the upper right corner compared to the original space they should occupy. I did not make any updates before the problem and even updating the plugin does not change anything. In fact, now it has asked me to activate the OER hub and I am getting an SSL problem... Have any of you experienced this problem before and were able to solve it? Thanks for any help. Merry Christmas. David 😊",

I am moodle admin for our school and a teacher let me know one of her youtube videos got taken down that she uses. She had interactive content in the \"summary task\" section. I think I know the answer to my question, but am just checking with others. So since the questions were timestamped in h5p to an existing video and now the video has since been taken down, it seems h5p had deleted the content/questions from the summary task section. Is there a way to find the old questions now or are they just gone forever since they were linked to the video that no longer exists? Thanks!",

The process which loads the H5P activities afterwards is contained into a task (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task) which should run once a day. But for this, another process is needed : the Cron , which is essentially a little server programmed to keep running on the web server and executing the tasks on due time. And according to my own observations, the Cron is a part often forgotten when installing Moodle without the assistance of a professional... I hope this clarifies the process. HTH C.",

If the Moodle contents have been installed by your admin, then you could go to your course's Content Bank and create your H5P activities there, then export them to your computer and re-import them in the h5pactivity plugin. Or you could install Lumi on your own machine, create H5P activities there, export and re-import to your Moodle site. But let's hope someone finds a solution to our problem to avoid having to resort to workarounds.",

I noticed this with new installations, since the task frequents is like 1 a month, when you have a new install it does not straight away 'downloads'/ 'make the contenttypes' avaiable. If you are a site admin (or when not give them these instructions): Login to site Go to Server > scheduled task search for the task \" Download available H5P content types from H5P.org (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task) if the column last run says \"never' then click on the radar fill in at minute */1, the rest is * Save the changes Wait 1 to 5 minutes (it kind of depends on how frequently your cron is running) Refresh the page, check if column last run now has a data and time Click on the 'radar' again check thebox \"Reset task schedule to default\" Save changes Go to the COntent bank and check if you now see Contentypes. If this did not work, check with your technical team/server contantperson if the Cron is correctly configured. Redo the steps. I hope this fixed your issue. Gemma",

I have a  course that uses a lot of h5p content, and now I am looking for a way to convert this content to a new content type version. I am using Moodle Moodle 4.1.6+ (Build: 20231013) and using the native h5p plugin provided by Moodle (the blue button). I am aware of this post , but there it is only mentioned that content can be upgraded when saving an individual item. This is great of course, but is there any way to do a batch upgrade for all content (as it seems to be the case for the 3rd party hvp plugin?). It is no problem for me to script this if needed, I have access to the server .",

When I embedd this H5P content by uploading  through the atto H5P button the file is accepted and the H5P configuration can be edited through the `Edit H5P content` link. However the content of the H5P does not display and the console shows an error of \"Unable to find constructor for: H5P.HourglassTimer 1.0\" Presumable the embedded library is not being extracted and installed and Moodle is only looking at the libraries that come loaded with the H5P core activities ? I tried uploading the H5P Content  through Site administration / H5P / Manage H5P content types and the content type does get installed but again the embedded library is not added as an installed H5P library. I have also tried installing the H5P Plugin where it does allow me to upload library byt Does anyone know how to load a custom library?  I know it's possible for the H5P plugin. I've tried loading my custom content type with that but also receive same error. Thank you in advance.",

That said, I had success in getting my custom content type with embedded library to load as an interactive content activity and also embedded in a resource Basically it came down to making sure the library JS code has no errors. In my case I was using an `import` statement which is not supported and so the JS file was not preloaded by H5P and therefore H5P was not able to find a constructor for it. But after sorting it out, everything now works and my custom content type is rendered",

Many of the chapters in the course are made up of 3 - 10 H5P files. I would like the experience for students to be as seamless as possible, and not have to go back out to the course menu between H5Ps. I am looking for some best practices here. I will also need to be able to Restrict Access to future chapters until earlier chapters are completed. So, I need to preserve completion data - not for individual H5Ps, but for the collection that make up a chapter. I have some H5Ps that are quizzes. I'm fine with the quiz being a separate experience so that it can be graded on its own with no complications. I have seen some discussion about putting these all on a page, book, or lesson activity. Does someone have a resource for which method to use and why, or a pros / cons list for each, or something helpful in the way of best practices here? Thank you!",

I did a test with a couple of H5P packages and they seemed to work fine in the app, maybe it's a problem in the package itself. I recommend you to use the same H5P package but using the Moodle H5P activity (available since Moodle 3.9) to see if the same issue happens. The H5P integrated in Moodle has a blue logo and the activity name is just \"H5P\" instead of \"Interactive content\". If the same problem happens with the H5P activity integrated in Moodle, please send the H5P package to us so we can take a look. If it only happens with the mod_hvp plugin then you'll need to contact the plugin maintainers because this is a 3rd party plugin, we didn't develop it. Cheers, Dani",

          "Text": "I have upgraded to Moodle 4.1 Here is just one of the millions of issues I have to find a way to fix now. This one concerns issues with embedding H5P activities (hvp plugin) in any html box. The original activity description is automatically added at the top of the embedded activity (this was not the case with Moodle 3.x). I do not want the description to show as it is not relevant to students. There is something not working with the sizing of the activity frame.  No matter what I do for \"width\" and \"height\", it cuts off the activity at a certain height, and users can't see the lower part of the activity including the \"Check\" buttons. An additional \"style=\"width: ; height: ;\" is added to the original embed code. That html code also always falls back to a certain height number (here: 527px). Example: <iframe src=\" URL \" width=\"100%\" height=\"1200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" title=\"XXX\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 527px;\"></iframe>",

It's about that the activity description is automatically added in the cases where I embed the H5P activity in an iframe, along with the tag \"complete the activity\".

One suggestion in the thread regarding the embedding is \"You can go to the HTML code of your activity page, and put the H5P div into another div with a min-height style property set. This should do the work...\" Not sure if that would fix the problem here, since the code is already adding additional height and width in the iframe. Anyway, it seems that within Moodle I can mostly get it to work alright if I go into the HTML code, then change the width to 100% both times and adjust the height to whatever I need both times, e.g. And then I click Save WITHOUT leaving the html mode. (If I leave html mode before saving, it just reverts back to some other height value in the second instance which cuts the activity off)",

It should be (and is) usable for all kinds of contents and content for teaching and learning also goes way beyond the notion of assessments. B ut if high-stakes assessments are that crucial (I am not a teacher, I cannot judge) , then choosing client-side evaluation was clearly a design flaw. I don't know the background however, so I can't tell what the prerequisites were. Server-side evaluation is on the roadmap of H5P Group, but I don't thing this is going to hit the shelves soon, because it would mean quite some work to redesign the core of H5P and also existing content types. So, the answer to \"Where are the other knowledgeable programmers?\" most likely is at \"H5P Group\". There are not too many H5P developers outside of the H5P core team, at least as far as I now of. I also don't believe that the moodle team is going to invest resources. And my answer to \"why aren't they helping to set the record straight\" would be manifold: lack of documentation (for external contributors), lack of interest (the moodle team included H5P in core even though they knew it's using client-evaluation when they started, and they probably don't want to invest resources in \"competition\" that would make it easier to get server-side evaluation into other platforms, too), lack of funding (the number of developers who would work on this in their free is tiny), complexity of the project (many technical aspects, possibly even coordinate developers inside and outside of the H5P core team), ...",

It's quite obvious that for \"Multiple Choice\" the answers field holds the answer options including the text and the correct state. The structure will vary from content type to content type, but the principle is the same for all of them. The H5P Core transfers all the parameters that were entered by the editor from the server side to the iframe on the client side by passing a JSON object that follows the same structure as semantics.json. You could retrieve that information as part of the `window.H5PIntegration` object as `window.H5PIntegration.contents[cid-<contentId>].jsonContent` directly from memory. Just try running `for (id in window.H5PIntegration.contents) { console.log(JSON.parse(window.H5PIntegration.contents[id].jsonContent)); } // no error handling` in the development console inside either the H5P iframe's context or its parent's context and explore the output.

If we still try to create this content, we end up with an empty content.  This time, the web console have the following error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slides') If we try to add the course presentation demo from the H5P site we can see this error message : Exception : Call to a member function get_content() on bool And these two errors in the web console : 1) Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () 2) h5p.js?ver=1680857919:997 Uncaught ReferenceError: H5PIntegration is not defined We have versions 1.25.5, 1.24.14 and 1.22.11 of course presentation installed. We used to have other problems like infinite loading for previously created resources but we managed to fix that by uninstalling and manually reinstalling a few H5P components. We've had a lot of network issues on the day where the scheduled task \\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task executed so it's possible that we lost connection to the H5P server halfway through the task. H5P worked correctly before that scheduled task executed back in May. For reference, I've previously posted that same question on the H5P forums where they told me that the problem seemed to come from Moodle.",

          "Title": "Issue with H5P Multichoice Question Set - Incorrect Display of Options",
          "Text": "Dear Moodle Support Team, I am writing to report an issue I am experiencing with the H5P multichoice question set in Moodle. When I create a multichoice question and enter four options for the question, the options are not displayed correctly on the frontend. Instead, it shows \"Answer 1\" as the option for each question. I have performed the following troubleshooting steps without success: Double-checked the configuration settings and verified that the options and correct answers are entered correctly. Ensured that I am using the latest version of the H5P plugin and that it is compatible with my Moodle version. Tried switching to a different theme to rule out any theme conflicts. Cleared the cache in Moodle and my browser to ensure I am loading the latest version of the H5P content. Despite these efforts, the issue persists. I have attached a screenshot of the problem for your reference. Could you please investigate this issue and provide guidance on how to resolve it? I rely on the H5P multichoice question set for interactive quizzes, and this issue is affecting the usability and functionality of my course. Here are some details about my setup: Moodle version: 3.10 H5P plugin version: 1.23.0 Theme being used: Edwiser RemUI I would appreciate any assistance or insights you can provide to help me resolve this issue. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Plz help me to solve this issue. Best regards, (Edited by Mary Cooch to remove personal details - original submission Saturday, 3 June 2023, 10:34 AM)",

Just re-read https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=445833#p1791939 , where it says \"You state \"All of the \"missing\" libraries are already in the package,\",\nwhich is wrong.

A teacher shared the attached screenshot with me showing the errors she received when she attempted to upload some H5P content. You can see even core components like jQuery and \"main library\" are missing, which leads me to believe there's a file permission or installation issue. However, I've been unable to determine what it might be. I should note that I manually downloaded the plugin and installed it on the command line. I did not use the automatic moodle.org install process. However, it was working after it was initally installed under a previous version of Moodle a year or two ago.

I've taken the liberty to create a more meaningful H5P Drag & Drop activity (attached). I've created this same Drag & Drop activity both using the H5P core activity (the Blue icon), and the H5P plugin (the Black icon identified as Interactive Content). Here's what it looks like with the Blue icon. With my activity I can confirm that there seems to be a problem with the Moodle H5P core activity reporting. If a student answers correctly and get a score of 4/4, the reporting looks different in the H5P contributed plugin and in the Moodle core H5P, as can be seen in the screenshots below: The report for the H5P plugin shows Computer and Tulip both correctly entered in the Not animals Dropzone. The report for the H5P core activity does not display the Tulip as having been entered in the Not animals Dropzone. More testing is needed, after which a bug report should be entered.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, I am creating this forum discussion with as purpose: Documentation for those who bump into a similair issue. To get a better view on the reasons why this happend. The issue In some of our courses student and other uses saw the notification below. Background information We have 1 main course that 'holds' the contentbank. In a different course, we add the H5P core activity and add the contenttype from the 'main' course \"link to file\". We have users that have the capability to manage the contentbank (standaard Manager rol). What do we think happend We think that one of these two scenario's that could play a role in this: User account that created and then added the content has been deleted from the Moodle installation, and therefor the file could not find the right user anymore. we have not found any references to this issue on this problem. We also where NOT able to reproduce this scenario in the Moodle instances 3.9 with a test account. We also try to reproduce it in a clean Moodle 4.1 and where unsucusses full. There fore we have not created a Moodle Tracker , since we don't know if there was an underlining issues which makes it difficult to submit the proper reproduction steps. User account has switched a role, without the proper premissions and therefor lost the capability and/or ignored the warning. See tracker: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLQA-14116 how did we solve it We reconnected the H5P contenttypes in the H5P activity. All the contenttypes where there, by reconnecting them we solved the message and the users could work in the contenttypes. - Gemma",

The h5p-files in the content bank was transferred from 3.8 to 4.0, but no H5P´s were shown. It was the links that was broken. The course editors (me) had to insert the h5p-files either in the editor, or as activity from the content bank manually once every single place a h5p-file was in use. i don´t know if this will solve your problem - so hope others are responding as well.

To do this, you need to modify the permissions of the course and the H5P activities within the course. Here's how to do it: Go to the course page and open the course administration menu. Click on \"Permissions\" in the menu (appears in different places according to the version) In the \"Roles with permissions over this course\" section, select the role(s) of the teachers who need permission to edit all H5Ps in the course. In the \"Override permissions\" section, check the box next to \"Edit H5P activity\" to allow the selected role(s) to edit all H5Ps in the course. Click the \"Save changes\" button to save the new permissions. After these steps, all teachers with the selected role(s) will be able to edit all H5Ps in the course, regardless of who created them. Note that if you want to apply these permissions to all courses on the site, you can modify the permissions for the \"Authenticated user\" role in the site administration settings. However, it's generally recommended to modify permissions on a course-by-course basis to avoid unintended consequences.",

Let's go through some common troubleshooting steps to help identify the cause: Ensure the H5P plugin is up-to-date: Check it on the h5p site. Check H5P activity settings: Some H5P content types may not save user attempts by default. Make sure to enable the \"Save content state\" or similar options in the H5P activity settings. This will ensure that user attempts are saved in the database. Verify user permissions: Ensure that the users participating in the H5P activities have the necessary permissions to save their progress. Check the role assignments and capabilities for the users in the course and verify that they are allowed to attempt and save progress for H5P activities. Inspect the browser console: Ask your users (or login as student) to check the browser console for any error messages or warnings when attempting an H5P activity. This could provide useful information about any issues preventing data from being saved. Examine server logs: Check the server logs for any error messages or warnings related to the H5P plugin or the database. This could help identify any issues with the server or the database connection that may be preventing the data from being saved HTH",

Upon uploading an image file to the activity (see below), I can see that the edit gives the default coordinates as 162, 82 and the dimensions of the image as 146, 117. I like my images fully-centred on the screen at coordinates 87, 0 and with the dimensions of 364x272 pixels. See screenshot below. I am interested in modding the h5p code, so the coordinates 87, 0 and the dimensions of 364x272 pixels, show up as default values. That will save me a lot of typing! Imaging changing 4 values 50 times - that's 200 manual edits just to create a h5p version of my powerpoint file! Anyone has any pointers how I can modify the code? Regards Frankie Kam",

The other disadvantage is that - unlike in the Server repository - the link files don't feature an overlay to show that - not even if you switch the CB Repo display list to \"File icons\". I think both are bugs, and I also think the \"File details\" view in the CB repo and Server repo should be improved and always include an overlay clearly telling the file listed is a link, and not an original content file. These checks above done under 3.11.11, but probably  the described Repository behaviours did not change with 4.0.* or 4.1.* .",

The Content Bank repository search as accessed from the File picker (in Moodle 3.11 at least) lists not the H5P package filenames (or links to those), but the \"Content names\" - the same ones shown on the course's Content Bank page. So, indeed, there's discrepancy in the timestamps between both displays - as \"simple\" as that, and that's an obvious bug to me. BTW - also tested for merely renaming a content in the CB - to the same effect : the last modified date/time  has been updated in the course's content bank, but not in the CB repository (Moodle 3.11.11, again). Anything else I wrote in my previous reply (about searching for (link) files using the Server files repo) is actually irrelevant to the original question. The file details view in the Server files repo would indeed benefit if there was an overlay arrow over the file type icon where applicable, but that's an entirely separate story.",

          "Text": "@Christophe, 1.- I agree that this is confusing. The sentence \"Use the content bank (opens in new window) to manage your H5P files\" should be removed from that screen, it's useless and confusing. 2.- There are 2 ways to add an H5P content when using the blue icon: a) directly dropping an H5P content created elsewhere (e.g. with Lumi) into the Files box; b) clicking on the Add icon, which takes you to the Content bank where, hopefully, you have previously created the H5P you need. \"You can drag and drop file s here to add them \" is wrongly formulated, since you are only allowed (of course) to drop one H5P file in that box. This should be re-formulated. 3.- I expect the Moodle programmers who integrated H5P into core could not make up their mind whether to only accept creating H5P course activities by using H5P contents previously created in the Content Bank or to provide an easy \"shortcut\" for using H5P contents created outside the Content Bank. Hence the regrettably confusing interface. 4.- Anyway, I agree with your original post question \"where does it go?\". If an H5P content (created elsewhere)  is inserted directly into a course activity it should automatically be made available in the Content bank. This would be coherent with the way questions are created and inserted into a quiz activity. Questions for a quiz are either created beforehand in the Questions bank where they become available to a new quiz, or created when a new quiz is created, and subsequently become part of the question bank and available to any new quiz.😃",

I have tried using \"update content type cache\" h5p libraries admin and that makes no difference. I can't see the h5p code unless I turned off \"use saved content\" in the h5p admin. If turn that off, I can see the h5p code in the module instance settings, but when I press save it says, \"Something unexpected happened. We were unable to save this content\".

          "Title": "h5P activity missing from content bank",
          "Text": "Hi there, I hope you can help me. Bear with me, it's my first post here... I have a fresh copy of moodle 4.1. I installed it on my own server . So far it's working great with one exception. One reason why I set up moodle is that I really want to make use of h5P. It doesn't quite work however. The problem: I'm using the h5P with the blue symbol (moodle based). When I go to the content bank of a course, I can add and create a h5P activity (e.g. a crossword). The activity gets created just fine and is visible in the content bank of the course when I open the content bank explicitly. Alas, when I now go to the actual course and try to add the activity from the content bank, the activity is just not there. It doesn't matter, whether I try to add the activity by using a text field (h5P button) or using the h5P symbol itself. In the dialogue field where I would be meant to choose the h5P activity from the content bank, there is nothing to choose. I can abort the process, go back to the content bank of the course and there the activity is. But it's not there from the dialog field. Really strange. Maybe I'm missing some sort of right settings or so. I can't figure it out. As a workaround I can download the activity from the content bank and upload it again when creating the activity inside a course. But this is really not too good, e.g. because I then cannot alter the activity and pass through the changes. Does anyone know why I can create h5P contents, but then don't get to see them when trying to insert it as a task inside the same course from the content bank? Thanks in advance and greetings, Andreas",

The course format is \"Topics format\", with Enable completion tracking and Show activity completion conditions enabled.

I am dealing with 2 separate issues: 1) When a student goes through the H5P presentation and answers the question in it, the result does not show in Moodle\nin the grade book. I tried to upload the H5P as a Course activity and also directly into the Topic Summary with same result. The issue is essentially similar to this one, only I am using \"Course presentation\": https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=438975 Do\nI understand correctly that in order to import results from H5P to\nMoodle, I basically have to create a custom script which takes care of\nthe XAPI integration? Or is there another way? 2) When the H5P is uploaded as Topic Summary (not as Activity), can I somehow track that it was completed (viewed) by students (for instance, by going through all slides, or answering to questions)? Or the tracking can only be activated for Course Activity elements? If possible, I would prefer using the Topic Summary than Course Activity, as the student don't have to open the H5P, instead they would see its content right away. Any advice would be appreciated.

If your Course Presentation contains a lot of H5P libraries, this would explain why the total sum of the sizes of your 4 \"parts\" is not equivalent to the size of the \"course original\" file! You ask \"Can anyone suggest a solution or a way fix it, or to decrease the file size of the shorter presentations?\" There is a way,  but this is not a trivial task. You'd have to edit your (parts of course) H5P files (which are just zipped files) and remove all the H5P libraries. But this is not recommended, as it would mean that you could only \"restore\" your files to a site where you are sure that the needed libraries exist. If you still wish to do so, please contact me at my e-mail address in my Moodle profile to discuss the matter. Joseph",

          "Title": "H5P activities with links to CB vs. copying courses - a frustrated teacher/manager’s story, a workaround and some suggestions",
          "Text": "Dear All, This is a\nvery long post..  The matter seems more\nglobal than H5P alone, but for the moment centres around Moodle users of H5P\nand their support staff. I've been\ntrying to figure out how best to advise our users with copying courses with H5P\ncontent. NOT an easy\ntask. It's\nrelatively straightforward (though I would not say friendly / robust) if a teacher\nchose to add and embed H5P activities by using the COPY file option from the Content\nBank, or by uploading ready-made H5P content into the activity or embed. Such H5P\nfiles are frozen to theist contexts, and when the activity is imported or backed\nup and restored (separately or inside the course), a new instance of the H5P\ncontent is copied into the restored / imported target. Why is this\nnot a dream solution? Because any update of H5P  content requires re- upload of the file from\nthe computer (after editing in Lumi etc.) or else re-attachment of the copy from\nthe course’s content bank after it has been edited there. Too much hassle, easy\nto forget all the steps. It’s so much\nmore convenient to link to the Content bank H5P file from an activity or embed,\nand then, when an amendment is needed, to just go inside the Content Bank (via\nthe associated link in the activity when needed), and update / correct the\ncontent. After saving, the post-edits will just get pulled into all\nthe linked places in the course. Great !\nUNTIL you try to copy the course that relies on such linked H5P contents.. For even if\nyou backup the course with all the files and with the Content Bank, and then\nrestore that course in full as a new one, or if you use the Copy course\nfunction, the restore will: 1) Restore all\nthe activities and the Content Bank files alright (with the same H5P content names\n!) BUT 2) the links inside the H5P activities and embeds will link back to the CB contents\nin the ORIGINAL course, and NOT to those in the restored course’s CB. And if you\nhappen to have used, say, 50 different H5P activities and embeds relying on such\nlinks in the original location, then you are likely in trouble. Why? If you’re\nlike me, then it’s likely that each next version of the copied course will be a\nbit different from the previous one, ergo you’ll want to update your H5P\ncontent a bit – but without touching the originals from the past year. Hold on !\nBut my currently restored course H5P contents link back to the CB in my last year’s course\n! And so do the H5P activities and embeds I used last year in that older Moodle course.. I can’t just go back to the CB from\n2021 and post-edit the files, since this would also update my older course (that my students can still access), not just the\ncourse I am creating now. There is no versioning of H5P packages to somehow fall back on. I need\nto edit those H5P contents  that are\nin the restored course's CB. Well, edit those I can, but … the files in the CB there are not linked with the restored activities and embeds. Aaargh! How do\nI now change/refresh all those link associations? How much more time will I have to spend\non that ..? For those determined, here’s my step-by-step\nworkaround for “rescuing” an H5P activity with a link to H5P contents in an\nolder course’s CB: 1) In your RESTORED\ncourse, click on that H5P activity’s name on the course page 2) Go to its\n“Edit settings” 3) Click on\nthe “Access the H5P file in the content bank (opens in a new window)” link – to\nopen the original course’s Content Bank 4) in\nMoodle 3.11 at least – in the breadcrumb navigation you will see the name of\nthe H5P package, (which is usually different from the name of the file itself -\nanother missing detail in the CB – we often need both names to identify a given\nH5P content precisely) 5) Copy\nthat name (if you forget, there’s another chance in Step 7 below). 6) Click on\nthe cog settings icon, then on Rename the content 7) Highlight\nand copy that name (if you forgot or could not in step 5 above), then (I suggest) change\nthe name by appending something at the end , e.g. “_OLD” or last year’s\nschool/academic year “_2021-2022” etc.  The\npoint is to later be able to identify which instance of the H5P content is\nolder and which is in the restored course’s CB, when searching through the CB repository.\nClick Rename to confirm. 8) Close the\nCB editor, and close this window / tab. 9) Go back\nto the restored course’s edit H5P activity’s settings page (which you left off\nat Step 2). 10) Click\non the “Link to X” alias name in the Package file upload area. 11) DELETE\nthe (link) file, and confirm the delete (don’t worry – until you have saved the\nactivity’s Edit settings page, all these changes are temporary, if you make a mistake,\nyou can back out and cancel at the bottom. In any case, we are only deleting\nthe LINK here, not real content files) 12) Click\non the package upload area to bring up the File picker. 13) Make\nsure you’re in the Content bank repo 14) In the\nsearch area paste the name of the H5P file copied in step 5 or 7 above (without\nthe appended part), and hit Enter 15) You\nshould see two or more versions of this H5P content – they will show the same\nfile details (Last modified dates, size etc.), but one of them will have the “_OLD”\nor “_2021-2022” appendix at the end – according to what you entered in Step 7\nabove 16) Click\non the file WITHOUT the appended part in the name – this is the file sitting in\nthe  Content Bank of your newly restored\ncourse, not in the original source 17) Keep\nthe “Link to this file” option, click on the “Select this file” button. 18) Scroll\nto the bottom  of the H5P activity’s Edit\nsettings page, click on “Save and display” to verify the result. 19) The H5P\ncontents should open and you should be able to view them. 20) To\nverify that the link is really that to the H5P content of the restored course,\nand not in the original source course, click on Edit settings again, then on\nthe “Access the H5P file in the content bank (opens in a new window).”  link . This time the link should lead you to\nthe Content Bank of the restored course (inspect the nav details around) . Note\nthe name in the breadcrumb nav (or else go to Edit > Rename, note the name ,\nbut don’t change anything, just Cancel). Close the CB editing . In the Content\nbank that will pop up, you should now see the name of the H5P content file and\nthe number of linked places – it should stand at 1 rather than zero (which is\nwhat it was after the course was restored). If you have a long list of H5P\nfiles here, you can find the right content by typing / pasting its name into\nthe Search box. ( BTW if you compare the URL of the “Access the H5P file in the\ncontent bank (opens in a new window).” link in the H5P activity edits , and that\nto the found H5P resource in the CB, this should be the same link, with the\nsame id number at the end) Now that is\nhow we have updated the H5P contents link for just ONE H5P activity in a\nrestored course. The same steps need to be repeated for all the others..\nTedious, wasteful, irritating, although probably my instructions could be simplified here and there. ALAS, with embedded\nH5P’s the situation is even trickier – there is some trial-and-error involved: 1) Open the\nrestored Moodle activity / resource that contains the “old” H5P embed, go to the\n(Atto) editor area, double click on the H5P grey box to get the “Insert H5P”\npopup 3) From the\nURL copy text box copy the filename – from the end to the last (first from the\nend forward slash) 3) Click\nBrowse repositories 4) In the Content\nbank – UNFORTUNATELY – you cannot search for the filename… You need to click on\nlikely H5P content candidates (it helps if the names suggest the H5P activity\ntype!) , and then inspect in the SAVE AS box what filename the selected Content\n will propose to use – it MUST PRECISELY match\nthe filename you copied in Step 3 above. (You can use Ctrl-F in the browser and\nsearch the modal page for the filename string to verify that it precisely\nmatches your search keyword.) (Actually\nafter you’ve found the right file you may change its save as name , but keep\nthe .h5p extension of the file. Maybe only slightly modify the main part of the\nname, appending a date or part of the current course's short name? These are just\nsuggestions.) 5) With the\nright file in the URL text box, be sure to leave “Link the File” in place (since\nyou will want to be able to edit the H5P content and to automatically refresh the embed via the\ncourse’s Content Bank !) , and click the “Select this file” button . If you\nhaven’t changed the name (Save as, step 4) , then when prompted to overwrite,\nchoose Overwrite or the other automatic Rename option. 6) When returning\nto the Insert H5P modal window, click the “Insert H5P” button 7) On\nreturning to the Edit settings page of the Moodle activity / resource , save the\nchanges, then visit the resource / activity to verify that it works as expected 8) Visit\nthe Content Bank of your course to see how another zero count of linked places\nhas changed to 1, or else incremented by 1. (at the same time the number of linked\nplaces for the related original file in the original course should decrease by\n1). The\nprocedures could have been simpler/quicker if Moodle and its H5P core plugin: - displayed\nboth the H5P content name and the filename together in the Content Bank and in the Content back repository –\nespecially when fixing the restored embeds, it is important to know which H5P content name corresponds\nto which H%P filename; - if the\nContent Bank repository search displayed the course name for the found H5P\ncontents , and/or allowed the user to only search the Content Bank of a\nparticular course, not all the courses they teach and have H5P’s in. Most of\nall, however, or rather on top of the above, I strongly believe that Moodle should\nclearly tell the teacher how it is processing the H5P content when copying /\nbacking-up+restoring a course  -\nespecially in the case of those H5P activities and embeds which rely on LINKS. Moodle\nshould also allow the teacher / manager to: - UPDATE such\nlinks when copying a course, so they point to the same CB contents that are\nbeing copied / restored from the original course into the target course, and\nPREVENT the link updates if the user has unchecked the option to include the\nContent bank in the backup / restore; - keep the\nexisting / original links (as is done now) - BUT with the warning that these\nlinks will point OUTSIDE the newly restored course), and give the additional option\nto exclude the Content bank from the restore since these files will not be linked\nto the restored activities. Altogether,\nunless I have seriously missed something, I believe I have described here a major inadequacy in the way H5P / content bank contents are treated when copying courses (not\nto mention copying and restoring courses between different Moodle sites !). The system\nshould allow the teacher (and manager) to see exactly what’ s going on, and to maintain\ncontrol over that. My description\nis based on Moodle 3.11. Is it any better in Moodle 4..? I have not tested, but\nI'd be surprised. I hope that\nthis post will be found helpful, and maybe taken into account to improve the\nH5P and Content Bank experience in Moodle. I can provide some illustrations if needed, open a\ntracker issue etc. I wonder if\nother users / admins have encountered  similar hurdles, and whether they have perhaps\nfound other ways or golden rules to stay out of trouble..

          "Text": "Thanks, John. Glad you are managing in your way. I never used the black plugin and consciously avoided H5P's in our Moodle's until the core plugin arrived - I feared migration problems. We also don't have stealth enabled, though this is probably irrelevant for me. Using a hidden topic with all the needed H5P activities \"made available\" and linking to those might work, but - again - the core H5P plugin only accepts post-editing inside the Content Bank, so I would be stuck again. One improvement to my scenario I have thought of could be to visit the CB of the target course as a first step after the restore and to rename all the copied, yet unlinked H5P contents in one sitting (by appending the same recognisable sequence to their names), so they appear recognisable at once in any CB repo searches. Sadly the renaming is not quick to achieve - one needs to open a package for editing, click rename from the cog settings, confirm, and close - 4 clicks per single content file. Too many. AND there is no way to search and rename the actual h5p (link) files until you try to re-link a given H5P as an embed - from what I have seen. (Unfortunately, h5p files are not included in server repo searches.) Overall, however, I think until some better file management options are added to the Content Bank, I will advise our users not to use links in H5P activities and embeds, but to use copies from the Content bank (or uploads from the computer). If they use CB for editing, then they simply must remember to re-attach that file to the activity. Luckily, existing attempts appear UNaffected by such updates / replacements. BTW - The \"Linked places\" counter included in Moodle 3.11's Content Banks is useful, but it counts ALL the existing links to the content, also those from outside the current course. We see the count, but we may have no idea as to who and where is linking to that content.. Is it just ourselves in another copied version of the course, or maybe our former co-teacher who has searched and decided to \"re-use\" the content for another course they are teaching. \"Unlisting\" a resource can prevent linking by non-owners of the content (so should perhaps be a default) - though a former co-teacher will of course be able to download a copy of a H5P file in co-taught course and to re-use it elsewhere (which I have no problem with, as this issue is down to pure work ethics; though I also know that is some cases the Owner meta-data gets changed to the current user).",

My solution is to choose a content bank from a different course (that never gets copied) as the repositpry for all h5p content. That way h5ps don't get copied into duplicated coruses without ever being linked to (taking up server space without any function) and I can manage them from this central place. If I want to make an update to an h5p video quiz, I'll copy the file in the reference course content bank, add a number to the h5p file name and link this revised h5p version to the target course as well as the course's template. I am not sure why Moodle doesn't provide the option to make these links relational (always linking to the content bank of the same course where the activity is located) rather than static to a specific location in Moodle space.

          "Text": "Hi Przemek, I am not sure if I fully understand your 'frustration' but to answer your question is it any better in 4.0. I think it is from what I have tested. I have a course called H5P in this course with various H5P content files, using either the H5P blue option where the file is NOT linked, file is linked ór embedded on the page with the Atto. As you can see - with the restoring the course it copied the full contentbank to the new course, regarding the 'solution' that is been used. What I noticed is : 1) The h5P activities where I used 'link to file' are linking to the MAIN course, as I wanted to because that's where i want to do the changes - thoughI would had NOT expected those contenttypes in the contentbank of the 'copied' course due to server space. But on the other hand, in your case you might just want to do that, because if you want to alter something you can easily use this file WITHOUT overwritting the orginal. That said it would be very convint as they would do the same with they activity dupliciteit functionalit, add something like \"copy\" behind the name so you KNOW it is is a copy of an orginal file. 2) The H5P activity where I used \"copy\" file, are now liking to the file in the Restored course. 3) Embedded files are 'linked' to the restored course file. To improve this experience a little bit more my suggestion would be that: when an h5p contenttype is already created and retored from a previous course the H5p contenttype name will have the addition 'restored' (or copy).

          "Text": "Thanks, Christel and Gemma for your replies and suggestions. @Christel - yes, the \"repository\" approach would work, and some teachers or course coordinators are likely to do (discover?) that possibility. It's nice to be able to save server space this way, I agree. However, this scenario should not be imposed on (unsuspecting) users. There should be - like you say - an option to choose an absolute vs relational link to H5P contents when copying courses, at some point, when backing up the course TOGETHER WITH the Content Bank (for which there is a tick box after all). I'm glad we're on the same page here. @Gemma - I think you have a similar scheme to Christel's - a dedicated \"master\" course with H5P activities in it, some of them not using links to its Content Bank but directly using uploaded H5p packages. The latter of course pose no trouble for backup and restore; and if you want to refresh the contents in a new course with such \"all-in-one\" activities, you can replace the uploaded H5P file (most likely bypassing the course Content Bank's editing capabilities). This approach works also with linked H5P - when all you want is re-use exactly the same \"classic\" contents sitting in your Master course's Content Bank. Re: \"(2) The H5P activity where I used \"copy\" file, are now linking to the file in the Restored course.\" - yes, that is what I would like to achieve - but being helped by Moodle's backup+restore UI. Right now I can only do this manually , and I first have to rename all the restored H5P Content bank contents by myself (4 clicks a piece), Too much hassle and too much time wasted (especially if you also want to train others how to use H5P's contents flexibly). I do like your suggestion that the copied / restored course's Content Bank should have the original names adjusted - with sth like \"(copy)\" (or a smarter suffix, maybe time stamp?) appended at the end . I would go further and suggest that the server file itself (which is often named differently than the content name) should also receive the same suffix. This way I would always, wherever searching or linking, be able to distinguish the original \"master\" sources from any later copies. Summing up , an improved scenario for course backup / restores involving H5P with links could perhaps be: 1) if the option to include the Content bank in the backup WAS checked when backing up a course When restoring the course, Moodle could ask if the Content Bank should also be restored (and if the restored course activities should link to the restored CB contents): - if Yes, then Moodle would re-create the CB, rename the H5P content names and files (adding \"_copy\" suffix or whatever), and re-link all the H5p activities and embeds to these copied equivalents; - if No, then: -- if the restore is being done on the same Moodle site as the backup - Moodle restores the course preserving the links to the original course (as is done now) (AND informs the user briefly about it, including reporting the name/link to the master copy course/s) -- if the restore is being done on a different Moodle site - Moodle does NOT (easily) accept the \"No\", but advises to restore the Content bank and to update the links in the restored activities. User could turn this down, and proceed at their own risk (at the end Moodle would, again, list all the broken links plus names and links to the Master course/s). 2) If the option to save content backup was NOT checked when backing up a course: - Moodle restores the backed-up course ON THE SAME SITE retaining the original links (as is done now). (Again, it would be nice if Moodle informed the teacher about it - that there are H5P activities in the course, and that original links will be preserved that go OUTSIDE OF the restored course. That master / source course + link should be listed in the feedback for the user to see it.). (Actually Moodle could even at this stage offer to pull copies of the original H5P contents into the new course's Content Bank ..., and use those in the linked activities - if the user wanted and where the originals are retrievable server-side, respecting all the permissions, public/unlisted status of original H5P contents etc.) - If the restore is on a different Moodle site - Moodle WARNS the user that the course contains H5P content links that come from outside of the current Moodle and that they CANNOT be retrieved . The user could then decide to keep these activities (at their on risk), or not . The list of original links , and names and links of courses they come from, would then be posted on the screen at the end of the restore process) The above would be - more or less - characterise an ideal user-friendly scenario for me. For a start, I would be satisfied if just the parts marked in bold above could be implemented.. All this still mostly based on my Moodle 3.11 experience.. I have yet to explore Moodle 4 more; we're not migrating there this year. Thanks again for all the feedback. Przemek",

I would suggest to ttry Moodle 4.0 because. @Gemma - I think you have a similar scheme to Christel's - a dedicated \"master\" course with H5P activities in it, .. no it is no master course. It was just a course we used, and created copies from to continue new groups. Re: \"(2) The H5P activity where I used \"copy\" file, are now linking to the file in the Restored course.\" - yes, that is what I would like to achieve - but being helped by Moodle's backup+restore UI. Right now I can only do this manually , and I first have to rename all the restored H5P Content bank contents by myself (4 clicks a piece), Too much hassle and too much time wasted (especially if you also want to train others how to use H5P's contents flexibly). this is supported in Moodle 4.0, as i explained.

Repository search and file server search make it easier to locate / associate a given content and file, but that's it. For H5P activities that use links to course's Content Bank, when I backup and restore as a new course / into an empty course, the links continue to point to the original location even if I do include the Content Bank in the backup and then restore. Moodle offers no option to either preserve the original links or to update them relatively to the copied+restored content bank contents with the same names. There is thus - currently - practically NO point in backing up a course including its Content Bank contents since these are NOT going to be assigned to the restored activities. The only indication that the copied Content bank is an orphaned copy are the zero counters for \"linked places\". The teacher who does want to make use of the copied+restored content bank must manually change the linked file inside each restored H5P activity or HTML embed, one by one.",

          "Text": "Hello, I explain how we have been able to solve this problem (in Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona), without accessing activity by activity, in case it can be useful to someone. The changes are delicate (test before in a test environment) and access as a database administrator is necessary. Observing in the table m_files ( mdl_files ), the entries that have as file name (field \" filename \"), \" %.h5p \", and the field \" component \" is an activity (\" mod_% \"), or course (\"course\", label in a section ) we saw that there are entries in which the \" referencefileid \" field is set to \" null \" and others have a numerical value . The ones that have a numerical value are the ones that use a link from the activity to the package. On the other hand, the ones that have the field set to null are the ones that use a copy of the package in the activity itself. The first are the ones. when restored through a backup of the course, when accessing them they show the error indicated in the first post, instead, the second ones (those with the referencefileid field set to null, that is, the activity has a copy of the package, not a link), when restored, they work correctly. Thus, changing the value of the referencefileid field to null in the m_files table of the source environment, converts the link into a copy of the package, allowing the transfer of the activity to a different environment, maintaining correct operation. ... Things to keep in mind ; - We found entries that had the referencefileid field with a numeric value, which when converted to null stopped working in the source environment. It was due to the fact that the file size field of these activities was 0. To solve it, we looked for the entry in m_files, corresponding to the package of the content bank of that classroom, and we copied the value of the file size and contenthash of said entry, to the first one (we did a script). - By converting the link into a copy of the package, the advantage of being able to edit the package in the content bank is lost, and that the changes are transferred directly to the activity... but evaluating the pros and cons, we thought it would be more convenient to apply this change (there were classrooms with more than 100 H5P activities). - Before applying these changes, test in a test environment... 🙂",

          "Text": "Hello, I what to talk about 2 questions. First problem: I have a problem with latex expression in h5p tasks. I have checked if  I create a task in content bank and use latex code, I can see the math expression correctly. However, if I create an interactive task, H5P green icon, and I choose the same task, the math expression is not displayed correctly, I see the latex code formula. Why does it occur? If I create a black icon H5P task and I use the task from content bank, latex is displayed correctly too. I installed the math displayed library and  mathjax in my server , modifing config.php file. I am making an interactive book from green icon H5P and I add different tasks, and in a dialog card I have written math expressions and they are not displayed and I can't create it in the content bank because the interactive books are differents. From content bank has less options than green icon type ( I don't know why). Then, How do I fix this problem? Second problem : I want to use Cornell notes h5p activity. I create the interactive activity (green icon), I select Cornell notes, I design the task and I publish it. When I try it as student role, I can write notes, but I can't save them. If I reload the task, I lose all notes and as teacher, I can't see the student's homework of this task. Can't I track or grade Cornell notes from my students?  Is it a bug? I hope to find solutions to my problems. Thanks.",

This is not only a problem when trying to open the content bank itself, but also when using the file picker to get to the content bank. Content banks with only a few exercises run smoothly. As soon as I get to about 10 H5P-exercises I start to notice the difference in speed. When I have over 30 it becomes very slow. But I have content banks with more than 100 exercises! These become almost inaccesible. Waiting times can be between 5 and 10 minutes. Often I just get a time-out. I read nothing about this on the forum. We can't be the only school with this problem, right?",

The frequent updates that were mentioned usually only cover new translations or some changes to existing translations files.

One could use a service to provide a central storage for the videos and include the material in H5P content at runtime, but then you'd essentially lose the cross-platform sharability of H5P, require to have an open or authenticated third-party service, or to create versions of that service for all the H5P integrations.

But this kind of endeavours are not finished once they are done, that is just the beginning. They have to be maintained, user support offered and above all has to be developed further. Moodle's own h5pactivity is half a rewrite but also a great big step away from mod_hvp's repository for activities to the content bank. I don't know all the details, but what I experience is that the support on H5P growing day by day - on both, the mod_hvp and the h5pactivity. Now to the decision makers: I was surprised that you don't know Martin D. Well, he may not be as well-know as Elon Musk but I expected the percentage to be higher in the moodle.org community.

Moodle makes certain assumptions about what is sent, but if some key messages are not sent by the content it does not record the grade. The behavior will depend on the content type which you did not specify. I do not know what you mean by a 'course'. Is that with an Interactive Video with questions included? If so, it may work to embed the Interactive Video inside a Column content. The individual questions may emit XAPI statements to report individual answers, but Moodle does not look for those because they would be very content type specific.",

Thanks for reporting this and adding some screenshots to understand better what you were explaining Regarding the issue you faced when creating a backup with H5P activities containing a link to the content bank and then restoring it in a new Moodle site, I've just added a comment in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31094 . If you want to avoid the previous error, you should review all the H5P activities using a link and replace it with a copy of the file. If you have created these H5P activities using the migration tool, there is one setting to create a copy, instead of a link, which in your case might be more interesting (the recommendation is to use link whenever possible, especially because usually people don't migrated data from one site to a different one). The content bank has one capability, \"Manage any content from the content bank (moodle/contentbank:manageanycontent)\", that by default is enabled only for Course creators and Managers that you can give to your teachers if you want them to edit any content in the content bank (not just the one they have created). I hope this helps Kind regards from Barcelona, Sara",

I'm assuming that the links point(ed) to the Content Bank files within the original course. On the use of copies rather than links to the course's Content Bank files: unfortunately in this way it is no longer possible to post-edit the H5P. One would have to manipulate the file outside of the course's context - e.g. download the file, use Lumi to open and edit, then re-upload and replace in the activity / embed context. Cumbersome... I have of course voted for https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-31094 , and would encourage all H5P Moodlers to do the same . For a sensible workflow within Moodle - this feature is a must-have.",

Have done quite a few Google searches but still none the wiser with regards to a solution. They have H5P installed, but no content types because it won't connect to the hub. I downloaded a content type from H5P and added it manually and that is working fine, but obviously a long-term solution for updates would be most welcome. On: https://XXXXXXXX/mod/hvp/library_list.php When I try to do a cache refresh I get the following two error messages: Received HTTP code 403 from proxy after CONNECT Unable to connect to the H5P Hub. Please try again later Can anyone give me some guidance as to what to do next, please? I don't have backend access to the server here (and not sure I can get it), so if config behind the scenes is needed, I will have to send clear instructions to the server manager to get them carried out. Many thanks in advance. Gavin",

(Though of course linking makes major sense because editing of H5P can only be done in the Content Bank...) A workaround would be to ALWAYS CLEARLY NAME those H5P activities which are linked to. Then - after restore - you should be able to mend the broken links. Maybe even now, in the courses you moved, there will be some hints in the embedded links that will tell you out the H5P file's name you can try to re-link . It's unfortunately much worse in the case of activities - here the aliased file disappears completely, and so there's no hint - unless you remember which activity it was, or can check back at the original course location.",

By doing so you are copying and pasting a lot of formatting tags which a basic text editor cannot interpret. Unfortunately you do not mention which H5P activity you are using in your example. I suppose it's an Interactive Book, and maybe a Text sub-content? Can you confirm? There are very few H5P activities that feature the \"sub\" and \"sup\" tags in their editor toolbar, e.b. MULTICHOICE, INTERACTIVE BOOK, etc. I am attaching an example of a MULTICHOICE question editing. PS.- Just saw the workaround suggested by Matthias Giger, which does work.",

See the pic attached. @Rezeau, yes, very well spotted. I am using Text option in Interactive book in H5P. Upon your suggestion, I tried typing with superscript option in Multiple choice question. There it worked fine. But then I copied and pasted the same in Text editor, there superscript vanished leaving it to be a normal character. I think since Text editor doesn't provide the option of Super-Subscript that's why upon saving all the characters become of same size. But anyhow, Giger's idea worked and I am sorted. By the way, thanks for suggesting point (1). I will take care of it.",

Now I want to update it. - Edit the presentation locally. - Visit the the course, go to \"Edit settings\" of the presentation earlier, go to \"Upload file\", select the edited .h5p file and click on \"Use\". Now the wheel \"Loading please wait...\" keeps on turning forever. The content never gets updated. The log files shows, even at DEVELOPER level, only this single entry: x.x.x.x - - [09/Jul/2022:07:28:23 +0200] \"GET /mod/hvp/ ajax .php?contextId=274&token=7f27d560cdff8&action=libraries&machineName=H5P.CoursePresentation&majorVersion=1&minorVersion=24&language=en&default-language=en HTTP/1.1\" 200 48340 \" https://example.com/course/modedit.php?update=187&return=1 \" \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox /102.0\" The teacher had this on a Moodle rel. 3.11.latest.

We’re having the opposite issue to John: the scrollbar appears for our students but not admins – it isn’t easy to consistently replicate but means that for many students the end of the question or the check/finish buttons are cut off and you have to scroll to see them. We did an update to Moodle 3.9 last week and since then a style class (highlighted in screenshot below) has been automatically inserted into the iframe of every H5P we have embedded (in addition to the width and height info that was there before) – we don’t know where it is coming from as it isn’t in the original H5P embed code. We can’t edit it or delete it – Moodle always just changes it straight back to what it was. While we’re happy for the width to be set to 100% if this means the H5P is responsive, the given height apparently can’t be changed: sometimes we are left with a height of just 147px so the students are left with a tiny iframe window through which to view the quiz, which is understandably frustrating! Please can anyone advise on how to make H5Ps consistently responsive so they appear without the scrollbar, or at the very least remove/edit the new style class in the iframe? Thank you in advance!",

          "Text": "Hello, I have a problem with an H5P activity in Moodle: Course presentation with Drag-and-Drop exercise. A drag item (a small image) is to be dragged onto a spot in the background image. When I open the task in the browser on an iOS device (iOS 15.5; ipad or iphone; Browser Safari or Firefox latest versions), I can edit the task as expected. (The drag item can be dragged onto one of the drop zones. The task will be evaluated correctly.) However, if I choose an incorrect answer on the first try and then want to repeat the task, not only is the drag item moved, but also the content of the screen in the background . As a result, drop zones \"disappear\" to the left and are no longer visible or selectable. The drag item can no longer be placed correctly. The task can therefore no longer be processed. I've tried whether you can get to the destination by holding and dragging the drag item, for example, or by tapping the drag item and drop zone. But that was not successful. The problem does NOT occur with MacOS, for example on a Macbook. The problem under iOS is documented in a small video, which is attachted here. (Background: Users expect us to solve the problem. Switching to the Moodle app is not a solution the user wants. They also don't want to work without drag-and-drop exercises. The user is faced with so many iOS -devices used that a change to other devices is not possible.) I would be very grateful for hints on possible causes of error or possible solutions. Thank you very much in advance … Matthias Addendum: The error described does not occur in the same exercise under Wordpress/H5P.",

Something on your system seems to cause problems in H5P core which explains why you encounter the issue in the plugin and in moodle's integration. It seems that on moodle the code gets minified, so the line of code that's displayed alone doesn't tell anyone where to look further. Could you please click on \"h5p.js:382:328“. That should open the source code (which is probably minified, so one loooong text without spaces or decent line breaks). There should be a button labeled \"{}\" which should unminify the code on clicking, and then the exact position of the code where the error happens should be highlighted. That's what should point into the direction where the actual cause is. The error message itself seems to be PHP related though, so if you by any chance have access to the server 's PHP error log, having a look there might help as well. Best, Oliver",

They can still type and after saving the question within the Interactive video, what has been typed in the text box (altough it isn't visible) will still be added and appear correctly when playing the video. This is on Moodle Desktop 3.10.10 (20220314). The issue was seen when using Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. The H5P version is mod_h5pactivity 2020110900 (core version) and for each of its activity: H5P InteractiveVideo-1.22 / H5P TrueFalse-1.6 / H5P SingleChoiceSet-1.11.

I ask because we're using the new Cornell Notes H5P activity and the student's text content does not save when a student exits the page. In the non-core version, the content would save at scheduled intervals as defined the H5P site admin settings, but I don't see anything for this in the non-core. I've had a student leave the page up for about 8 minutes before navigating away and when they returned the text was no longer there and there was no record on the teacher's end -- they would see \"View all attempts (0 submitted)\" still. This is an activity added directly to and access from the course page with \"Enable attempt tracking\" set to \"yes\" and \"Review attempts\" set to \"Participants can review their own attempt\".

It will work. I've had a look at the H5P forums but can't find any mention of this issue and it is a new issue as these packages were working fine before.",

          "Text": "Hello, I\nuse very often the H5P activities in my courses on Moodle. Until now, I\nalways used them with the \"black\" Plugin and everything worked nicely. I\nalways fill out the Metadata because I want other people to know\nexactly where the exercises come from and that they can use them. And\nthis works: On Moodle sites and on a WordPress site where I've tried it. Ultimately,\nI've checked the \"blue\" H5P activity on Moodle. The problem is:\nAlthough I choose in the settings that the Copyright button should be\nshown, this doesn't happen. This is not a problem of a specific content,\nit just happens with everything an on all the Moodle instances where I\ntried it: At work, on my private Moodle, on other Moodles ... Can anyone\nhelp me? I give you three screenshots. If you want, you can also\ntry it out on my private Moodle site (guest access) although that won't help much as you can't see much what's behind the scenes: 1) With the Plugin: https://moodle.arcoworld.de/mod/hvp/view.php?id=964 2) As a Moodle activity: https://moodle.arcoworld.de/mod/h5pactivity/view.php?id=1122 Another annoying thing is that if I download an H5P activity from the plugin and upload it then into the content bank the metadata are not just not visible, but even deleted, so that in this case, I first had to reinsert the data and then I could check if they are displayed (which I did). This problem doesn't happen if I insert it somewhere else with the plugin or on a website that works with Wordpress. Thank you very much, Clemens",

We have a large number of users from different institutions, so consequently we use groups to ensure that teachers cannot see details of students in other institutions. The H5P attempts list does not respect groups, so teachers can see attempts from students in other institutions, which is clearly unacceptable. We've had to remove the permission for teachers to be allowed to see any H5P attempts for this reason, which is a pity. There is a tracker item here https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-71662 which was created last year but it doesn't look like anyone is working on it. This seems to me to be a serious privacy issue - surely all Moodle features should respect groups if separate groups are set and teachers do not have the permission to access all groups. If you agree, please vote for the tracker issue and comment here so that this can be addressed.",

This is for a self-guided learning course and I would like to move the student in the correct direction after finishing a quiz in H5P.

I have never done any debugging so I just turned it on. I have set the debug messages tot normal and the debugging messages to HTML but I have to work out where I can see the debugging messages. (I do'nt have acces to the server but do have admin rights in Moodle). I will get back to you on this. Two things that I tried before I send you this message. 1). I  tried to create a new course presentation via the content bank but this gives the same result as uploading my existing Course presentations (screenshot 1) 2.) I have just upload ed a demo course presentation from tracker.moodle.org to Moodle en this oddly enough works and this one can be edited after upload (screenshot 2). All my existing course presentations have been made in Moodle 3.3.6. I have a few questions that may help to solve the problem or work around it that I hope you can help me with. 1) Should I do  something with the H5P content created in older versions of Moodle before uploading it in 3.11.4? 2) How do I avoid using the Moodle core H5P and do I need tot add the H5P plugin then as I did in the older Moodle version? (H5P is already present in the plugins overview). 3) The H5P contentbank does not appear in the admin site bar or course admin bar in Moodle. I can get there  when I add content or bij using the URL ( https://demoplatform.enbl.eu/contentbank/edit.php?contextid=28&plugin=h5p&id=4&lang=en ) Should it appear in either one or is this normal or could that be part of the problem? (I did add the Atto editor, so the H5P button is visible when you add an activity). 4) Should I use a different (but newer then 3.3.6) Moodle version to avoid these problems?

          "Text": "Hi Bram I send you a PM with my emailaddress. Okay if the uploaded a demo course presentation from the tracker and works, then this rules out issues with the theme. Could you check in the 3.3.6 environment: if the course presentation in your Moodle 3.3.6 is the same library version as you use in your M 3.11 site? When the version on 3.36 is lower then on the 3.11 this might be the reason you have the current issues. You could update the course presentation content type by using the \"green arrow\" button if you have newer versions installed. If that is not installed, go to on of your H5P activities , select the course presentation contenttype and check if there is an update available. 3.36 site administration >Plugin > Activity modules > H5P > H5P Librariers 3.11 site administration > H5P >  manage content types In 3.3.6 check if there is a plugin update available for H5P? If so check if the versions is compatible with your 3.3 site and update. Some Moodle hosting providers placed a comment line in the config.php file that avoids Moodle to take the full H5P contenttype files into the backup. This has been done to avoid issues with backup/restore. But if they have placed the comment line in your enviroment then this could be one of the reasons you get this error. As in response to your other questions: 1) See above, check these points. 2) You can disable the H5P core plugin by going to Siteadministration > Plugins > Activity modules > manage activities . I would not advise to uninstall it t.b.h. 3) This could depend on the theme you are using. Check if it does appear when you switch to Boost thema  by adding ?theme=boost to your url. (See documentation: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Allow_theme_change_by_URL ) 4) I don't think you will avoid the issue with a different Moodle version, since it clearly works on the demo sample you used. The issue seems to be in your H5P file.",

I guess the overriding issue though is that you might add an H5P activity, say a single choice question. And then later you change the question type used. Moodle would not have a way of 'looking inside' the content, so now the icon might be incorrect/misleading. So in many ways it's safer to simply indicate to users \"This is an H5P activity ... of some type\" I guess it would be possible for Themes to override the actual H5P icon, which might be nice, with an icon that signals \"interactivity\" in some way.

I would like to know why it would be advantageous to have different icons. I think each icon should have a consistent meaning (current icons allow us to easily distinguish quizzes from assignments for example even if teacher makes a bad title choice). In the case of H5P I am not sure how important it is to know the main library. Several content types have a similar appearance or function. In the LTI case above, I think separate icons make sense. They are usually configured to to the logo of the provider. This allows the provider to brand and indicates to the user that they using different outside sites which may involve different privacy policies and licenses. Actually the H5P icons are useful in this forum to distinguish core Moodle from contributed H5P modules. If both used content type icons that would be lost.",

          "Text": "Daniel, I agree with Gemma and Jacek on the usefulness of individual icons: just like the standard icons, they are useful in to indicate the type of activity or resource the student will be doing. For example, we now distinguish file icons by type, docx, pdf, etc. - based on mime types - for the same reason: it gives both visual information as to the expected type of content and also helps provide a visual anchor or signpost when scrolling in the course. Icons for mime types have long been an internet defacto standard. This is the same sort of thing for the same reasons. Currently just knowing that something is any \"H5P activity\" means little to a student. That's similar to saying \"This resource is a file.\" which is true but not important. As Gemma said, how useful this would be would vary. I think this would be very useful for K-12 situations where H5P activities can be the most common type of activity in a course: having a visual differentiator is very useful. Likewise, in my experience, this is common in some disciplines such as Language teaching were many H5P activities of different types are in the same course. Currently, there is a fixed set of mime type icons that you can draw from to change such icons, but if you want to use any others, you have to go to the server to do that. That's not exactly the same thing as the H5P library types, but it is a model to draw from for sites that may or may not want to adjust such H5P icons. Food for thought that you don't have to reinvent the wheel for that part if you think of them in a way similar to mime type icons.",

Speaking of which , also the labels displayed on mouse-hover - whether on the course page or in the Content Bank itself - might actually also prompt the name of the H5P activity type. In the Question Bank it would actually be useful to have a filterable separate column with the activity type names spelled out. Reviewing the Content bank by merely eying the icons is not handy.",

The main problem is that the H5P icons appear small in Moodle (as Stuart observed). The icons supplied by H5P are in a different format than Moodle icons. Moodle icons are expected to be square and without margins. H5P icons are 16:9 aspect and about 20% margins. That can be compensated for with CSS on the course page, but not in the grade book. The content bank icons look better with \n```text\n.cb-toolbar-container .icon-size-4 .icon {\n\n\n    width: 43px !important;\n\n\n    margin: 0 -7px;\n\n\n}\n```\n added to the 'Raw SCSS' in Boost, but I do not think that is the best long term solution.",

However, with Administrator role, I totally created Interactive content in the content bank. 6. I also created new Moodle website with default Moodle theme and it was surprised that Teacher role can create file .h5p in content bank => So, Using new theme (Name of theme is Edumy) might be the main reason here, but I am not sure until now. Could anybody understand my circumstance and give me some advises how Teacher role can create .h5p in content bank with using Edumy theme? Thanks a lot!",

Although the container is considerably bigger than the embedded H5P, I have also noticed that the iframe will resize itself after saving. The simplest solution would be to use a Column but I want to use a combination of H5P and other embedded elements (for instance Padlets). If I use a column and then embed it, I immediately face this same issue; the course looks unaligned and unappealing and does not engage in the same way the column does when not embedded. Is there something glaringly obvious I am missing? Huge fan of H5P and it's potential to really transform online learning spaces, so really hope you can shed some light on this. cheers, Paddy",

However, after I save it and then check the embed code for each this is what I get: These are, by the way, the same embedded item repeated and the original has the dimensions of the second iframe; the first was that size originally but changed when I saved the label. Why the second didn't is a bit of a mystery, frankly. I have tried using 100% for the width, taken out the resizer script as well embedding into the top of the section (as opposed to in a label) which resulted in a slightly larger display, but not significantly. Nothing has been successful so far and can't find reference to this behaviour anywhere else. By the way, I have also changed theme to Boost but that had no impact. Sorry for the essay!",

To summarize, it seems that, when deleting the h5p activities created with the plugin, and after uninstalling the plugin, the generated grade items still remain. In some cases, this causes a problem. My questions are: how has the rest proceeded when migrating from the plugin to the core activity? Did you encounter this grade items issue? I know that re-installing the h5p plugin and disabling it would solve the problem, but I'd like to avoid having a plugin that has no further use. Any sharing of the experiences with the migration is welcome! Thanks!",

First question why two H5P's or are these different? Now to the issue, Added an H5P 1.22.3 activity (interactive video). First off noticed the Editor says H5Phub. Step 1: Uploaded an mp4 video, then went to step 2 Add Interactions. When trying to add the interactive content, we get an error message saying  \"Network Failure\". If we close this off and save this video - (without interactives), and play the video as if it were a student - it plays fine. Its adding the interactive content that does not work. In my initial search I saw something in regards to imbeded H5P vs H5P hub etc. Could this  be part of the issue? Could seeing 2 versions of H5P be a cause? I am having issues narrowing this down. I also changed the default moodle editor from tinymce to atto, could this be part of the issue? Thank you in advance. Chris Nelson",

One method would be to use the Lumi desktop tool to create a H5P content from a file on the desktop and then upload the H5P files via ftp to server file system. You would them be able to use the file system repository to add theme to the content bank. From the Content bank select Upload content and the File system repository will appear as an option in the file manager. Another option would be to use the latest version of Repurpose resources content type plugin to import files into a Column content. This allows adding audio , image and video files to the column type with the Moodle file picker. From there the Audio, Video, and Image objects can be copy and pasted into other types. Unfortunately it does not look like you can paste into Interactive Video so it would have to be modified if that is what you need. Daniel",

If you are providing a source for H5P materials, this may the right place. Developers that work on those implementations often respond in this forum to problems, but if you with details of setting up a new integration, there may be more developers interested in the General development forum or in LTI forum. It might also help to create a tracker issue if you want attention from the core development team.

The problem occurs using both H5P 1.20.1 and Moodle 3.5.9+ (PreProd) and H5P 1.17.2 and Moodle 3.5.7 (Prod) Now, very importantly, the problem does not occur on our Dev Server , using H5P 1.20.1 and Moodle 3.5.9+ What happens on our Production and Preprod servers is that: The H5P content appears to work correctly, including editing, right up until someone completes the activity and then the completion is reset. Sometimes a person only has to complete the activity. At this point, you attempt to edit it - instead of seeing the editable content, you get a piece of code like this: [field:group:coursepresentation:presentation] We discovered that we also cannot create new activities of the Course Presentation or Interactive Video types. Other content types do not appear to be affected. We have turned on debugging and replicated the issues but there are never any messages in regard to this problem. Dev, Preproduction and Production environments all underwent upgrades from Moodle 3.5.7 to 3.5.9 recently, however this has not caused issues on the Dev server. We do not control upgrades to the server environments or security configurations and though we have asked for details as to changes to these environments, we do not yet have this information. It seems that the server configuration (that we do not have access to) may be playing a part in this as we do not experience the same issues with the same software and courses on the Dev server. I have read around the internet and see that some people have experienced similar issues - does anyone have some advice for us that we can use to point our IT people in the right direction? Our H5P modules are great additions to our courses and we would like to continue using the software. Thank you for your time",

Sometimes you can fix it by editing the activity (if possible), or by completely uninstalling H5P and then reinstalling it (but take a copy of every single H5P activity before doing so as you lose them all if you don't). Another time we fixed it by doing an upgrade of Moodle and H5P. You can also manually download the correct library and that sometimes works. It's all a bit hit and miss. Kathy",

Login to the demo site ( https://sandbox.moodledemo.net/ ) and try to reproduce the error (to discard the issue is due to some problem in your instance). 2. Download any of the samples in https://h5p.org/interactive-video and create an H5P activity in your Moodle site (to discard the problem is related to the H5P content you created). I hope this helps you to find out why it's not working as expected. Kind regards!",

          "Text": "Hi there, We have encountered an issue when adding an H5P activity (using the H5P plugin). We are using Moodle 3.8.5 (Build: 20200914) and H5P plugin 1.21.0 (2020080400) We have a large course with a lot of H5P activities and now when adding an H5P activity, we get an error (see moodle-error.png attached) I recorded my Moodle screen after I clicked 'Save and display' and before the error appears. In the console I noticed this error shown in the console-error.png attached . We thought it was an issue with the size of the course and the allocated memory. But in our test platform we deleted half the course and our IT Department said that \"we doubled the limit of memory allowed for a PHP script (to 1Gb) and it still failed. This suggests that Moodle becomes stuck in a loop while adding an activity to this course and it will use up any and all memory that you can throw at it\" . Adding a core Moodle activity seems to work fine. The issue appears only with the H5P activity. Has anyone encountered this before? Any advice would be very much appreciated! Many thanks Harry",

Your question about the Content Bank is also really important - and this should be clearly documented in Moodle Docs . Usually, if a file is added to a course as an Alias, and then the course is backed up and restored elsewhere, the alias files are not included.

It seems like there should be a setting that prompts the admin whether the script should be run immediately when upgrading.",

However, I was trying to do this alias linking from the Content bank between courses and that didn't work for me as you showed when adding a file!. For instance when one teacher has .h5p content in his Content bank of one course and then, the same teacher, in another course, doesn't get the alias option but has to save the .h5p file into his other course thus the duplication. Unless my system is not working as expected but I will check out the School demo site to see how it should function. Thanks again BTW .

The method that i was trying out was different but the logic starts the same: \"As teacher Bob (for example!) I have some H5P content in Course A  and I would like to use it in Course B. So I go to Course B\" However the H5P content is located in Content bank of Course A .  So from in the Content bank of Course B, I was trying to firstly Upload then from Upload content > Choose a file (the .5hp file from Course A) but I don't get the alias option here. It's quite possible that the Content bank isn't meant to function this way but I thought i might. So again my first thought was how the Content bank works across courses/users because I wonder whether (H5P) content you put in the \"Content bank\" is available site-wide or only in the course you put it in?

As Mary said, when teacher Bob creates a content in Course A content bank, that content will be available in any course for any user who has the right permission to Course A. So you can create a content in Course A and all the teacher with permissions to Course A could use the content in all their courses. So, if somebody with site level access creates a content in the Site Content bank, that content will be available for all teachers in all courses. The alias/copy options in the filepicker feature has a different purpose. If you choose a content from the Content bank repository and select 'Create an alias/shortcut to the file', if someone edits the content in the content bank, the changes will be applied also in this instance (kind of synchronized). But if you select 'Make a copy of the file' this will be a copy of the source content, so the changes and edition on the source content bank content won't be applied on the current instance.",

This is an important difference and is not idea and may not be the best place for storing copies...I would have thought that the copy would have been saved into the Content Bank of the course you are saving it into!! Often Admins turn off Server files, like they do at the Institute I work at for all sorts of security and file management reasons so it would be impossible to access the copy in this scenario. So I would suggest the best way to get a copy of the H5P would be to download it and then upload it into the Content Bank of the course you want to have it in. Cheers, Ben",

Adding 'Content bank' as a component the team that is \"taking care\" of that component will triage it, checking all the fields are ok, filling whatever else is missing and asking for any other information we need. The most important thing for us is you to use a clear title and to add as many information as you can to the 'Description' field: what the issue is, some steps to reproduce or understand and test the problem, use cases why this change/improvement is important, and so on. If you prefer, you could add that 'Title' and 'Description' here and I could create the tracker issue on your behalf.

Apart from that, you need to have permission to access the Content bank. Teachers and managers have permission to access it by default, but an admin could change those permissions. To check you have the right permissions, you could try to create an H5P activity (the blue rounded icon) Below the 'Package file' filepicker you will see a 'Use the content bank' link if you have the right to use it.

We now seem to have the issues resolved, though not entirely confident; however, the blue H5P icon and the black H5P icon how appear for the same activity in our site: We use the question set activity again in a Post-Assessment Quiz, later in our site, but it only shows the blue H5P plugin being used: For consistency, we'd like to use the same coloured H5P icon for both quiz activities , which is the black. Question: is it possible to copy the Post quiz that appears in the blue H5P plugin, to appear in our site using the black H5P plugin? Tried using Copy of the question set from 'blue', then adding the black H5P plugin to our site, and pasting this into the question set, but received this message: Other suggested ways to do that work, if possible?

          "Text": "Hello Four Buckets Design, I am a little confused by your question. I think the copy paste method you are trying to do might not be supported between the H5P Plugin and Core H5P integration. I haven't tried and can't because I don't use the H5P Plugin in Moodle. But just to clarify, the black H5P icon, in your case, represents an activity from the H5P Plugin whereas the blue H5P icon represents Moodle's core integration (Content Bank) of H5P. If you want to get your H5P quiz activity (Post-Assessment Quiz) with the blue icon as an activity into your H5P Plugin, you will have to download the H5P package from the Content Bank and then upload it into your course using the Plugin. For info on the use of H5P in Moodle, see post by Svein-Tore from Joubel - The H5P Moodle plugin vs H5P.com vs the new Moodle core integration and in a pinned discussed in this forum Should you use the H5P plugin, or H5P core functionality in Moodle? Hope that helps. Best regards, Ben",

To add to the confusion, you get this option to \"make copy of this file\" when you are adding an activity or resource in Moodle. It should not be at this point you get to save a copy of the file, but only to link to existing content using the alias option. The issue was discussed in this post , so please go and read more about it there and in the Moodle Tracker issue, linked above, and add your comments and suggestions there and if you think it is worth improving I would encourage you to VOTE for its improvement.

It prevents you from accidentally breaking the file structure, it allows you to keep translations consistent across all the content types, it allows you to get notified if translations get changed or added, ... Just keep in mind that each language needs a dedicated editor who needs to check language translations from time to time to prevent misuse and to press a button to sync that language's translations on translate-h5p.tk to the official repositories - you can apply to become such an editor.

There are, however, 2 main points on which AMOS is superior: - for each language used in Moodle there is a translation \"supervisor\" who is responsible for checking the validity of the translations submitted by volunteer translators, especially checking the consistency of the terms used; - when the submitted translations have been validated, the language pack is immediately updated and made available to Moodle users. Unfortunately this is not the case with H5P where one has to wait (sometimes for a very long time) for a new version of the H5P content to be released along-with the new translations.",

Also it is available now . Sebastian Rettig just took the initiative to set it up for content types and aligned it with the H5P core team's workflow. I don't say it's a perfect solution - and you could move all of H5P to use AMOS, the WordPress translation system or whatever yields more benefits - but that's something that should be discussed where the H5P core team actually has a chance to find the discussion, shouldn't it? After all, moodle is just one of many platforms that H5P runs on.",

Looking at the \"Mark the words\" content type, it seems that it may help in some way, but that's not exactly what I looked for. I will try to be more clear. What I'm thinking about is something like a content type that shows text (a sentence), and above each word there is a dropdown list that you can choose from the linguistic (syntax) role of that word in the sentence. The \"Mark the words\" content type would let me choose all the words in sentence that answer to a specific role in the sentence, and I want to identify all the roles of all the words in the sentence. Maybe I'm missing something and \"Mark the words\" allows this.",

From experimenting with different H5P activities , using the same original image in different activities, (no changes made to the image size for example), the image used in the different activities appears differently; for example, using dialog cards, the image appears fine; however, when using image slider, the same image appears large and distorted. Not sure there's an answer to this observation, but if the same image used in any h5P activity could adjust automatically in the activity for viewing, that would be great--you don't know how the image will appear until previewing the activity in the course site. Cannot find any advice about image sizing related to H5P activities in Moodle documentation or at https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications",

The flashcards is similar, but not 'it'. Find the hotspot is ok, but doesn't flip (turn) the image. Question set or True/False only permit 1 image to upload /question.

But there may be some kind of interference with the H5P plugin (black), so I guess this could be an option. Do you know what is the difference between H5P 'core' and its plugin cousin? From a user's perspective, you create, publish, manage, and edit activities with the core activity differently. You use the Content Bank to create them and to publish them, you have two options: using the activity H5P (blue) to create a stand-alone activity using the button H5P in the Atto Editor to embed it into another resource or activity (f.i. a page, a label). I cannot explain well the technical differences, but both are taking different development paths if my understanding is correct. This is everything I can add based on my experience, hope it helps.",

H5P also appears as blue when clicking Add an activity or resource on a course site (3rd screenprint below). When clicking it, the H5P icon in the atto editor appears black, but then again, so do all the other icons in the editor. Couldn't attach a screenprint of it because limited to only 3 attachments in a post to this forum, but no doubt you know what it looks like.

So I would likely disable the plugin, and try using the core functionality. However, if you prefer the plugin (without the overhead of the H5P core content bank), then uninstalling and reinstalling the H5P plugin might help. As Beatriz says, the H5P plugin is maintained by Joubel, and the H5P core in Moodle is then adapted by Moodle HQ - I doubt anyone aside from Moodle HQ developers would be able to detail the 'differences' between the two, although in terms of the ways each content type works it should be identical. I note you mentioned moving to your own server . One thing I might test is whether you can create this type of content on a MoodleCloud site, with Boost Theme, and the same browser and connection you usually use. If so, it may in fact be an issue with your server - speed - PHP - who knows!?",

As admin go to Site administration > H5P > Manage H5P content types and on 'Installed H5P' list delete Multiple choice library. Once that library is removed, you could upload an Multiple choice H5P package using ' Upload H5P content types' in that same page (the example offered by H5P is too big to attach to this post, so you can download it on https://h5p.org/multichoice -> Reuse -> Download). H5P libraries are downloaded by a cron task needs to connect to H5P, so some connectivity issues could face downloading not fully functional libraries. Those steps would remove the downloaded library and upload a new one locally, so... as I said, it worth a try in my opinion. Then you could go back to Content bank and give it another try to create content. If that doesn't work, would be great to check error logs and see if we can get some more information about the issue. About disabling core H5P activity shouldn't help, because the content bank should be independent to the activity itself. The activity could 'use' content in the Content bank, but the Content bank doesn't 'use' the activity.",

Re: the multiple choice path you suggested, https://h5p.org/multichoice -> Reuse -> Download ), takes you to a page description about Multiple Choice on the H5P website?; you must create an account to download the M/C activity? 😕 Feel like we're going around in circles. Further, don't see Reuse. The Multiple Choice activity we wish to use/create content, no longer appears in the content bank 'Add' drop-down menu. If an account is required on the H5P website, that's the only way now to re-install the M/C activity because it's gone for good having been deleted from the library as you suggested. See screen prints. Very confusing and frustrating. Don't know what's not working and why. Should not be this cumbersome to do something so simple. Thanks,",

I would say one of the main differences is the way the work and how they manage the content itself. For the \"black\" H5P activity, the content is created/edited inside the activity. The content created is completely managed by the activity itself. Content and activity are totally dependent. For the \"blue\" H5P activity it's not as dependent to the content itself. The content is created, edited and managed by the Content bank. And you can USE it (from the Content bank) in a (blue) H5P activity. Or in a dozen of activities, or in an atto editor text, or... Apart from that, there are some features already implemented in (black) H5P activity that are not implemented yet in (blue) core H5P activity or Content bank. So they are not exactly the same. But about how the H5P editor works, and the issue you are having, should work mostly the same (technically speaking), because the Content bank is using the API offered by H5P. I hope this helps to understand the differences/advantages/disadvantages for each of them",

By default, H5P plugin is installed in Moodle to mange H5P content. I mean, the responsible to manage and support H5P content is the H5P plugin. So, if you uninstall it, your Content bank won't be able to Manage any H5P content. So you couldn't upload or create any H5P content in the Content bank. This would happened with any plugin in Moodle. If you, for example, uninstall 'Forum' activity, you won't be able to see or create any Forum activity. I hope this makes sense.",

I deployed a fresh installation of 3.10, caught up on the differences between the core and mod_h5p, picking the former (i.e no non-core h5p modules installed). Then I tried to do a Add activity or resource -> H5P However I get a generic 500 error. I have no idea where to troubleshoot the error or why it doesn't work out of the box. My php (7.4.13) has zip, mbstrings and ssl installed. Apache /2.4.46 is running on SSL With apache logging on debug, there are no relevant error reported or on the syslog. My apache config has this according to Apache - MoodleDocs : ``` <VirtualHost *:443> ..... AcceptPathInfo On <Directory /var/www/html/moodle> AllowOverride all </Directory> ``` I wonder if the mod_deflate is causing issues but have no idea why it might. Could someone please share what they have done to make it work?",

Question information (max 200 characters): Click the word below that best describes how you're feeling today. Option 1: Great! Option 2: Medium Option 3: Terrible Option 4: Other Correct answer(s): 1, 2, 3, 4. Feedback correct: Thanks for sharing that with us! Feedback incorrect: - I was wondering if something like this already exists for the different H5P interactive activities that can be used in Moodle. It would make it a lot easier for me to write out my content in full, have others review it with comments/track changes, and then even potentially delegate the actual input-work to someone else.

See example below. I have read that it could be that the h5p-resizer.js script is running twice? We do have both the H5P plugin and the core H5P installed, but the plugin is disabled.

I suggest a few things you can try: You can see if you can reproduce the error in https://sandbox.moodledemo.net/ with any of the activities you're getting the vertical scroll (to discard it's because of the H5P content). If you're using a theme in your Moodle site, you can switch to \"Boost\" (which is the default), just to confirm that this is unrelated to the theme. You can use different browsers (to discard this will be an issue only for one of them). You can try in a different computer, to discard is something related to your resolution. If you share with us the result of the previous tests, we'll get more information to see if we can help you Kind regards from Barcelona, Sara",

See screenshot below: attemp_details_subquestion_FOR_course_presentation.PNG But, I cannot see the details, individual attempt answers for each sub-questions (multiple choice, true/false, drag&drop,..) in INTERACTIVE BOOK . It only shows total score as below: general_attemp_interactive_book.PNG My guess is that since the Interactive book is a new H5P type (when you compare with Interactive video and Course presentation), that my be the reason for the delay in implementation of the same detailed attempt answer view for sub-questions. 1. When do you plan to implement the same detailed attempt answers view for Interactive Book in Moodle? 2. If it takes too long, can you please guide me where in the code I can apply the change/patch for this future ? Thanks!",

Via contentbank and H5P activity I put them into courses to try with test-student accounts. In both activities there is a Submit button at the end, however, nothing gets saved. If the teacher looks at the grades of the course, none are displayed. And there is no way to view the attempts of students. If the teacher looks at the H5P itself, it always says \"This content is displayed in preview mode. No attempt tracking will be stored.\" Additonally, it always shows View all attempts (0 submitted) , even if students have submitted their attempts. It's as if the xAPI simply does not work at all, as if content can be created but no communication with moodle takes places for grading or watching progress. I'd appreciate any help in this matter. Thanks!",

I hope you have achieved the desired output i.e. accessing H5P content created using H5P Activity on the mobile app. In case you are yet to, here is the solution. Prerequisites: Moodle mobile app version - 3.8 Step 1: Enable web services in moodle at Administration->Advanced features->enable web services Step 2: Enable frame embedding at Administration->Security->HTTP Security->allow frame embedding Step 3: Comment X-Frame-Options in your \"httpd.conf file \". Follow this procedure to do that. Open your httpd.conf file which can be found in your apache folder at \"/apache2/conf/httpd.conf\". On my Bitnami installation, it is available at \"/opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/httpd.conf\". Based on your installation it can be found in the apache2 folder. Open the file using Vim. Find ( approx. line no. 528) and comment the line \" header always setifempty X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN \". Do not alter any other lines. Step 4: Restart the apache server . Now you should be able to access any H5P content created using the H5P activity.",

My problem is: when a new version of a library is available on a moodle site where H5P instances were created with an older version, the hvp plugin provides a way to upgrade those older instances to use the new library version . This very useful feature is missing from the Moodle (core) h5pactivity, as clearly shown on my 2 screenshots. Note.- This seems related to MDL-68922 ( H5P doesn't upgrade content when there is a newer H5P library ). But the tracker reports this bug as fixed and closed. Maybe the \"automatic\" upgrading of contents only works for the \"official\" H5P activities , not for non-official ones, such as my own. I will investigate further and report in this thread.",

As Gemma mentioned, the behaviour for the H5P core libraries is slightly different and that's why this feature hasn't been included until now: H5P player uses the version defined in the H5P package file. H5P editor uses ALWAYS the latest version available in the system. So, for instance, if you have installed 2 different versions of your \"Dialog Cards Papi Jo\" library (1.12.0 and 1.13.0) and upload an H5P content to the Content bank with the \"Dialog Cards Papi Jo\" v1.12.0, it will be displayed with the libraries included in 1.12.0. However, if you edit this content (using the H5P editor included in the Content bank editor) and save, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest (v1.13.0) so, from now, it will be always displayed with this library version. If you feel some extra feature should be added to let admins to bulk this action will all the existing contents for an existing content type, feel free to create an issue in the tracker Kind regards!

Assigning another, more privileged role to the teacher didn't do anything, either. Moodle is 3.8.2+ Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! Best regards",

          "Text": "Hello, I am attempting to create 360 tours in h5p but I get stuck in a loop of the system loading the background image (first image below). Sometimes the image partially loads, then stops (second image). In a few cases, it will eventually load but I'm not certain what triggers it. I tried on a similar installation on my local machine and it's working, no issues. As an alternative, I created a test activity in my local installation then uploaded it and the same occurs. The upload of the package only takes about 5 seconds, but I am then greeted with the \"background loading\" screen. Other h5p activities are working on the server without issue (that I can tell). The images are jpgs about 4mb each and the connection between myself and the server is fast (it's azure). What should I check to troubleshoot this issue? Does my server need to communicate with the H5P server for this process (assuming I already have the activity installed), or is it hosted locally?",

Some interactive content don't load In the content bank I can see all of the content and some content is working. E.g Accordion is loading correctly, so I can fill it with some content. 2. Some of the content isn't loading. E.g., in alphabetical order, the next one \"Advanced fill in the blank\". Instead it shows the \"famous\" loading-please-wait-message. 3. But I can't edit even the content, that seems to work correctly when I filled in some text. Instead it shows the message \"file not found\" (screenshot is from the Accordion in screenshot above). If I click on \"Edit\" it shows up correctly again. All are displayed in the content bank. I click on one, I get the msg. \"H5P file not found (invalid contextid)\", I click on edit then, I can see the contents … I am quite desperate about H5P. Has anyone an idea that can lead to a solution? (I know H5P can work, when looking to the Moodle Demo side \"Orange Mountain School\" and I would love to use it.) Cheers Oliver",

I am building a languaje course which needs many different excercises, but especially \"fill in the blank\" activities . I decided the best way to present all the information and activities was to do it in an interactive book. The problem is that if one single page includes one long \"fill in the blanks\" the whole thing starts to fail. If I dare to have two \"fill in the blanks\" then the book refuses to open altoghether and after I have edited and saved the book, the \"page\" doesn't stop blinking until I push the edit or close buttons. I have seen that if I eliminate alternative answers it does not fail so\nmuch, but then again, if there are two of these activities in one page,\nor just one not so short (more than 5 blanks) then it won't work. This is an example of the kind of questions: ﻿ 1. A partir de mañana, ella *conducirá* el programa. 2. No importa lo que digas, no me vas a poder *convencer* de comer gusanos de maguey. 3. El puesto es tuyo porque te lo *mereces*. 4. Debo estar a la cocina porque el pollo se está *cociendo*. 5. No tenía idea de que *luciera* tan joven.

Apparently, Google Chrome is more \"at ease\" running all the different activities. As soon as I changed browser, my problem stoped. I hope it stays stable (I'll come here and inform of any change)! Your question about the browser I was using gave me the idea to try a different one. So you did help me! Thank you again and all the best!! Alicia",

(I did not do this and regretted it).. What I think is happening is that the file download is validated at the wrong point. A corrupt file is downloaded and saved. This fails a validation step which gives the above error. There is a an entry added to the filearea in the files table. The code really should be saving the file in a draft area, then validating it. and then move it to the permanent file area when it checks out. Anyway what worked for me was deleting the entry from the files table corresponding to that content type, and rerunning the script to download it again. (remember to save the backup first)",

In both cases we needed a feast solution, so just bounced the data to a new server and reinstalled (I know this isn't an easy option for everyone). I am not seeing the error again, so I am also of the opinion that a specific version release of Moodle caused this (e.g. 3.9.x) and it has been solved now ... the only thing that occurs to me is an issue connecting to the H5P repository when doing the first download.

I have a full site backup of the 3.5 just before upgrade to 3.9 (two working days ago) and a copy of the same 3.5 running in a sub-directory (eg. mysite/35/). I also have full automatic course backups of the same. Because of a few courses with hvp content, I don't want to roll back the whole site. What I will do is to restore only those courses which have hvp content from the 3.5 final course backups. Before that I want hvp plug-in working cleanly in the production (3.9) server. So a \"destructive\" plug-in downgrade is OK with me. How do I do that? (I think, that is what Stuart meant.) By clean I mean, let the plug-in deinstall (20200828) / install (20200804) clean all the corrupt downloads, etc. I am not famliliar with the h5p plug-in to debug nor clean the site manually.",

          "Text": "Hi Stuart Good to know that the H5P maintained plug-in is also discussed here. We have a small but very enthusiastic group of teachers who've discovered H5P and are very happy with it. I want to disturb them as little as possible. They all use mod_hvp, as we've just migrated from Moodle rel. 3.5 to 3.9 (both LTS). On a side-note, the confusion with the \"black and blue\" H5Ps has already started. Hi Oliver Thanks for the reply. As already said, good to know that both H5P methods are supported here. I learned my lesson not to copy-and-paste Git commands without studying them. I'm the person, who otherwise preach the same for Shell commands - now it is my chance to bite the bullet. As for the GitHub instructions, if you expect more illiterates will visit your site, just as a safety measure why not put instructions on how to download (check in) stable versions of mod_hvp? See https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Git_for_Administrators#Obtaining_the_code_from_Git for a template. That said, there is a new turn in the saga. I went back to the staging server and noticed that the plug-in works - in both languages. The difference between the two servers was the theme. So the corrected conclusion is: - mod_hvp 20200828 works with Moodle 3.9 and Rebel 1.7.1 (2020120700) - but not with theme_eguru_moodle39_2020073000.zip nor with Boost (2020061500)! (mod_hvp 20200804 works with all three themes) \"Works\" means the editor loads in German. For details, see the original post.",

I've read what information I can find, but I'm looking for a bit more about how the plugin works and interacts with the H5P website and it's content. So my questions are: Does the H5P activity interact with content/sites outside of the Moodle installation? - Is any data sent offsite, or is it completely isolated? I read that the H5P catalogue is updated via cron task. Is this true? - Can it be turned off or manually checked before allowing any additions or updates? Can some of the H5P content types be restricted, or is it an all or nothing catalogue? I would likely want to restrict certain users to the H5P activity, and then certain H5P resources within the catalogue. I wouldn't want users adding to the catalogue at this stage. Many thanks in advance & apologies if I've overlooked something. Anthony",

This is controlled by the Scheduled Task \"Download available H5P content types from h5p.org\" (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task). This is on by default and runs once a month. If you prefer to control the content types and libraries yourself, then turn this scheduled task off, and use the \"Manage H5P content types\" in Site admin > H5P instead to manually upload the content type files and library files you need. 3) It is all or nothing. There is no option in the Moodle integrated activity to hide or disable a specific content type nor are there specific permissions for the content types. You either have them installed or not: If they are installed, then anyone who can add the H5P activity (by default, Teachers) can use all the content types. (N.B. This is different from the standard H5P \"Interactive Content\" plugin which does have the ability to restrict content types.) 4) \"restrict certain users to the H5P activity\" - You can do this in the roles by setting the various permissions for the activity as a whole, just as for other activities . Search for mod/h5pactivity in the Roles to see the details. There are four main capabilities: view, submit (for Students), and add and review submissions (for Teachers). 5) \"certain H5P resources within the catalogue\" - Only Admins and Managers have the ability to manage the content types. By default, the Manager role can see and use the tool in Site admin > H5P > Manage H5P content types , which is controlled by the capability \"Manage H5P content types\" (moodle/h5p:updatelibraries), set to Allow for Manager. This is all or nothing, too: there is no way to set it up so that some Managers, for instance, can manage some content types but not other content types. This permissions means they can add or remove any or all of them. Hope this is helpful.",

I thought about your question of how Moodle and the H5P Hub talk, but I don't know exactly what data is exchanged during an update with the H5P Hub. It could be done in several ways, but certainly the Hub would know your Moodle address, IP address and approximate location, etc. I would assume, for the sake of efficiency, it would exchange what content types and version you have installed for update. (Although Moodle could just say, \"Send me all the latest versions\" and handle the matching locally, which would be less efficient but more privacy preserving.) A further question is does this update process cross the line into telemetry or usage statistics other than that required for updates? Eg. does it send the number of installed content types in use? Hopefully, someone who does know the details of that can chime in here. Randy",

Regarding the information that is sent from Moodle to update the content types, what Moodle is currently doing (only if the \"Download available H5P content types from h5p.org (\\core\\task\\h5p_get_content_types_task)\" task is enabled), is the last one Randy mentioned: is calling the H5P endpoint hub using a site unique identifier that, by default, is a hash of the URL defined in $CFG-> wwwroot , and then, the content-types are processed one by one (to check if they have to be upgraded or not). For technical people (if you're curious), this is where this call is done: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/h5p/classes/core.php#L305 So no privacy data is sent to the H5P hub to get the latest content types. This task can be disabled but then admins will need to upload and upgrade manually the content types, as Randy said I hope this helps! Kind regards!",

To be able to choose which versions to update to and which content types to update is very valuable., especially for large sites with many thousands of activities of different types. This will be especially important for sites that remain on a maintenance release for a year or two, or for organizations with multiple instances, etc. where version dependencies will need testing before updating.

Of course, I share Joseph's skeptical position because at some point the accurate and individualized feedback of a teacher is necessary.

This issue was causing some errors when activities with max grade were migrated.

Instead of having one icon per sub-content type, there should be just one button that will use the H5P Hub to choose. ( https://h5p.org/moodle-plugin-vs-moodle-core-vs-h5p-com ).

          "Text": "Thanks Stuart, that is helpful too know. The way that a content type or library file can be updated now from the H5P interface is very nice, but it would be nicer to have those both on a local hub and also that the Moodle core system would also have that same ability to control the updates too. The H5P one is far better than the Moodle admin panel, which really just dumps version control onto the admins to figure out manually. It sounds to me like the OER Hub can provide a lot of control here, I hope, if we can use it to maintain the libraries too, in addition to being a place for content development of course. Unlike Oliver, I have seen some issues with updates to content types and library files break activities using them, and this is also a concern where there are multiple Moodle sites on different versions of Moodle running the same content.",

From your post I'm assuming you want some \"YouTube like\" image? But remember, an H5P Interactive Video is not just a movie clip like an mpg or avi, it's completely different. I can think of two ways to get somewhere where you want: a) Create a small image of the video, add this to a Label, and link it to the activity (which you can set as 'Hidden but available') b) Embed a link to the activity in a Label. However the ability to embed might be disabled on your site for security reasons, and if you can embed then you might struggle to get the size of object right. I would't take this route, as you might end up with several embedded activities on the course home page which could slow it down dramatically. My advice would be to stick to the way it works, which is consistent with other activities and resources on the course page.",

I find the following JS issue in the browser’s console : Error 413 Request Entity Too Large “Request Entity Too Large error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.” The process gets stuck at 18% when it encounters this error on a post request with a body of more than 1MB . Here is the endpoint concerned: https://…/mod/hvp/ ajax .php?action= libraryupgradeprogress &library_id=70 I’ve checked the following php values to see if I could fix it simply. But they seem correct. post_max_size = upload_max_filesize = 512M max_execution_time = max_input_time > 180 The parameter impacting the accepted request body size is in Apache . Upon inquiry, it seems that the Apache ’s parameter to modify is LimitRequestBody so that it is not as limited. Unfortunately its modification (LimitRequestBody 0 in .htaccess) is not taken into account on a shared hosting . Would you have other ways to fix that? It would happen again next time I want to upgrade to a newer version. Bonus question: How can I know the list of activities using this library? Thanks in advance!",

H5P's upgrade process is in fact running in batches already, creating requests for every single content instance. It fetches and posts a content type's parameters which in your case seem to be quite large (but a Question Set can become large, I guess). I don't think there's a way to shrink it down. Unfortunately, no solution that comes to my mind is really handy. The simplest one of them is probably to export the content, upgrade it on some other H5P platform and then re-placing the old versions be uploading the new ones - although that's still awkward depending on the number of content instances. If you prefer a programmatic approach, you'd have to take the parameters (filtered_parameters) from the content's database entry, upgrade them using the upgrade script that comes with Question Set ( https://github.com/h5p/h5p-question-set/blob/master/upgrades.js ) locally and then replace the old parameters and update the pointer id that links the content data to the library (from the old Question Set version to the new version).",

I think what Siddharth is trying to say (Siddharth, please correct me if I am wrong): The Atto editor has a way larger number of features (buttons) than the CKEditor that H5P uses. Both resemble each other visually, so I assume Siddharth was under the impression that some setting in moodle might allow to use other features in H5P. Siddarth also wrote a post on the H5P forum already where he went into more detail and where I already answered that not offering all the options in all the HTML widgets is not a technical problem, but it was a deliberate choice by the content type developers in order to keep the interface simpler. What I did not mention there, but what I am adding here now: Siddharth, if you're lacking a button from the CKEditor: You can use the H5P plugin's alter_semantics hook to add those that are used thoughout H5P, and you can even use the alter_scripts hook to add extra plugins to the CKEditor. Please visit the developer documentation on that topic . Please mind however, that your content will not run on other people's H5P instances unless they have made the same customizations. H5P will filter out HTML tags that are not allowed to be used in a content type. Cheers, Oliver",

I got till this page, but could not understand should I make the changes in the same page - mod/hvp/renderers.php and if yes then what would be the code for enabling the HTML code for that one? Here someone has applied the  MathJax by applying some changes. But it is tough to find it for Moodle. Challange I am facing: I am using the tables used in the H5P, but they are not giving good output and also have bugs. So I am having the styling already created. I just need to give ID to the respective tables. I also have some HTML contents in which I need to give ID to DIVs, but also not seem possible without it.

You'd use the $name variable to determine for what library H5P is about to render the editor (in $major_version and $minor_version ). The $semantics variable will contain the complete editor structure that you can parse for the text elements that you'd like to alter - and when you have found them, you simple amend its tag property with the values that you want and are allowed to use . It's not specific to moodle, but works the same way on WordPress and Drupal. All the best for finding solutions to your challenges!

          "Text": "Hi Oliver, I beg to disagree with your reply above. 1.- There is definitely a bug in the D. & D. activity, which can be easily fixed by that small change: in the D. & D. library css file for the .h5p-dragquestion .h5p-draggable elements, remove the text-align: center rule. And removing that rule will not break existing D. & D. activity instances as I'm hoping to demonstrate. 2.- When entering the text editor in H5P activities text is left-aligned by default (the Align Left button is selected by default). Users who want their text to be either centered or right-aligned need to click the relevant buttons on the toolbar. Unfortunately, because of the bug mentioned above, the text-align: center rule over-rides the align-left default behaviour of text. On the figure below, I have attached to a D. & D. display the extract from the content.json file for each draggable item. As we can see, the draggable text which says \"left-aligned (default) text\" does not have a style rule, it's not needed because left alignment is the default behaviour. I have created 3 text draggables, and, as per the bug, the text which says \"left-aligned (default) text\" is displayed as centered. 3.- Now let's see what happens after simply removing the text-align: center rule from the D. & D. library css file for the .h5p-dragquestion .h5p-draggable elements. The draggable text which the user had originally selected to be centered is still centered , ditto with the right-aligned text, and the default left-aligned text is indeed correctly displayed as left-aligned. Everybody is happy. What you wrote \"... removing that property would allow to change the positioning, but all existing content would automatically use left alignment \" is not true. Actually, two categories of users might be unhappy---or, rather, intrigued---after the fix. a) those users who initially wanted their text left-aligned, saw it centered because of the bug, had resigned themselves to the buggy behaviour and now, after the fix, saw things displayed as they originally wished; b) those users who did want their text centered, and at first clicked the Center toolbar button, then one day realized that this was not necessary since leaving the Align Left default button clicked gave the same result. It's impossible to know if those are in the majority. I am of opinion that it does not matter, as they can always edit their D. & D. and center their text if they wish to do so. And this minor inconvenience is balanced by the major advantage of making things work as they should. Q.O.D.",

You are correct, this one was not true or not precise or incomplete at least. Let me try to explain better this time. When people have designed content, they were not able to make text be left-aligned. We can agree on that, I believe. We also agree that this is a bug, I assume. Now, people may have wanted the text to be centered, but they never ever explicitly clicked on the center button. Why would they, as it's way more convenient to just enter the text, it's centered, done. At least I am that lazy, but I dare to assume that many people also never explicitly set the text to be centered. See where I am heading? Now, removing that property would allow to change the positioning [to left-aligned], but all existing content [that never explicitly set the text to be centered] would automatically use left alignment. That's your scenario b) and we can argue all day long how many content types would be effected - we don't know. But it's not just matter of \"technical\" right or wrong, but people are involved. I for myself as a user would be pretty pissed if I had to manually edit every single Draggable in Drag-and-Drop. I as a company would not want to deal with pissed-off people, so I better implement a fix that doesn't cause that trouble. It's always simple to argue \"this is technically wrong, and there's this easy fix!\" from a developer perspective, but then you neglect that you are dealing with humans who are using your software. As I outlined above, it's possible to fix that, but it involves more that just removing the CSS property. I'd appreciate if you could at least agree that \"easy fixable\" may be true from a technical perspective, but not from a socio-technical perspective. If you on top of that stopped repeating and insinuating that this was an easy fix: 😘 Best, Oliver",

The policy is not necessarily shared by other user communities. H5P is used on other platforms, and H5P core team detemine their own policy.

The issue is more likely \"have people gotten used to seeing it centered on the 'view' screen despite how they originally designed it.\" Does that make sense to you? Again, imo!",

Be aware though that this will activate that feature for all content types. If you are using the core version of H5P in moodle, then I am not sure - that feature may not have been implemented yet.

However, the change from H5P 1.17 to 1.20 must be relatively small, so this might not be your issue. Because Themes don't affect the Moodle tables (Themes just style what is there) it should be possible to remove the Theme, and use an earlier version of that without any major issue. I would check what happens with the current H5P 1.20 with a standard Model Theme like Boost first, to see if you still have that error.",

It seems there is some problem with the library for the H5P column content type. Have you checked how is the status of the H5P core activity libraries? I could include all types of H5P activities in the content bank without any further action, because all activities were installed. This is how my content status for the column looks like ( Site administration>H5P>Manage H5P content types ): If the column activity is not listed, you should go to h5p.com or .org, download this activity and upload it.

The content bank looks a bit like a repository browser, but it's not. he current process for cloning content isn't that obvious: open a package by clicking on it click on EDIT, as if you wanted to change that package press the copy button at the top press CANCEL press CLOSE to go back to the content bank. use the add button and scroll around in the list till you find the same content type (why isn't this an autocomplete type box?) and click that type Click on the 'Paste' button at the top and agree with the dialogue. There's your clone. Go back to step 6 and discover it doesn't matter which type you chose because you're going to overwrite it anyway. Ok so now I've made my copy and I realised that I don't need it any more. I'll just delete it again. I'll click the package I'll click, eh, maybe edit? Scroll around a while ... can't see anything maybe at the bottom? no? can't see a way to delete Oh wait a minute ... go to the themes control and switch to Boost Now there's a cog menu and underneath it a drop down with Delete Phew! Wow these copies are getting out of control. I'll just go organise them into folder with nice version names or something uh ... click on the folder icon? oh. oh I see. Well, big old list of Presentation Actviity (copy) (copy) version 2 final (copy) Final version it is then. I might as well just have the files in dropbox and set it up as repository.

So using the plug-in on Moodle I seem to get the h5p content showing as an activity/link, rather than embedded directly on the course page. To get it embedded I then create a label, copy the code in the label and then hide the h5p activity.

          "Text": "I have spend a few hours tweaking roles and permissions on a development Moodle with the goal to have students create their own H5P content from within a Moodle course but no luck so far.  I got close by allowing student role to manage activities (moodle/course:manageactivities) but that created additional unintended results in that students could manage other activities as well. I am on Moodle version 3.9. In addition, I looked at database activity but students only seem to be able to supply a link to H5P content but neither upload it nor create it. In Forum activity, .h5p files can be added by the student role which is good but does not meet my needs. I am curious what I should be looking or searching for next to find a way to have students create H5P in Moodle (just like a teacher can). I don't want to send students to H5P.org Thank you in advance.",

If you allow students to access it they will be able to use all the content there (belonging to other students), but you can restrict them to editing there own content. If that is okay, students should be able to then include any of the content in other activities like wiki or glossary entries using the H5P filter. You do not need to use the H5P activity unless you need to have results of the activity recorded in grade book (which students should not normally access).",

I've tried the options \"Make a copy of the file\" and \"Create an alias\". I have also purged the caches, deleted the chapter of the book and created a new one, but the header still displays.

I've been testing out different H5P content types, with much the same material, to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each. So next I've tried the same questions, but this time using the H5P Quiz (Question Set). So here I'm sharing the \"Guess the animals\" H5P quiz. Feel free to try it out - my kids really enjoy these. https://elearningworld.h5p.com/content/1290877973286713379 The criteria for building this content is: Must work well on a mobile phone - this is a game we play while out and about, in a cafe, etc. Have high quality images (some of the free Apps I found previously have really poor animal photos) Feature genuine learning opportunities through pop-up tips, help text etc. Be easy to use, navigate and read for children - my target audience initially being my daughters aged 4 and 6 Must be fun! Given my criteria above, I've created all the questions as multiple choice, but with just two options. Younger learners can practice their reading as they can sound out the first letter of the two options, and click on the correct choice. As with the Flashcards I've attributed everything correctly, so if you want to use this content in some way please do! Any feedback on errors, omissions, or any type of improvement please let me know Note that the H5P Quiz (Question Set) allows for randomisation, which the H5P Flashcards does not. The ability to zoom in on the image is very cool too ! Stu",

He didn't know a few of the incorrect animals so that was good because he learnt some new animals. But also it was good for him to read words, for instance, after a couple of times through, I got him to read the correct animal to recognise the written words. Also, I followed up getting him to do some writing of the animal's names. He is still forming his letters so that was useful. He really enjoyed it and it provided an excellent learning opportunity.

Here are the options as I understand them: Enable the cron job to download all types from the h5p.org hub. Upload individual .h5p/.zip for each content type you want With option 1 you can download all of the available content types, then delete any that you don't want to support (maybe for accessibility , duplication of functionality of other tools you use, or media storage reasons). The problem with option 1, as I see it, is that any time the cron job runs to fetch updates it will also re-install those unwanted types). Option 2 is attractive, but I'm not clear on where to get the installer files for the content types I want to enable. According to the h5p site, the way to add content types is via the hub that is included in the WordPress/Drupal/ Moodle plugins . I feel like I'm missing a piece here?",

We are planning to integrate H5P as a plugin in our campus, but we would prefer to offer a selected set of content types to our users. We think that this would be less confusing for them. Is there any way to do such a thing, instead of giving to any user with teacher role in any course the ability to install new content types? We are not about not  giving permissions, just trying to set an intuitive environment. Many thanks in advance for any tip, link or experience on deploying H5P in a big Moodle installation. cheers,",

There is not an option to remove a content type once activated. With capabilities you can limit content type management and just have you admins do it. You can do some library management at the admin settings level, including \"restricting\" libraries. We have used this feature to take away a content type that was accidentally or dependency activated, e.g. appear.in for Chat and Talk.\"",

It is unbelievable that in mark-the words- each sentence has to be entered separately, because only one picture or sound file can be added. We did not do that in the year 2000! I wonder which educator has been working here. I don't think that was a teacher, let alone a language teacher. I hope I don't offend anyone here. If that's the case, please explain to me what the motive of the choices H5P makes. Mvg, Henny",

If you feel, as a language teacher, Hot Potatoes gives you a function that H5P does not, that's fine, and you can use that Perhaps other language teachers would find things in H5P they prefer to Hot Potatoes? The aim of H5P is certainly not \"to support language teachers\" - it's much bigger and broader than that as you can see from quickly looking at https://h5p.org",

I think that what you call 6 simple activities are basically are precisely the activities that contain all closed-question types, which are digitally possible and which you will find in all these platforms and programs. Not only with HP, H5P, but also with others. It is Jcloze, Matching, Multiple Choice, Mixing text. I think it indicates exactly what the digital possibilities are ultimately. (when it comes to closed questions) There are many variants and modifications for (also with Hot Potatoes!) but it comes down to these basic activities. What was not possible for the computer age is to show / hear an individual student at the same time an image, sound and text. That was not possible for the digital age. You never had any noise, especially with paper. And sound is essential for language teaching. My students always hear the pronunciation of a word before they can read it. And now I can use my computer. Only then will you get a good pronunciation. This is a didactic principle that is used, for example, by TPR ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_physical_response ). It is an internationally important starting point, which has contributed a lot to the learning of a foreign language. Therefore I am surprised that H5P does not give priority to sound. Why does H5P have almost the same name as Hot Potatoes? That makes them more likely to be compared, while that may not be the case. Apart from al this, I might be that I'm frustrated about H5P, since somebody advised me it as the solution of ll my problems with HP and Moodle. We should blame that person in the first place! ?",

          "Text": "Yes, this is the intended way. Some H5P packages have content types that require and depend on certain library support files to be present to work. You will see that the error message says, \"Missing required library H5P.Image 1.1\" etc in your example. That message tells us that those library files don't yet exist on your Moodle site. The admin needs to install those. A related issue is versions. In your screenshot you will see that the admin has installed Mark The Words, but the error message is telling you it needs Mark The Words version 1.9. So the version on the server is probably too old (but also could too new!). Again, this is an admin task and they can check the versions over in Site admin > H5P > Manage H5P content types. It shows them every content type and every library with the version of each. Right now, there is no tool to manage library and version control in H5P. So admins will have to track this information down manually themselves, which is not easy to come by. There is always the possibility that a teacher will upload a package whose library files aren't in Moodle yet or whose versions are wrong. When that happens, these sorts of messages will appear. However, once the right versions of a library file are installed the first time, any new content type will find them and install correctly.",

I have rebuild what you have stated in my own Moodle 3.5.11 enviroment and was not able to reproduce the issue you present (logged in as a student and the H5P embedded item was showing in the Book). This said I know - and seen - simalar issues that are caused by either a different plugin that H5P that is \"out filtering\" the Iframe code, and/or a Moodle core change. I could seen the Iframe code being \"filtered\" away when I did a browser inspect. Since you seen NO error, just a blank page. I think that it might be either a different plugin ór a filter of Moodle causing this issue. So I advice you: - To login on your student account, go to the book, and do a browser inspect and see if you noticed on the spot the iframe should been shown a class called \"hidden\" (Probably easier when you log in with your own account in a different browser, and do the same browser inspect and check if there is a difference). - Turning off (or maybe even filters ON) in your book activity. I found out that the Math Jax filter was the causing a conflict. Other option: turn debugging on, and check on your student account if you see debug information. Gemma",

          "Text": "We've made a recent upgrade from Moodle 3.4 to Moodle 3.7 and found that all H5P content of type \"Interactive Video\" stopped working. When attempting to view or edit any H5P interactive video on our Moodle site, we simply get a timeout resulting in bad session locks. I'll list all the relevant specs and changes I can think of: New Moodle version: 3.7.4 Change of $CFG->cachedir and $CFG->localcachedir Content Type library updated from 1.21.2 to 1.21.8 Servers (both production and test) are running memcached for sessions H5P version is 1.20.2 on both servers Directory permissions are identical on both servers (777 for moodledata and separate cache dirs) I've tried to replicate the issue on our test system and was successfull in doing so by simply moving said cache directories to their default location (in moodledata) and back (to their custom directory). That was enough. Strangely enough, on our test system, I have been able to remedy the situation by simply deleting \"cache\", \"localcache\", \"sessions\", \"temp\" and \"trashdir\" (in both paths where applicable). On production, this doesn't seem enough. Only two differences between the systems: 1) Production has internet access and thus 2) Production has more current plugin and content type versions (see 1.21.2 vs. 1.21.8 above) I'm at an absolute loss. PHP Debugging on max level is not helpful: \"session_start(): Unable to clear session lock record\" I'm hesitant to start playing around with session handler, etc. My best guess is some interaction between H5P and the moodle cache. But not sure, how exactly... and even less what I could do about it.",

I needed to take some additional steps to reproduce the problem on the test system in the first place: Moving around the cache & localcache folders. It might be worth noting that these changes (moving cache & localcache to more performant storage) were the only changes not tested in detail on the test system. (i.e. we checked whether the whole system would work with these changes, but not every single activity) We can add new H5P content, including interactive videos. That seems to work. We also do have *some* existing interactive videos that work. There does not seem to be a predictable pattern which work and which don't, though the majority fails to load. Other H5P content seems to work just fine. I'm planning to stop the production server completely for a short period of time tomorrow morning, allowing me to clean all moodledata directories I think might be involved: cache, localcache, lock, temp, trashdir Might it be worth a shot to add the \"muc\"-folder to this list?",

          "Text": "Hi everybody, This week, we have continued the hard work on H5P integration by advancing a more robust architecture at Content Bank and xAPI.  We are expanding the use of the Content Bank beyond the system level. Now, it can be used at the Course Category and Course level ( MDL-67786 ). On the other hand, substantial improvements have been applied to xAPI and we already have two of the key xAPI issues in integration, MDL-67734 and MDL-67788 within we can already\nhave tracking in the new H5P activity. Regarding the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we already have the issue in Peer review and we hope to have it in Integration soon. Furthermore, we are working on integrating the Moodle translation system in the H5P Editor ( MDL-68227 ) and adding a post in the translation forum where we explain our approach with the H5P editor localization.\nAlso, we would like to remove the ckeditor from the H5P Editor ( MDL-68240 ) in order to use the current editors in Moodle. Finally, the work in the Repository issue ( MDL-67812 ) has begun and it will allow to easily reuse the contents of the content bank. Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-68116 : Prepare Moodle to be ready when h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We already prepared Moodle to be ready when this year H5P closes h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content. We have removed https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/ [id] as default value in Display H5P filter and the embed field int the Atto button. It's important to notice that the api.h5p.org will continue to work and the only thing that H5P is going to change is the visibility of the test content on h5p.org, so that only the author can see it. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67734 : Create basic skeleton for a global xAPI library needed for H5P content. MDL-67788 : Add xAPI statement support to mod_h5p. Tracking the students's attempts using xAPI in the H5P activity. Warm thanks We want to thank Eloy for taking such good care of us, for his enormous patience and great ideas. For always being available to all of us and accompanying us with his great experience and knowledge.",

Thanks Andrew for your contribution and Ferran for your hard work here ( MDL-67734 ). Creating folders for organising the content and renaming existing content from the content bank ( MDL-67787 and MDL-67790 ). Integration of the H5P editor ( MDL-67814 ). The first version of the editor is almost ready to peer review. We're currently trying to figure out how to integrate H5P translations with Moodle system. All the issues planned for Moodle 3.9 can be found on the H5P epic ( MDL-67425 ). BTW , the date of the next Moodle 3.9 release has been postponed one month and Moodle 4.0 is planned for November 2021. You'll find this information in the roadmap . Hot topics The following issue has been integrated this week: MDL-67707 : Create a new H5P activity. For now, it only lets teachers grade manually H5P activities . Integration with H5P automatic grading and reporting will be done in MDL-67788 , once xAPI skeleton lands. Apart from that, there are several interesting issues waiting for integration review that hopefully will also land soon: MDL-67786 : Create a new 'contentbank' plugin type and a new H5P plugin in the content bank. MDL-67795 : Delete content option in the content bank. MDL-68116 : Prepare Moodle to be ready when h5p.org down completely so that only the author can see the test content Warm thanks All the people around the world trying to make things slightly better and working hard against COVID-19.

This week we have been focusing on the basic structure and design of all different fronts we are working on: The first version of xAPI statement handler is already implemented, documented and waiting for peer review. You can find some more detailed information in xAPI MDL-67734 . The content bank is on its way. For now, the only module in core that uses content bank will be the H5P content manager, but we are sure more will come for future releases. And, as always in Moodle, everybody will be able to create their own content bank plugin as any other plugin type. We hope to get everything ready for Moodle 3.9 and encourage developers to create new plugins that suits their needs. We started working on the H5P core activity ( MDL-67707 ). This will enable users to create new core activities using existing H5P contents in the content bank. We will try to make it as compatible as possible with the current mod_hvp some of you are already using, to be sure you can continue using the content created in older Moodle versions. Hot topics: MDL-67060 : Improve admin UI to make H5P content types management easier for admins showing them all information together in the same page. MDL-67063 : Add a mechanism to support different H5P core_api versions in stable Moodle versions. Warm thanks: To Spanish healthcare system for taking care of some team members. It has been an intense week, but it's getting better.",

          "Text": "Hi Amaia: This is going to happen just one time for Institutions having mod_hvp installed and with content. It would be fine for us to have a migration tool form ONE version of mod_hvp (perhaps the latest stable by April or so) to the initial version on mod_h5p in moodle 3.9. So we don't need this event been added and stored forever in the module db/upgrade.php For mod_h5p the history of upgrades would be clean, and always within mod_h5p. I', thinking something like the admin_tool tool_assignmentupgrade when mod_assignment was deprecated and mod_assign was born. The key point is that I think admins do not need a complete \"any previous version of mod_hvp is compatible with any future version of mod_h5p\". We need a path for upgrade, avoiding being trapped by scenarios where maximal upgradeable state in an install doesn't match with minimum upgradeable in the other branch. The current mod_hvp version 1.20.2 (2020020500) is compatible from moodle 2.7 up to 3.8. So, and admin migrating to 3.9 (or further) just will need to upgrade mod_hvp yo this 1.20.2 (2020020500) version (or other agreed with hvp people in these months before 3.9), then migrate to initial mod_h5p in a 3.9 installation, and then upgrade that to 4.0 or 4.3 in the future. I wholeheartly agree with Stuart that content migration is a must. Unthinkable otherways.  This must be part of the initial implementation plans for h5p integration in core.",

          "Text": "I'm confused how the Display H5P Allowed sources setting in Moodle 3.8 is supposed to operate. Documentation indicates that content from H5P.org and H5P.com can be processed by the H5P Filter in Moodle (meaning the content is rendered, rather than remaining as a link - standard Moodle Filter approach). The Display H5P Allowed sources (filter_displayh5p | allowedsources) has a default value of: https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/ [id] So, I tried adding an additional URL for allowed sources: https://elearningworld.h5p.com/ This does not appear to work. The idea of this Filter is that teachers can link to their repository of content on H5P.org and/or H5P.com - so a domain name like this should work right ? But reading that default URL structure, it's almost like it's pointing to an absolute file reference? I also tried adding a path in a similar structure: https://elearningworld.h5p.com/content/ [id] This just resulted in a \"The link may be broken or the URL has been mistyped\" error. Has anyone else been able to add an additional Allowed Source to an H5P.com account ?",

Could you please confirm that the content URL is not added inside a link tag? If that's the case, you could remove the link tag and leave only the text itself with the URL or wait to upgrade Otherwise, could you please check that 'Display H5P' filter is on and upper than 'Convert URLs into links and images' filters?

Although we still have many details to polish, and a handful of decisions to make, the core tasks of the project are on the verge of integration, closer than ever. We'll probably see any of them integrated next week: MDL-67063 - keeping updated H5P in your Moodle instance. MDL-67707 - H5P activties, a must. MDL-67734 - xAPI. Are you kidding me? MDL-67786 - Content Bank? H5P plugin? Can't wait. MDL-67795 - unfortunately, some times you'll have to delete stuff. MDL-67814 - the H5P editor is almost ready for your eyes; next week will be under peer review. Hot topic MDL-68116 - we need your feedback to improve the H5P Atto button screen. There is an \" URL or embed code\" field to make it easier for users to reuse content from other sites, specially h5p.org. Please vote for one of the options available or give us a\nnew one. Warm thanks International Women's Day is Sunday! The world certainly needs more women in tech, but we are fortunate to have a bunch of them making Moodle better every day, both in Moodle HQ and in the Moodle community. We want to give a big shout out to every one of them, for sharing their talent and energy, and for pushing forward our mission and goals. Each one in their field of expertise is an inspiration and a reference to be followed. It wouldn't be as much fun without you girls.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, The Carnival has arrived at Moodle HQ and at the same time we have started our third sprint surrounded by the best possible environment. During this sprint, we will focus on finalizing the standalone version of the H5P Editor ( MDL-67814 ), we will provide the Content Bank with new features that will allow us to more easily manage the H5P content packages ( Epic 3.9 ) and integrate xAPI with the new H5P activity ( MDL-67788 ) allowing us to handle the tracking of the H5P contents. In addition, we are working on small issues that will turn the Moodle 3.9 H5P integration into a more robust solution ( MDL-67302 and MDL-67095 ). On the other hand, next week, the Moodle Moot Japan 2020 , from 26th to 28th, will be held in Kumamoto, Japan. There, our Moodle LMS Product Manager, Sander Bangma , will talk about H5P and the future of Moodle LMS. Another opportunity to hear directly from Moodle HQ. Hot topics: MDL-67337 Apply Display H5P filter inside <a> tags: From now on, when somebody copies an H5P content URL from a Chrome browser address bar and pastes it in Moodle's rich text editor, it is pasted as a link, inside <a> tags and the 'Display H5P' filter will be applied. MDL-67707 Create a new H5P activity: The first version of the new H5P activity is waiting for integration allowing progress in the integration with xAPI. MDL-67062 Add Admin UI to delete existing libraries: Allow Admins to be able to remove libraries from the Admin UI to Manage H5P content types. MDL-67786 Create a new 'contentbank' plugin type and a new H5P plugin in the content bank. MDL-67063 Add a mechanism to support multi H5P core_api versions. Warm thanks: We would like to thank our super developer, Amaia , an example of commitment, effort and knowledge at the service of the team. Tons of thanks for all the help you give us every day and your active participation in technical and functional decision making. It is blessed to have Amaia by our side.",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, Today we finish our second bi-weekly sprint focused on developing the main skeletons for the new components required for the H5P integration, and much more. This is the current development status: The first version of xAPI statement library is ready for integration review and we hope in the next weeks it can be integrated into the Moodle core. Once integrated, all plugins will be able to use the xAPI statement format to send tracking information to Moodle. You can find more detailed information on xAPI integration here: MDL-67734 . The first content bank component is almost ready for peer review ( MDL-67786 ). For now it can only store and preview H5P files, but we truly believe that Content Bank plugins will be a game changer in Moodle and we are excited to imagine how the community will engage with this new family of content generator plugins. The earlier version of the H5P course activity is now under Peer Review ( MDL-67707 ). This first version covers only the basic activity functionalities (creation, deletion, backup, restore, manual grading...) and has the ability to play H5P files. In the next sprint, we will work on capturing the user tracking and automatic grading. Hot topics MDL-67192 : H5P: get site UUID using H5P API . From now on, each instance will receive a valid ID from H5P servers to download the lastest H5P libraries. MDL-67060 : improve admin UI to manage H5P libraries and give information about H5P tools' status . Now administrators have a nice overview of all H5P components status (H5P filter, Atto plugin and content type cron task) Aside from in this forum, you can also follow our day to day development activities and give us feedback in our H5P Epic for 3.9 .

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We're excited to announce the new features for the integration of H5P into Moodle 3.9 and the progress during these past weeks. Our main goal for Moodle 3.9 is: Integration of H5P content types with Moodle gradebook and activity completion. Improved integration of H5P content type selection in Moodle's activity chooser. To this end, we have worked hard to get a first functional prototype that covers most of the needs expressed in the studies and interviews conducted to the community throughout 2019. The result, is an approach that allows Moodle to be more versatile in content creation. To do this, we have created a prototype that separates the H5P activity module from content creation. Two clearly different mindsets. One for the activity and one for the content creation. In this way, a user can create or add new H5P content from Moodle without associating them with an activity. On the other hand, through the activity, you can access those contents in a simple way and use them through a new repository where you can\nchoose the H5P created in the Content Bank and take advantage of all the activity's functionalities as activity completion or grading. On the Content bank, you will be able to create, import and edit H5P files, among other functionalities.\nThrough this separation, we enhance the reuse of H5P contents that are created or imported into Moodle allowing them to be used in any activity or using the Atto editor or the filter anywhere in Moodle. It will help to provide Moodle with great\nflexibility looking forward to the future. We would like to add all the news and progress in the integration of H5P and Moodle every week. Hot topics: You can check the prototype of the activity here . We will add the link to the Content Bank prototype as soon as possible. We are still working on a full version. You can check the Epic for 3.9 here . We are still finishing the work of adding issues in the epic. Warm thanks: To Rafael Lechugo our UX expert, for sharing with us his great ideas and for demonstrating great patience with all of us.",

From a usability point of view, it would be great to allow the user to create and embed in a single motion. And then possibly save into a Content Bank.

Finding out how to interact with the content bank. Content bank ( MDL-67786 ) - creating a new content bank type plugin (H5P will be the first one). Besides, we have been improving the initial integration of H5P available from Moodle 3.8, such as MDL-67063 (allowing several versions of the H5P core library to coexists) and MDL-67060 (enhanced libraries management). And finally, we have been working intensively on the prototypes of the content bank and how it will interact with the H5P editor: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/2YVQAY2BCRJ#/screens/402513375 Warm thanks A big shout out to our team leader, Carlos Escobedo.

          "Text": "I really love the idea of H5P (new hotness). It is pretty easy to use. It usually looks good (if you build it well). I keep hearing people say it is better than SCORM (old and broke) and these are people who know what they're talking about. But I keep finding little things that are deal breakers. I can caption video. That's great! But if I add audio, no captioning. I can use YouTube video, which already has captioning (possibly bad captioning, but captioning)...but if I use it in interactive video, where I add questions or interaction, the captioning is gone. There's no way to get captions on a YouTube video with interactive video that I can find. Interactive video is so cool. But if you use a large video (what video isn't?!?), your whole site might suddenly start crashing. Yes, I'm sure. And reporting. This is a big one. First. The reports are...not easy to find. Why would I go to the gradebook for activity reports? Well, if I'm using H5P, that's where I go. If I create an interactive video module, my users have to answer the questions and then manually submit them for it to report to me that they have done anything. If they don't do the submitting thing (and there is no way to know you need to do this), it might not remember they did it. Sometimes it starts where they left off...and sometimes it doesn't. And if the site crashes because the video is big...it always forgets. (to be fair, really large scorm modules can muck things up too, but they remember doing it). I'm not hung up on WHEN they started, just that they did. And that they finish. And that it knows they finish. If I want completion to be contingent on completing the whole thing...well, there is no tracking. I can just click next indefinitely and not do anything. If I set up branching, there is a button at the top that lets me skip entire sections . If I want completion to be contingent on a specific score...well,It doesn't do completion on a particular score--only if a score exists...I could fiddle with grade book settings for a grade to pass but I'm not confident it would actually work, because, well scoring is weird. Really weird. I can get grades (or complete/incomplete) from SCORM. If I find an error and need to change it while it is being used by students, when I make the change, it forces my users to start over. Updating SCORM is easy and doesn't mess up reporting. If I want to know how people answered questions. Well, I'd better use something else. That's not something H5P does. SCORM does it (badly--but I can get the data!). I really want to use H5P but I don't think I can. I need these features that SCORM has. Discuss?",

          "Text": "So, I've created SCORM content with Lectora, Camtasia and Captivate. I've seen/manipulated content developed with other products. I've heard some really good things about Articulate (so your complaints are surprising. Back when I first started working with Lectora, if I had seen Articulate first, I probably would have gone that direction instead. But I love Lectora.) I've also used eXe and iSpring. Honestly, I recommend Quiz for testing always. SCORM reports results but cannot give any kind of effective stats on overall participation. Quiz gives stats. LOVE that. I don't test is scorms ever if I can help it (knowledge checks for interactivity, applicability stuff but not actual testing) My experience with people who complain about authoring software is that they generally haven't learned how to set them up properly or they don't think outside the box or they want something that does the hard stuff for them. It really helps to know what you want before you start. I think building in H5P is generally easy. I want to like it. I want to use it. But it can't do what I need with reporting and some of the 'interactions' are a bit clunky. I tend to build branching type stuff...there are four things you have to do but you can do them in any order you want, and my materials tell you when you've completed one. H5P...not so much...you can branch but it is more story branching than what I do. That said...I LOVE story branching! I have used it in the past for human resources training and case management training... I wish I could use it for what I do but the thing I need it...well, it's IT training, which makes story telling more complicated and I'll only have a month of development time (plus my regular job duties for supporting tech for all our departments, answering help calls and managing our Moodle) which isn't a lot of time. Research says a 1 hour on-line module should take about 80 hours of development. I don't think I ever take that long...but you're better off with smaller bites of content--10 to 15 minutes apiece (so, as much as 20 hours of dev)--our attention spans aren't that long and with our tech dependence, they are getting shorter! Tom Kuhlman (Articulate) calls short courses coursels, which I love--he is my hero, so awesome! (Well, and Dan Marsden and Tim Hunt. And Helen and Mary...) Interactivity takes time. You have to know what you want and how it should look/behave. If the student does X, what happens? If they do Y, what happens? It can help if you can create a template and build from there. I once built a course where the student had three case files they had to complete. It was mostly story telling and choose-your-own adventure types stuff with good ending and supervisors telling you you did the wrong thing. It took a ridiculous amount of time to build and was incredibly complicated...but it worked...later I stripped all the actual content out and saved it as a template shared it with a work group I'm a part of...I don't know what happened with it after (but people still talk about it and that was 2 years ago). Lectora is expensive, but I think worth it. It also allows a lot of granular control--variables, action sequences. In fact, if you want any interactivity, you must use variables and action sequences, which requires some braining and working out what you want and when. Captivate is less expensive (but getting more expensive every year) but gives less control--I could set conditions in lectora where if X was true (like a specific quiz grade or range was acheived) then the course would be marked complete at the end but I can't do that in Captivate--completion reporting is hard coded--you give it a grade for passing an that is it--I sometimes don't want 80%, I want a range because it isn't a quiz, it is an assessment of something (like a personality quiz) and Captivate is balls at that. And branching is hard in Captivate (it's hard anyway, from the brain standpoint, but harder). So, that was kind of a dis to people who complain about the tech...to be fair, I complain a lot about Captivate--but that is because it takes about 3 times longer to build something in it than Lectora. Knowing how to do something only gets you so far...but creating interactive video is pretty easy with H5P, which is why it was so attractive. It's fairly easy with Camtasia, as well, but there are weird things about reporting there, too (but it reports and reports completion) and sometimes it crashes or does weird stuff. The short answer is both of SCORM and H5P require skills (with the tech, with design, with knowing what you want). If you just want to share some information and don't care about tracking (like a ppt), it might be easier to use H5P (or upload the ppt). If you want tracking, SCORM works better because, well, it tracks. If you want interactive video and don't care about tracking, H5P is probably nicer to use. If you need to know the person actually did the whole activity, SCORM is better, in spite of being an oldster. And branching, well, if you want tracking and don't care about looking spiff, Lesson is fantastic. If you want tracking and pretty, SCORM. If you just want pretty, well, H5P is okay. But this is a data driven world. We want tracking. If it is just practice, that's fine, go for H5P. But if it isn't practice, I have to still go with SCORM. And that makes me sad.",

          "Text": "So, I created an interactive video with H5P. It is, admittedly, a long video--90 minutes. Throughout, there are questions (hence, interactive).  It went live and within about 45 minutes my server started acting strange. Users across the site started experience Server 500 errors, intermittently. We looked into it.  Something has been opening database connections, leaving them open, sucking up resources and then spontaneously aborting them.  And then the server crashes. It comes back up and starts all over again. Only one thing has changed: the H5P module went live and started getting use. We had no problems when testing it before the go-live, but then it was just me messing with it. So, it seems pretty likely that the issue is related to the H5P. I switched to H5P from SCORM because I didn't like the way the scorm published video couldn't seem to remember where it left off if the user had to stop and come back (Camtasia published scorms just aren't that smart. The alternative is manually captioning 90 minutes of video in Captivate. No. Just...no. Of course, that would work. but I've already spent hideous amounts of time fidgeting my captions to deal with the fact that Safari and Chrome only allow one line of caption...). I'm running Moodle 3.6.2 (will probabaly upgrade to 3.7 in November or Dec).  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or why it would cause this problem?",

Moodle 3.8 will include: - Built in H5P renderer/player (significant back-end work) - Ability to add H5P content easily through a button in atto - A H5P filter So you will be able to upload H5P files or link to them and Moodle will be able to play them without needing the external plugin. And yes, the external plugin will be able to work next to these features in Moodle 3.8, for when you want to create new H5P activities in Moodle. For Moodle 3.9 we will work on building in support for the creation of H5P activities in Moodle that link to gradebook",

I'm testing on my local Moodle 3.8dev+ (Build: 20191004) with latest H5P Moodle plugin verion 1.19.1 dated 2019081600 and the httpswwwroot bug is still there. Of course, if I create a branch and do a search-replace httpswwwroot to wwwroot on all the files in the mod/hvp dir, the problem disappears.

A side effect is that the H5P plugin needs a small modification. This is the request in HFP-2858. So the change needs to occur in the H5P plugin, which you have successfully tested by doing the search and replace. Thomas is one of the maintainers of the plugin, but it is open source, hence I suspect his comment on the issue is suggesting that you or anyone is free to create that branch and send them a pull request. The Moodle team working on H5P have had their hands full on the integration of the H5P player, but I will reach out to Thomas as well.",

It now includes 3 modes : Free browsing is the default mode. In Match mode the user will have to pair the front and the back sides of cards. In Self Correction mode, they will be able to guess the other side of the cards and confirm if they got it correct or not. The Match mode is a brand-new feature. The Drag & Drop experimental version includes many new features too. You are welcome to play with the many examples provided, and to use my libraries on your own Moodle test sites.

          "Text": "Being the most popular additional Moodle plugin, one would expect that the Moodle H5P plugin had full translations for the major languages, but many translations are currently incomplete But the real problem for many users in languages other than English might be the translations of the H5P modules themselves, that need to be done in the H5P GitHub site. And the fact that these GitHub translations seem not to be incorporated into the H5P released packages soon enough As typically we won't release a content type just to\nupdate languages. We will typically release the content types when a\nsignificant feature or bug fix will go out because of the overhead\nassociated with releasing a new version of a content type. Could there be a reasonably policy for updating translation for the H5P modules suggested for them and supported by Moodle users of this plugin with languages other than  English? According to fnoks' post on Fri, 09/26/2014 - 11:39 \" When we get new translation-files from the community, we will create a\nnew release of the H5P content type containing the new/updated\ntranslation, and publish it here on h5p.org .\".  Which seems not to be the case nowadays, as \" For the content types it will be in effect when the respective content types are released. \"",

          "Text": "Germán, I think the whole issue of how the modules (aka library files or content types) will be managed is a big question. If the new plugin in Moodle 3.8 replaces the H5P supplied plugin, but does not have any way to manage those library files, but each Moodle site must still pull them from the H5P hub (or hunt around to get them to update manually), that is not really an improvement. Version control now really doesn't even exist for those library files and those are the important part. Users actually use those, so how those language files get timely updates is vital. What if those library files could be pulled from Github without having to wait for H5P to bundle them up their releases? What if those strings could be pulled / pushed into AMOS so language maintainers could provide the various Moodle languages back to H5P as well? If the content type modules were treated as subplugins of the main H5P plugin (similar say to what Custom Certificate and others do now), that would solve the problem. But it then means HQ must manage those library files on their way into Moodle as proper plugins just as they will be managing the way the main H5P plugin gets into Moodle. Hopefully, this is the eventual plan, as I don't see any other reasonable way to do it, since the package formats of the content files (which are mostly json) are not like Moodle plugins , and the strings are not the same as AMOS based strings. Some sort of conversion tool would have to be built, I would think.",

The learners' records are only saved in Moodle What kind of access does H5P have to our Moodle?

The review is on the list of issues that will be tackled next though, so it won't take \"forever\". You can track the progress in Joubel's ticket system . Regarding the score: Did you set the mastering percentage to 75 % in the behavioral settings? Then the maximum score will also be set to 75 % of what's possible, too. It would be weird if you wouldn't have a full score bar and a filled star on mastering -- H5P computes the score bar based on the achieved score and the maximum score. Also, this behavior was set by design: Essay is not Fill in the Blanks or a word guessing game, but rather a less-than-ideal solution for roughly estimating how well a text is. That's why setting a mastering score lower than 100 % means that it is not necessary to have included all the words. Using this approach students won't have to include all of them to master a task. That's a different notion than having \"only\" found 75 % of the score(d words) but \"generously\" being granted to have mastered the task. You wouldn't grade an essay by comparing it against a list of keywords either. Furthermore, because Essay is not really capable of assessing an essay, it has the option to deactivate the scoring completely and just provide some feedback based on the keywords given or not given. I have elaborated on that issue some more in a blog post (in German) .

By the way: The 255 character limit for feedback has already been raised to 1.000 in the version that still waits for quality assurance (just in case you have missed the discussion in the H5P forum). Also, I can fully support your presentation of the tool's limitations. My own description on github reads: Try to give automated feedback This is rather an experimental playground than a fully elaborated content type for H5P. In its first stage, learners will be able to write a text and receive feedback immediately. Initially (and maybe finally), this feedback will simply be based on a list of keywords that have been defined be a teaching person before. The content type could possibly evolve into a solution for automated essay scoring using machine learning techniques. However, that's merely wishful thinking right now. Also: Beware the pedagogical implications and stumbling blocks! Best, Oliver",

We quickly adopted the H5P plugin based on what we saw in their forums, the usefulness of the plugin to teachers, and just a general feeling that this is too good to not offer to our teachers - even if it went away.  Almost an \"enjoy it while you can\" assumption. As you can see from Oliver they are very much interested in keeping this open source.  I wouldn't delay trying it out.  It's very good.",

This short video demo shows the tool in action: http://demo.h5p.org/ I'd be interested to know if anyone else is looking at integrating such a platform in Moodle.

Having followed the progress of H5P for several years and looking forward to the Moodle integration being finalised, I'm incredibly impressed by what you/the H5P team have achieved. Btw , just to let you know we've installed the plugin under a fresh 3.1.1 system and everything seems to be working perfectly so far. One quick question though: the Moodle page on H5P.org you linked to states that backup of H5P activities within a Moodle course is not supported under v1.0 of the plugin. Do you know if there are plans to implement this functionality in future versions of the plugin and, if, so when this might occur, as this would be a very important feature for us (and likely many other users)?",

Then it starts shouting about missing modules and telling me they are missing from the disk. e.g modulename /mod/hvp 2016051306 I can download something from the site it directs you to but that seems to say drupal and wordpress (no mention of Moodle and seems to unzip into an awful lot of folders) then the only instructions it has are to go through the front end of Moodle into the libraries. I can't do that - where am I looking for in the folder structure - am I looking in the mod/hvp folder or some other folder e.g. lib/ I'm not finding it very clear, but that is probably me misunderstanding.
