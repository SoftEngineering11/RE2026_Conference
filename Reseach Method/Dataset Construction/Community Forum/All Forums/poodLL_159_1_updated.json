          "Text": "Hi Mohammad, I do not think your hosting provider is the problem. MP3 will work fine. You are using the Poodll filter. But Moodle also has a filter called \"MultiMedia Plugins\" filter. Probably they are both processing the same MP3 file, and so they are conflicting. Try this: Move the Poodll filter higher in the order of filters. So that it works first. This should prevent the conflict. Do this at: Site administration -> Plugins -> Filters -> Manage filters Did that work? Finally ... you should use the Cloud Poodll Question. It is much simpler than the Poodll Recording question. And it does not need the Poodll filter. It is here: https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_cloudpoodll",

However, the MP3 file is indeed blocked by my hosting provider, and this has been confirmed by them: \"Good morning Mr./Ms. Mohammad Rizki, This is Goldan here. Regarding the issue, MP3 files are blocked according to our Terms of Service. We recommend using embedding methods, such as uploading to object storage or SoundCloud and embedding the link.\" As a result, I am unable to download or access the MP3 files recorded by the students. Because I have already subscribed to this hosting for a year, I have had to clone Moodle to another hosting provider to access the students' audio recordings. That’s why I’ve been searching for a solution to allow the students' recordings to be in a different audio format, other than MP3. I have also read about the Poodll filter order and have already moved it to the top, but the issue persists. Thank you!",

There are so many things you can do with it, especially get students of foreign languages to speak, which is not an easy task given that they are often very numerous in a university class... Wo use Read Aloud a lot, but I'm new to Minilessons, and haven't been using the widgets much either. So here's the question: in some cases, like in Minilesson or Speechcards, Poodll seems to consider my answers as incorrect how ever hard I try. In the Speechcards items I get like two stars out of three but I'm stuck there (I would love to use this to create structural exercises like Does he like it?|Yes he does - that's a great additional possibility!). I can't see any settings to configure the way it is graded, like I do in Read Aloud - would anyone know if that's possible, and how to do it? Thank you!",

This is under Site Admin ->plugins -> filters -> Video Easy And what version is that template? Or is it modified from the default? The template's settings page should tell you that.

Try turning off Multimedia Plugins filter temporarily. Does that solve it? If so turn it back on, and disable handling of the mp3 file extension by the media player that Multi Media Plugins filter is using.  Or move VideoEasy filter higher in the order of filters at : site admin -> plugins -> filters --> manage filters",

What I have done in the past is add JS script to the page which hunts down uploaded .wav/m4a extension files and then renders those in a popup player if the file link is clicked. If you are able to tinker with js/html to show mp4 or other video files, you could modify that for this task. Probably not the solution you were looking for. But if you want to try ... You will need the Generico filter for this. You need to create a template from the bundle file (popupwavplayer.txt) that I have attached here. Just drag the bundle file over the green \"bundle\" button an empty Generico filter template page in the templates area of the Generico filter settings. And save changes. In safari that drag and drop might now work. In that case use Chrome. ​ The template needs to be inserted as a widget on  page where the attachements are. You might add it to an html block that shows on that page. After you created the template , it should be possible to just paste the following text into block text area. You have to be a little careful when pasting these things that html artifacts do not come too e.g font or span tags. These can break it. (The safest way is really to type it by hand.) {GENERICO:type=\"popupwavplayer\"} The Generico filter bundle is attached.",

The key thing here is that Moodle manages the activity(quiz, activity, forum etc) and by extension the files associated with that activity. So to remove files, you need to remove the attempts or submissions or posts that contain them. Moodle then deletes the files or moves them to trash. The actual restoration of file space (true deletion of file) takes about 4 days for some reason. If a file is no longer necessary then presumably neither is the activity/post/submission containing it. So that really is the best way to manage the files. Poodll could do better in reporting about files, I agree. But its just not a good idea for Poodll to try to remove files that are contained in activities . I know that you are using assignments and students have relatively short enrolment periods. Since Moodle does not offer the ability to delete assignment submissions individually, my suggestion for pruning files is to have two courses and alternate them. When one course no longer has users enroled, then reset the course. This will remove the files associated. You can be specific and reset only the assignments in the course if that is better.",

The two courses idea is a good one but doesn't work for us as we never have the situation of zero users enrolled. At this point I have been able to build a report to see the culprit files.

This seems to be exacerbated by the system seeming to store multiple versions of the same file - see below: We've managed to clear out about 30GB by removing no-longer-needed backups, but I know that within 1-2 months we will be back here again and will either need to commission more server space, or...

One of the fields you have in that table is the contenthash field. For each of those files it will be the same contenthash, and that is how Moodle ties them all together (draft files and permanent files). CloudPoodll is working well and we have built the new CloudPoodll assignment, and another plugin on top of it. The Cloud Poodll assignment is in alpha/beta now.

A couple of things you might try: If you have the PoodLL Record Anywhere, see if you can record directly into the text box for feedback. Might not be able to do if that box is not set to allow any type of media insert/ upload . Another possibility if you have the PoodLL Repository set it up is to set the assignment to allow for feedback files. Then go through the steps to upload a file, but select the Poodll repository, make your audio or video recording, and then upload it. That's one of the things I used to do before retiring so I presume it might still work.",

          "Text": "Hi Justin Due to not being able to upgrade Moodle beyond 2.8.3 at this time, we are using PoodLL 2.7.6. My question is a simple one: is there any way to make PoodLL work (i.e. allow audio and video submissions) on people's iOS mobile devices like iPhones? Regardless of what settings we try, we cannot get it working. When we enable HTML5, we get the following on iPhone: When we use the default Flowplayer or the PoodLL player, we see this (and it's unclickable)... When we use the JW player, we see this... And those represent all the possible player options we have in PoodLL 2.7.6. Any advice or guidance would be gratefully appreciated. Kind Regards Lee System details: Moodle version: Moodle 2.8.3 (Build: 20150202) PoodLL Filter is 2.7.6 (Build 2015070401) Online PoodLL submissions is 1.5.8 (Build 2014062000)",

If tiny recordings always upload ok, but longer ones do not, then look to update your course max upload size. https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/File_upload_size Justin",

Some of them on the server and some of them on the browser and some of them in the network between them. I am pretty confident that the server is doing the job properly. I just tested now with a 1 minute video from an iPhone 6+ and it transcoded so fast I was worried it had failed. But it worked fine. So I think we need to know more about how you did the upload, which plugin you were using did you use the File Upload => 'Record or Choose' option what version of iOS / iPhone did the converted file ever come back (ie after 20 ... 30 minutes) and any other information you can add",

I would: i) visit the site notifications page and make sure there are no pending installs. Site administration -> notifications ii) confirm that the Poodll recording question is not showing in the list of plugins on the plugins overview page ii) purge the Moodle cache to make sure the cache of database tables is current Site administration ->developer->purge all caches.

You can not uninstall Poodll recording question type if Poodll questions remain on the system. And you can not uninstall the Poodll filter while other dependant plugins (including the Poodll recording question type) are on the system. So you first need to remove any Poodll content, then the plugins that depend on the Poodll filter, then the Poodll filter.

But then in the current submission area, FlowPlayer says the submission is 00:00 in length. Cannot play it back. When I download the file, it is zero KB.

One obvious thing that can cause this, is when your microphone does not capture any audio. This can be because you don't have a mic, or because you have not granted permission to the browser (or Flash) to use the mic. It can also sometimes be because your browser refuses to allow access to the mic . This can happen if your site is not on HTTPS, with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox . You can try recording at https://demo.poodll.com because this is all set up ok. If you need to test Flash, try using Internet Explorer. That should default to Flash,",

Just FYI , our Moodle version is Moodle 2.8.3 (Build: 20150202) In the Plugins area, the two relating to PoodLL are these: The PoodLL Filter is 2.7.6 (Build 2015070401) The Online PoodLL submissions is 1.5.8 (Build 2014062000) I note that in your demo site there appear to be many more references to PoodLL settings in the admin area. I've also screen-dumped out our PoodLL Filter settings into this document if you'd like to take a look? I'm not having any issue with the recording aspect - the green bars flash. Also, I jumped on your demo site as a student and was able to successfully record. In saying that, I noticed that the recorder and player on your site looked different to mine. Mine look like this: Old versions of the Flowplayer perhaps? Justin, where are the audio and video submissions stored? If they are supposed to live on our webserver, are there certain directories that need to be established by our web host - or will the Plugin do this on first save?

Basically, I found the following: I could not record on Chrome. It could not find the camera or mic, and would not prompt, despite settings saying it is to prompt (see below). I could play back on Chrome. I could record and play back on Firefox. I could not record on iOS using either Chrome or Safari browsers - see below error. At the end of the day, we need a solution that simply \"works\" for students with minimal intervention. So is there some issue with this old version of the recorder/player? What is the best solution to get things working nicely on all/most devices? If the answer is upgrading PoodLL Filter to the latest version, would that version operate on our older version of Moodle?

The best solution really is to move to HTTPS. There is no real reason to stay on HTTP and plenty of reasons to go to HTTPS. Many of the Cpanel based hosting providers provide free SSL now, and you can also get good free ssl from : https://letsencrypt.org/ The recorders that you see on https://demo.poodll.com are HTML5 recorders.

I understand the use of this, to help manage problems and have them resolved sooner. In these information,  there is the \"number of active users\". The problem is that, to obtain this number, there is (i suppose) a calculation made from the log table, and this calculation can be very very long. Moreover, it generates a very big load on the server . On my plateforms, it has taken up to 5 minutes for the biggest one When, has an admin, you open a setting or information page, you expect to have it open (nearly) instantly, and not to have to wait several minutes. I really think that this calculation should not be made when you open this page, but on (specific) demand, with a big warning , or by cron, at a moment where the server is less used. Séverin",

Student reads a question Student records an answer with PoodLL Student compares their own answer to a model answer in \"general Feedback\" Student grades their answer (so the Teacher doesn't have to\") Steps 1 through 3 are obviously already standard quiz steps. The fourth is important for me since the objective of the exercise I'm trying to build is the checking of the answer (and not necessarily the answering). I realize this is probably a general Moodle question rather than PoodLL specific, but since I got no answer in the general Moodle forums, I thought maybe another PoodLL user had experienced the same need.",

This has worked well for us this past school year. Another thing you could do is direct link to an externally stored audio/video file (in the assignment feedback text box) but that can be a little time consuming if your looking to do that regularly.",

Poodll repository. I'm trying to wrap my head around what it is and exactly how it works. It is basically just allowing a folder to add files to/take from that get stored there? I see in the settings it says 6 site wide instances, but, zero category or course instances since it isn't enabled in any courses. We use Poodll for submissions with the assignment activity, qtype for the quiz activity, as well as the necessary Poodll filter to render the audio player/recorder. My ultimate question is can I uninstall the poodll repository plugin without it affecting the aforementioned assignment submission, qtype, and filter in any way?

For example, if you go to add a picture into an html area, the popup dialog allows you to enter a URL , or to \"browse repositories\"(usually) Once you are in the repositories area , you have options to: upload a file choose from server /recent/private files area (optionally) get a file from google drive (optionally) get a file from wikimedia etc Its not just html areas either. The little file attachments drag and drop area, that you see under forum post forms and in other places, is also powered by the repository system. Regarding Poodll, mostly you do not need the Poodll repository any more. Poodll Anywhere for Atto and TinyMCE allow you to record/draw into a text area faster than going via the repository system. But you might need it sometimes, eg when you only have a file attachments area. Removing it won't affect anything else in Poodll. So you can safely remove it I think. Repository intances actually need to be setup, so if you did not do that then its doubtful you are using it anyway.",

I've never used them and I don't think any one has ever used them. My guess is the previous admin simply installed all of the Poodll mods regardless of whether they were used or not. I see what you mean that if the editor doesn't have Poodll Anywhere, you would need to use the Repository short cut (provided it's there) through the file manager. And if there is no editor available, then the file attachments area is the only way to access it. Adding it to my remove list . Thanks for clarifying.",

I think this is because we use the Amazon AWS SDK in Poodll, and Moodle does some verification on the code, and there is a lot of code. Can you check what the reported max execution time on your site is when you visit: Site admin -> server ->php info It should be 90 or more. If you really can't get past this, I am happy to look into it for you. But in that case you should start a ticket via https://poodll.com/contact .

However, now it isn't visible. All that shows in the forum window is \"upfile_468814434.mov\". In the html I can see \"<p><img src=\"https://XXXXXX.XXXXXX.xxxxxxx.ac.jp/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/851821148/upfile_468814434.mov\" alt=\"upfile_468814434.mov\">\" which means it should be showing doesn't it?

          "Text": "Hi Eric As a super Poodll 3 guy you can, and probably should, send support requests via the contact form at https://poodll.com/contact or send email directly. The reason is that in Poodll 3 there is a support info file that you can generate. That tells me all your versions and settings, and it speeds things up. Find that at: site admin -> plugins -> filters -> poodll -> support info ( I think its probably best not to attach it to forum posts. ) To answer your question. It sounds like \"cloud recording\" is off. In that case the mov file has not been sent to the Poodll cloud conversion service. So it is stuck a mov file. Try turning on \"cloud recording\" on the Poodll filter general settings page. This is really the best thing to do. You could maybe play ,mov file back as is.  As long as the player selected was good with mov files. You could try the Media Element Video player in Poodll. This page explains how to set up Video JS, but the principles are the same for Media Element Audio. https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/video-js/ Finally there is a Poodll App these days. Read about that here, https://poodll.com/poodll-3-docs/using-the-poodll-mobile-app/ That makes it easier to record audio/video off iOS devices. But it also works best with cloud recording. So you should have that enabled.",

The only tool that seems to be available deals with Audio Gain (50), Echo Suppression (on), Silence level (0), and Loopback (off) Thought I would check the PoodLL video to see if the audio was working there - it isn't. In the PoodLL video, Audio Rate is set at 22; the other settings are identical to the PoodLL Audio mp4 is available but it doesn't make a difference whether or not it is ticked.

This is because: i) no sound can be played back from the audio recorder itself ii) the video recorder records video, but not sound This means that it is likely to be something specific to your pc. If it were a permissions issue, your video would not be captured. So this makes me think that you either have no microphone or your microphone is off or your machine has multiple audio capture devices and the wrong one is being used. If you right click the recorder and choose \"settings\" or \"properties\" you should be able to see the audio capture devices that Flash has detected. You can also see when audio is picked up by the mic. If you play around there, can you make something work?",

In my case it is Poodle anywhere that is affected (browser or theme are not relevant in this). If a user tries to add a poodle recording in an HTML editor for the first time a pop up appears in which the user must allow Flash to use the microphone.

Using the very latest version of PoodLL 3 with a valid license, Moodle 3.1. The uploading wheel spins indefinitely – even after 15 mins it is still there. I also use my own Red5 server which is working correctly. I have restarted it and tried again and again. This also happens when I use the default Tokyo server. Note that this is a 6-second video, it shouldn't take longer than a minute tops should it? Upon either 'insert' or 'cancel' (clicking the X), nothing happens, nothing is embedded on the page.

The two most likely causes are: i) You have not selected \"cloud recording\" and hence your PoodLL is trying to convert to MP4 on the Red5 server. While that is still possible, it is just too inefficient and doesn't produce the best MP4 files. ii) There is a permissions or timeout error at poodllfilelib.php. The best thing is if you can export a copy of the support info csv file from : site admin -> plugins -> filters -> poodll -> support info and submit it to me at : https://poodll.com/contact That gives me all the tech info I need about your server, so we do not have to play email/forum ping pong. Going forward, we now have a helpdesk so that we can track of these support requests. So if you are on PoodLL 3 its best to post support requests via the contact page. I do check the forums, but I won't respond as quickly here.",

So on the page: site admin -> plugins -> filters -> manage filters move PoodLL higher than MMP in the list. Disabling MMP will also work. And maybe its simpler. The only proviso here is that YouTube links are handled by MMP. So you would lose that. PoodLL can also handle YouTube links, just as you set up mp3 handling, you need to set up YouTube handling. The player template/preset is Youtube lightbox, but I will add a few more options shortly. Regarding ii) selecting \"no cloud\" with the mp3 recorder, This will have no effect on the mobile app or the other recorders. (at least not in the latest version). The mobile app is looking good but its still a few weeks away J",

The setting worked for me: 1) move PoodLL higer than MMP in the list ( I find that which one goes first does not have much difference) 2) select \"no cloud\" 3)  use JS audio to handle MP3 file However some of the students report that they had problem on their computers. The Issues they had were: 1) When I clicked record it didn't say it was recording 2) It couldn't play back the recording 3) When you click save it had an error uploading. I also tried: 1) move PoodLL higer than MMP in the list/ turn off the MMP ( But if I turn off the MMP I will have the uploading error when play back the recording attempts. ) 2) keep the \"cloud\" 3)  use JS audio to handle MP3 file I still have the problem with the recording saying \"poodll is still converting your audio, please try again later.\"",

Is there any common factor relating students whose recordings fail? Some of the common problems are i) check the permissions on /filter/poodll/poodllfilelib. php They should be 644 or 664. Sometimes they get messed up when you upgrade. This would cause all mp3 recordings to fail. ii) Try recording tiny small recordings, do they work? If so, a) check your max upload size for the course you are using b) check if suhosin is enabled on your php. This and apache mod_security can both interfere with the upload. iii) If you look in your browser console , there will probably be an error after a failed upload. You might find it on the \"network\" tab of the console, in the request to poodllfilelib.php Seeing that error would help",

We are running moodle 3.0.5+ on RHEL 6 with postgres DB We have installed the following PoodLL plugins: Filter ( 2.8.6(Build 2016061600)) Recording ( 2.6.0(Build 2015121100)) Assignment Submissions ( 1.5.9 (Build 2015121101)) Feedback ( 1.0.6 (Build 2015121101)) I noticed a number of warnings in the error log: [Wed Aug 17 16:42:40 2016] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File does not exist: /ROOT-DIRECTORY/moodle/mod/assign/skinvolumemeter.png, referer: https://SERVERNAME/moodle/mod/assign/view.php [Wed Aug 17 16:42:40 2016] [error] [client x.x.x.x] File does not exist: /ROOT-DIRECTORY/moodle/mod/assign/plainskinbackground.png, referer: https://SERVERNAME/moodle/mod/assign/view.php Is there some configuration issues we missed? Also, when we attempted to submit an audio assignment, the recorder would appear, the audio would be recorded and could be listened to but when submitted, the recorder showed up again on screen and the page was still loading (spinning).  I noticed a brief glance of some debug information and realized that moodle was set to debug email sending.  If I stopped the page, and went back to view the assignment, the audio was uploaded and working (blue flow player).  When I turned the debug off, it appeared to work. Also, for some reason, a tester indicated that they were unable to use the recorder but then it started working.  I know this is minimal information but is it possible that cache needed to be cleared or permissions for player needed to be accepted? Any advice would be appreciated.  If I have more additional comments, I will add them. Thanks Eric",

          "Text": "Hi Eric Sorry for the slow reply. Those error messages about .png files can be ignored and they are annoying. I think I removed those in the latest version. The other issues are a bit hard to pin down. Sometimes debug and other output can get mixed up in what should be meaningful ajax responses and even into the recorded files themselves. Of course this shouldn't really happen but I have seen it before. I would consider this not a likely cause of the other problems you reported. There are many ways recording can fail, let me count the ways The recording timed out during upload The user's mic device is not recognized or not available The user has not given permission via various popup dialogs to access mic device The recording can't be uploaded due to bandwidth or network issues There are file permission issues on the PoodLL files There is a bug in PoodLL somewhere There is not really a problem, but the user thinks there is The file is recording ok, but its in a format that can't be played back The PoodLL filter settings are to convert with FFMPEG but ffmpeg is not set up PHP security settings, mod-security or suhosin are killing the file upload And that won't be all of them. So its a bit of a minefield at times. Its most likely a permissions, network or device issue. Try really short recordings, and see if they work. If they do, and big long ones don't, then try using the red5 audio recorder (ie not the mp3 one).",

The Atto PoodLL Anywhere buttons will let you do recordings in the forum, database , glossary, newest version of journal, or just about anywhere you can use the Atto editor. All of those options allow for easy deletion. If you also install the PoodLL repository plugin, then you can also do recordings with the Podcast (pcast) plugin, which was my favorite way of having students submit recordings.",

A pop-up window shows up, but before you can click to give permission for the asset to be used, the popup disappears.

          "Text": "Hello Community; I am struggling to get consistent and good performance out of Poodll/Moodle specifically regarding mobile uploads of video assignments. I am evaluating Poodll in a self hosted virtual instance of Moodle, and have found that although small mobile video files under 10MB will generally upload via Poodll and play back without issue on the source device, once the file size exceeds roughly 15-20MB, then things start to fall apart. Background... My use case requires that all students will be submitting assignments via mobile device platforms, which if I understand correctly would be best served by converting submissions via FFMPEG for widest mobile platform compatibility. Therefore, I have built FFMPEG on my test server from sources, and have verified that when called from the system path, it is working correctly. I have also verified via shell command that the FFMPEG switches used on the poodll demo site are working. Therefore, I assume that the Poodll Filter settings to auto convert mobile submissions to MP4 and to use FFMPEG for the conversion are also working, although I have yet to determine how to verify this as I have not seen any entries in any server logs. Back to the problem at hand... Without FFMPEG settings enabled in the Poodll filter, files of any size, up to the server limit of 512MB, will upload from a mobile device without issue. Playback is choppy over mobile data, but plays smoothly via WiFi, suggesting that playback quality is bandwidth dependent. With FFMPEG conversion settings enabled in the Poodll filter, mobile uploads above approximately 15MB in size will cause a browser error on Chrome, or will simply never complete the upload process in Firefox . In Chrome, after selecting a mobile video larger than 15MB to upload, the progress bar never appears and within about 15 seconds Chrome will throw an \"Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage...\" error. In Firefox, after selecting a mobile video to upload larger than 15MB, the progress bar will appear, but no indication of upload activity will be evident and the process never completes. Obviously, in both cases Mobile uploads will fail. Since it is possible to turn on the mobile upload processing error, and turn it off, by enabling and disabling the FFMPEG conversion settings in the Poodll filter, I assume that the root issue is with the filter and not my environment, but I would appreciate some other perspectives or troubleshooting  suggestions on the matter. Moodle is running on a Debian (Jesse) instance, with 2GB of RAM, 60GB HD, and PHP.INI settings that allow up tp 512MB uploads and 640MB of script memory. Regards; Michael",

This will mean that the browser won't wait for the transcoding to finish. It relies on cron to kick off the transcoding. So it won't start till cron runs. Though it does sound like the real issue is with uploading. There are settings that affect uploads on your web server. Apache mod_security and the PHP extension suhosin are two of those. I would look into that. Both of those by default limit the size and nature of uploads.",

The usual suspects are suhosin and mod_security. In php.ini there are also: memory_limit upload_max_filesize post_max_size Apparently the values of those should follow this pattern: upload_max_filesize =< post_max_size =< memory_limit So the simple way is to make them all the same, but upload_max_filesize should never be greater then post max_size, which should never be greater then memory_limit. I am not an expert in this, though I have learned the hard way about some of it. Another thing you might try is recording over at https://demo.poodll.com . This is using the new PoodLL3 and Amazon S3 for uploads. If that all works for you, perhaps PoodLL3 would be a good solution",

So going premium is not something I have taken likely. At its heart is the reality that PoodLL needs a lot of work to make the full transition to HTML5 and for a host of other feature improvements and better support options (incl. documentation). You can read more on an this here: http://poodll.com/?p=2107 It will be available as an annual subscription with 3 tiers of membership: i) individual teacher (aka little guy) ii) single institution/organization iii) partner The pricing and some other details are yet to be decided, but from now on there will be more no more updates published on Moodle.org or the existing GitHub repositories, other than bug and security fixes. In the past I maintained a mailing list of PoodLL users, but these days that list doesn't contain the large majority of users. So currently there is no direct way for me to communicate with the PoodLL user base.  It would be very helpful for me if as a PoodLL user you could take this quick 8 question survey. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/63DJ529",

On a completely different but related matter, I was reminded of the thread earlier on plugins.  I am still of the opinion that alongside the plugin/premium ecosystem we have talked about, we need a \"Givealittle\" style option. I found my post from 17th June here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=314916#p1263153 I think I will give this a little bump. My view remains unchanged: \" As a first off, I'd like someone to make it easy for us to \"give a little\" to any developer with a plugin in the database .  Quite apart from any of the complex plans and programmes you have thought about\" I will watch developments with interest Justin. -Derek",

So think about what has happened on your site recently. A Moodle or plugin upgrade perhaps? A common problem these days is Moodle installing the plugins with permissions that your server doesn't like. Maybe check the poodll filter directory has permissions 755 for folders and 644 for files.",

          "Text": "Hi there, I've just installed the latest version of the filter and the online assignment plugins in my Moodle 3.0.1 site, so students can submit assignments by recording themselves. It all works flawlessly on Chrome and Edge, but on Firefox (v43.0.4, the latest one with the latest flash plugin), it doesn't work. I can start the recording (after giving Flash permission to use my microphone), I then proceed to stop it and I see an \"uploading\" spinning symbol, but when it finishes the recording hasn't been actually saved, nothing plays when I click on the play button of the plugin, or when I save the supposedly recorded audio and use the media player to listen to it. Not even if I submit the assignment. One thing I can tell is different from when I try this same action on Chrome and Edge is that on those browsers, while I speak, the volume bar in the plugin shows feedback (with green and red bars), while on Firefox that doesn't happen. I've been able to test this in a couple computers running Windows 10 and the latest version of Firefox, both with exact same results. In those same computers, using Chrome or Edge works fine. Is this some sort of bug in Firefox (or the plugin) not actually enabling the microphone? Any way around it? Thanks so much in advance for any feedback, this plugin is awesome! Edit: I forgot to mention that I also tried with the audio submission example in the Poodll demo site ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?id=87&action=view ) with same exact results, so it's not something related to my Moodle site or my server ...",

But even if you did upgrade you will still experience some of those problems. Files recorded on your device will not necessarily play back in the same device's browser. For example iPhone records mov files, and Android records different file types depending on the device model. But those are mostly rotten for use in a web environment. PoodLL can't do much about that, except to receive the recordings and then convert them to a better format. You will need to convert them using FFMPEG to a file format that can be played back generically. By email last year I sent you notes on the FFMPEG setup. The javascript whiteboards should work, but there were issues in Moodle 2.8 with Literally Canvas, so please try drawingboard.js. It is one of the options in the PoodLL filter settings. Regarding being logged out when trying to upload, I have heard of this but have not had a chance to look into yet. Justin",

Because the file permissions are correct when they leave PoodLL HQ, but somehow when they arrive on people's servers  they occasionally end up wrong. I suspect that in order to use Moodle's automatic plugin installer people change their file permissions to allow write access. If you use Filezilla FTP client , or something similar, a simple way to do this is to right click the poodll plugin folder and choose \"file permissions\" and then recursively change directory permissions to 755.

          "Text": "Hello there! We're trying to get Poodll working with our Moodle 3.0.2+ and the newest PoodLL Filter and Poodle Anyhwere for Atto and everything is still a bit wonky. Audio recording works on desktop browsers out of the box (except for Firefox , which needs flash in \"unprotected mode\")  but on mobile devices recorded files upload without a file extension (e.g. \"upfile_121212.\"), which obviously causes all sorts of problems (also they still seem to be AAC MPEG 4). The video recorder works on mobile devices (probably because they directly output mp4) but on desktop we experienced some strange behaviour and I wanted to ask how this might happen: when opening the video recorder, there is a red cross in the lower left corner and the video controls are deactivated/greyed out. After some googling around I learned that this means that PoodLL can't connect to a Red5 Server . As soon as I type in the defaults (tokyo.poodll.com) the controls light up and I can record. It then says \"cannot convert locally\" or something like that and I guess that this has to do with some less than optimal FFMPEG config on our end (it's a unix server). My questions: 1) Could the missing file name extension be related to our FFMPEG not working correctly ? (the file not being MPEG Layer 3 obviously is) 2) Due to privacy concerns from our computing center we can't have any external servers listed in the application configuration. Will the controls in the video recorder work when our FFMPEG is responding correctly (but i guess the flash plugin doesn't check that beforehand)?. If we use local conversion, we shouldn't need to enter a Red5 server to click on \"record\", right? The whiteboard and screenshot are working fine on our test system right now and we're not using anything else. It would be great if someone could help us out here! Thanks for the great plugin and best wishes from Germany, Felix",

          "Text": "This is all probably related to an FFMPEG setup that is not working properly. Its a bit hard to say without logging in  and poking around, especially the missing file extension is a bit dodgy.  But mobile devices and how they upload is a bit of a minefield and depends a lot on the device, browser and versions. PoodLL can probably handle it regardless if you specify the FFMPEG conversion parameters ... provided FFMPEG is working. The video recording relies on a Red5 server, and tokyo.poodll.com is the one that most people use. FFMPEG working or not, the video recording goes via Red5 (for desktop machines) so the greyed out controls and red cross won't be solved by fixing FFMPEG. You will need a working red5 server with PoodLL installed on it.  You can set up your own to get around privacy restrictions, but its a bit a technical.  I have attached 2 PDFs,  a \"how to\" on RED5 + PoodLL set up and a \"how to\" for FFMPEG + PoodLL set up. If you want me to do the setup, then it becomes a commercial discussion and those  need to take place off-forum. So message me in that case.",

Last week I decide to update Poodll plugin (filter and Question types: Recording) of my moodle. unfortunately all Whiteboards questions didn't work now! When student has completed the whiteboard with their answers, after validation of the question, Moodle tell them that they don't have answer yet. And if teacher try to see student's work, it's the same thing. I try to use all diferent whiteboards : nothing change... modify a question and save it again : nothing change... Also purge all cache of moodle : nothing change... It's the second time I have this problem. First time, to solve it, I do another moodle with an installation of the new plugin poodll and after restore all courses. Actually, I have no time to do this (and I really want to know what's happen and solve the problem).",

Most of it was done long ago, but it took time to get the javascript whiteboards ready and I took the opportunity to clean up a lot of old code in the PoodLL filter. The current release is for Moodle 2.9.x and 3.0.x only. Because of the code cleanup, all the PoodLL plugins will need to be updated. If you are using Git to update your plugins, each of the plugins has a branch called MOODLE_29+ . This is the correct and most up to date version for Moodle 2.9.x and 3.0.x. From now on avoid using the \"master\" branch. Finally PoodLL now requires the site admin to register their PoodLL. There is no charge for this at this stage, and its simply a matter a getting a registration code by filling in a form, and check ing email. A registration code can be obtained at: http://poodll.com/registration",

Some other questions about evolution of PoodLL: i know you plan to make PoodLL paying ; do you have precise date? an idea of the cost? and some precision about paying possibilities (because i know it's sometimes complicated for french universities)? will PoodLL sites already registered continue to have PoodLL functionnal when it's the case? will paying be required to use PoodLL, or will allow to have additionnal capabilities? All these questions to better know what you plan, and what can be done for us... Séverin",

You can use the same registration key on multiple sites.  The site url is for reference at this stage, but please leave the trailing slash off. The purpose of requiring people to register, is so that I can contact the right people about PoodLL developments. These communications will not be often. They will likely  be information about upcoming releases, broken functionality,  questions about PoodLL usage, but there will be news about commercial matters too. I had planned to impose a paywall on this version of PoodLL but I was worried that the word had really not gotten out about that. And as you mention, we need to give institutions fair lead time for this sort of thing. So it seemed too abrupt and the lack of a PoodLL for Moodle 3 was preventing people upgrading. So I decided to simply require registration so that I could communicate with the key people to manage the transition more smoothly. The current version of PoodLL will remain available indefinitely (and any security/bug fixes). Later versions will be premium.  Any new release from now on will be premium. I am estimating that institutions will pay $US800 per year, but I want to keep the option available for individual teachers to continue to use PoodLL.. I am still thinking through how best to do that. The revenue will pay for more reliable release dates that match those of Moodle. And it will pay for the addition of a host of new features. The plan is to hire some help for those. The wishlist includes: Cloud hosting of PoodLL recordings Cloud hosting of media files HTML5 audio and video recorders HTML5 audio and video players HTML5 snapshots Contributions to the Literally Canvas whiteboard codebase A mobile application for PoodLL Data logging on all aspects of PoodLL use Multiple education purposed  HTML5 audio players (once players, mini players, subtitle players) An audio recorder with built in shadowing and mirroring functions Full HTML5 and audio enabled flashcards Skinnable audio and video recorders An html5 widgets icon for the Atto editor Almost none of this will be available immediately however. It is something to look forward to!",

Since then I haven't seen anything on this issue.  With the release of Moodle 3.0, this becomes a bit more pressing.  I've nothing against the premium concept, and given how important I find Poodll, I'm principally in favour of the move.  But I would like to know what the situation is. For example, will the current version (which I understand will not be actively supported in future) still work with future Moodle versions?  I guess ony Justin can answer this, but for many people this could be important. Has anyone tried  Poodll with 3.0?  Have there been any issues? Given that a lot of language teachers rely on Poodll in their courses, it would be nice to have an update so that the planning can begin. (If I have missed an article/post about this, then I apologise and would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.) All the best Andy",

Possibly it is not enabled yet. If you don't need RTMPT, then don't worry about it. Try putting 5080 into your poodll filter settings http port setting, and see if it works Ideally the RTMPT port should be 80 or 443. That is because for bypassing firewalls, those two ports are  usually open. The http port is for moodle server to red5 server communications (ie downloading the recorded file). If both machines are on the same network then you don't have to worry about firewall issues, and even a high port will work ok.",

That is important. At this point your recording is already gone. There is probably nothing you can do but re record. Things to check i) is the microphone capturing sound? Or the video camera capturing your picture. If not, then there is nothing to submit or convert. And you might get this error. ii) does a very short recording get submitted ok? Sometimes longer recordings have problems at the server or browser level. iii) what recorder are you using? The two audio recorders look similar but are completely different. The video one is different again but in terms of troubleshooting its identical to the red5 audio recorder. MP3 recorder: recordings get less reliable as they get longer. Best not to venture over 2 mins. conversion to MP3 happens before the upload . If the file is too big it might spin forever and give up if the upload begins but throws an error, the connection to the Moodle server is problematic. Check the browser console for errors related to the file being posted. Some servers restrict the upload file size. Thats a whole new ball game, but if thats the case small uploads will be working. audio recorder/video recorder (red5): if you can't play it back after recording.... then the file never arrived on the Red5 server. Check the connection lamp on the recorder. Should be green. If its red or yellow your connection is bad (firewall? ) or the red5 server is down (happens.) If you can play it back, but get the error message above ... then the problem is that your file can't be collected from the Red5 server and copied back into Moodle. Turn off auto convert to mp3/mp4 in the filter settings and try again (or uncheck the mp3/mp4 checkbox on the recorder BEFORE recording). If conversion is the issue then its best to set up FFMPEG on the Moodle server and have PoodLL do its magic with that. Check the port settings in the PoodLL filter settings for HTTP. Your Moodle server will need to be able to do a server to server connection to that port on the  Red5 server to pick up the recorded file.",

Chrome and other browsers may have their own permissions dialogs which will be shown after flash tries to access the mic. Other things to check might include that the microphone is plugged in, or if there are multiple microphones in the machine, that the correct one is selected. (again right click ->settings and choose the microphone tab ). Occasionally it is necessary to mess with the microphone tab settings there to spark the microphone into action. I do not know why.

I have read that the text cache lifetime is no longer an issue for 2.9.1 (Build 20150806) I purged all caches today but to no avail.

One of the biggest problems is that it was very confusing for students because they couldn't tell if their audio actually submitted, as no notification was given, and after saving, they can't see the file there, or listen back to it. The instructor had the same problem in leaving voice feedback for students. Is there anyway for students and instructors to listen to files after they've been submitted? Or for instance if an instructor uses PoodLL to give feedback and two weeks later wants to hear it to remember what they said can they? Currently that doesn't seem available.",

The recorder does allow you to playback the recorded file, and should display an \"uploading\" dialog. And after the page hosting the recorder has been saved, there should be a player (audio or video) in the feedback area for the student ( or on the submission summary if its an assignment submission). And when the teacher returns to the page they should see a recorder for re-recording and a player for listening to the existing feedback recording. If none of that is happening, it should be, and so there is some problem at your end.",

I battled for some time to make the buttons visible to screen readers and in the end found that it was not going to work ... because of limitations of the framework I originally wrote the recorders in. Though it did not occur to me then, since that time I have found a way around those limitations and have implemented it in one of the recorders. Basically by hiding the flash widget and handling all user interaction via html buttons and javascript a far more accessible interface can be made. Effectively we are introducing skinning to PoodLL. It is just a matter of finding the time, to get it all done. But accessibility goes beyond just screen readers, so any comments or advice would be welcome.",

The other recorders require similar work, but at least we have a pattern to go with.

Information on how to do that is here: http://poodll.com/flash-and-poodll/ In short, in the PoodLL filter settings, widgets, players and recorders can be limited to HTML5 only in the \"When to use HTML5\" section. The default whiteboard can be selected in the \"Whiteboard settings\" section. N.B. The non flash whiteboards (LiterallyCanvas and DrawingBoard.js) are not working properly in Moodle 2.9 yet. I am not actually advising anyone to turn Flash off. I will leave that to people more knowledgeable than me.

The best way to deal with this is to install FFMPEG on your server and set PoodLL to autoconvert incoming audio uploads to MP3. If you are not sure can you attach one of the recordings to a reply on this post, and I will look at it. There is a setting in the PoodLL filter settings which will show a download icon beside the player (for admins). I posted a screenshot of that.",

I installed Poodll (latest version as of 22 May 2015, I think 2.6) by dragging the zip file of poodle on to the plugin installation screen within Moodle. It seemed easy enough ... Moodle reported succes! I only installed the filter, because (for now) I only need the flashcard widget. I watched several videos on youtube how to use the widget, but finally I noticed that poodle is nowhere to be found in the repositories! Note that the Poodle filter has been enabled already. So something has gone wrong... I tried to add flashcards but nothing works. Then I also installed the repository plugin from Poodll, and now I could enable Poodle not only on the Filter page, but also on the repository page... I also added questions to the question bank, I added a page with the widget code in the code (copied from the poodll website)... but when I click save and show I only see back and next and NO questions. What do I do wrong?? The installatin seemed to be succesful but since nothing seems to work I am not 100% sure... Any help is welcome! Michael",

But what is not ok is when Moodle tries to copy the file back into Moodle's file system Check these things: i) the location of the recorded file. It should be in the dir specified in /webapps/poodll/WEB-INF/red-properties. xml (need trailing slash) ii) the port on which Moodle is trying to connect to copy the file. this is 443 by default, but if Red5 and Moodle are on the same server then Apache is probably hogging port 443. So try 5080. Either way check that the port is actually matched on the Red5 side. To do that go into red5/conf/red5.properties. The HTTP port is the one that needs to match. (RTMP is probably ok with 1935. RTMPT is also interesting but it won't cause the problems you are describing. It is the port to use tunnel RTMP connections through a firewall.) Also don't auto convert files to mp4 or mp3 while testing. Conversion is another place where things can go wrong. When you get to that stage, use FFMPEG to do the conversion in Moodle. I have another document on setting all that up somewhere.",

So I think that most likely the cause of the problem is in the recording/ upload . Are you using PoodLL Anywhere on the Editor Toolbar (Atto or TinyMCE)? Or are you using the PoodLL Repository? Or are you doing something else? If you are using PoodLL to record/upload, does it state the file was uploaded successfully? Finally does doing a much shorter/smaller recording, of say 5 seconds, work?",

I am pretty sure you have not set up that, so I think we can ignore that avenue. Let me know if I am wrong though. So the files Moodle is attempting to play will be .mov files. Flowplayer should play those back fine. As of course, should the iPad. But I have seen it go wrong. I would really need to see the uploaded file to check. So here are two things to try. i) turn off the PoodLL filter, and try to reload the page and play the video. Does it work? If so, PoodLL is messing up the playback somehow. If it still doesn't play .. lets do ii) ii) Turn the poodll filter back on. And turn on \"show download link\" beside players  in the PoodLL filter settings. Then there should be a download link by the player when the page is loaded. Download the file to your desktop. Can you play it there? If not, can you post it to me here, or by email, so I can look at it?",

Can you try the same thing into the \"forum(with video)\" activity on http://demo.poodll.com ? (login creds are on the front page ) If it works there, it is a server specific thingy we need to figure out. There might be an error in your logs. If you can find the error log that apache generates, check it and see if there are any recent errors that look related. It can be necessary to turn off or configure a thing called Suhosin. And your server's maximum file upload size could also be a part of the problem. If we are at this point and there is no good error in your server logs, it gets quite complicated unfortunately. If it doesn't work on demo.poodll.com I think that maybe PoodLL has in issue with receiving uploads from your ipad. One thing that I have seen occur, is when people select \"choose existing video\" from the popup dialog, rather than \"take a video.\" The uploaded file is compressed and this can cause problems with the browser/server interaction. The best reply right now to this is to recommend people select \"take a video.\"",

My understanding is that the camera has a definite orientation (Home button should be either down for portrait orientation or on right for landscape), but will flip the preview of the video or photo if held upside down. This flipping will continue if viewing the photo or video on an Apple device. When viewed on other systems - that don't read or understand the encoded \"flip this image\" instructions, the image is displayed as it was recorded - upside down. This became more of a problem when Apple enabled the volume buttons to act as the shutter release. This made it more natural to hold the phone with the shutter release (volume) on top - like a camera. Which is really upside-down. David",

I see the filetype is .mov so it was likely an upload from an iphone or ipad. PoodLL can auto convert those to mp3 if set up to do so. But if its not set up to do so, you will need to have some filter enabled that can handle .mov files. I suspect that is the problem here. Whatever filter is active for that file extension can't display the player. Check the filters that are active , probably either or both of Multimedia Plugins and PoodLL filters. Make sure the active one is handling .mov, and deactivate .mov handling for any other filters.",

Using a voice recording app said that the generated mp3 uploaded successfully, but Flowplayer won't play it. General questions: When using the HTML5 recording for audio, the Red5 server isn't needed, correct? It's up to the device to provide a file of type audio, and if FFMPEG conversion is installed/configured, that's what translates an ogg or wav to mp3? Is audio likely to be problematic for iPads in the way Eric was experiencing in the other thread? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hi Hilary. Yes, you are pretty much correct. Red5 is not used when recording with iPads and other mobile devices. The device usually has a \"record now or choose an existing file\" type of file upload dialog. That is out of our control. In the case of iOS there is no \"record audio\" option on that dialog. Just record video. And yes, that means it is hard to predict the file type that will be arriving, though in the case of iOS it is .mov. FFMPEG does the conversion if it is installed and configured. Most PoodLL/Moodles don't have it installed I suspect. Is Audio likely to be problematic, as in Eric's experience. All I can say is \"maybe.\"  As I said in that thread, I now feel that the file upload approach, at least in the way that I have implemented it, is too fragile. The possibility of a student having a device I have not tested on, or sending up a file that doesn't convert, or that doesn't make it through the upload , is quite real. I hope to re work things in the very near future, but for now I think we should assume that recording with mobile devices needs to be handled carefully.",

I do have it installed on my server and it works from the command line. For example, I can transform an ogg file to mp3. However, when I submit the same file via a quiz, it shows conversion (\"Saved: upfile_146395184.mp3\"), but the result won't play in flowplayer. When I dig into the actual file location from the hash table, it's still the ogg file (original size, & if I download & add .ogg it plays, .mp3 won't). The phone voice recorder app creates .amr files; same thing, I can translate with ffmpeg, but what PoodLL names .mp3 and stores seems to still be the amr file. I know this is labeled experimental, but is there something simple I could be missing, like file permissions? It's strange that the conversion does actually work on the one hand, and PoodLL seems to think it has successfully performed it on the other, but the result is not saved. thanks!",

          "Text": "Well. That is interesting. If the mov files convert to mp3 correctly. We would expect that the ogg and amr files should also. The conversion process is the same throughout PoodLL. So it is possible to do the testing for this outside the quiz. If you turn on \"show download link beside players\" in the PoodLL filter settings, a little download arrow will show beside the player. Even if you don't download, rolling your mouse over it should show you the url in your browser status bar. So you will see if it has in fact been converted by noting the file extension. PoodLL will first try to use the FFMPEG that it finds in the [Moodle]/filter/poodll directory. If it doesn't find one there, it will assume there is one available on the path and just bravely call \"ffmpeg -i blahblah.flv blahblah.mp3\" . So it is possible that the ffmpeg you are testing with and the one that PoodLL is using are not the same. It is also possible to set some parameters to the call to ffmpeg. The default is not to, but if you have some set and it might be that they work for mov but muff it for other filetypes. I have attached a document that I use to help people get up to speed with PoodLL and FFMPEG. See if anything in there helps. Also try it out on demo.poodll.com. If it works there, but not on your site, we might be able to see why. Justin",

The link ends in mp3. Downloading the ogg>mp3 file results in a playable file. However, it is smaller (187KB) than the mp3 generated from the same file at the command line (196KB)--which is exactly the same size as the original ogg file. And actually I think it is still an ogg file... if I change the file extension it still plays in Windows Media, because I have the codec for ogg installed. Ahh, I uploaded it to TrID and that says it's indeed an .ogg. I'm attaching it, in case that helps. Downloading the supposed amr>mp3 file won't play as an mp3, but will if I change the file extension. TrID confirms it's still an amr. Also attached. .mov successfully converts to a genuine mp3, and plays in flowplayer. I tried to add \"-report\" in the mp3 options to get a log file on my server but can't get it working... On my server, ffmpeg is in /usr/share/, not in the PoodLL directory. But I installed it when installing PoodLL, so there's only one version to be called. It must be working in a similar fashion to the demo system, since on both .ogg and .amr don't work, but .mov does? If you get this/look at this before 9am, I'm users 06, 16, and 26 with submissions to the first audio assignment ( http://demo.poodll.com/mod/assign/view.php?action=grading&id=87 ). Thanks, Justin!",

Until friday, all was working well : deposit of files via PoodLL recording worked well. Now, when trying to deposit a file using PoodLL recording, we only have the 'Next' button, the recording tool does not appear on the screen  (and this for audio, audiodirect and video).  We checked all the options and nothing seems to have changed. We did not make any Moodle or plugin upgrade or installation since two weeks so we do'nt know what is wrong now. I make a screen capture in annex. Any help or idea is welcome. Thanks.",

Deleting the file makes the production site to work again.  So the file does not seem to be the direct problem.  When copying the English file to the fr directory, it works too.

You're using Moodle 2.8, and it allows an automatic update of the language packs. That certainly explains why you have new files. It's also the case if you've manually updated your language packs. Moreover, i've made (small) improvments on the PoodLL filter french translation yesterday. What i don't really understand is why you have such a problem, depending on the file there is in place... have you cleaned caches?

My current plan is to redo the PoodLL players to use a completely different filter I have developed, that makes customizing them much easier. This is the video easy filter. But I will probably create a specific audio player version. If the language strings for the Once Player were customizable, would that be sufficient for now?",

I don't want you to pursue this issue with Poodll if it is your intention to make the media players obsolete.  I'd rather see you work on videoeasy and make it the best darn media filter available.  ;) In the meantime, I have hacked together a solution for videos using jQuery that manipulates the HTML video object - it basically auto-plays the video, hides the controls and disables right-click functionality.  This still doesn't address page refreshes, but I believe the only way to track that is to have the user's current playhead location saved to the database somehow every few seconds.  (I have implemented this kind of functionality on another non-Moodle site in the past and it works nicely... but I digress.)  The solution may lie in the ability to add custom JavaScript to your new 'templates'. For the audio-only playonce scenarios I am using Mat Bury's old .swf file and manually crafting the <object> tags in the content.  Not elegant, but it's working and no text strings to deal with...",

For the once player I was planning on just implementing some custom controls for the HTML5 player. I would make a \"onceaudio\" VideoEasy template, and then that could be set as the player that handled MP3 in the context of that activity. It might even be more appropriate to make the template using the \"Generico Filter\" because then we wouldn't have to worry about owning the mp3 file extension. Hmmm, actually if you could share the code for the once player for video , I could at least make that one up in Generico. It would be a good starting point for the onceaudio player. What do you think?",

How did you manage the wide variety of Android installs in Japan with regards to using the voice recording feature?

Did you have every student install a specific voice recording app?  How did you manage those recordings.

In general I just rely on the browsers file upload screen and the associated media recorders. I think its a challenge and more so now than before. It is cat and mouse trying to keep up with the devices. And you simply don't have one of each to test with. So I have decided that I need to have an app, and have one in the works.

Recording audio on the ipad from the browser, ie without an app, is still a bit of an issue.  PoodLL could be doing a bit more, but Apple could be doing a whole lot more. That said, I think the difference between your school's site, and mine is that the video is converted to audio on the PoodLL server .  I think the Online PoodLL assignment submission type will pretend its an audio file and show it in a player. But elsewhere that won't be the case. In the latest and greatest, always undocumented, version of PoodLL it can do the conversions as an \"ad-hoc task\", ie in the background. Thats a lot more reliable since timeouts don't happen. But the real trick in getting file conversion working is to configure FFMPEG on the server. Without that we can't do it, I have a document on how to do that somewhere ....[rummaging sound] ....ok I attached it here.

Put the cursor between the image and the video link. 4. Press Enter to add a line break. 5. Save and view. Result: 2 players will appear.

It could be a bug, but the appearance of two players is usually caused by \"double filtering.\" (I made that phrase up, but I get to use it a lot, so its ok.) Here is how I described it previously. \n```text\nThe appearance of two players is caused by \n\"double\n filtering.\" The link to the media file, is parsed by both the multimedia plugins filter and the PoodLL filter, so both try to turn it into a player.\n\n\nIn most, but not all, cases moving the PoodLL filter higher in the list of filters than the Multi media plugins filter solves the problem. When it doesn't, usually because the media file is being used in a \"label,\" disabling the file extension (mp3, or mp4 or whatever) on the multi media plugins filter (site admin->appearance->media embedding)  will fix it. For PoodLL you can disable the file extension at site admin -> plugins -> poodll filter settings. \n\n\nYou could also turn either filter completely off which would solve it. But there are reasons to keep the multi media plugins filter. As an example,  because it will turn links to YouTube videos into Youtube players\n.\n```\n That you mention it occurs in labels, is a pretty good sign that we have double filtering going on. Try turning off the file extension in question (.flv) in the Multi media plugins filter, and see if that fixes it. If not, report back and I will dig into it some.",

In a circuit drawing application (or a parts drawing application that a mechanical engineer might be interested in), that does not make any sense. The student is expected to start drawing from a blank slate, and it is interconnectivity of the parts, rather than the precise placement geometrically that matters. What would be the right forum for this? And if one does not exist, what would be the level of coding prowess needed for me to start writing a module (not that I have any time to spare, but still it would be helpful to know)?",

Do you have an internet connection on the machine in question? Did you change the settings for the Red5 server, right at the top in the PoodLL filter settings? If you did not touch them, then don't change them now, it will only confuse matters. If you did, then put them back how they were and see if that makes a difference. Sometimes our Red5 server gets a bit busy. I just checked now and it was ok though. Perhaps try again. If it really doesn't work. Post back here, and I am sure we can get it going. Justin",

If your network has a strict firewall it could be blocking access to Red5. - Does using a different machine (ie not your Apple airbook) or a different browser work? One possibility is that you have some security software, a personal firewall of some sort, that is blocking access to tokyo.poodll.com or one of the ports it uses.

          "Text": "Hi Csasa Well there might be more than one issue here. It won't be the max size though. The first issue is that you have two audio players showing up, for one file. In this case only one player will work, if at all [shameless copy and paste from another post follows] \n```text\nThe appearance of two players is caused by \"double filtering.\" The link to the media file, is parsed by both the multimedia plugins filter and the PoodLL filter, so both try to turn it into a player.\n\n\nIn most, but not all, cases moving the PoodLL filter higher in the list of filters than the Multi media plugins filter solves the problem. When it doesn't, usually because the media file is being used in a \"label,\" disabling the file extension (mp3, or mp4 or whatever) on the multi media plugins filter (site admin->appearance->media embedding)  will fix it. For PoodLL you can disable the file extension at site admin -> plugins -> poodll filter settings. \n\n\nYou could also turn either filter completely off which would solve it. But there are reasons to keep the multi media plugins filter. As an example,  because it will turn links to YouTube videos into Youtube players\n.\n```\n You can record audio using the MP3 recorder in PoodLL, or via the older \"audio recorder\"/red5 recorder. The former transcodes to mp3 in the browser and uploads it. The latter records on the Red5 server , and Moodle copies it directly from there to itself. Depending on which method you are using the problem could have a different cause. If you use the MP3 recorder, it doesn't work well with long recordings. Too few resources available in browser. 2-3 mins is the max. 50 seconds seems a bit short to cause a problem, but it might yet be the culprit. If you use the red5 recorder, it could be a case of the server being overloaded. It happens. The Red5 server is set up to auto transcode to mp3 if the mp3 box is checked on the audio/red5 recorder (and you haven't configured FFMPEG on moodle). That can time out on long recordings. For the most part those are the primary causes of failure. There are other things to look at. A sneaky one that could possibly be the culprit here, is Suhosin being activated on the Moodle server. That sets a max size for file uploads from browser (ie from the mp3 recorder) and they get stopped when they hit the limit. I have had it once or twice, but its not that common. I hope all that helps.",

I'm sure it's not because of the two player as I just activated it after having tested the recordings in every possible way to see if it may be solve the problem playing the recordings with the Poodll filter. But originally only the multimedia filter was activated. 2. As until now we only tried it with the mp3 recorder, now I have tried it with the red5 recorder: it's working also with bigger recordings, so this may be the solution. Although I still not understand how the mp3 recorder can be working on other sites then but not on this site. 3.

What happens if you temporarily disable all filters, and leave only the PoodLL filter enabled? If not, does having only the multi media plugins filter enabled work? If you get it working that way, then re enable the other filters one by one and see where the problem is coming from. If it is just mobile devices, I suppose it is possible that the PoodLL filter is not recognizing your devices as mobile. But in that case the multi media plugins filter will probably work.",

They see preface screen to the test, showing them test-taking info and links, advisories about the test, etc. 4. They start the fifteen minute timed quiz. The video tapes them automatically and they see the recorder (themselves) on screen. A proctor will review it, to compare it to \"face on file\", and to prevent cheating in several ways (looking at notes, asking someone for answers, etc). 3.

          "Text": "Rodney I spent a little time on it yesterday. It is a little more complex than just the iframe sizes etc. The JS code for the calculator is exported from the same source that creates the flash version. It uses a framework called OpenLaszlo.  In the exported code we seem to be getting the sizing issue. I did not write the original calculator, but I did have to get deep into it when creating the three sizes (normal, small and tiny). To be honest it would require getting into the code and recompiling it. Knowing OpenLaszlo, I think that could be a bit of a time sink, and I certainly wouldn't recommend you going that route. A better investment of time would be to get an all JS calculator and replace the original PoodLL calculator with that. A quick google, came up with this: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/javascript-css3-calculator If that works for you, or you find something you like better, let me know and I will try and put it in.",

Currently, mobile devices upload video to the system which is completely unnescessary for us. What I'm hoping for is a demux ability in poodll that I haven't seen before.

There is the ability to specify encoding options for ffmpeg, there on the PoodLL filter settings page, but it does assume the end format will be mp3. In my own experience the conversion to mp3 is not a significant drag on the server, but it depends on how many conversions you have going on simultaneously.

So it is done. Not all the options for each type are listed, but the main ones are. The URL is here: http://www.cheatography.com/justinhunt/cheat-sheets/poodll-filter/ The PDF download is attached to this forum post, but in the future you should get the latest from the url above. For those who don't know what this is all about, Poodll has a whole bunch of widgets that can be inserted into Moodle. eg a stopwatch. You do that by inserting a crafty little string that looks like this: {POODLL:type=stopwatch} which turns into stopwatch when you view the activity. The cheat sheet contains information about those crafty filter strings. You can play around, and see them, over at http://demo.poodll.com **NB DON'T COPY AND PASTE THE FILTER STRINGS** The encoding of the text on the PDF and cheatsheet website is wrong. Even without that, invisible html characters often sneak in and break things. Just type the strings out longhand. Enjoy *edited 19/06/2014 added warning about copy/paste and file encoding*",

On my mac (OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion), the Safari 6.1.3 web browser doesn't show the background graph, but otherwise it works.  Instead of the background graph, all I see is a small box with \"?\" in it. Firefox 30.0 doesn't show the tools at the bottom, or the background graph. On Ubuntu Linux, firefox 29.0 S does the same thing as Safari did.  (Background graph missing, but tools work.) On a PC running Windows 7, Firefox V28, doesn't show any tools.  Goodle Chrome is the same.  Can't use. So all-in-all, two of the five browsers I tried worked with Poodll whiteboard.   And then, it was missing the background graph paper. Sigh...  I know the feeling of having to deal with the idiosyncrasies of web browsers.  Not fun. Please don't give up!  I want to use it. Peter",

          "Text": "Sudeep Sorry for the slow reply. What browser are you using? And which recorder are you using? How long are your recordings? There are many things that can go wrong with recording. Most of them are at the browser end of things. Did you try rebooting and using a different browser? Google Chrome has a permissions dialog that is very hard to see. It pops up when you first try to use your webcam/mike on a site. It appears just beneath the address bar in the browser. Almost everyone misses it, even I forget about it. And of course there is the standard flash permissions dialog. If permission is not granted to the camera/mic then the recording will usually fail in the way you describe. Also if Skype or another application is trying to use the webcamera, it can be unavailable for the browser. Sometimes it happens that the other app doesn't release it. Even when the other app is closed down the camera is unavailable. I wonder in these cases if there is a problem with the driver software. I sometimes get this on my mac. Anyway, rebooting and trying a different browser are good steps to take. Finally depending on the recorder you are using, try not selecting \"mp3\" or \"mp4\" on the recorder. Sometimes the conversion process is failing because the server is too busy, or the recording too long, to respond before the browser gives up waiting. Justin",

The connection to tokyo is correct, it have green check mark. But the error is the some: \"an error occurred and your file has not been uploaded\". But not knowing what that error, we can not fix.

Your first link you have listed above downloads directly from Justin's site and if you get the Kaboodle, it will include all you need to get going.The second link is also ok, just have to download the different parts, one at a time. The main add-on of the bunch that all the other parts depend on is the filter. Their installation depends on the filter being installed, too. If your site folder permissions are set right and your site is registered with Moodle, an admin can actually do all the installs right in Moodle 2.5.x, by going to Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Install add-ons then click on Install add-ons from the Moodle plugins directory.

Most people probably don't use the 2.2 assignment type anymore or the database activity field(though you can do fun stuff with it) . So if you install piecemeal from Moodle.org, you might leave those off. The one mod you must have is the PoodLL filter. Everything else uses stuff from there. Stuff generally goes up on poodll.com earlier than on Moodle.org. But at the moment everything is up to date everywhere. Just to confuse things, there is a new mod, PoodLL Anywhere. It adds recording icons to the TinyMCE editor. If you use that you probably don't need the PoodLL repository anymore either. PoodLL Anywhere can be downloaded from the page you referenced, but it is not in the Kaboodle bundle or available from Moodle.org yet. Hmm, lets summarize this a bit PoodLL Add-on On PoodLL.com In Kaboodle On Moodle.org Notes PoodLL Filter Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Question Type Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Repository Yes Yes Yes PoodLL Assignment Submission Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Feedback Yes Yes Yes for new Moodle assignment (avail. from Moodle 2.3) PoodLL Assignment Type Yes Yes Yes for old Moodle assignment PoodLL Anywhere Yes No No adds PoodLL icons to TinyMCE HTML area PoodLL Database Activity Field Yes Yes Yes",

Noticed there as no overwrite messages as suggested in the Poodll docs  but Moodle upgraded my database and declared the whole thing a success, Added an assignment and sure enough there is a Poodl voice recorder and whiteboard option and I ticked the mp3 submission. The assignment does not show the recorder widget though- what have I missed? The assignment does not have any sort of recording feature available. I checked the docs and it mentioned configuring Modules->Filters->Manage Filters under site admin. I can't locate this. Is it my version or just me lost in the menus?",

There are two main possibilities for this situation that are really just about learning how to use the Moodel assignment. ( I am assuming this is the new Moodle assignment (new as of Moodle 2.3). If you didn't know that there was an older version of the Moodle assignment, then you are probably ok. Since it should default to the new one.) i) did you configure PoodLL recording for the assignment submission? Or the assignment feedback? The assignment submission is what the student will do. The assignment feedback is how you respond to them. ii) Are you testing this by logging in as a student? By default a non student can't actually even do the assignment. So you have to be a student, then you will see a button saying \"add submission\" and it all starts from there. Justin",

You can tell them what to do. If they record audio regularly the nervousness and pressure fade away, but the first few times it helps to take it slowly. So I might ask them to practice their speech/introduction a few times with different partners before they record. Also if you make the thing that they record basically a no brainer, eg say some tongue twisters, sing a nursery rhyme, or read a dialog from the book. That lowers the bar too. You will possibly run into technical quicksands the first time you do it. eg The browsers are too old, or half the microphones are broken . So it pays to do the activity yourself on the student machines first, so you know what will happen for them. Not doing this still catches me out sometimes. And making the first activity obviously not important ( some tongue twisters etc) means you won't get students too frustrated if things don't go right.",

I have not heard of that specific problem, but there are a few things you might check. Does it work from a different browser? And if you are using Chrome, did you see the little popup permissions dialog that Chrome requires for webcam access?  If you didn't see it, and it is very easy to miss, that might be the problem. It shows just below the address bar of your browser. Also is the little connection lamp on the lower left of the recorder green? If not you won't be able to record until a connection to the recording server is made. Do other PoodLL feedback types work, eg mp3 recording or whiteboard? I made a lot of changes \"under the hood\" recently. So it is possible I missed something in the PoodLL Feedback mod, so please let me know how you get on.",

The second error is occurring because there is no file to display. I think that is caused because your camera is not being picked up and the recorder is recording, but recording nothing. That still doesn't explain why only \"feedback\" is giving the problem. Before you commence recording, try checking both the device settings on the recorders settings tab, and the webcam settings on the flash properties page (right click the recorder). Can you select the webcam on either of those locations and cause the webcam light to light up? Justin",

Sorry about that. I have auto-update turned on in Moodle, I powered off&on my Laptop.  Not sure what else changed. But in any event, it's working just fine now. I can say it woks in the current version of Moodle, PooDLL, Windows 8,1 Chrome, and IE 11. So whatever the problem was, the answer is to update. ====================================== Again, thanks!  At some point, I'll configure FFMPEG and test further.  I'd like to take some of the workload off of your server. Thanks again for all you do!",

We have two Moodles, the only difference in set-up being that one is designed to be external to our Intranet and allows users to manually register for an account. We have a number of non-traditional courses whose staff and students might not be formally registered at the College. The other is internal and students get bulk loaded. You can create a repository no problem in the \"external\" version but when you try in the \"internal\" one it appears to loop, and no repository is shown in the list. I cannot see a reason for why it should work in one and not the other. Has anyone come across this issue before? Or has anyone got any other plugin suggestions for audio feedback I could investigate instead? Thanks.",

When I attempt to give audio feedback on assignments, there is an Adobe popup onscreen that wants me to set the settings. Itsw hard to describe, but it happens with some websites too that play video. It wants me to set global settings. If I do set them, it doesn't keep the settings the next time. I have to do it every time. But when I set them, then I can use the record button in Poodl.

You should be able to tell Adobe to remember your permission settings on that PC. To do that, right click the PoodLL audio recorder (or any flash recorder loaded from that website) and choose \"settings.\" Choose to allow access to the camera and microphone and check the checkbox to remember those settings. I attached a screenshot to this post Sadly Chrome now has its own set of permission requirements for camera/mic. So on Google Chrome, after you set the Adobe Flash permissions, you will see a grey horizontal dialog appear beneath the address bar/url input field. You need to also allow access from there.
