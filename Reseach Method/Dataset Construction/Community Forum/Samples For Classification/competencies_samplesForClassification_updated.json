          "Text": "Hi everyone! I'm supporting a school that already uses CBL in their transition to Moodle from fully offline. Besides academic competencies, students are expected to self-evaluate and then work on a couple of soft skills per semester, in alignment with the school's graduate profile. I have enabled the capabilities competency:planviewowndraft and competency:planmanageowndraft for the authenticated user role, which worked fine. However, it quickly became overwhelming since students could see all the academic frameworks. I would like to find a way to restrict students from adding academic competencies to their individual plan. I have tried the following: Setting the soft skills framework to a category and creating a new role, at the category level, with the above capabilities. This didn't work (I suspect because learning plans exist at the user level) Doing the opposite, with the academic frameworks in a category, and setting competency:competencyview to prevent. The list looks clean but students are not allowed to view their rating, proficiency, etc. If there is no other option, I'll use tours to guide them, but I'd really appreciate any ideas you might have! Thank you, Inês",

It would be great as well to have some kind of notification for a student that the deadline is approaching (as for now I did not find a settings about learning plans notification. There are notifications about courses, activities , etc. but the student can miss/not enroll to the course at all). Unfortunately for me, one of the available plugins which is very popular and recommended ( Monitoring of Learning Plans - report_lpmonitoring ) is not supported in Moodle 4.0 (I tried to install it and I had some issues, similarly to other persons on higher Moodle versions than 3.8 or so. I don't feel comfortable with mentioned solutions like removing some of the tables in the database and reconfiguring some moodle/competencies settings again as I wouldn't like to loose some already collected data as probably some data disappear after removal). It looks that I must base on the official features (or any other plugins, but I'm not aware about them). May I count on any hints from more experienced users?",

          "Text": "Dear Moodle community, I am quite new to Moodle, so I hope you can help me clarify a few thing. To give you an idea, what I am working on: We are trying to build an online learning tool for handball referees. Our idea is to have separate learning plans (LP)  for different leagues: referee - elite level referee - adults referee - juniors On the next level, we plan to have competencies (C) for different aspects of being a referee: understanding of handball - elite level leadership - elite level organisation and rules - elite level understanding of handball - adults leadership - adults organisation and rules - adults ... and so on ... And on the bottom level, we would like to have multiple courses, e.g. - understanding of handball - elite level group tactics - elite level offense - elite level defense - elite level ... and so on ... Our idea is that after completing the 3 courses (group tactics, offense, defense), the referee is awarded the competency of \"understanding handball - elite level\". And after gaining all the elite level competencies, the elite level learning plan is fulfilled and the referee can lead games on that level. However, we don't manage to get it work like this. As soon as one course is completed, the competency is awarded. I found these two forum threads: 1) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=392070 2) https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365575 Here, it sounds like this is not possible (\"each lesson may have 15-20 competencies\"). On the other hand, the Moodle FAQ says \"Can a competency be added to more than one course or activity? Definitely - and your organisation might well need to do this, if certain competencies need to be met in a series of courses or several activities within one course. \" This sounds like what we imagined. Now the question is: Is this possible? If so, which settings do we have to set to accomplish this? Or do we need to add (child) competencies for each course and parent competencies for our planned competencies (understanding of handball, leadership, etc.)? Many thanks for your help already in advance. I hope I have explained everything in sufficient detail that you can imagine what we are trying to do.",

Is it OK to use the competency framework without using a learning plan? For example, I can add competencies to a course. Then link those competencies in a quiz, or graded assignment, is this a common approach? From student's perspective, when they go to the \"Competencies\" section, then they should see what competencies they are proficient in. I have not fully tested this out, but it seems to be possible. 2. Or should I be creating individual learning plans for each student to be graded for each competency I understand we can use cohort sync to assign learning plans for the entire cohort. However, it seems that that grading has to be requested from the student. Is there a way that teachers can review the competency at a certain time and manually input the grading scale for the students without getting students to request? 3. Is it possible to manually grade students for competencies? Understand that a better way is to use assignments or activities to track completion status. However, we are just starting to use Moodle, so many of our assignments, quizzes etc are not in the moodle system yet (could be paper form, or in other electronic form), so it will take some time to import all assignments into Moodle. Before we get to the state where everything is handled in moodle, is there a way to manually and easily assign the competency grade to the students? Thanks, David",

The object being viewed is the Student's Learning Plan. 2. Normally, you create a Learning Plan Template and then add in all of the competencies for that learning plan. Each student may have a unique learning plan template or you could create learning plan templates that are common goals that all students in that area of study must achieve. 2a. Cohort Sync to learning plans will automatically link student's that are members of a cohort to a specific learning plan. Cohorts are mainly used to automate course enrollments. 2b. When a competency is related to a course activity the administrator can choose to either automatically award the competency to the student or have the activity manually rated by a teacher. The student will not be awarded the competency until the teacher rates it. I would only recommend manual rating for Essay or complex assignments. 3. Competencies are not grades. Competencies are an alternate method of tracking achievement. Please note the core Moodle structure does not have standard reports on Learning plans and student competencies. The UI for working with competencies and learning plans frameworks are very unforgiving. There are many past post in the forum that you could poke around and look at to provide you with a sense of the challenges if you decide to use competencies and learning plans.",

For some institutions, this is all that what they currently need and may not yet be focused on or desirous of implementing the Learning Plans: they are focused on the course design phase. Also, I have seen a definite benefit in cases where an organization may not have experience with competency based learning models: they can use the frameworks to understand how those work. It is very valuable as the first step if you are not used to working in a competency based model. You can always progress later to add Learning Plans: but if you don't have the right set up for your frameworks to start with, and sufficiently well designed courses that align to the standards, it will probably be a less effective (and more confusing) if you rush into it.",

          "Text": "As far as my understanding goes: At the moment you can use competencies in Moodle as a teacher by doing a lot by hand. But I would like most of this work to be automated. So here is what I am looking for. According to local requirements, we have to rate competencies at four levels - which is not a problem to set up. However, in our courses we use a lot of automatically graded activities (or even assignments). But at the moment I don't see any way how I can automatically assign a student a high level of competency who has done very well in one of these activities, and a low level of competency to a student who has done less well. Doing that by hand is not only tedious (you don't see the points of an assignment or quiz in the competency overview, but also prone to error. And I don't really see the point of copying/replicating digitally available information by hand within the same system. The second problem I have: Some acitivities (rich in pedagogical content) are linked to several competencies, but as far as I see I can't award one of several competencies automatically whereas another one is just used as reverance. All these problems are in stark contrast to the fine grained possibilities when restricting activities depending on prior achievements Moodle already provides. That's why I want to ask whether there ary any plans to make the whole compentency framework more flexible? That would certainly save teachers a lot of time and frustration with teadious paper work. In case my conception of the possibilities and limitations of competencies are wrong, I'm more than happy to stand corrected.",

Still trying to understand if this is possible in Moodle, basically, in my head i'd create a Learning Plan for each Job Role, then many different courses that grant Competencies. My question would be, once i have the users enrolled to the courses that they need to complete, (this should be done by Learning plans, correct?), how do i view their progress towards completion of either the learning plan or the competency framework? Is there a bird's eye view of all the competencies by that user, that HR can go and see? And inversely, is there a bird's eye view of all the users that have succeeded in that Learning Plan? Bonus points for seeing all users that have that learning plan associated, but something missing to complete it Sorry if these questions are basic, i feel lost in the documentation and moodle isn't helping - i've reinstalled several times for problems due to competencies.

These are designed to be viewed by the student/Employee - it may be possible to allow manager/instructors to see this view but this takes changes to roles/permissions. Moodle core has no manager, instructor view - I use the plugin I mentioned above to achieve this. Courses - a. Courses contain content and/or activities that students (employees) must complete. You can set passing conditions such as a grade. b.Moodle has standardized core reports for course activity completion and course completion. c. All students who are enrolled in the course - current status and date they achieved the completion status. d. Students who successfully complete a course can achieve the competency which can be rated (automatic or manually). You should research some of the posting in this forum to see the issues that have come up - You should research the available Moodle documentation for competencies, learning plans, scales Maybe start here - https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Competencies",

Different types at same level Moreover, the official program are organized with Competencies AND Associated Knowledge at the same level.

This could be very useful to create groups and further activities for students based on the individual needs found out by a competency assessment? Is anyone aware of any workarounds or plugins, as I don't think it is easily achievable with core. Potentially a personality assessment?

          "Text": "Hi Tennille, Competency Based Training as you explained needs to be made more task related and specific. Competency :-Basic Oven is insufficient as it would not allow the proper assessment. A simple approach can be to divide the task into three i.e. the pre activities , the activity and the post activity. What are the skills required for the task that relates  to the oven? Identify these in order. An oven is useful for baking or broiling:- Possible Pre-task:- Appropriate preparation of the oven:- 1. check the oven shelves (this determines quality) 2. presetting of the temperature gauge. 3. appropriate setting of the temperature gauge. (The difference between 2 and 3 is that it can be set but it was too high or too low.) Task:- 4. Proper placing of the chicken in the oven (for proper circulation of heat) 5. Sufficient baking time 6. Checking of product during baking. Post task:- 7 Turning oven off 8. Placing product in an appropriate place Check online, help can be found there. \"Type competencies training  for bakers\". I hope that you would be able to set up your plan. Best of luck Jemima",

          "Text": "Competency Frameworks do not have to mirror your Learning Plans Template (Framework). Competencies from any framework can be added to a Learning Plan Template. You could have one large framework or hundreds. Note: once you setup a framework you cannot move the competency to another framework. Consider how your administrators will use these objects before you setup your framework(s). If you have one large framework, you can relocate a competency within the single framework. IMHO - I would create Food Safety as the top, Parent. I would create under Food, Chicken, Frosting, Chef, Baker. Under Chicken - deboning, Marinating. Before you can build your competencies frameworks, you have to consider scales. Scales cannot be changes once a student (employee) has been awarded the competency. We are using the Monitoring of Learning Plans plugin, which is more visual than the core design. Consider how you will use the competencies and learning plans. For Food Safety each employee will probably have to requalify annually or bi-annually. The competency objects have no end date, they never expire. Learning plans assigned to employees have no end-dates, they never expire. Deleting them removes the training history that you will need to retain for FDA. Kind Regards",

In lots of industries  we can see a discussion about agile corporate mindsets and structures.  The is has massive consequences for L&D.  Typical L&D programs will run decentral and lots will be adhoc training offers and self organized trainings. The general expection for an employee is that s/he start activities and organizes learning  acitivities by self. If an employeee is interested in personal growth, getting new skills and competencies s/he should be able to identify  a learning plan and to enrole. I expect that we will have much less open central programs, much more decentral initiatives that are started  just a few weeks after identifying the need, working out loud circles und individuals that start their own journey. The role of an LMS will change in a  VUCA world. Ralf",

          "Title": "Thinking out loud:  A competency based Moodle site",
          "Text": "As a long time Moodler I started a few weeks ago thinking about use cases for competencies and learning plans in corporate or adult training program scenarios.  I would like to share and discuss my findings and ideas. Can we set up a Moodle site that is fully /mainly based on competency based learning/courses and how would it look like.? I'm not completely happy with my results, but it will be possible that I've overseen some options. But lets start at the beginning. We can create site wide or category related competency frameworks. A competency framework bundles several competencies and brings them into a hierachical order. Competency rules allows to defines rules that a user gets a top level competency if one or many other comptencies are met. Acitivity or course completion can be connected with one or many competencies. Its possible to connect the same competence in different courses. A participant can be enrolled into a learning plan. The user sees the learning plans and progress in the dashboard . When a learning plan is created  competencies are connected to the learning plan. Participants are enrolled to the learning plan via cohorts. Is it also possible for single learners? Its possible to define different levels of competencies. I.e. basic, standard, expert. How can we use it in a typical learning environment? For each learning topic and class level a competency framework is cretaed. They are connected to typical learning plans. At school it could be Class 8 English as a second language competency framework. Each teacher has an own classroom for each class in the term. He creates learning activties and connects them with competencies. Each students is connected with a learning plan (i.e. ESL class 8) The student can see the progress in dashboard. This model will work. But there are several issues I'm not happy with.: There are competencies that are not related to one topic only. (i.e. Presentation competency is an issue in German schools in class 8/9 in most topics for this class level). If each teacher adds activities for this competency students have to do  the same/similar very often and teacher don't see the progress/successs from other topics. As long as we have class and topic related courses teachers are isolated and everyone creates individual ressources, avctivities and didactical concepts. Cooperation and collaboration of teachers at schools are not part of their mindest (mostly here in Germany). So ist a lot of effort to create courses. This stops teacher to use a LMS intensive. Let me try to discuss an alternative model. Competency frameworks and learning plans are edited on site/category level. Courses are created for competencies not for classes. Instead of typical class and topic courses we create competency related courses. Its possible that for each competency several courses are available and the students enrolls themself. There are furthermore class/topic related courses. But the intention is different than typical. They are used for communication, some collaborative activities and final exam preparation. The student sees an overview about progress in the dashboard. This model tries  to push teachers to work collaborative and to use didactical scenarios from other teachers teaching the same topic. In some cases this could be  a little bit to radical/revolutionary. If this is your reality you can use the competency based courses as template and import them  into class related courses. I didn't check whether course related competency connections are included in backups.) What is missing? What I could not realize.... How can a teacher see the individual progress for a student? How can a teacher grade, comment the students activities? How can we limit the teachers access to his own students in the competency based courses? How can we implement didactical scenarios that needs group work? I also tried to understand how we can use taxonomies. After discussion with Mary we came to the result taxonomies are only descriptions. They are not related to any function.  Is this correct? Who can see the taxonomies? What do you think?

The current UI displays, were not intended for hundreds of competencies and learning plans that a corporation/or adult training programs require. Cannot move structures - Learning plans, competency frameworks, learning plan templates. Cannot link parent competency to a learning plan, and have all children related to the learning plan. Cannot Search the learning plan templates The current UI does not include  the functionality for students that require annual retraining to \"retain\" their current competency level or to improve on their current competency level. Functionality to set a competency framework, learning plan template or learning plan to \"inactive\" to retain the history of the objects and relationships. Deleting removes the history. Completion of a students learning plans to remove make it inactive is inappropriate, but it is the only option. Need the ability to \"grandfather\" a student for a competency and enter the dates of achievement. Students in the corporate world complete training outside of the LMS - and administrators often are provided evidence long after the course was completed. The taxonomies should be been at a system configuration level vs. the individual competency framework. These are just the thoughts off the top of my head.",

'*' key expands all nodes in the tree 'shift' click will select all nodes in between two points in the tree. So you can quickly select all nodes in any branch of the tree. \n```text\n\"The taxonomies should be been at a system configuration level vs. the individual competency framework.\"\n```\n The framework defines what the taxonomy should be and changing the taxonomy for one framework should not affect other ones. \n```text\nFunctionality to set a competency framework, learning plan template or learning plan to \"inactive\" to retain the history of the objects and relationships.\n```\n This does exist already - when a new version of a framework is created, the old one can be set to not \"visible\" which retains and will show the history of objects and relationships, but will prevent the competencies in the \"old framework\" from being selectable\nwhen adding competencies to a course / learning plans etc. There is then also the Migrate Frameworks tool to update all the competencies in courses from the old framework to the new one.",

          "Text": "Thank you for your response. I was not totally clear on why the current competency to Learning Plan relationships are challenging in a corporate environment. The corporate learning world goes through business changes that obsolete, rename and reorganize data structures frequently. Selecting all of the children in the tree view quickly, is not an issue. Sequencing them by the ID vs. manually moving them one-by-one, like the course category would be the desired functionality. Setting framework to not visible (hide), did not remove the learning plan from the student's view during my initial testing. Maybe there is a cron job that needs to run, or run more often? Or the functionality does work as expected. I am not concerned an admin picking the wrong competencies, I am concerned with the students' view of their learning plan(s). The migrate frameworks is not that intuitive to use. I have looked at it several times, but moving course competencies from the old framework to a new course is not really the functionality I was looking for. I need to reorganize an existing structure, because my business reorganized a department. I need to move a framework to a new category.",

However, I cannot think of a systemic way of doing this in Moodle. You could include on the course summary page - a list of each of the competencies. Then add within the course a quiz activity with a single select one question. Each of competency is listed and the student \"declares\" which competency value is their goal upon course completion. When the course is successfully completed, the instructor can award the requested competency value. You would still need to build or the competency framework and relate them to the course. Consider how to build out your scales for the competencies before you implement. Such as; Submitted evidence for this competency, no submitted evidence, alternative evidence was submitted.

The importer shouldn't really create a new scale if one can be found using\nthe configuration column from the database.

We may have gotten around this issue by push/pulling information from the Moodle\ndatabase.

The initial logic with those two features is that by connecting them with courses you can define which course will help a particular employee build up his competency level or in general develop a competency level. And that is ok. But the thing I want to do with this is that based on the employee's competencies (organization skills, communications skills, IT knowledge...) he can see or be assigned to a particular course. So if the guy is an IT specialist when he signs into our Moodle page, he'll automatically see only courses that correspond with his roles and competencies, and of course, he can then choose if he wants to roll in. I assume this is Role connected, so can somebody suggest how to best approach this? Thank you in advance.",

These features can be put together to require someone to annually re-achieve a competency (which is a actually a new competency for every year). Expiring a competency after a time period or on a certain day has been mentioned but I don't think anyone has created a tracker issue for it (it seems like a good idea).",

I have 4 learning objects in a SCORM package and 4 corresponding competencies in Moodle. I've checked in the SCORM reporting and the notation of each SCO appears well. My problem is that I'd like the competency in Moodle to be validate according to the validation of each learning object in the SCORM package. The only way I found to validate a competency is if the user completes the SCORM or get a grade. I didn't find a way to validate the competency according to learning objects. Is there a way to do this ? Or an existing plugin ? Thank you very much for your help. Hugo",

Milestones As the ACGME began to move toward continuous accreditation, specialty groups developed outcomes-based milestones as a framework for determining resident and fellow performance within the six ACGME Core Competencies. What are Milestones? Simply defined, a milestone is a significant point in development. For accreditation purposes, the Milestones are competency-based developmental outcomes (e.g., knowledge, skills, attitudes, and performance) that can be demonstrated progressively by residents and fellows from the beginning of their education through graduation to the unsupervised practice of their specialties. Who developed the Milestones ? Each specialty’s Milestone Working Group was co-convened by the ACGME and relevant American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) specialty board(s), and was composed of ABMS specialty board representatives, program director association members, specialty college members, ACGME Review Committee members, residents, fellows, and others.",

With the current set up of reviewing and rating competencies, this can not be done: 1 rating per competency. This probably has to do with the nature of CBL/CBE and the preferred 'competent/not yet competent' scale for this.

This competency is part of a framework, and uses a scale of 6 elements: from ignorant to master. After the lesson, there are several quiz-questions, to check if learners have understood. If they answer all (4) questions correctly, then the maximum they will be able to reach is the second level of the scale (out of 6). What have I done? In the lesson, the grade is set to 'scale' (with maximum grade of 6) Grade to pass = 2.0 One competency was assigned to 'course competencies' Each correct answer yields 0.5 points of the grade What happens? When the learner answers all 4 questions correctly, he reaches the maximum of the scale (6), not the second (2). Can someone help me achieve the objective that I had set? Thanks !!",

          "Text": "Greetings all, I am not sure where I should post this, so starting here, let me know if it should be elsewhere. MOODLE v3.2 - Competence Frameworks, I am creating a framework at site level (we have no defined standard internationally or nationally).  I have my 5 top level competencies, and I am breaking them down into smaller chunks against which activities will be judged. What I want to know, is at what level I should be defining, or breaking down the competencies into performance criteria at the framework level  and where I I stop and then have the remainder defined within a course.   This is hard to explain. For example, if I have a top level competence, say COMMUNICATE then that is one of the top level competence elements in the framework.   Then say I am testing communication in terms of written and oral.  So I have two subcompetencies COMMUNICATE - written and COMMUNICATE- oral.  Then the written communication requires that the people use the correct systems or technology, use appropriate language, and, say, cover the right material.  Should those three sub-sub-competencies be in the framework, or in the course? Is there any kind of standard that anyone knows of? Many thanks for any thoughts, or any advice on where else this kind of topic is discussed, I know it isn't really to do with moodle, moodle is just the tool, but I figured someone here might have hit this problem before me!

          "Text": "Hi Michelle, This is more a CBE (Competency Based Education) question than a tool one, but I'll see if I can help you (as the topic has my particular interest). The key is to be as concrete as possible when elaborating the competencies in your framework, limiting each competency to one specific behaviour/skill/situation. For your example, this could mean: Communicate Oral Informal I can have a phone conversation I can ask questions about something personally relevant, such as directions to the nearest bus stop etc... Formal Written Informal I can write a post card from my vacation address I can IM with a friend I can write a status update for my social media Formal I can write a formal letter to apply for a job I can write a resumé to accompany my job application I can write an email to a potential employer to apply for a job And so on... one good source for this elaborate breakdown of competencies/skills/can-do statements is the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, aka CEFR. If this is not a foreign language thing you're after, you might want to look into descriptors for soft skills, that are bound to be out there.",

Thanks for the reply,  I have done more research and thought and discussed this at work.  I am going to add one thing.  Thanks for your post, that helped to get me started! Basically I have decided to split the framework elements Vs course measurables using elements that are non-perishable (and hence in framework which stands the test of time) Vs perishable (measurable in course that might change in the future). i.e.  Oral - informal and Oral - Formal would be part of the framework, we can assume that these will be required forever (non-perishable).  However, the medium used for oral communication (phone/video.) is perishable, the phone may cease to exist, video may become hologram (?!) .  I'd argue that the ability to ask questions is non-perishable, where as using a particular system (phone/twitter/facebook etc) are perishable.  So I'd be putting the system based performance criterion in the course, and the non-perishable in the framework. Does this sound sensible to others? Joost, should I be adding this to CBE discussion? Not sure where that is.... Thanks! Michelle",

Same goes for computer skills: tool-related stuff can be managed in in-course tasks (being able to store a document made with MS Office Word on a laptop by using the short key Ctrl-S), whereas the skill 'I can create, edit and save a text document' would be handled in a competency framework.",

In order to be able to post an issue in the Tracker, you have to vote for a number of related issues, so you can prove you're a human being. This prevents the Tracker from being spammed by bots and other things. As for the competency ID numbering, I normally work with a spreadsheet program, set the framework ID to 1000 for instance, the main categories within the framework to 1001, 1002, 1003, etc, and then use the spreadsheet to auto +1 the value for every competency in there. Automating this in the interface may seem like a useful feature, but working with a framework of over 100 competencies, it's a bit of a task keeping track of all the layers and subcompetencies. You have to keep track of the parent competencies and their ID numbers in order to be able to correctly relate them. I found working with a spreadsheet > CSV a lot faster than the interface.",

Behavior : The observable demonstration of some competency, skill, knowledge and personal attributes attributed to excellent performance. I also think that for some competencies 4 levels is inadequate and for others may be too much. I would like to suggest that the framework be more adjustable and editable. For example: Have a pull down so the user can indicate the number of taxonomy levels they require when creating a competency and also a way to edit the options available for the levels.",

I have it set at the moment so they must spend 40 minutes on the activity before a certificate will be issued (video is 41 minutes long) The training will be conducted by a lot of people (Potentially 100,000+) so this process needs to be completely automated, also they may access it at any time over the training year.\n\nThanks in advance for any help/guidance you may have",

For instance, a competency in Minnesota 4th grade Science is \" 4.2.3.2.3, Demonstrate how an electric current can produce a magnetic force. For example: Construct an electromagnet to pick up paperclips.\" That competency (Minnesota calls it a benchmark) is one competency in the group of standards, named, 'Energy can be transformed within a system or transferred to other systems or the environment.' The group that that standard is in is called \"Energy\" which is a group in the larger group, Physical Science, which is in the larger group Mn 4th Grade Science Standards. I would like to use an off line submission of an Assignment activity that includes a rubric to determine whether or not the student(s) have achieved mastery of that competency. I would likely have a comprehension quiz and another simple assignment on which students would need to earn a certain grade and complete before they attempted the Construct an electromagnet project. As the Director of Elementary Science (theoretically) for a school district that includes 45 elementary schools that each have on average 3 classes of 4th graders, I want to run a report on that competency by class, by building and for the whole district. I would also like to be able to drill down and view the artifact submitted by each student, and the completed rubric with teacher comments, in fulfillment of this competency. There are twenty other 'benchmarks' in 4th Grade Science with hierarchical groupings at each of the above levels. I will also like to run reports on aggregations of those 'scores' by all of the above. How do I set-up reports like that?

          "Text": "As always Helen - excellent clear description. May I please add that we may need both Competencies and outcomes in the gradebook. Our ministry looks very closely at the \"outcomes of our competencies\" and we need a method in the course to assess how many students achieved the competency and report that in our Ministry reports. We are now very integrated to the Moodle gradebook and in my opinion in the short time I spent in working through the competency framework - I would love to be able to attach it to the graded item and to evaluate the results through the gradebook. I know there is a work around but I would like to encourage the developers to add them to the gradebook for adding it to a graded item and the category. Thank you again, Nancy K.",

You can get it anyway from github at https://github.com/damyon/moodle-tool_lpimportcsv It needs to be installed in yourmoodle/admin/tool and once installation is completed, you will have an Import and Export link added under Competencies. Works nicely and will let you match your csv file columns to the one used by Moodle CBE frameworks, if they are not the same already.",
