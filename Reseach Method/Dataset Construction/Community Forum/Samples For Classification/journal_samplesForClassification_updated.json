          "Text": "Hi everyone, We have been using the Journal plugin for many years, and since upgrading to Moodle 4.5 we have encountered several  issues. We noticed that there are multiple open pull requests on GitHub that contain fixes which have not yet been merged. For now, we plan to apply the relevant patches ourselves in order to keep the module running during this academic year. However, given the current lack of activity and the absence of an official release supporting Moodle 4.5, we are considering discontinuing the use of this module next year unless maintenance resumes. Could you please confirm whether there are any plans to continue maintaining this plugin or if it’s being phased out? It is a shame, because this module has been very valuable and interesting to use in our courses. Thank you for your work so far. Best, susana",

Students can only see their OWN writing and do NOT have access to another students writing unless the students share the writing via some other means. e.g. Physically show them on their screen, or via copy and paste in an email message. You can set up automatic prompts that update at whatever time interval you desire. Each day is okay. Changing the required number of words each day is one of the automatic prompt options. You can also setup and use a, Gloassary of Common Errors (the actual name is optional), that is also accounted for in the auto rating suggested scoring. This makes it possible to enforce proper spelling so that the modern slang of such things as, u, instead of you, can be enforced. The autograding is actually only a suggested rating that the teacher can acept with one click of the mouse, and even if they apply the suggested rating they can always over ride it, and change the rating and feedback.",

The biggest hurdle was to make sure I found the correct entry in the mdl_grade_items table. I then had to go and regrade every journal entry. I also did that in the database as it is quicker. Everything appeared to have been changed and updated correctly. WARNING: I do not recommend that you do this on a production Moodle site, but if you MUST make sure you back up your current data first. As an alternative, I know that at one time I was changing how much an activity was counted for in a final grade book calculation. Sorry to say I do not remember how I got in there to change that. What I do remember is just how much of a pain it was to do that. It probably was along the lines of putting the faulty journal in it's own category and then set how much that category counts towards the total grade.",

If you play with Diary a little more, you will discover that you can have it work just like the journal plugin. Edit all entries > No Edit entry dates > No Enable statistics > No Enable automatic rating > No, but it is optional. Ratings > No ratings, but can be set to any of the five rating types. All the other settings are optional and truthfully, just those first 3 items are the key to making Diary work like Journal. Granted, since you can change the, \"color\" of things, it will look just a little different. 😁 And as you've discovered, it is great for other types of activities .",

          "Text": "It has been over a year since a forum entry with the same subject was started, so it is locked and cannot be commented on. I somehow missed the original question posed by Robin Latham, but in a private message yesterday, I provided her a partial solution, and it was so simple, I am mentioning it here so that others can implement it, too. She asked:  \" Could we get a toggle to be able\nto organize the journal entries by student last name rather than as it\nis now by date of entry only?\" Not a toggle, but a change to alphabetical order...In the lib.php file, look for: function journal_get_users_done($journal, $currentgroup) { It should be around line 702, depending on your version of journal. Just a few lines below that look for: $ sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY j.modified DESC\"; Change it to: $sql .= \" WHERE j.journal=? ORDER BY u.lastname ASC, u.firstname ASC\"; This will cause both the users that are done and the users who have no entry, to be listed alphabetically when a teacher goes to the page generated by report.php. I have made a pull request to try and get this change into the Journal code at github. Robin also asked: \"Also, if we could be able to download the entries, that would be nice.\" I do have a solution for this, but it is nowhere nearly as simple, requiring the addition of about 100 lines of code lib.php and nearly that many in report.php. Time permitting, I will try to add it to my github version of Journal, and will post here when it is available. Download entries is actually available in a new plugin I am developing, based on Journal, named, Diary. Over the years, I have seen numerous requests for a Diary plugin, and mine is similar (based off of) Journal with the added capability of giving the user a new blank entry, every time they go to edit on a new calendar day. Still have lots to do, but if anyone wants a look see, let me know via private message, and I will give access. Or you can git a, mostly current version, from the Diary master branch at my github account.",

We need to specially thank AL Rachels ( https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=94615 ) for his contribution in this release as he removed all notices and debugging messages as well as converting the add_to_log() calls to the new events system ( http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2 ) Thanks AL. Please, if you notice any new issue during these first days of testing and deployment comment about it here in the journal forums, on the tracker contrib component or on the github project page ( https://github.com/dmonllao/moodle-mod_journal ). Next step towards the code cleanup would be to write unit and acceptance tests for it so we will detect quickly when we are breaking something during the cleanup.",

          "Text": "I'm trying to find the best way in Moodle I can do the following: For each of the assigned readings (perhaps more than 25 in a semester) ask students to submit a reflective writing assignment. Deadline is something like three hours before my course, and I will use their contributions to prepare mini-lectures. Grading is simple (if they submit something reasonable, they get full credit). I only take marks off if they submit reading summaries (paraphrasing the content of what was read, not personal, not reflective). For the purpose of my mini-lecture preparation, I want to annotate their submissions, e.g., with comments on passages such as one can do in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Adobe Acrobat, etc. I don't want to do this on hard copy in 2015. I'd like to be able to generate a word cloud using the content. I could have up to 40 students in two sections (80 students total) and I don't have a secretary to help me click! Looking at the Journal activity in Moodle, I think it comes up short on the annotation feature (at least based on the documentation I looked at, there seems to only be a form field for instructor feedback and a grade). I'm thinking of going with Assignments (there's bulk download of Word/PDF/etc.) documents although a Word cloud wouldn't be possible (that's not a show stopper). I'd appreciate feedback from the Moodle community regarding this approach. Thanks!",

About three weeks ago I discovered that most versions of Journal (including 2.6) have one small bug in the journal lib.php file if you are using Journal set for Grade > None and with debugging turned on. The bug is a notice that an offset is not set and is caused by checking to see if a grade has been overridden in the gradebook...but no entry is in the gradebook because the Journal is set for no grade. A couple of days ago I came up with a fix that will most likely be in the next version along with a new feature I've come up with that posts a notice that a journal entry needs to be regraded if the student makes changes to an entry that has already been graded. The upshot of it all is that it will not hurt to go ahead and use Journal 2.7.2 with Moodle 2.8. Tonight I will finish pushing that last fix up to my github account and you can get an updated copy with the fixes, if you would like to. HTH , AL",

I really like the Grade Me block for alerts as to what needs to be graded, but it presently does not have a plugin for showing Journal entries that need grading. Last weekend, while laid up with another cold, a truly UNWANTED gift from my students, I managed to cobble together a working plugin that will do what's needed. The modification adds one folder, one file, and modifies one other file of Grade Me. Right now I am waiting on a reply from the Grade Me folks about getting a copy of the plugin to them. If anyone would like to try it out, I can provide a copy of it.  Just be forewarned, I have developed it for Moodle 2.7 versions of the Journal and Grade Me and have not had any time to test on any other versions. I might be able to do so next week, but no guarantees. It does work very nicely on Moodle 2.7, Moodle 2.8 beta, and Moodle 2.8 RC1. AL",

David Monllaó (Lead maintainer) has been pretty good about releasing versions for each Moodle but he only does enough to keep it working and is not adding any new capability. The latest version for Moodle 2.6 works with Moodle 2.7, but if you turn on debugging to developer mode, there are about 30 warnings of various types that will show up depending on what part of journal you are in. Most are related to deprecated methods of getting info and adding log entries. There is one set of two warnings that will show for every student entry when you view all the student entries. Now...the reason I know these details is...I have played with trying to do a little programming in Moodle over the years, and literally just yesterday, had picked the Journal activity as something to play with while on summer break. It is very simple compared to other activities , without too many files to learn about. I am down to just two warnings left to try and figure out. They both show up for the teacher but only one shows up for students. I have fixed the log entries and even added a couple of new ones. If you would like a copy with my modifications, to try out, let me know. The modifications do not change the journal database tables at all. Hopefully, sometime tomorrow, I will have the last two warnings  fixed. I'm going to quit \"playing\" for now. Students \"gifted\" me a cold and it is getting to me, so I'm done for the day. AL",

If I had to insert some code to make this simple email message be sent to me... what would be the page to insert it? Thanks!",

Click \"(View ___ journal entries)\". When the journals open, they're in chronological order. If you check each day or so, you'll know at a glance which entries are new. OR 2) Click \"Reports\" in your \"Administration\" block. Select the date you want to check, click the drop-down arrow by \"All activities\" and select \"Journals,\" click \"Get these logs,\" and any journal entries on that date will be listed.

          "Text": "Since it appears Journals won't be supported in 1.7 anymore, it is with some reluctance I will probably be replacing my Journals with Assignments - they are not the same thing.  Just the name \"Assignment\" makes it sound like something the teacher is requiring, you do it, turn it in, then forget about it once it is done. What I liked about the Journal was the way the student could see all their entries on one page when they clicked on the link in the upper left (on my site).  This encouraged them to think of the Journal as a progression of thought and showed how their thinking or reflection was evolving as the course went on. It didn't look like a gradebook but rather was more personal - a journal that they \"owned\" rather than a series of assignments from the teacher. When they click on Assignments then it looks like a gradebook - each assignment is separate and they click multiple times in order to view each entry.  (And journal-like entries are mixed with other writing assigments). One of the harder things is to get student to connect the material earlier in the course to material later in the course and one of the uses of my journal was to get them to keep reflecting on this.  Sure I can ask them to do this using the Assignments, but the just the layout of it makes it more difficult and I don't think they feel the \"ownership\" that a Journal encourages. Bottom line - a series of Assignments is not a Journal - nor is a Blog unless they allow for making the Blog private.  [ Yes a peer-available or public Blog adds another dimension but depending on the course may not be appropriate.  ] Just venting here. Hacking Journal to work in 1.7 is not an option for me.",

It wouldn't be graded. Has anyone tried this and if so would you share your experience with us? Thanks : )",

(GUIDE - Glasgow University Initiative in Distance Education - just down the road from you?! - NB we currently support any Moodler in the University - especially but not exclusively distance ed. staff and learners).

The great joy of Moodle (and a key reason why the U of Glasgow has recently adopted it as its centrally supported VLE) is its inherent flexibility, its potential to afford a range of learning opportunitities (such as PDP here) espec. those premised in soc. constructivist learning and support, and its relative ease of use (thereby affording learning enabled not driven by technology).   A further plus for moodle.org is its potential to enable folk in the same institution to communicate! It would be good to hear from anyone else using Moodle for PDP and I seem to recall seeing some messages about it - will use 'search' and see!",

I like having students revise their journals through the week with frequent suggestions from me. Giving developing journals one minute of attention here and there, saves enormous amounts of editing/grading/reading time for the teacher at the conclusion of the process. If you REALLY need an \"in-line\" editing function, you can spend the time to login as the student, and edit the journal in a different font color (using the HTML editor), though the logging can get tedious with big classes. The absolute proper use of a journal is probably to have the student reflect and revise on his own for a period of time. Then the teacher provides feedback. For this functionality, no module is better. But, hey, this software is incredibly flexible, so I don't think it is wrong to re-imagine its use to fit your situation. best, Tom",
