By setting the prefs like that, and allowing for Ratings , students would be able to begin their forum experience by posting a \"discussion\" and then rating his/her peers' discussions without having the distracting option of a reply also. Our first forum exercise (just to understand what it is all about) is to post an idea to improve the school. When they are done posting their idea, they are to rate other students' ideas with \"I totally agree\" down to \"I totally don't agree,\" with gradations between. This activity is to teach them how to do ratings. I've found replies allowed along with the ratings link confuses some of my new Moodle students (all of whom are 12 years old or younger). They lose track what they are looking at. This idea would not eliminate any current options, but would add an additional new option.",

Let some of the others worry about developing the forums.  That is one component of Moodle that isn't very unique, original, or comprehensive.  And it tends to distract time, efforts, and resources from the core Educational Content Delivery Application. Just my thoughts... What do you think?",

          "Text": "We use a rubric to rate the quality of posts, and we usually also require a certain number of posts for each discussion. Does anyone else use both quality and quantity to assess forum participation? If so, how do you set it up for grading? In 1.8.x, our instructors could export the gradebook to Excel at the end of each discussion and see all the ratings (from our custom scale) in the spreadsheet cell for that assignment. Thus, instructors could quickly see if students had made the minimum number of postings and average the scores to enter into an offline assignment called \"Weekly Forum Grade.\" In 1.9.x, exporting the gradebook to an Excel file will only produce one number that is an aggregate based on the settings for that forum. The only way I can see to grade on both quality and quantity is to let Moodle average the ratings and then go to every participants activity report to be sure they made the minimum number of postings. Or, maybe the participants report could show the number of postings for all the students in one report? I would appreciate any insight. I cannot upgrade to 1.9.x until I have a good plan for assessing forums. I know that this question is a blend of forum and gradebook, but I thought it was a better fit here. Thank you, Bruce",

          "Text": "A year or so ago, I had one of my staff, Irene Leon (who now has moved on to another job), modify the forum email notification routine to allow users to choose to get separate digests for each course rather than just one digest for the whole site. She made some changes and submitted them through the bug tracker, but they have not yet been incorporated into the released version. Recently, when incorporating these modifications into 1.6, we discovered that we had not tested enough. The course-by-course digests were working, but the single digest for the entire site was broken. We have now fixed that. The net effect is that users can now elect to receive complete or subject-only digests separately for each course they are enrolled in, in addition to preserving the previous functionality of a single site-wide digest for those who opt for that. I have attached a zip file with the modified files (all are modifications of the 1.6.1 versions of the respective files). Here's the summary of changes: user/edit.html : Added lines 162-163 lang/en_utf8/moodle.php : Added lines 405-406",

In my Moodle, Moodle 3.6.4+ (Build: 20190519), when a person replies to a post, Moodle automatically adds a Re: to the subject.  Here on Moodle.org, the same thing happens, except \"Re:\" continues to be added to the subject line whenever there is a reply to a reply.  These subject lines grow in size when a discussion topic is very active, see this one as an example. This did not always happen, see this post as an example, where there is only one \"Re:\" regardless of whether it is a reply to a reply. I don't think that the \"Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re\" is really adding anything of value, and suggest that we go back to posts having only one \"Re: \".  I don't know if this is a \"bug\" or a new \"feature.\" Has anyone else noticed this?  It becomes especially irritating with viewing emailed posts on a smartphone since you cannot see the subject (it is to the far right.)  Is anyone else getting irritated?",

However when I've tested this with a student account that is only in one group, the RSS feed is displaying ALL the discussions, not just the ones from the group the student is a member of (though when they click on the discussion posted to a different group it comes up with a 'You do not have permission ...' screen). Does anyone know a way to fix this so that it only displays the discussions they have access to? I really want these announcements to appear on the My Home page, but different students will get them from different sources so the RSS feed seems to be the best way. thanks Isabel",

With forum subscription set to Auto-subscription, participants start out being subscribed to all discussion threads, and can opt-out if they want.  This is the behaviour I expect, and seems to work. With forum subscription set to Optional subscription, Moodle *should* check back with the participant's User profile preferences.  If the preference is not to be subscribed, the participant should not be subscribed to any forum threads.  If the preference is to be subscribed, then participants should start out being subscribed to all discussion threads, and can opt-out if they want.  Except that the behaviour I'm seeing on my Moodle 2.8.3+ (Build: 20150212) site is that regardless of preference, participants start out subscribed to all threads, and can opt-out.  Making optional subscription mode no different to auto-subscription mode. Is this intentional?  Have I misunderstood something? All the best, Lindy (@moodlechick)",

Students start out subscribed to all discussions but can opt-out of either forum subscription, or per-discussion subscription as the choose. With optional subscription, Moodle does not subscribe them by default at all. This has never been the case. The profile setting determines the default setting when a user replies to a discussion. That's to say that when a forum is in Optional subscription, and replies to a discussion they have not taken part in before, this is where the profile preference comes in. It either defaults to subscribing them to the discussion, or remaining unsubscribed. So there should be a difference between Optional and Automatic subscription. However , if you take an existing forum and change it from Automatic to Optional then the existing subscriptions will remain in place until a user unsubscribes. Any new user will not be subscribed. Just to be clear, when you create and Automatic forum, under the hood it subscribes every user in the course to that forum and they gain a subscription setting. Hope that clarifies things, Andrew",

That makes browsing the forum (and rating posts) difficult since some posts are miles wide and long. If images could be automatically thumbnailed to some reasonable size (600 pixels wide?, better yet, a selectable parameter for the forum) and then be hyperlinked to the full image, that would be ideal.

It seems like students in high school (senior students using moodle for the first time) even though its a online collaboration but students still answer one on one on the forum. Using facebook mention is very effection where if a students reply to a teacher and mention other students name, they will be notified through facebook and email......There comments can also post to facebook for feedback from people on facebook (if necessary) she can mention an educator who are friends on facebook and that person can reply from facebook but still appear on Moodle.... I will keep doing this if this will benefit the students ....please keep in touch.... Tobias",

It tells them \"Subscriptions not allowed\" like it should. And yet my users of that forum are still getting spammed. I've double-checked their profiles, they're all set to \"No, don't automatically subscribe.\" This seems different than the reported bug where it's giving users the ability to subscribe. I am running Moodle 1.92 and this issue is killing me. The temp workaround has been to basically disable mail. Has anyone seen my exact same problem?

And here is a semi-integrated wiki but not the one that he was thinking of integrating. But since Mike Churchward is very busy, there does not seem to have been much progress. A universally re-editable forum would be a quicker way of reaching this worthy goal, and would be a useful add on. So, please make it! It really sounds quite realisable doesn't it. All it would really need is for the last post on the forum to be the default text in the reply box and, as is already almost the case in the reply window, all but the last post to be displayed only as links. My guess is that Martin would be inclined to aim for more kosher, wiki-propper module as opposed to a \"stop-gap solution\" in the general release (even if there were time), but as you say, the forum is almost there, and of course perfectly integrated. So perhaps it could end up entirely kosher. And there do seem to be difficulties in ingetrating external open sources projects into Moodle. (Off topic but..) This puzzles me a little... with all the wonderful open source software in the world, it surprises me that there is not more of it being stuck together, in a sort of meta-open-source , \" open-source s format \"!? Perhaps someone will invent some international standards for say, web deployable software and their data-bases, so that people can make things that fit together. Or that the database of phpnuke, or postnuke, or Xoops or Moodle will become such a standard. As it stands there is are many great wiki / forum / chat / quiz / calendar etc software being reinvented at various places all over the world. United we stand? Resuing the forum module is certainly one way avoiding reinvention. Tim Timothy Takemoto",

When I choose File download, I am given the Available export formats and I only have HTML and Leap2A formats. From the Portfolios documentation I expected to also see Text. In administration, I don't see anywhere that I can add this format. Nor do I see a way to add a PDF format as the documentation states. What am I missing? Also, when I export to Google Docs I am not given any export format option and when I open the exported document in Google Docs, it is scrunched into a very narrow table in a text document. Is this behavior normal? If we export a forum entry to a Google Docs document will we have to do major reformatting in Google to get it to look correct? Thanks Jeff",

The documentation implies this should be possible: ---------- If the group mode is set to visible groups: - Teachers are given the option of adding a new discussion topic for all participants or for a selected group. If a teacher adds a new discussion topic for a selected group, then only group members can reply to it. - Students can only start discussions for their own group. - Students can only reply to discussions started by other group members or teachers. [emphasis added] ------------ However I'm finding that if the teacher sets the initial post to all participants, all students can reply to all postings, regardless of group. If the teacher sets the initial post to either one group or uses \"Post copy to all groups\", students can see only posts made by their own group members.

Of course, using this approach would still not result in the introduction forum being duplicated in all classes...it would all be in the metacourse, but this may be a good thing as well.

But the time limit here has an upper limit of one week. Say I want to restrict users to a single post or single discussion? I would like to provide a nomination feature that allows each user to start just one discussion topic (their \"Nomination\"), and would then allow other users to second the Nominations of their choice in a Reply. Alternatively, Discussions are not allowed, but the teacher starts a single Discussion (the nomination topic) and users are allowed just one reply each (their nomination). This would be perfectly possible if the blocking feature time limit option included \"Ever\" instead of a maximum of 1 Week. Is there a way to achieve this? Thanks in advance Simon",

Task 2:  Each group are to respond to two other groups.  One group member will post on behalf of the group/team. Group members of each group should receive the same grade for their group's post and replies - similar to the group grading in the assignment. Thank you for your support.",

Other email from the site (like badge awards) is being sent fine. If a teacher posts a new message to the news forum, only a single message is sent.  The message is sent to whomever is the first in the list of people subscribed to the forum. When I run the Chron manually, I can see it processing the message and sending to the first user.  If there is more than one subscribed user, it will say it processed it for the first user, but then the next line of the Chron report will be \"sending\" and it will stop there. It doesn't matter if the first person in the subscribed list is a student or a teacher.  It also doesn't matter if it is the sender of the message. If there is only one subscribed user, the Chron report will read that it processed the message, sent it to the one user, and then, unlike if there are more than one user, it will go on to complete the remaining Chron tasks. It has me stumped.  Any thoughts? Joe Cavanaugh",

I also will be developing a gathering place for home school educators and parents using forums and some link pages very soon. I see that Martin has Moodle.org set up in this very way and has about 41 forums running. My concern is if I will bog down Moodle that is being used for the classes by having the forums. I could easily see having 2000+ posts a month on the home school forums. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Will it not cause difficulty? Would it be better to get a separate simple PHP forum software to handle the extra load (or it is not needed)? Thanks, - Joe",

The idea started with my not being happy getting emails from a dozen of different forums at Moodle.org, all with \"using moodle\" as subject prefix. However, the same applies to my Moodle, where I am in a multitude of forums, and to students in our courses, many of which take 4-6 courses in parallel, each with multiple forums. The point is that different people use different mail clients and have different preferences and habits for processing mails. Some use threading, others use filters, others use content concatenator or else. Some use pop and some imap. Some see content with email list, others see only list and must open an email to see content. So, I think it would be nice to empower users to give them a choice of the subject format just as we have now a choice for mail format (plain or html). * course name only * forum name only * course name:forum name * custom prefix (unique site-wide, set by admin or teacher)",

As soon as they click on \"Grade users\" however, they see all participants. Shouldn't they only be seeing the selected group? Are we missing something in the setup?

I refreshed the page, thinking it might be some glitch in my browser client ( Firefox 1.0.6), but it still showed the unupdated version. I tried editing the post the second time with the same result as before. I then added my additional comment as a reply to the previous message.

However, I would like to cut down on the volume of email, particularly for students.

The practicality of Moodle is that it provides a consistent platform for \"Instructors\" to develop resources and activities for Learners to engage with to allow them to expand their practical and/or theoretical skills base. The benefit of Moodle is that it is a mode of communications between Learners and Instructors in a variety of ways which ultimately allows both Learners and Instructors to improve their practical and intellectual abilities by delivering opportunities for the development of a body of work demonstrating those skills and abilities. The practical reality of Moodle is - it's fun.😁.... except for the new emojis, they suck.",

We have a polytech with different campuses and separate Moodles, and the desire is to put them all together under one Moodle instance. This CAN be done with categories/sub-categories etc, and category themes, BUT the concern is losing the front page news items that were specific to that campus. One way is as you mentioned, using a couse page and forum, but we already use meta courses for enrolling within the different programmes within our campus. Plus the news forum can't be displayed on a course page like the site front page. Of course, you COULD make that course page at the category level a Social Forum and change permissions so that students can't post or reply...but is there a more streamlined solution to this? The multi-tenancy feature that WAS going to a part of 2.3, but alas, has been abandoned, would have solved keeping separate identities for our various campuses. So being able to keep some sort of category identity in terms of a news page is the next solution.",

I tried to add a new category of classes and got a red message saying the category couldn't be added. I realized I had to add some new members, went and did that and came back to the main area where my classes had been listed down the center and they were gone!!! Now, in the area where my courses were listed is a repeat of the right hand, introductory text block. It seems the issue is that the only course category that existed (was MELODY) was somehow deleted when I went from the \"add category\" screen in courses, to the \"add users\" area. Because now I get this message when I go to courses: Serious error: could not create default category. Also, no one with administrator rights can re-establish any course category. So, no course category, no courses. It's 3:16 a.m. here...so, any immediate help would sooooo be appreciated - especially since the site is live. Oddly, a friend just went in and, did a search under the instructors name: Rick Carnes (at www.songwritersguild.com - click on chat or on forums). He found the missing courses under the instructors name and was able to subscribe to them. So, maybe they're not gone...but I can't see them as admin. And I still get the serious error message when I go to courses. I know I am still in the process of learning Moodle but, this is mindboggling . Can anyone help me? I have no idea how this happened. Is there any chance this is a glitch? Or will I truly have to repost each course?",

If she sets her preference to SUBJECTS, she gets nothing but if she chooses NO DIGEST, all of the email notifications show up in her email, no problem. But here is why this is even more strange. I put myself in her class as an (instructor like her) where this is happening and I was also unable to get forum notification emails in the SUBJECTS form but I was able to do what she does, which is get them in the multiple emails a day NO DIGEST option. We both were instructors in the course and both had the same issue. (In my other courses that I teach, I can get the SUBJECTS option without issue.) So I decided to put her in one of my courses that appears to be working correctly, and sure enough she could not get the SUBJECTS option to work and was only able to see student forum post emails when she chose the NO DIGEST option. I have no issue with this, and I added her to the class as an instructor, just like me. So I went from thinking there was a problem in her course to thinking there is something with her settings. But I checked them all out and they appear to be exactly the same as mine, which as I mentioned work fine. So basically the problem is that this one instructor out of all of our faculty is unable to use the SUBJECTS option to get one email a day per class and is forced to use the NO DIGEST option and is inundated with emails each day. Can anyone point me in the right direction here? It's weird it's only her, and I checked her preferences 10 times.  I must be missing something..... thanks , John Horner SUNY Delhi",

Just check with your school administration to see if your students and their guardians have to sign a consent form before their photos will be published on the web. Hope this helps, Ulrike",

I have no idea if they are doing it accidentally or the students are somehow removing themselves or even if someone else with admin privileges is doing it. I can't track through the logs who is accessing that particular course/group settings page, although I have setup Piwik to track and I can see it being accessed, but that's all I can see. Does anyone know a way of tracking the groups membership? Or of even locking it down as it should not change over the course of an acedemic year. As I say it appears to be only happening on one course, but it could be that other lecturers and tutors are just not reporting it to me or not even noticing. It's annoying because the tutor no longer trusts anything that happens in the Moodle install. Any help or ideas would be most appreciated. Thanks Derek",

Is there any easy(ish) way to make a change across all forums to set them up to use the rating scheme we have created? I appreciate that this may mean the running of an SQL command...but that would be a lot easier than manually going into every single forum and changing their settings. Cheers, Phil",

The main thrust of the critique is that when you reply to a post in a discussion thread, you only see the text of the post you are replying to. However, one often wants to refer to other posts in the thread. To do this currently, one needs to right click and open up another window and suchlike contortions. I think that a good way to address this issue would be to initially just show the text of post you are replying to together with titles of other posts in the thread. There should be checkboxes next to these titles and a button to refresh the view, showing the text of all the other posts whose checkboxes have been checked on. Or some +/- controls which allow you to expand the titles to complete posts.",

And opening/closing individual messages, quite a mess, more if you are in a slow connection. What do you think about a \"compose page\" in an small pop-up window? In such way you can keep the whole thread open in a window and the answer in other in a \"natural\" way, without having to right click, etc. I understand that threading usually means branching and see the risk of fragmentation that Feldstein points out. But I think he is talking about \"casual\" or \"general purpose\" forum conversations. Where all contribute to all. But in some parts of education we do need branching, and been able to review arguments in the thread, why branching occurs etc. Moodle offers a \"flat\" format, but I use most the \"nested\", since I do see al posts (with scrolling) AND the tree. What I try to do (and not always do) is to reply to the OP if my answer is a kind of summing-up or combined reply for several posts (something quite usual if you have a teacher role). But there seem to be no netiquette agreement on this nowadays (young people have not used usenet newsgroups at all). I would like the \"reply to conversation\" button suggested by Feldstein. And I am sure it is much more easy to implement. Perhaps the mere existence of the choice (to all, to poster) would enforce thinking about before posting.",

A flat view of the original post, along with a view showing tangents allows for the creative flow that often emerges in real conversation, yet maintains the integrity of the original discussion. The threaded model can and very often does lead to a disintegration of the original subject when ambiguity and neediness creeps in. It can be difficult to keep on track with the original thread when branches that may not be relevent to the topic are all displayed with those that are. This isn't very intuitive.  At the same time relevant information often comes from tangent branches, so it might be nice to somehow merge just that kernel of relevence from tangent branches into the original discusssion. In that sense, I might suggest an \"integrate tangent\" link to go along with Feldsteins \"start tangent\" link.",

As an example, a bug tracker would allow for tagging of a discussion as a whole - where the problem is, what type it is - and then tagging of posts - additional information, potential fix. A question and answer forum might want posts to be tagged as question, further info, response. Getting this information hooked into the posts properly, along with linking the relationships, will allow us to start designing the informational display and the user interface. I could see a forum format the collapses the posts like gmail, and allows me to quickly open and close them while I'm editing. It would be great to have a personal scrapbook, that allows me to collect bits of information as I move through forums and other activities . These scraps would have appropriate informational ties back to their sources and would allow me to drop them into posts or other activities. Anyway, lots of thinking still to do...",

The only problem I have with current Moodle forums, is that you loose the view on the branch where the reply is aiming at: like this message is an answer on the first message in this forum.... maybe should an answer be right under the previous answer, unless you press a (new)button called \"new branch\" which will be a new column next to the previous one. maybe something like the swimlanes in UML? maybe a merge button for two branches is also wishable?",

Is there a way for the teacher to place this new topic in its right place? The function \"move topic\" allows only to move it to another forum, not inside an existing thread of the same forum. The \"dirty way\" would be log-in as the student, copy the post, delete it, answer in the correct place and paste the old post, then log-out, but it is nor practical, nor very ethical (it is rarely a good policy to log-in with someone else's identity).

A new forumtype: Metaforum A metaforum is now an additional forumtype. Metaforums offer a view on chosen forums of the same course and don't contain posts themselves. This forumtype should be helpfull to keep track of new posts etc. if a lot of forums exist in one course. Metaforums can be used to give a summarized overview of chosen forums. 2. Enhanced linking between forums and resources Generally spoken this is a possibility to allocated discussions to resources of the same course. To admit this resources can now optionally be allocated to forums. If such allocations have been made, discussions in forums can be allocated to one of the resources allocated to the forum. If an allocation has been made while viewing a resource a link to add a new discussion allocated to the resource viewed is displayed. If discussions have already been allocated a link to an overview of all allocated discussions is displayed too. I would be glad about testers and comments on the new features. Of course I'd like to answer further questions too. Enclosed you find installation bundles and directions for Moodle 1.6.1 to install either one of the new functions or both new functions.",

We just updated our theme from the default to the Archauis theme and it seems after that we are not able to see who's post it is.  Are there any settings that I am missing, or is it just a theme issue? It used to show the student's name at the top of the posting, but not any longer. We also updated the software to 2.7 also, so I'm not sure which is the problem. I really like the theme, but if I can't fix it, I will have to look for another theme.  Thanks for your assistance.",

The discussion of the assignments are important. The students have a deadline to send in their assignment but after that they are given time to comment/read other assignments for another week. However this give the student opportunity to add their assignment after deadline (which they do). Is there a way to stop the students to add their assignment (start a new thread) from a certain date but let them continue to read and comment on their fellow students assignment. Or is it a better way to handle this way of teaching? I do hope you understand my questions and I do hope someone has an answer. Thank you so much in advance.",

Thanks in advance - Leticia The specific forums I am having problems with are the 'q and a' format forums. These feature multiple questions for students to answer. The problem is in trying to find where students have responded to both. If our teacher goes into the student profile and clicks on forums - answers to the Q&A forums don't show. If she goes into students' activity, it tells her how many posts to that particular forum students have made, but not to which question. If she clicks on the forum link from the activity report, it just goes to the forum and not to the individual student's post. Keep in mind that with these forums there are multiple questions and multiple posts for each student, and our teachers i having to go through each one individually to find which question a student responded to. This is taking a huge amount of time. If a search is completed, it won't bring up posts to these forums either: only to the 'group' ones. Is there any other way of searching the q and a forums??",

Forum posts by students in Q&A DO show up in the forum posts lists on student profiles in my Moodle 1.9.4 Which version are you using? All forum posts should be emailed by the cron job to the teacher if the teacher is not logged in to the classroom. Many of my teachers use these email notices for exactly the kind of record keeping you describe. If your cron isn't working, you're missing a lot of notifications that make life for teachers immensely easier. If you have a proficient IT person, try installing Ajax Marking Block to simplify your teacher's record keeping further. It requires that the Forum be \"rated,\" which we do anyway (not yet using the AMB) by giving a possible score of 1. Can't be confused with getting a real grade. Have the teacher turn on forum tracking. Profile > Edit profile > Show advanced > Forum Tracking > Yes This shows her which discussion topics have new contributions. If none of the above work for her, the low-tech solution is to have students message her saying, \"I contributed to Discussion X.\"",

Click Submit to continue.</p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /> That could be from any submit button, but how did it get in the document? the document was only 4kb so something strange happened either on upload or. on submission.

These then get stored as simple ascii but translated back to the correct character by the browser when displayed as HTML. Safari (and possibly Opera) simply substitute a question mark for characters outside the specified encoding. Neither is actually 'correct', in fact the Mozilla way, while more useful for my purposes, may actually be less correct from a standards point of view. ref:",

I am not a programmer, so I cannot help with the code to make this work. But the logic should be: If Display_Start is enabled, then Post_date=Display_Start_Date. Well, that's my simple-minded approach.  I suspect if someone perceived the need to use the actual post date, that another option could be provided saying something like: \"Use display_start as post_date\" YES/NO, with the default being YES.",

I have the following scenario that I want to accomplish: I want to create a forum in which the Students are able to see only their posts, and not other student posts. Teachers can see all posts of everybody, and can replay to any of them. My workaround to solve this is create a group for each student, and configure the forum with a \"separate group\" configuration. But I may be missing something more obvious here. This solution may work with small number of students, but with 300 in my coursem, this crowds the groups in a way I don't like. Moreover, as students belong to not only one group, I have to teach them to post in the correct group in order for the forum to work as expected. Any thought on this? Thanks in advance",

When you create groups I always recommend that you create them in a Grouping . A Grouping is a logical collection of groups.  When you set up your forum, and you put it into Separate Groups mode, you can set a Grouping. The effect of that Grouping is that the activity is only limited to those groups, and ignores any other group in the course. This means that your students will only see that one group, and will not be prompted to choose a group when posting. As I say, I always advise creating groups in a grouping. In fact I would advise that all groups are in at least one grouping. Hope this helps, Andrew",

Somebody who was having a problem with the uploadusers script posted an attachment with sensitive information while seeking help with the problem. After I replied and solved the problem, we both deleted our posts to protect this information. Today I offered a solution for somebody, then realized that there was a much better solution. While I could have left the old post in the forum and then offered the better solution in another post, I thought it was better to delete the old post in case somebody hastily searching for such information later might be misled by the old post.

          "Text": "Hello Using Moodle 1.8.2+ (of August 8th, I think). On a forum using groups (visible or separate), an editing teacher (a legacy role) needs to be a member of the group to be able to reply to a post by a student. Is this the designed behavior or a bug? And if a bug does it affect others or is it particular to our system? I'm thinking a bug as: - The same teacher is able to edit the post without being a member of the group. - An admin switched to role the editing teacher legacy role is able to reply. - the behavior doesn't seems moodle-like Could anyone confirm the situation at your (1.8.x) systems, so I know if I should be looking at my own system for the cause, or filing a bug report , or a suggesting a change and/or a added capability.",

However, I am of the philosophy that if students make posts, I must read, then grade them.  I do not agree with a \"Grad All Submissions\" feature, because then you might not have read them.  So I don't feel that I am \"hunting\" for things, I just watch for posts that I haven't graded. I usually first grade forum posts within the forum.  This allows me to grade student's post \"in context .\"  Then, I use the Moodle \"search forums\" feature to search for all forum posts.  I scroll through each page, looking for posts not graded.  Most frequently, if a post is not graded, I view this post \"in context\" and grade it there. Yes, I understand that some instructors might prefer to not read and grade individual posts, and a \"grade all\" would be handy.  Not me. So I just step thru the various topics and grade individually. I do have a tracker suggestion that the Search Forums provide a \"search for not rated\" feature.\"  Consider voting for it.  It is MDL-34195 , closed, but voting might re-activate it.",

          "Text": "Okay, there are actually faster ways to grade forum posts for those who don't want to read what students are saying, in context. 1) Go to your grade book, edit the item, pick override all, perform a bulk insert, insert a value, then save.  You have just given every student the same grade in less than one minute. 2) (Slower than #1, but you can claim that you looked at their post) Go to advanced search, search for the forum of interest, then simple rate each student's post.  You should be able to rate around 10-15 per minute. (This is faster than D2L.) 3)  (Slower than #2, but you can look at all posts student by student.) Start like #2, but add the student's name in the filter dialog box.  Then you will see all the posts for a forum by student.  Using this method, if you leave off the forum name, you can simply grade all of one student's posts across all forums.  This method is good for teachers who don't care to grade forum posts until the end of the course. 4) If you really don't care what students say, don't include forum discussions as part of their grade.  (i.e., Don't use ratings.) This is really the fastest.  There are probably many students who would really like this method. 5) What students would like most, and involves the absolute shortest amount of your time and theirs, is simply to not have discussions. My guess is that there are probably other ways. Some LMSs can do word counts.  I don't recall if Moodle attempts to do this, but I do recall that D2L might.  When students catch on, they will learn that the following paragraph is a great way to get full points. \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Since you are not concerned about whether what a student says makes sense in context, what are you really looking for?  Do you really spend time reading grouped-by-student posts, or are you essentially doing a word count, or a quick visual check to avoid Ipsom...?  In other words, do you ever give a student less than maximum points, and if so, do you spend time writing the student?  I ask these questions because I am just curious about your technique, not to dissuade you.

Right now you can move intact discussions, but it is an all-or-nothing affair. A current case in point is a topic I initiated in the Quiz Module section: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=3100 . In order to avoid any non-sequiturs which might occur if there are references to the previous posting which is no longer there because it has been left in the original discussion, an automatic message with a link could be appended to the top of the \"new\" first message saying something like: \"This message continues from a separate thread. See previous context \". (This is a non-working example....)",

The reasons for email not being sent out (other than users not being subscribed) include 1) No cron at all (beginners often forget they need a cron) 2) The use of a noreply email address or admin email address that is outside your server 's domain . Some servers prevent the sending of email with sender addresses that do not correspond to the server. This MAY also occur if Setting>Modules>Forum>forum_replytouser: is yes and the server does not even allow 'faked' reply addresses but that is just a guess. 3) Moodle 2 has a different address for the cron to previous versions of moodle.  moodle/admin/cron.php is now moodle/admin/cli/cron.php thought most of the documentation page mentions the former address. 4) Disk space is full. 5) Incorrect smtp setting (try php mailer by making the setting blank) 6) A problem with another module (e.g. a problem with the journal module ) that stops the cron before it gets to the forum module. 7) A rather arcane problem with servers that are set up like gmail and require a modification to the code as would be made when using gmail as the smpt server. I have tried all the above except the last. Any other suggestions? My cron says",

As far as I know, this means that instead of respecting the forum-specific delay for mailing a given post, it is added to the mail queue right away. The mail queue will be processed at the next cron run, whenever that occurs. That means that there can still be a delay until the mail actually goes out. For example, if your forum is set to allow editing of posts for 20 mins and cron runs every 5 mins, \"mail now\" means that your mail will go out within 5 mins instead of within 25 mins. Caveat: there were some substantial changes with regards to cron in the recent versions of Moodle, which may affect this, but probably not or not significantly. If the understanding is not the issue, there may be a technical problem with the scheduling of mail-now mails on your site. There have been a few threads about different technical issues. Search the forum.",

My school seems to suggest going external, using a product like Piazza. And look at you!  You are trying to find Moodle's internal code that you might be able to use.  My feeling is that if one must use an external discussion tool, why not use Moodle for discussions? Well, this won't happen at your school.  It would be admitting that some administrators picked the wrong product. Here on Moodle.org, we use Moodle for discussions, right?  Not so with Canvas.  Their community forums use a different product than their own.  Seems that even Canvas has recognized that their own product can't effectively handle discussions. So, what I see if that if you want a better discussion tool, don't use Canvas.  If you want a better grade book, don't use Canvas.  If you want a better quizzing engine, don't use Canvas. If you want a better community (like Moodle.org) for discussions, feature requests, bug reports, don't use Canvas.  If you want a better system that allows students to track their progress, don't use Canvas. So, for very simple-minded tasks, like posting a syllabus, sure Canvas is as easy as other LMSs. I guess if one doesn't know anything about LMSs, Canvas does a better job marketing itself. You seem to be an LMS administrator-type person, so you are stuck.  In my own case, I am a professor, and I run Moodle on my own for my courses. I will watch this topic to see where you end up. Here is one real suggestion that maybe you have already done.  Get involved in the Canvas Community discussions.  Then, make a post just like you did here.  If you want some sparks to fly, mention Moodle.  Or leave Moodle off.  See what you are told.  Make some feature requests (they will be quickly canned, or \"archived, as Canvas calls it.)  Report back to us.",

If you OS is a BSD then as root execute the following; crontab - u root -e On a Linux system execute sudo crontab -u root -e A editor will pop up into which you add the following; For BSD add 0/15 * * * * /usr/bin/fetch -q http://your.domain.org/moodle/admin/cron.php For Linux add 0/15 * * * * wget http://your.domain.org/moodle/admin/cron.php Save and all should work.

In other words, The instructor would receive emails notifying that someone responded to their post. Otherwise he/she would not receive any emails about any other post unless it was a post in response to the instructor's post.

It would be like this: John Doe: \"I think that it should be......\" - Instructor: \"Yes, but if you....\" - John Doe: \"That's what I thought...\"  ---Instructor gets an email copy since he responded to instructor - Mary J: \"I am not sure if it should be...\" ---Instructor does NOT get an email since she responded to John and not instructor The advantage of the this is that the instructor does not get 100's of emails of all discussions, but if someone does respond to him, he does not miss the response. Obviously, the instructor will have to log into the class daily and respond to student's initial posts, but this helps a tremendously in making sure that the dialogue is quicker in replies and that the student definitely gets answered and instead of the student's conversation being buried in a 100  posts.",

Could this be done while showing the title in the small box, instead as hardcoded in the database as currently? Or have a setting for the smaller and larger limits (20 and 50 for example) This way the words would show up ok in wider spaces like the middle section or the forum itself, and not break the small boxes. In Finland we have a growing habit of (specially younger) people not being able to write combined words together. Adding spaces on our own is not a preferable workaround. It's slightly artificial to add a space inside a word when it doesn't belong there. To give some idea on how difficult our language (Finnish) is in this regard: The very first topic that I tested, with a real headline, included a word \"opiskelijaterveydenhuollossa\". It means \"in student healthcare\" and has 28 letters. If the words are written separately it looks like a work of an illiterate person.",

          "Title": "Problems with the forum module since upgrading to 1.5.2",
          "Text": "Since my Moodle environment was upgraded to version 1.5.2 (2005060223), I have experienced a number of problems. Two of these relate to forums (I shall post a separate message to describe a problem I'm having with a quiz). The first issue may not be a problem but a change in design philosophy. In the previous version, messages were nested. In the latest version, messages appear in straight sequence; messages are no longer embedded. I've selected all display options, but none appear to display the link between a message and responses. This makes it difficult to follow multiple message threads. The second issue relates to groups. If someone from a group posts a message to their group forum, the line entry includes a link to the group. If you click on that link, the system tries to close the window and exit the system. Has anyone else encountered these problems? Is there a solution? Thanks.",

However, for this simple forum, I guess \"whole forum grading\" could work. So, I use \"Ratings\" and set the point value to \"1.\" As students are making their intro posts, I read each one, and after reading it, I provide them with 1 point. Whenever I return to this Intro forum, I can easily see which posts I haven't read because they will show as un-rated. Perhaps what you are missing is that you want Moodle to provide a grade automatically without anyone needing to read what they said. If this is the case, meaning that you don't care what they said, then an alternative grading method would be to go to the Single View of an activity in the Grade Book, and do a bulk edit (an override) to provide every student their 1 point. If no one is reading what they post, you could do this at any point in time.",

In that case, though, I saw a message saying that I could simply drag and drop the file (rather than select with file picker, which was absent)  into the resource area. I did this and it worked, including with  little bar showing progress of the file upload. But there is no such thing with attachments to a reply in a discussion group. I checked and the Assignment activity seems to allow me to upload using the file picker. Could this be a problem with the version of 2.7 I'm using, and is it a \"known issue\". Should I simply upgrade. Thanks for any help with this. Gary",

          "Text": "Hi Derek, Thank you for raising this in the forums. During our planning period, we started to scope out the various changes required within the forums and the amount of work required for each. Unfortunately when we looked at both ForumNG (mod_forumng), and Advanced forums (mod_hsuforum), we felt that they were not quite the right fit for Moodle. This was in part because we felt that some of the features included in these solutions did not fit outside of the specific requirements for which they were written for. As an example, both solutions include an anonymity feature, but implement them differently. mod_forumng only allows tutors to post anonymously, whilst mod_hsuforum only allows all users to post under the name 'Anonymous'. Both were written for the HE market, but clearly there are major differences in the perceived requirements. Neither of these implementations allowed for use-cases such as role-playing which are an important pedagogical tool. In any case, if we had decided to migrate to either mod_forumng, or mod_hsuforum, we would have needed to either rewrite within the existing mod_forum plugin, or to provide an upgrade path from mod_forum to the chosen module. In migrating from mod_assignment to mod_assign we learnt many lessons about renaming modules and refactors of this kind... although this was largely a successful migration, it took us many releases to get things into the right state to be able to finally remove the old module. Instead, we have opted to look at each feature in turn and look to improve the existing forum to add the desired functionality. The aim is to improve the forum for the largest number of users and support as many pedagogical approaches as possible. The encompassing issue for all of the forum changes that we've been looking at is MDL-39707 . MDL-1626 is one of the components of this overarching issue and is one of the most requested features of all time within Moodle. I'm hoping that the feature will be integrated this afternoon and will be rolled in weeklies on Thursday. The next forum-related task we aim to look at is likely to be the layout and UI refactor ( MDL-41773 ) with the key aims of this task being to make the user interface more accessible, and clearer. It's likely that this will incorporate a couple of the other issues (e.g. MDL-8501 , and MDL-33692 ). I can't give a timescale on these, but the intention is to have these in place for the Moodle 2.8 release. With regards the roadmap, Martin updated the roadmap recently to give more consistency and to list each project that we are working on. Hope that this helps, Andrew",

Many of our instructors had questions on how to set up a Q&A Forum on Moodle 1.9.9. When we directed our instructors to moodle.org for help, they still had questions on how to set it up. I want to get your opinion. I posted the instructions that we came up with below. Are these instructions helpful? Is there anywhere else we could direct the instructors for help? Thanks! Q and A Forum Help Article The Q and A Forum is a great instructional tool for instructors to require students to respond to a question or prompt before reading what their peers think. This kind of activity works well to foster original thinking while reducing the “me too” posts that can be common in discussion forums. Unfortunately, the default settings for the Q and A Forum need to be modified for it to function as intended. In most cases when using a Q and A Forum, an instructor should be the only user starting new threads (discussion topics). Students will then respond to the instructor’s threads and then they will be able to view and respond to their peers’ posts. When setting up a Q and A Forum, instructors should not include the discussion questions, and/or prompts to which your students should respond in the Forum introduction. The Forum introduction is the place to inform students that they should respond to each of the discussion threads first before being able to view and respond their peers’ posts. The threads posted by the instructor should be the discussion questions and/or prompts to which the students should respond. A Q and A Forum should always have at least one thread started by the instructor before students access it. To configure the Q and A Forum to work as described above, make the following changes: Create a Q and A Forum and add a general Forum Introduction. Access the Override permissions tab. Select the Student role. Set the Start new discussions permission to prevent. Save the changes. Save the forum. Add a new question or prompt for your students to reply to before seeing their peers’ responses. Add as many new questions or prompts as desired for this Q and A Forum activity.",

Generally speaking, the user can determine whether or not he/she wishes to be subscribed to a forum. If they are subscribed then they will receive the emails; however, if they unsubscribe from the forum the user will not receive the emails. The teacher can force subscription or allow the users to choose. When forced all students are enrolled; however, even in this case if a user disables his/her email address then emails will not be sent to them. If the teacher allows the individual to choose, then it is up to the student. The teacher can also go in and unsubscribe students from a forum if they wish to stop students being notified. Another option is to not allow subscriptions. You can also set the subscriptions not allowed option to the Force everyone to be subscribed? setting when creating or updating a forum.

Another option to make the forum email notifications more manageable for your students (or fellow teachers) is... -user visits their user profile -select 'Edit' tab -select 'Show Advanced' button to expand all fields in first section of user profile page -for 'Email digest type' field, select option that reads 'Subjects (daily email with subjects only)'. This setting will result in a single daily digest email with subjects only being sent to users subscribed to the forum(s) concerned. If there is no forum posts in a given day, no email notification is sent. Personally, i like this option because it allows users to stay informed without necessarily having to visit 'my moodle' page, the course or forum to check for new posts. Cheers, Chad",

This would show if you did anything else, including the exact time that you logged into moodle. You might need to sort through the daylight saving time changes, know if the server makes this adjustment. This might be \"a lot of work\" for the professor and your Moodle admins. For me, it might take less than 15 minutes, and I would do it for a student in your situation. But some Moodle admins would not.

I found the following note in Help. ﻿Note how the \"Yes, initially\" option behaves when you update an existing forum: Changing from \"Yes, initially\" to \"No\" will not unsubscribe existing users, it will only affect future course users. Similarly changing later to \"Yes, initially\" will not subscribe existing course users but only those enrolling later. Based on the above, I'm wondering if the forced subscription will also not subscribe existing users. Why would my admins and instructors receive the emails, but not the students?  Does the daily digest not work? Any help is appreciated!",

Scenario: Our course has multiple forums (one per week).  We found that some students were getting emails for some forums, but not everyone was getting emails.  When we investigated further, it became clear that students received emails for forums to which they had previously posted and not to forums to which they had not yet posted. This was due to the combination of these settings: Student profiles included this setting for Forum auto-subscribe: “Yes, when I post, subscribe me to that forum”. Each of the forums in the course was set to “Allow everyone to choose to subscribe”. The combination of these settings resulted in students getting emails for forums only if they have posted to the forum already. To fix this, we did the following: Force subscribed everyone in the class to every forum. De-enrolled all of the students. Re-enrolled all of the students. The force subscription then took effect. Hope this helps!",

For example, our Headmaster put out a Video called the Headmasters Challenge which appears very nicely on the Frontpage as an Announcement but students should then be able to reply to the Announcement. I dont want to set up a separate post for each announcement on the frontpage in a forum. And I do want all students to be emailed the Announcement, but only students who reply should get emailed about replies to that post... regards, Brad",

It is because Moodle issues emails using the student's email address, and in the case of Yahoo they are flagging any emails not generated from their servers as being a security risk. Read: http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html for an explanation. In our case, instead of using Meg's solution, we have changed our provisioning to substitute any user's yahoo email address to our college provided Office 365 address and send them an email at their yahoo address to explain the switch. We opted to do this rather than prevent Moodle using student email addresses as our lecturers find it very useful to be able to reply to emails and have them go straight back to the student. If you prevent moodle using the student's email address it gets substituted with a 'Do not reply' address that obv. can't be replied to. Hope this helps.",

          "Text": "I am no expert on PHPBB but, here are a few things that spring to mind when comparing them. I have never moderated phpbb (only invision). I can tell I am going to miss out a lot of features on both sides. It is often difficult to say when a feature is an advantage or limitation  but I have given my subjective opinion of advantages in pink. And I am not up to date on moodle 1.7 roles. I think that phpbb may have some mass pruning and user management features that I have no idea about. Moodle PHPBB Integrated with the Moodle LMS and all sort of educational functionality (Perhaps there is a hack somewhere to allow the same authentication to be used on both systems but it will not be integrated in the ways outlined below) Posts can be graded via a drop down menu no grading I am aware of Posts can be graded using a custom scale of non numeric strings no grading I am aware of The submission period can be set, such that only posts made within a particular time slot can recieve a grade. no grading I am aware of The grade can be made viewable only the teacher, only the student and the teacher, by everyone in the posters group and the teacher, or by everyone. no grading that I am aware of The grade is integrated into a gradebook with the grades of all the other learning activities . no grading that I am aware of Who is able to grade (no one, only teachers, all users - and more fine grained using roles) can be specified. no grading that I am aware of Forums structed independently of other forums, so rather than being part of one mother forum, forums are part of Moodle courses Forums are part of a big mother forum and seperate installations are required to create completely seperate forums. Users can choose how the forums are displayed (nested, oldest first, threaded) I don't think the choice is given to users. Users can be placed in groups and a group icon is displayed beneath the users icon Users can be placed in groups but there is no group icon (other than a row of stars) User group membership can be alloted via the suse of (secret) enrollment keys provided to users, as well as manually. I am not aware of an enrolment key function in phpbb but see \"The number of posts that a user has made can affect the group\" below. Forum posts can be set to be invisible between members of different groups. I am not aware of this function. Forum posts can be set to be un-respondable between members of different groups. I am not aware of this function. The html editor is more advanced, alowing table manipulation, GUI generated image embedding, access to shared images. The html editor is pretty basic. Forums can be set up such that each user can create only one thread. I am not aware of this function. Forums can be set up such that posters are not able to see other threads until they have posted their own thread. I am not aware of this function. Forum notification can be made compulsory I am not aware of this function. Teachers can elect to have notifications sent out immediately rather than after an editing cool down period. Notifications are always sent out pretty Posts are filtered with automatic linking to glossary entries, module names, and media players. I am not aware of this kind of flitering in phpbb, but some forums seem to have simlar (e.g. experts exchange forums are filtered to provide links to advertisers). Users can enrol only in forums and recieve all notifications of new threads posted to that forum. This is one of the biggest complaints about the Moodle forums but the only subscribe to forums, in-for-a-peny-in-for-a-pound style may be one of Moodle's most powerful featurers. Users can enroll and recieve notifications on a per thread basis (other than administrators). The fine grained ability of PHPBB is probably often an advantage, but the \"inability\" to turn off notifications for forums in moodle makes for a much more lively community Not possible but possibly there is a hack Sticky posts which remain at the top of the forum can be created possible Not possible The number of posts that a user has made is displayable below username/avatar Groups (and later roles) can be set manually and the former by enrolment key (see above) The number of posts that a user has made can affect the group that they belong to (novice, average user, expert...) To quote a post one must copy and paste that post. One can choose to respond quoting the previous post. One must post and then edit but the html editor is more WYSIWYG than in phpbb, so the meaning of preview would be unclear. One can preview ones post As far as I know, only administrators can (with the appropriate configuration setting) edit posts indefinately. Users have up to about 2 hours (settable) to edit their posts. Users can be given permission to edit their posts indefinately. Perhaps it is not possible to limit amount of time that users can edit their posts and so either they can or they can not. Only the single post to which one is responding is displayed. The whole thread is displayed in rerverse order below the response, to that one can look back through all the posts in the thread as one writes ones response. I don't think that this can be done (but inventive use of roles or groups may be able to achieve it) Threads can be closed but left visible. Threads only have titles but: This is a subtitle -- can be used. Threads have subtitles There are no signatures but one can paste on it. Users can set a signature which is automatically appended to all their posts. A lot more could be added to the above list. There are a lot of features that Moodle and phpbb have in common such as... Authentication Site/forum policy disclaimers Searching (by title, forum, user, etc - perhaps moodle allows more fine grained searches) Attachments Moving threads",

Subtle point: I'd probably have a scale like Not achieved/Achieved/Merit and use one of the grades to indicate I have seem the post but for some reason it is not a 'pass' Scenario 2 You want students to post interesting articles they have found in a journalism course.  But sometimes you know the article is there in the forum but cannot find it. === REPORT B Attachments list: Report showing attachments in the forum Name (Sort by name) | Last access | Attachments (sort by name) | Type (Sort by type) > === Use the Scenario 3 You have 47 students.  You require one post in the forum as an assessed task.  Some do 3 or 4 posts.  Ideally you need some sort of way to see who has and has not respondes. You may like to check to see who has NOT posted and send them a reminder. Lets say you set up a scale Merit Achieved Not yet achieved The report could be: === REPORT C Participant list for forum [Dropdown with grades] Tick box | Name | Last visit | Grade > Button email all selected === Run REPORT C, select Not Yet achieved, Click \"select all\" Email all the students. Scenario 4 You just want to know a few statistics about your Q&A forum === REPORT D Statistics Name | Last Visit | # of Posts (Replies) | # of Discussions Started | Total > === Scenario 4 You have 1200 students in a MOOC.  You want to know who has posted and not had a reply. === REPORT E Discussions with no reply Checklist | Poster | Subject | Link to Post > === Lets say you want to really get into new territory.  We could add a dropdown at the bottom like this",

          "Text": "Hello -- I know this we discussed a while ago and there is some discussion of this topic in the bug tracker, but I am trying to determine if there is an easy way to start grading forums by cumulative points instead of by average. I know that some people have expressed that this is perhaps not educationally good because it promotes quantity over quality. However, the current system only promotes quality of one post and discourages extra discussion. When I rate the forum, I like to give every post a grade so that I know I read that post. So, if I student posts two good posts that get a 13/15 and a 14/15 but then just post a simple reply that I give a 0 to, then they end up with a 9/15 which is not a good grade. I would like to be able to set the maximum points at 15 and give a post a grade of like 5, so if a kid sends in 3 good posts, 4/15, 5/15. 4/15 they get a 13/15 which is more representative. I have seen a few patches for 1.9, but I would like to start doing this now. There is a way I saw where someone edited forums.php, but I don't have that power. Anyway, is there a way to accomplish what I am seeking via either some add-on or via a custom scale or some other method. I have installed the 1.9 beta 4 on an extra site, but I don't see an option in teh grade book or in the forum about this.",

The patch should provide teachers with the ability to use sum, count, max, min, or average (the current default). I'm not sure what your time frame is but you may want to consider grading the forums and then updating the code once the changes get committed. Once you change to type of scoring, it should then recalculate the grades for that forum discussion. Peace - Anthony",

We also give parents access to view courses. In each course we have teachers create a forum for homework and then auto enroll members of the course. This way everyone receives an email about homework requirements on the day it is posted. For parents who have 2 or more students in MS/HS this can mean receiving 20+ emails a day. Is there a way to turn that into a single digest? Or is there a way to pull all the forum posts to a single module on their homepage so they can go to a single place to check all homework for themselves as a student or for all their children as a parent? I'd be happy to upgrade our instance to a different version if necessary. Thanks for your input.",

Our courses are rolled over in advance of teaching, with a start date in the future, the courses are hidden, no students enrolled but staff are enrolled in order to work on the course etc. Staff get notifications from each announcement forum on each course. The default is auto subscription and I don't want to change this as we want students to get the notifications from announcements. We are being asked by staff if there as a way to stop them receiving notifications from announcement forums before the course starts. I advised that forum subscription settings can be turned off until such time as the course is live, but  this is not a solution that is acceptable to staff as it would rely on remembering to turn it back on again. So, my question is - if the forum availability is set to a future date would that stop notifications going out? That's the only other solution I can think of without changing subscriptions (as that approach would rely on staff remembering to re-enable it when they do want to see the notifications). Or does anyone else have a solution I haven't thought of? I'd welcome any input please. Thank you.",

Therefore, I would like to implement some sort of  forum that would be accessible to all students enrolled in any classes, but still be password protected from outsiders. As far as I can tell, the only way to implement something like this now would be to create another course for the \"student lounge\" and make it \"social\" and then enroll every student enrolled in other courses in it. Am I correct? Is there another way to do this that would clearly tag it as a social forum separate from courses?",

Right now, I have to remember to modify the discussion settings after the deadline has come, by manually setting \"Discussions and replies are allowed\" to \"No discussions, no replies.\" Currently, there is a function to allow evaluations until a specific date, but that does not address the problem completely since 1) there is currently no visible notice of when this deadline is, and 2) it doesn't cut off the flow of contributions, which subscribers might find annoying. What I would like to propose is that the current 3-way choice, Discussions and replies are allowed No discussions, but replies are allowed No discussions, no replies be expanded to, Discussions and replies are allowed",

This will export all posts, including questions and responses, as a spreadsheet that can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets. Use a third-party plugin: There are several third-party plugins available for Moodle that allow you to export forum data in various formats, such as PDF or XML . One example is the \"Forum posts report\" plugin, which generates a report of all forum posts that can be exported in various formats. Backup and restore the forum: You can also backup the entire Moodle course, including the forum, and restore it in a new course shell. This will preserve all forum questions and responses, and allow you to access them in the future.",

          "Text": "How to achieve Prevention of New Threads in Moodle Forum? (To remove the \"Add a new discussion\" link on the students' pages) For some standard discussions, you may want to limit students to replying to specific threads rather than have them post new threads. For instance, you might want them to choose one of two or three topics to reflect upon. If you don't control their ability to add new threads, the forum can be somewhat chaotic, with students adding topics willy-nilly. Instead, you can add a post for each topic and then eliminate the \"Add a new discussion\" link for students, allowing them only to respond to your initial threads. To remove the \"Add a new discussion\" link on the students' pages, you'll assign a No New Threads role to your students. How to do it?",

We have a few separate catagories with forums that only a few groups of our staff use (for example a catagory French for the teachers who teach French). The problem is that I have to manually enroll all users to all different forums, because I don't want to subscribe all users to all forums in that category. I tried making groups in the course, and setting the activity to that group only but everyone is still listed in the e-mail listing and will probably receive an e-mail (even though they don't have access to the forum. I'd rather not create a course for the communication of each type of communication group, so... I came here for advice. In short: is there a way to make a group subscribe to a forum? I'd install a plugin to sync that group to a site cohort too. Thanks in advance!",

          "Text": "Hi Bruno, This is actually very easy to implement. At the moment you have created groups for each of the study groups, and presumably placed users within these groups. When you create your forum, just set the Group Mode (in Common Module Settings) to \"Separate Groups\". I would recommend that you also create a Grouping of your various groups, which you can then select at the same time as the group mode. Groupings are designed to bring together a collection of related groups to be used in an activity. For example, you might have a piece of group work where your students are expected to work together as a team and submit a brief of their work. They may want to discuss that work in a forum, and then several weeks later they submit the final product in an assignment . To do so, you can create 5 groups for your students for this activity. You would create a single grouping containing all five of these groups. You can then select this Grouping (of groups) when setting up the assignments and forums for your group work. Later on, you place students in a different set of groups for a new piece of group work. You would create your new groups, and new grouping for this. If you had not created and used the groupings, both activities would see every group in the course, which can quickly become confusing to students. Andrew",

You can turn on post ratings, however, which makes it easy to grade each individual post.

You may choose to give recognition for prior learning this way.

These fail codes come from lib/classes/message/inbound/address_manager.php and are a bitwise addition of a number of fail codes. In this case, you have a failcode of 10, which is a bitwise addition of: const VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_HANDLER = 2; and const VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_DATAKEY = 8; This is a bit of an unusual one. Essentially it looks like the address was generated, but before it was used, something changed about your system - maybe you reset and repeated an upgrade on your test site? Andrew",

I can confirm that nothing changed between adding the forum post, Moodle sending the subscription emails, the student replying, and Moodle retrieving the reply. It is possible that my test email server is breaking the text of the emails in some way, but I'm not sure if this is the case. Attached is the raw email message sent to a test student account (student01.gz) and the reply sent from the student account to the mailbox that Moodle is configured to retrieve emails from (moodleadmin.gz). Could you take a look and see if anything odd jumps out at you? Otherwise any further thoughts on where I should be looking for what is going wrong? Many thanks for you assistance. -Corey",

According to RFC-5321, \n```text\nThe local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case sensitive.\nTherefore, \nSMTP\n implementations MUST take care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts.\n```\n I'd say that this would be the first thing to double-check.

In the meantime I've switched to Roundcube , and I can confirm that everything is working as expected. The issue that I had was caused by the email address being transformed to lowercase.

We're using moodle for a single course on information security and the director wanted to make the format as simple as possible, with the least amount of links for anyone to get confused over.  It's not a major concern, it was just a request from upper management. While we're on the subject of things not recommended, is there anyway to disable the link to view a users profile? ie. clicking on a user's name takes you to their profile. Thanks again, Chuck",

I compared settings for the forum that worked and this one that does not. The settings all appear to be the same. No groups, no restrictions. Any ideas?

I tried searching the doc but keywords are unspecific enough that it doesn't help. And the main help docs explain the different formats without explaining how to switch from one to another. Is this a version specific issue? My institution recently upgraded and it looks like we're now using the same version as this one.",
