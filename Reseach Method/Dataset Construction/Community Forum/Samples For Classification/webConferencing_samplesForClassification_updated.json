          "Text": "Hello, I am having a problem with the BBB extension in Moodle management. The conference room plug-in is installed and working on the platform I use. However, even when I enable the waiting room option, so that students can only enter when authorized, they still have free access to the platform. As soon as I start a session as an administrator, they enter the room directly, without my mediation. I have already checked all the settings (I enabled students to only have access to the room as participants), but the waiting room still does not work. Would anyone know if this is due to a lack of an important update by the platform administration or if the waiting room option has actually been disabled in the latest version of the system? Has anyone else encountered this same problem? Thanks to everyone for their attention. Best regards, Egon",

We have created a tracker for this issue: https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-85873 and would be great to get some input /insights from others. the issue user experience: As a teacher I have enabled the Guest Access in my BBB activity. I shared the Guest link with my participants so they can easily access the BBB session. Some of my participantes have an account on our LMS, but are not part of the course. BUt are allowed to follow the session. When the participants is logged into Moodle LMS, and use the link. The username is automatically filled in. When they fill in the guesst password they see the notification “required” at Guest Username. Our proposed solution Modify the logicto only mark the username field as 'readonly' and 'disabled' if the user is both logged in AND has access to the course. If the user is logged in but does not have access to the course, the field should remain editable. (Please be-aware of Password managers) what we do now As a temporary workaround we added a Javascript to the addiontal HTML . The script is placed in the tracker. Looking forward to your thoughts on this. Gemma",

The newer duration-based method gives percentage credit based on the duration of attendance. The newer method is complicated, because it relies heavily on the data that is available in Zoom and matching up the attendee information with the Moodle user information is not always exact, so manual editing may be needed in varying amounts depending on how the Zoom meetings and the Zoom plugin activities are configured. Here is the grading method help text: Choose the method to use when grading student participation. Upon entry: the student receives full marks (max grade) when they click to join the meeting in Moodle. Attendance duration: the student receives a score based on the percentage of their meeting attendance compared to the total meeting duration. Notes regarding Attendance duration method:",

Perhaps it will also work for others: I think that the BBB plugin accesses the BBB server when deleting the courses in order to delete the recording there as well. Our old server data is still stored in the Moodle backend (bigbluebuttonbn_server_url), but the server no longer exists. In my opinion, this causes the error message in Moodle and the course can therefore not be deleted. Our solution is as follows: we still have a server URL and the token of an old BBB test instance that is still running. We have entered this URL and token in the backend. Now the courses can also be deleted - even if the recordings do not exist on this test server. At least it works for us. best regards, Anton",

Part 1 is fine as when I switch away from test-moodle and instead use test-install with the default secret, I am am able to launch the room just fine. For step two, the URL is fine as I am doing an exact copy/paste from the default (I tried both http and https just in case) When I get to step 3, everything goes off the rails. It seems as if the shared secret does not exist. I am given a shared secret in the setting box, but there seems to be no matching shared secret on the server itself. Running the command 'bbb-conf --secret\" returns the error that bbb-conf does not exist. Following https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html#api-security-model I can neither retrieve nor reset the salt due to bbb-conf being not available. Accessing the server directory shows that neither bigbluebutton.properties file nor the /etc/ directory exist. (I cant remember where I read it, but I also used wget to make sure I am able to connect to the server and that was ok) Any clues as to what I may have done wrong? Why bbb-web.properties file is missing? Where could I find it? Is there any way to recreate it? \n```text\nwget\n```",

I am using the 'free tier' service from blindside networks that comes as a default included with Moodle. Since I am only using moodle for 1-on-1 tutoring (and sometimes demoing it for schools) this is fine for my needs. Part of my confusion was from trying to run the commands on my web-host and not understanding that the BBB server was on blindside networks and not my own web server. Since I last posted, I tried out various short term trials of hosting companies, including biggerbluebutton and higheredlab and both are able to launch a room totaly fine. And as I said before, running blindside networks 'test' server also works fine. It very much seems as if blindside networks has discontinued their 'free tier' services but never anounced it. Everything I read still seems to indicate that using the defaults for Moodle 4.0 and BBB would still let me conect to the blindside networks free service, but in practice I simply cant conect.",

I working with Moodle for a while, and recently I found myself with the challenge of integrating a webinar solution to use with our active students but also graduates. We're launching \"webinars\". Today we are integrated with Zoom Webinars, but I want to test a Webinar platform like \"WebinarJam\" becuase it generate less friction with no download requeriments, and also has some interactive polls, multiple hosts, etc. Does anyone by any chance have experience working with WebinarJam or a similar tool? I was also looking StreamYard, but it's just a virtual studio that i wasnt able to find integrations with Moodle. Thanks in advance.",

          "Text": "Hi All, I'm at my witts end here! After 18 months of successful running all of a sudden, 3 instances that I manage encountered the same error. All instances of Moodle are version 3.9 and BBB version 2.2. We suddenly received an error when trying to access the classroom link and/or recorded sessions. It stated \"Unable to connect to the BigBlueButton Server .\" I double checked the URL and secret in the plugin settings and they were all correct. A restart of both the moodle and BBB servers allowed us to start a session again, but now it will not load a presentation. It just won't show any slides and gives an error in the BBB logs about failed to upload presentation 404 error. I'm unsure if this is a moodle/BBB plugin error or a BBB server error, but any pointers would be greatly received as I've now spent 6 hours trying to solve and need to get this up and running before lessons resume tomorrow. Many Thanks Greg",

Example: you have this setup: Course X Groups A, B, C Student 1, 2, 3 in Group A The BBB activity is set to separate groups. You have a lesson with group A and this is being recorded. After a while, the recording is visible for just the members of Group A. My question is: where in the database is the link stored between the recording and the group? I simply can not find it anywhere. The problem is that I have recordings that I as a manager can see. Neither students nor teachers in this course can see the recordings. When I set the BBB activity to 'no groups' the recordings are visible for everyone again. What I think that happened is: a recording is made for group A. Then group A has been deleted. The recording is now 'orphane'. I can see it as a manager, but I seem to be the only one that can see them... Any ideas?",

The plugin works fine for the admin who can schedule and start a Webinar and for users who can initiate the connection and participate in the synchronous activity. But I have experienced a serious problem. At the end of the Webinar there is no report in the session link . Of course, I would like to point out that cron works fine and runs the script every 15 minutes (* / 15 ****) \\ mod_zoom \\ task \\ get_meeting_reports Any suggestions on how to fix this? Furthermore , it would be very interesting to be able to automatically link the user's stay in the Webinar (the total minutes) to provide the evaluation in Moodle. Currently, if I set the Zoom activity rating to 100 points with a pass value of 90 points, at the end of the webinar all participants are assigned the value 100 (in the evaluation register) without considering the actual minutes spent in the webinar. In this way it is not possible to differentiate between those who have followed in full, and is entitled to a certificate, and whoever has left the Webinar early, and is not entitled to a certificate.

We have a large faculty that we would to have a platform to share and manage documents AND at the same time be able to have a video-conferencing within the platform itself. I know Moodle has a CMS (Content Management System) capability, but doesn't allow video conferencing. Are there plugins that allow video-conferencing in Moodle? If not possible in Moodle, any suggestions for other subscription-based platforms that offer BOTH content management AND video-conferencing at the same time that some of you know or used by their school. Thank you in advance, James",

          "Text": "Hello Everybody! I've got a problem and looking for suggestion how to resolve it. My history of using BBB+Moodle started in 2016. That time I've installed VM with Moodle 2.6 and VM with BBB 0.81. We used this system successfully till 2018 year, that time we decided to upgrade Moodle to brand new 3.6.1 and BBB to 2.0 beta. I established new VM, got fresh installation for BBB and I copied all recordings from 0.81 to 2.0. Then I switched off old 0.81 BBB and tested communication of Moodle 2.6 with new BBB server 2.0 and everything worked fine. That time we decided to save time and let both Moodle (old one 2.6 and new one 3.6.1) worked with one instance of BBB 2.0. I was going to move my courses alog with recordings of the old Moodle instance 2.6 to the new one 3.6.1 later and I supposed it should be easy for me, but I mistaken... So I adjusted my firewall and two different Moodle web-sites worked on different ports fine. Untill I decided to upgrade BBB to the latest 2.2 release. The reason was Adobe Flash EOL and I wanted new technologies like HTML5 client, using it on mobile phones and all the new features which appeared in BBB since my last upgrade. I did that upgrade the same way as before - just made fresh installation using BBB-conf script and copied all my folders with recordings to the new VM. Then I set up new Internet connection, because BBB required wide broadband channel, and I changed IP, readjust everything, domain name, firewall and so on. Finally I tested it with new Moodle instance - everything worked fine! I was glad till the moment I tested old Moodle instance 2.6 - it was unsuccessful. Of course I changed secret key (aka SALT), but I din't know should I change URL (I left it the same, because I didn't change domain name, only adjusted new IP in DNS records). Summarizing all up-mentioned my question is: \"Does somebody know the way to transfer courses as well as lists of BBB recordings which belong to them from old 2.6 Moodle instance to new 3.6.1\" I've tried it today and it transfered with empty list of recordings, only other kind of standard Moodle plugins and other content... The problem is that old 2.6 Moodle also lost all recording lists... I am in despair! Please suggest any workable way to resurrect my webinars! Thanks in advance!",

Since it is BBB related you may be better off by asking in the bigblubutton-dev google group. But, you are correct. The recording processor is a single thread process and that is exactly what happens when meetings are to big or the server is processing too many. There have been plans over the years of re-implementing the recording processor but stability and features on the core components always trump this initiative. Let's remember though that the single server deployment is not meant to be run at high scale. In that spirit, and if you don't want to write your own recording processor (which is what every single company in BBB ecosystem is doing for scaling their clusters), you could have multiple bigbluebutton servers under Scalelite. You would not gain speed and compute power by spreading meeting, therefore recording processing between servers, but at the same time, you would increase your capacity for live sessions.",

If I don't load a\nprevious presentation, it shows the default without problem and if I\nopen the session I can load presentations as well without problem. But\nif I use the preload presentation function in the edition of the created\nroom then it does not show anything, neither the presentation I loaded\nnor the presentation by default.

The import script is specific to scalelite and just copies the completed published recordings from individual BBB servers to the central scalelite server. The script is here if you have scalelite - /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts I've updated our BBBBN plugin to 2.3.4 and moodle to 3.9 today and all is working correctly for us so don't think the plugin is the culprit. Are you using scalelite or is it a single BBB instance? Are any recordings being published? They can start to take days if you stick with webm format and have a lot of sessions on the go. In our busiest period (we had 4 BBB servers and rang between 400-600 users across them with 5-10 meeting, only one webcam showing on each meeting thankfully) I had to change to mp4 (which also made my IOS users happy) to get recordings showing up in anything like a sensible timeframe. Have you used the bbb-record command? Used with --watch it will at least show you the various workers are running - https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/recording.html I also used to fish around the /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/ folder, ls -ltr will show latest recordings at bottom which can help diagnose problems. If you haven't signed up to the BBB google groups I would recommend it. I have fixed most problems with a combination of these moodle forums with the google groups.",

If it does can I install it in the same VPS? We want the institution to completely use Moodle without the need to go outside it. I did consider zoom but it seems we will need to take a license for each teacher then. Any Suggestions?? would appreciate the help here. Thanks in advance",

Since the recording is in reality hosted by BBB, that would require a better player able to track the progress and to report back to Moodle. Then and only then, the plugin could be extended for such capability. The only event that can be tracked right now is when the users click on the playback recording link. That generates a Moodle event that could potentially be used as part of a report. No, which report?, that is the part I don't know. How do you normally track activity in other plugins or activities ?

We also have BBB plugin from our moodle server configured to connect to this server for recording.  I have admin access to both the servers. Using BBB from moodle, I conducted an online class for my students, in which I taught using a presentation uploaded to BBB.  This session was recorded. After the session, I am able to view the recording and play it from moodle. But, I am not getting an option to download the video (containing both the presentation and the speaker view) .  If I right-click on the video of myself speaking, the speaker video alone is downloadable, without the presentation. The download feature of the entire session is important, because the video will be auto-removed from the server after two weeks and my students need the recording downloaded by then, for future reference. 1) Is there a proper BBB recording download procedure that can be made available to teachers and students, from moodle (for downloading the entire session)? 2) Is there a way to download this recording using BBB server's web interface? If not, what is a good workaround? 3) Is there a way to get a teacher's conference room created from moodle to be listed as a conference room under the same person's BBB user account?",

I need to move a big blue button record in another course : a course had been filmed and recorded to allow students to replay it. I have several courses in that case, filmed and recorded. But one of this course has been filmed and recorded in the wrong one. That's why I need to change the location of the video and playback by assigning it to another course. I also need to change the name of the meeting. But I can't find the option in my moodle. I've tried to change the course id in the database (bigbluebuttonbn table) but this video doesn't exist in this table ! I got the meeting id in the URL name (when I read the video - which exists in the moodle platform), but this one seems to be imaginary in the database. Do you know where I could find details of the database schema ? I have only 2 tables with the name \"bigbluebutton\" : bigbluebuttonbn and bigbluebutton_logs. I guess there are more than 2 tables ... Can anyone help me ? To change the course directly in database or to find the management option in the platform ... Thanks in advance !",

I don't have access to the video you posted, and I am not quite sure I understand your question, but I can tell you this. There is only one official distribution of BigBlueButton, although there are several versions available for production. We (as the developers of BigBlueButton) encourage people to use the latest one. At this time, the latest version is 2.2, and it is what you find in Moodle Cloud , test-install (the server configured by default with the BigBlueButtonBN plugin), and any of our servers (Blindside Networks servers). Now, that being said. If you have your own BBB server, you need to configure the BigBlueButtonBN plugin for using your own server by replacing the configuration that comes by default. And that is unrelated to the version of the plugin, or Moodle. Just to recap, there are thre components here Moodle + BigBlueButtonBN plugin for Moodle + BigBlueButton",

We made the announcement here to our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bigbluebutton-dev/34SphncjKEw/KJZsbQbEAQAJ . Here's a quote from our announcement The BigBlueButton HTML5 client runs without plugins. There is no Flash, no Java , and no mobile app needed to run the HTML5 client.  The client takes advantage of the latest capabilities of FireFox and Chrome (the recommended browsers on the desktop) and mobile Safari (for iOS 11+ iPhones and iPads). The HTML5 client uses the browser's support for web real-time communication (webRTC) to send and receive high-quality audio, video, and screen sharing.  You'll find the shared video of higher quality than the Flash client.  We use FreeSWITCH for WebRTC audio and Kurento for WebRTC video/screen sharing. The HTML5 client implements the full capabilities for the presenter upload presentation, pan/zoom, and annotate using whiteboard tools (including multi-user whiteboard). The HTML5 client offers more collaboration capabilities (compared with the Flash client) including built-in shared notes (using EtherPad) and ability to share YouTube video during the session (though the shared YouTube video does not appear yet in the recording). The HTML5 client runs on desktop, laptop, chromebook, and mobile devices.  It implements a responsive interface (written in React) that automatically adapts to the screen size.  This means the *same* code and interface is now running across all these devices.  For mobile devices there is no app to install. The HTML5 client runs with the mobile browser which on iOS is mobile Safari browser and on Android is Chrome.  These browsers support using WebRTC to send/receive audio and video.  The supported operating systems on mobile devices is iOS 11+ for Apple iPhones/iPads and Android 6.0+.  The device must support the h.264 codec (which is supported by iOS and most Android phones). We've been testing earlier builds of the HTML5 client on our test server at https://test.bigbluebutton.org/ . While BigBlueButton anyone can use BigBlueButton as a general web conferencing system, the project focuses on the needs of the instructor and student for online learning. With our announcement, anyone can setup their own BigBlueButton server (with HTML5 client as default) by following the install steps at: http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/html/html5-install.html . Regards,... Fred Dixon BigBlueButton HTML5 developer",

          "Text": "Hi Urpo, Very simple. Room/Activity with recordings, is the normal and regular room we have had since BigBlueButtonBN version 2.0. Meaning an instance that can be used for joining sessions that may be recorded. If they are and have recording linked to them, the recordings are shown at the bottom. Room Activity only, similar to the first one, BUT with no recordings. This instances won;t give the users even the possibility of recording the session. It is normally used for give students an space for collaboration with no need to be worried about space or the content they recorded. If an existen room is changed to this type, the existent recordings will remain in BBB but they won't be shown. Recordings only, Since the inception of BigBlueButtonBN version 2.2, the plugin named RecordingsBN that was used for showing all the recordings in a course, has been phased out. The reason for that is that there was too many duplicated code and it is always more difficult to maintain more than one plugin. Specially when they have similar functionality. So, In order to have an instance for showing all the recordings in one course you select this type. You can also use this type if you want to show only one recording (or a small set of them) by importing recording from another instance in the same course, or even in a different one. I hope this clarifies things. Cheers, JF",

Lets say a teacher wants to have a room with recordings for student collaboration showing a recording from a different course but only want them to have meetings that  should not be recorded. You may argue that students won't have access to start/stop recordngs anyways, but they could if you want to give them moderator capabilites. I know, the convinations are endless, but this is the thing, this plugin has been growing in features and capabilities based on user requests. What does't make much sense to you may be the only way to solve someone else problem. My advice is always to look for the settings that will work for you particular use cases and try to set them up by default, this way your users don't have to be worried for too many combinations. I would say that in your case, if you prefer no to see the checkbox but still want to have all the meetings with the option for being recorded, add this to your config.php $CFG->bigbluebuttonbn['recording_default'] = 1; $CFG->bigbluebuttonbn['recording_editable'] = 0; I hope this helps.

For restricting access to a room to some users (including teachers) you could use groups and to use an special role for those teachers (non-editing teacher may be used, but I would rather create a custom one for that particular use case. Lets call it TA). Then you enroll the TAs into the course/groups you want them to have access, and for the activity you can add them as moderators in the list of participants. The groups should be set up as \"separated\". You may have to play around  with the options until you get the set up you need. Good luck, Jesus Federico",

The old BBB plugins were fine in that, but now the recordings are integrated in the BigBlueButtonBN plugin. A pity because there is another plugin specially for showing the recordings.

          "Text": "Hi Nick, I think there is a misconception here on what the capabilities in the previous version were and the ones the current one are. With BigBlueButtonBN 2.1.x the recordings belonging to a Room were also shown to all the uses who have access to the Room. RecordingsBN was used as a view in order to show ALL the recordings in a course. But this use case was not changed at all. With BigBlueButtonBN 2.2, the functionality offered by these two plugins was merged, which means that you can have an instance that has a Room/Activity with no recordings, it can be a Room/Activity showing its own recordings (same as the standard Room in v2.1.x) or a resource with Recordings only (same as an instance of the previous RecordingsBN) The use case you are trying to cover has never been considered, although you were able to hide the recordingsBN instance from students using the Moodle capabilities. Nonetheless, there is a workaround you could try. This would be to create a group per user in that course and enroll them. Students should see only the recordings for the group (or groups) they belong, but Teachers should be able to see all of them. I hope this helps. JF",

          "Text": "Hi, I have been running BBB successfully on my Moodle site for over a year, possibly longer; I have been using http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/ . It has been a terrific plugin, and really helpful for me, and for my students. Last week my server 's hard drive failed, and I had to restore from the recent backup that I fortunately had. Since then, all of my previous recordings have vanished, meaning that the entry for the every one of my previous recordings (about 30 of them) says \"There are no recording for this meeting.\" More than that, new recordings that I (thought) I made are producing the same message. The lecture streams just fine, I have online students who see it just fine in realtime, but the lecture is not being recorded. And yes, I did have the \"Session can be recorded\" checkbox checked (that is my default setting for the BBB plugin). I am also aware that the recordings go away after 14 days; however, unless my memory is failing me, I recall that the link to the recording is still visible in the BBB activity; it produces the \"this recording is not available\" only when that link is clicked. For me now, all of those links are gone. I have been testing it tonight, and no recordings are happening. The only error message I have found is in the Chrome developer's console, which said that the html5 server returned a 404 (not found) error. I see nothing in my server's logfiles (I refer to the server files, not the moodle logfiles, or the BBB/RBN logfiles; I don't know where those logfiles are located.) My version of BBB is 2.1.1 (2016051905), RecordingsBN is 1.3.0 (2016051904), Moodle 3.1.2 (build 20161027). My server is OSX Lion, running (among other things) MySQL v5.6.33 and PHP v5.6.27. It's worth saying, maybe, that the hard drive crash/restore may not be relevant; it may only be co-incidental. Can you suggest an approach I can take to diagnose this issue, and hopefully fix it? While it would be great to get my recordings back (the last 14 days, anyway), more important to me is to be able to make new recordings going forward. Thanks in advance! Cheers, Kevin",

We are looking for an alternative virtual classroom that can support this number of simultaneous users (divided over a dozen concurrent  sessions or more). We have been looking at BBB now and again and recently it has started to include the functionality we need (recording, breakout rooms, etc.), so now I wonder if there are any users of BBB out there who have installations of similar or bigger size, so that I can ask them about the hardware infrastructure we would require to set up a server that is sufficiently powerful for our needs. I also have a number of questions about possible functionality (to which I have not yet been able to find the answers on-line): Can one BBB server serve virtual classrooms to two Moodle sites if they are in the same Moodle server? Does the Moodle integration limit BBB sessions to accept only users authenticated via Moodle, or is it also possible to have people from outside of Moodle access the session (acccess via a link)? Will the number of Breakout rooms be flexible (5 seems to few for our class sizes)? Thanks in advance for any information you can share. Rgrds, Paul.",

Yes, it can serve multiple Moodle sites, servers an even other systems (like Wordpress) with no problem.

Does the Moodle integration limit BBB sessions to accept only users authenticated via Moodle, or is it also possible to have people from outside of Moodle access the session (acccess via a link)? The Moodle integration only allows access through Moodle activities , and only to authenticated users will be able to join. For allowing access through a shared link you would need to tailor an special link. The plugin does not provide that capability. Will the number of Breakout rooms be flexible (5 seems to few for our class sizes)? The number of 5 rooms is fixed and it was defined that way to simplify the UI JF",

Now, for fixing the recordings already processed, you need to reprocess them. sudo bbb-record --rebuild <recordID> You can find more information in the BBB documentation http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/recording.html#process and more help with BBB in BBB forums. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-users",

This is observed even after refreshing the page. Furthermore, I had to turn on UI as html : changed from No (unchecked) to Yes (checked) in order to see these recordings. Also attempted while UI as html feature can be edited is set to Yes. Another fellow reported the same issue down in the comments (January 2016).",

And the toolbar seems to be broken since the last update, on Moodle 2.9.5+ (Build: 20160317) works with no problems. As you noticed, the best workaround for now is to use the plain html UI. Although the toolbar should work with plain html, it does for me on Moodle 3.0.3+ (Build: 20160317) . A few questions. 1. What version of the BigBlueButtonBN you have? 2. What BigBlueButton server are you using? test-install? your own? a hosted server? Depending of the BBB server you are using the actions over recordings can take a few seconds to be processed (up to 10), but you should see a spinning wheel while the request is processed. 3. If you clean caches both in Moodle and your browser, do you still see the problem? 4. If you activate the developer console in your browser (Chrome or Firefox F12) do you see any error message coming? 5. Can you confirm out of moodle if the actions on recordings can be performed? Or, what about in BigBlueButtonBN, can you perform actions to the recordings there? JF",

If that doesn't work you can confirm that the connectivity issue is there and more likely you'll get a message error telling you where exactly the problem is. Regards, JF",

It appears that their Adobe rep has suggested they leave this field blank, but the test connection fails and when trying to add it as an activity, the whole site just hangs forever. This is what they sent to me: HTTP Authentication Header - This value can be found in your custom.ini file for your Adobe Connect Pro server . In the custom.ini file look for the line that begins with HTTP_AUTH_HEADER, enter in the value after the equal sign. Example if your custom.ini file has the line HTTP_AUTH_HEADER=rl-user-id, then only use rl-user-id in the module global setting. leave it blank Does anyone out there have any advice? Thanks! Erin",

However this does not happen. BBB-forums state that \"Bigbluebutton JOIN call should be modified in the integrated system which is Moodle, what is called a Custom URL \" Any ideas which file in the moodle module needs to be modified to change the join call from http:// to bigbluebutton:// It seems that all join calls originating as bigbluebutton:// can be handled by the BBB-Android app, however there is no specific documentation statting how this can be customized from within Moodle. Any help in the right direction is highly appreciated. Thank you.",

We now cannot see our recordings in Moodle. I switched back to the Blindside test server and salt and the recordings work fine.  So something has become derailed in the process of setting up the new BBB server. I'm pretty new to Moodle and BBB so I would appreciate any advice or troubleshooting steps that you can offer to help me find the problem between the new server and my Moodle installation.

If you are running a BBB 0.9, sometimes the users forget to push the recording button (even though the meeting was set to be recorded, the user must push the button to really start recording). Or for any versions, sometimes the recording was not processed for some reason. I would recommend you to do a direct request to the BBB server by using api-mate http://mconf.github.io/api-mate/ (or ask to your system administrator to do so) You can query all the recordings and look for the one you need by title, or if the recordings are too many then you need the internal meeting ID and query for recordings in that specific meetingID. Let us know your findings",

          "Text": "Hi Tina, Not necessarily. And I am afraid you need to have a good understanding of how the recordings are managed in the BBB server. Are you doing the getRecording request for the specific meeting you are looking for? The BigBluebuttonBN plugin will show you only the recordings related to the BigBlueButtonBN activities in the course it is. If there are recordings in the BBB server from other courses you will see them by using the getRecordings command, but they don't necessarily belong to the course where you have the recordingsBN instance. You need to execute the query for the specific meetingID you are looking for. You can see that ID if you launch into a session from your moodle and while you are in you run a getMeetings command using apimate Take that ID and use it to recover the recordings. If after the recording is made you have recordings in the recordings element, so all is good. NExt thing to look at is the connectivity between your Moodle server and the BBB server The response is always an XML file like this <response><returncode>SUCCESS</returncode><recordings/><messageKey>noRecordings</messageKey><message>There are not recordings for the meetings</message></response> If there is success and no recordings. Well there are just no recordings. If there is success and there are recordings, in the element recordings you should see something like this for each recording in that server: \n```text\n<recording>\n   <recordID>26961dd06cd95364e5fc58cdb3e69837609b59ee-1414094627549</recordID>\n   <meetingID>3c9da89e522728730c41bd16c82624d4-2-1</meetingID>\n   <name>BBB Test</name>\n   <published>true</published>\n   <startTime>1414094627000</startTime>\n   <endTime>1414095020000</endTime>\n   <\nmetadata\n>\n      <originservername>192.168.22.147</originservername>\n      <contextactivitydescription>Test</contextactivitydescription>\n      <contextactivity>BBB Test</contextactivity>\n      <origin>Moodle</origin>\n      <recording>true</recording>\n      <\ncontext\n>English 101</context>\n      <originversion>2.7 (Build: 20140512)</originversion>\n      <originservercommonname />\n      <origintag>moodle-mod_bigbluebuttonbn (2014101002)</origintag>\n   </metadata>\n   <playback>\n      <format>\n         <type>presentation</type>\n         <url>http://ANYURL/presentation</url>\n         <length>7</length>\n      </format>\n   </playback>\n</recording>\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n You are looking for the recording for an specific meetingID that belongs to the activity you created in your moodle <meetingID>3c9da89e522728730c41bd16c82624d4-2-1</meetingID>",

Most of the time our server is in use it has between 30-70 concurrent users. We maxed it out at 124 - once. It worked, but I did notice some mildly degraded audio, especially in the recording. Based on monitoring, we believe that was more a function of running into bandwidth limits (on our client side) rather than pushing the server to any sort of limits. We have a fully virtualized infrastructure - for production systems we make sure we slightly under-provision the underlying hardware. Our BBB installation is running with 8 cores (the underlying system is 2.3GH Xeons) and 16GB of RAM. The filesystem is running on a flash-based subsystem.",

You can use the default values and create/use meetings as it is shown in the video included in the plugin page https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_bigbluebuttonbn Just keep in mind that your Moodle server needs to be able to communicate with the bigbluebutton server using CURL. The first call the plugin makes is to validate the BBB version parsing the xml response that you usually get from here http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/api/ Also, as always, the more information you provide (specially versions you are using, settings you have and steps you followed), the easier for anyone to help you out.

By chance, are you missing the protocol in the url? >url setting like this: \" 10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/\" It should be http://10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/ , if that is the url you use to access to your BBB server, which by the way, assuming you have a n standard and complete installation, it should show you the demo page. Also, if you test this URL in your browser http://10.0.9.92/bigbluebutton/api/ do you get the same XMl you got from the test-install server? You should. If you don't so your BBB server is broken. And finally, did you replace the salt (AKA shared secret) by default with the one used by your server? The one that comes by default only works for test-install, at least you replace the salt in your BBB server. By the way, the XML response you got in the browser has nothing to do with the response your Moodle server should get. That only means that your client computer can communicate with the BBB server, but doesn't mean the Moodle server can. JF",

The first thing you want to try is of course to make sure that the target BBB server is working fine using the demo page installed by default. When you are trying to make the plugin to work for the very first time, we recommend testing with the configuration by default. If that works you can discard a bunch of things. If these two conditions are fulfilled, then you can proceed with changing the URL and SALT. Now, if after these three steps you still have problems, the first thing I would check is communication between servers. Making a wget call from the Moodle server to the BBB server can give you a good idea about what can be possible wrong. \n```text\nwget -O - \nhttp://demo.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton/api\n```",

          "Text": "My problem is that our Adobe Connect developers may have some outdated information: they're telling us that that when the Connect plugin was first developed in MoodleRooms, colleges had to have an \"on-premise\" hosted version of Connect... a $40k investment. However MoodleRooms Tech Support states that \"you can either host it yourself or subscribe to another Adobe Connect hosting service.\", giving us the impression that the MoodleRooms plugin will work with any environment that Adobe Connect is hosted in, including \"Adobe hosted Connect\" as mentioned in http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect/buying-guide.html . We can not afford to make a $40k investment in an on-premise hosted version, but we can do an Adobe hosted Connect. I understand that MoodleRooms is only responsible for turning on the Connect plugin, but we need help! Please can anyone confirm for me and our developers that the MoodleRooms plugin for Connect will work with an \"Adobe hosted Connect\" that we activate through Adobe, and that we wouldn't have to have Connect hosted \"on-premise\"? Thank you very much!",

If you are looking for community feedback you are asking about the Adobe Connect community plugin found at https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_adobeconnect . This is the plugin Moodlerooms has reviewed and is available for clients to enable. Historically this plugin will work with hosted adobe connect sites except for the single sign on. This plugin focuses on adobe connect pro, which is an on premise solution, and this is historically the only server type that the plugin supports single sign on for.",

After several years and various solutions we're waiting for BigBlueButton to reach 0.8. I really believe that BigBlueButton is the best cost effective solution. If you have the money and infrastructure for an on-site version of Adobe Connect then I hear the integrations with Moodle are pretty good, but it's not a good solution if you don't have a dedicated installation of Connect under the control of the same group that runs your LMS. BigBlueButton meets almost all of our needs right now, but for us to really commit to it we need recording and playback, which should drop in the next few weeks. At that point we'll re-evaluate moving completely over to an integrated installation of BigBlueButton. Right now we make due with a mix of a few other solutions and upload the recordings after the fact to our instance of Kaltura CE.",

I did not contribute earlier, because our classroom solution is not open-source. After Blackboard acquired Elluminate some years ago, the famous Moodle bridge plugin disappeared from Moodle Docs Plugin directory. The Elluminate trainer community did wait in vain, how Blackboard, (who is vendor of a commercial LMS also) will handle Elluminate´s Moodle connectivity in the future. Here are the good news: Blackboard did continue to integrate the famous Elluminate engine, now named \"Collaborate Web Conferencing\" with many LMS (especially all those supporting the LTI standard). Collaborate´s user interface is improved from Elluminate´s plane cockpit GUI, The Java -based engine is still the same and does include audio-enabled breakout-rooms as usual However, recording and playback of actions happening in several breakout rooms might be difficult to handle, several independant audio streams in parallel. It might be a better idea to define several rooms and let participant change the room for group work. This enables you to record each room independantly. Collaborate has a flatrate-like license model limiting the number of seats, but not number of rooms driven in parallel. The dedicated Collaborate-Moodle Integation is currently certified for Moodle up to 2.5x . I´m driving the Collaborate plugin v3.1 on my Moodle 2.6 - without glitches up to now. Please note, that Collaborate´s Moodle plugin is distributed by vendor only and therefore not listed in the Moodle Docs plugin directory. I currently consider this as a conceptual bug of the Moodle Docs site disallowing any documentation about plugins not being distributed there.",

( http://bigbluebutton.org/ ) It looks like it has most of the functions that I would need. I never really liked the record features of elluminate simply because I never really wanted to watch long meetings again. However, If you invest $299 in Camtasia studio ( http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/ ), you can record meetings and then cut out the fluff later. There are some free alternative desktop recording options, but Camtasia is, by far, the best out there. I actually use Camtasia a lot to create training videos and lectures. It would be nice if a web-conferencing programs also allowed the recording and editing features that you find in Camtasia. I have also used Camtasia to record someone else's elluminate meeting. It was a good thing since they forgot to hit record at first and then later realized their voice wasn't being recorded. As of this reply, BigBlueButton was still working out some kinks on their whiteboard feature. However, a good, free whiteboard application/website is scribblar.com . ( http://www.scribblar.com/ ) It allows you to create multiple rooms and each room allows multiple pages. It even allows file sharing and pdf uploads of 5 pages. I have used scribblar for lecture rooms in moodle as well as tutoring rooms. I love the fact that you just have to put a link to the room in the moodle course for others to access the whiteboard. It also allows you to lock the room so that others cannot change or delete things if you have a lesson set up or something. It doesn't have a record feature, but again you can use Camtasia to record a session and post it to YouTube or something later. So, my recommendation would be to use 3 programs: BigBlueButton - although I have only seen demos at this point (But it does have a moodle module.) Scribblar - Easy, powerful, and free whiteboard Camtasia - $299, but well worth the money. You will thank yourself for buying a copy.",

For the whole community, the ideal way to go is probably to keep a free open source version (based on version 4.5) of a Dimdim module up to date and glitch free. It might also be helpful to change the name to separate it from its Dimdim past. (No pun intended.) I'd suggest that it's important to have the range of features that people want, but keep the possiblility of switching off features that administrators don't want to provide, as some features won't be appropriate for some student groups. If it's good enough, it would eventually get drawn into the mainstream Moodle. CamStudio is also open source and it might be possible to integrate it to add features. Might all be easier said than done, but it looks like webconferencing is here to stay, so why wouldn't you/we? Ross W",

In fact, DimDim has most likely used the free word of mouth publicity associated with open source product as a stepping stone. Every company has to make money, but if they could be open right from the beginning about their policy, it would have helped. If one was interested in open source only, one would possibly not have wasted time on DimDim. Having said that, DimDim product looks okay to me for basic web conferencing and scores on ease of use.

I just tested it using my local BBB vm and the plugin works fine. It also works well on Moodle 2.6 which was released this week.

I've just noticed on the adobe site another plugin for use with adobe connect and moodle: http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/adobeconnect/feature-details/connect-moodle.html Does anyone have any experience with this mod? http://www.refineddata.com/learning-management/c2m I can't see any reviews for it, or any mentions of it in moodle.org forums. What is of interest is the money-line: Connect-to-Moodle provides a Single Sign On (SSO) environment in which information passes effortlessly in both directions between the two platforms so users cannot tell where Moodle ends and Adobe Connect begins. The SSO associated with the free integrator doesn't work with Adobe Hosted Solutions (majority of Adobe deployments). I wonder how they have achieved this with: \" Connect-to-Moodle is installed as a series of simple drop-in modules, blocks and activities . \", when the discussion on the remote leaner plugin points to adobe being the problem for SSO on hosted solutions? Has anyone had any experience with this mod? Would anyone from Remote Learner like to comment? Cheers, -David",

Also an observation: Users will only be able to automatically access the WebEx meeting if the Trainer/Host is already logged in as the Host. If the Host is not logged in, users will only be directed to the standard WebEX page. Ideally, users should be directed to the WebEx page that shows the login page to click on the Join button once the Host has logged in.

We don't know the calendar dates of \"day N\", except by counting them out. Days after enrolment type scheduling is a pain, but that's the job. Our second problem is that BBB seems to have a \"single activity = single meeting\" association. So over time, the course is going to have a stack of use-once-then-discard activities , which is something I'd like to avoid. I'd like to know if there's a way to modify the plugin for moodle (or if there is an existing plugin) that allows multiple schedules for a single activity.",

Your probably testing the plugin when logged into your Moodle site as administrator, which is why you are always entering the BigBlueButton session as moderator.

Off course if you have a big server and only few users, you could handle the two services in the same box. Just keep in mind that out of the box BigBlueButton has a web server (nginx) configured to listen the port 80 (as any other web server has by default). You can deal with the configuration of moodle on nginx or if you want to install a different webserver like apache, you would need to put either of them to listen to a different por, hence to do extra configuration. We as BigBlueButton developers and commercial providers never do that, not even for development, but yes, we have learn of several deployments of both services in one box. So, the use of two servers is highly recommended but it's not mandatorily required. Regards Jesus Federico",

Is is accessed via a get URL ? If so, to get the start and end time of a participant, two details could be added to that URL : an \"entry url\" and an \"exit url\". When the BBB server does a successful get on the entry url, it sends \"time of entry\" to the mdl_bigbluebuttonbn_log table. When the user exits the session (e.g., via logging out or losing the connection for whatever reason) the BBB server does a get on the exit url and sends the \"time of exit\" to the mdl_bigbluebuttonbn_log table.

Now the problem is integrating openmeetings to moodle. I have downloaded latest openmeetings release named  \"apache-openmeetings-incubating-2.0.0.r1361497-14-07-2012_1108.tar.gz\" from official web site http://incubator.apache.org/openmeetings/downloads.html and opened the tar file. Then I copied that folder to the moodle/mod directory. So, here is the problem that when I log in as admin to moodle and go to notification page (localhost/moodle/admin/index.php), nothing happens, I mean openmeeting installation does not take place. So I looked the possible directories that might named \"mod\" under moodle folder. There are two optiom: 1. usr/share/moodle/mod 2. var/www/moodle/mod But I even copied this downloaded folder to both directories. So, something must be wrong somewhere, I need your help. Thanks in advance. p.s: My sql server is in another virtual machine and not in the web server virtual machine. Web server machine connect to sql server machine to do moodle data jobs.",

This is the 1.0.8-b2 release that has been labeled as version 2012081300 for both components, BigBlueButtonBN and RecordingsBN . The main changes and/or improvements included since the previos release are: 1. The schedule parameters that were originaly activated only for activities in section 1 and higher, are now also available for activities in the section 0. 2. There was a serious security issue on internal calls to index.php, ajax .php and bbb-broker. The access was not validated according to the permissions of the users. This issue was registered as CONTRIB-3840 on the Moodle tracking system. 3. A bug was preventing the normal operation of the module on servers accessing bigbluebutton and external services trhought a proxy server . This bug was registered as CONTRIB-3844 on the Moodle tracking system. These are the issues reported by users during the beta one testing phase. If you find anything that you think is a bug or it can be improved, please don't hesitate in letting us know or directly create an issue on the tracking system for the corresponding project ( BigBlueButtonBN or RecordingsBN )",

The \"SOAP-Only\" user can do exactly what is needed to run the integration but nothing more. This does result in no need for any OpenMeetings Admin-User in the Moodle Module config! So you can better protect your OpenMeetings server from non-authorized access via the SOAP Gateway and no need to share confidential account data.\"SOAP-Only\" users can not login to OpenMeetings administration or manipulate user accounts via SOAP. It is recommended to update to the latest version of OpenMeetings (1.8.3). Moodle Mod 0.9 for Moodle 1.9.x is still compatible with OpenMeetings 1.8.3 and you can also use the new secure user with access level \"SOAP-Only\" with the old Moodle Mod 0.9.

Once we finish BigBlueButton 0.8, we'll prioritize the features for the next iteration.  To understand how we priorotize the features, see http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ#When_will_feature_X_be_implemented We definitely want to see RTL support in BigBlueButton.  Implementing RTL would require some rework of the chat interface, along with many other parts of BigBlueButton.  At the moment, we've not investigated the effort, nor can we give any promises on when we can implement this feature.

          "Text": "Hi to all! It seems that after numerous testing projects I will finally try Moodle for real!!! (extremely small scale but still in a \"production\" environment). The problem is that, apart from asynchronous training, we need to implement some basic web conferencing with (and here is the catch) synchronous video streaming. To illustrate, imagine this scenario: A web conference with 1 instructor and 5 to 10 max participants where the instructor has the ability to present a video (and also pause, rewind etc) which the participants can see in real time over internet (not LAN) in adequate quality and all sides should be able to voice comment on it. Of course, all the web conferencing goodies that, for example, bigbluebutton offers (like whiteboard, raise hands etc.) are more than welcome but not essential. Sharing a Desktop while the video is playing doesn't seem to do the trick since the quality would propably be inadequate. I know I am asking a lot (especially if you consider that it should be a free or low-cost solution at least at the beginning of the project) but I was hoping that someone could suggest a solution or workaround. Thanks in advance, Andreas",

OpenMeetings recently was also updated to Version 1.7 with a number of updates: Multi-Whiteboard, you can add new whiteboard instances, each whiteboard can have the full range of tools and documents inside. Advanced File-Explorer, Drag and Drop Interface for managing files, including possibility to create a document tree with folders. Private and Public Drive in File-Explorer. The File-Explorer has two different views, one is the Private Drive and the other the Public Drive . The Private Drive always contains the same files. Those files are only visible to the user currently loggedin. The Public Drive is bound not to the user, but to the conference room. All users in the conference room have access to the Public Drive. Save whiteboards. You can save each whiteboard instance as a file. The file is located in the File-Explorer and can be drag and drop'ed and organized like any other document, image or folder. New User-Level: SOAP/Web-Service only. For security reasons there is a new user-level. You can now create user-accounts that have only the ability to access via SOAP. In former versions you always need an admin account. MyRooms section. Each user has now by default 2 personal rooms that are always accessible exclusive for that user. There are buttons to enter those rooms from the dashboard VoIP-Integration. Together with our Finish partner and the Open Source Department of Kvarken region we have done a VoIP integration by using an applet for the audio part.

Both work correctly separately . I installed Moodle modules to connect to BBB , i have tested with Dual Code and the Blindside Networks module and both i found the same problem: the students never have access to the conference if it is configured to have to wait for connecting the moderator . With the Dual Code module is configuration is preset and can not change , so students should always wait for it to connect the moderator . They can never connect, the module does not detect that the moderator already connected . With Blindside Networks module configuration can be changed , so the moderator and students can connect only if the settings indicate that \" students m ust n ot w ait until a moderator joins \". Also, with this module from M oodle I can not see how many students have joined the conference and I can not end the same for all ( if you disconnect the facilitator , students can remain connected ) . So, in summary , with the two modules I have the same problem , the difference is that the module Blindside Networks can be configured to help in exchange for significant loss of functionality. I hope someone can help me please . Thank you very much and sorry for my bad English",

          "Text": "Hi, I'm wondering if anybody else that has EL module integrated in their Moodle site has encountered a similar issue when upgrading to Moodle 2.0. We did a test upgrade from M1.9.10 to 2.0.2. We have Elluminate Live module installed in our 1.9, and I was aware that the latest version posted here: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=557&filter=1 is for 1.9, but I just thought to give it a try and drop it in the upgraded Moodle 2.0, and indeed was unsuccessful. I then found out on Elluminate's website that they have a bridge package that supports Moodle 2.0 and is available from their download page . So I got the package and was about to install it, but on the new block/ mod confirmation page I noticed that it's called 'elluminate' now, not 'elluminatelive', thus moodle will treat it as a new install instead of an upgrade. I looked at some of the upgrade  and install scripts in the package, and I think all my data in \"mdl_elluminatelive_xxxxxxx\" tables will not be transferred, which means that currently scheduled meetings will no longer be there and links to the recordings won't appear on the block. So is there any solution/ workaround/ hint to tackle this. Is the Elluminate Live Module posted in the plugin download page still being supported/ further developed to some extent? thank you, Dimas",

In addition, many home PC users don't have phone sitting beside their computer; 2) Whiteboard and Recording : they claim DimDim can record courses, but only audio and video are recorded (with very bad quality). Whiteboard and anything else are not recorded. If only record audio and video, why bother use this product? You can simply use YouTube. 3) Moodle-Integration : It does not work! If a Dimdim account is reused by a teacher, there are many scenarios that subsequent meetings fail to start. Bottom Line: Do Not buy this product!",

The problem i'm having is that the first one that logs in to openmeetings via moodle is always the moderator, is it possible to get rid of this? right now it seems it works like this: a student logs in to openmeetings and receives the moderator status after that the teacher logs in and has to do a \"poll\" to receive the moderator status what i would want is this: a student is the first one to log into openmeetings and after that the teacher logs in and the teacher receives the moderator status.",

          "Title": "Elluminate 9.0 compatibility?",
          "Text": "Has anyone installed the Elluminate 9.0 update yet? Are there any known compatibility issues with the Moodle integration module? The reason why I'm asking is that we host our own Moodle (1.9) and Elluminate servers. I upgraded Elluminate from 8.5 to 9.0 per their directions, which were for a standalone system. I made no changes at all to the Moodle side. Since the upgrade, there have been reports of strange things when using Elluminate through Moodle. Last week, Elluminate was throwing authentication failures after the application loaded for anyone coming in through Moodle. Today, I have a report that a faculty member received a pink Moodle error box saying \"You must be a moderator to create meetings\" when he/she tried to add another Elluminate meeting to a Moodle course. Since we're in our winter break here, I'm not sure if the integration is 100% broken with nobody using it, or if these are random problems. Anyway, I was wondering if we are the first site to do this upgrade, or if somebody else has Elluminate 9.0 successfully integrated which would indicate that I did something wrong when doing the upgrade.....",
