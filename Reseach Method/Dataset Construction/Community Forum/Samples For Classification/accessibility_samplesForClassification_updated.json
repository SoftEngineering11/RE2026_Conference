          "Text": "I have studied more than twenty courses across four different Swedish universities and higher education institutions. Despite the differences between them, they all share the same weaknesses in how Moodle is structured and presented. As a student with ADHD, I often experience that perception and navigation in Moodle become barriers in themselves. To better understand my difficulties, I have also used ChatGPT to analyze how my own perception interacts with the learning platform. This showed me that the problems are not purely personal – they are systemic. Key Challenges Important details disappear in complex file structures. Key documents are sometimes reused but remain hidden in folders named after earlier modules. Unclear file names (e.g. “document1.pdf”) and inconsistent naming of resources. Long and complex course pages where crucial information gets lost. No standardized course template – every teacher organizes Moodle differently. As a result, I sometimes spend entire working days just trying to orient myself in the file structures, or contacting teachers for help. This takes away focus from learning and wastes valuable teacher time. What is Needed What we are really asking for is standardization : Clear coding and labeling of documents/resources Each file should include a code and a full “path” in the course structure (e.g. Course Geography1 → Module 1a → Assignment 2 → document2.doc ). Adopt a standardized course template across the institution Same predictable layout for every course (intro, resources, assignments, forum). Consistent naming conventions and metadata . Built-in support for time orientation A function that clearly shows how many hours/days remain until assignments are due. Why It Matters Without such standards, Moodle courses do not meet current European accessibility legislation (the Web Accessibility Directive, soon strengthened by the European Accessibility Act). For students with ADHD, this lack of structure creates unnecessary cognitive barriers. Standardizing Moodle use according to clear accessibility principles would not only help students with ADHD – it would support all learners by creating clarity, predictability, and compliance with legal requirements.",

In my experience this is not about a few individual teachers – it is a systemic problem that I have encountered at several higher education institutions where I have studied. Interestingly, I have not had the same difficulties when courses were delivered in Canvas. We should also not downplay the fact that many teachers simply do not have the time to learn the platform, do not receive sufficient training, and are often unaware that their choices in structuring Moodle can make learning virtually impossible for students with impaired working memory or selective attention. At present, students are forced to keep entire folder structures in their head to locate relevant documents. This is made worse when teachers are careless with file names, or even use different names for the same document. That is why I am suggesting a document ID system – for example added as a suffix in the filename – so that each resource can always be identified, regardless of naming. The part you found interesting – the visual “Time left bar” – is inspired by the gaming world. It could show the due date as a live countdown in days and hours until submission. Such a feature could add a useful layer of gamification, but most importantly it would provide clear temporal orientation for all students, not only those with ADHD.",

Most existing studies focus on outcomes (e.g., screen time, distraction, difficulties with self-regulation) rather than on the subjective perception and user experience of digital platforms. As a result: Knowledge gaps remain – we lack robust frameworks and systematic studies addressing ADHD-specific interactions with digital systems. Adaptations are missing – digital accessibility standards (like WCAG) focus mainly on visual, auditory, or motor impairments, while ADHD-related needs are overlooked. Responsibility shifts to the individual – instead of platforms offering built-in adaptations, people with ADHD often have to “cut and paste” together their own strategies, tools, and methods to make digital systems usable.",

A visual indication of time left for things is a good idea and also technically not especially hard to implement.

A long tagging system for file names is problematic as it will break a lot of teaching use cases and can be confusing for screen reader users.

I don’t fully agree with the previous comment that these issues are purely instructional. Depending on how the question is framed, they are also system problems. The way the platform is designed either increases or reduces the chances of mistakes, and that has a direct impact on students. Take file naming as an example: tagging systems sound useful in theory, but in practice they are inconsistent, confusing for screen readers, and too dependent on teachers’ technical skills. A strict, purpose-driven naming convention — built into the system — would create predictability and reduce errors. And this, in my view, is just the first step in a broader, step-by-step change where each course component is clearly framed to support even those instructors who are less interested in digital structure. From here, we face a choice: either maximize flexibility and accept higher risk of inconsistency, or reduce complexity through enforced conventions and guided workflows. From a student perspective, the latter is far preferable: it should be hard to do things wrong, not simply possible to do everything right.",

The way the platform is structured determines whether it increases or reduces our cognitive load and the chance of errors. My central point is simple: We need a shift in design philosophy from \"maximize flexibility\" to \"reduce complexity through enforced, guided workflows.\" ​ The Flaw of Flexibility and the Engineering Mindset ​The current system's focus on maximum flexibility, which often feels like an \"engineer's mindset,\" treats usability as secondary . It creates an environment where, while it's technically possible to set everything up perfectly, the complexity means it’s all too easy to do things wrong. This leads to \"configuration overload\" and wildly inconsistent course experiences, which is a massive, unnecessary burden on students. Our focus should be on knowledge transfer , not on mastering complicated software. ​ The Necessity of Enforced Standards ​We need the system to incorporate governance and guardrails . Essential elements like a system-enforced naming convention for files would eliminate inconsistency, instantly improve predictability, and ensure better accessibility for tools like screen readers. Institutions must prioritize a standardized, recognizable course structure to ensure a minimal learning curve . The choice is ultimately between flexibility (high risk/inconsistency) and enforced conventions (low risk/high predictability). From the student perspective, the latter is vastly superior because the system should make it hard to do things wrong. ​ Predictability as an Equity Requirement ​This need for predictability goes deeper than general usability; it's a critical issue of inclusion . A teacher can work a lifetime and still not fully grasp the specific perceptual needs of students, particularly those with neurodevelopmental differences , such as an ADHD brain . For these students, the platform's inconsistency—a disorganized folder or a confusing label—is not a minor annoyance; it's a significant, energy-draining cognitive barrier . This means that a minimal learning curve and reliable consistency are not a luxury; they are an absolute necessity for equitable access. ​",

Still, I can’t see how teachers realistically would have the time to learn and apply Moodle-specific training courses. Most of them already struggle to balance teaching with their own research and administrative duties. In that context , expecting them to master course templates and structural conventions feels unrealistic. This is why I am leaning towards creating external structures outside Moodle – based on downloaded materials – where students with ADHD (and others) can organize content in a way that reduces the cognitive burden. From the student perspective, this often feels like the only practical solution. That said, I also wonder whether I am missing something: do schools and universities not already apply standardized course templates on the teacher side? As a student, I only see the “front end” of Moodle, and it is often chaotic. I would genuinely like to understand if the lack of structure is because templates do not exist at all, or because they are optional and inconsistently applied. In general, I am positively inclined toward open source and flexible features, but in this case my main aim is simply to figure out the cause-and-effect relationship behind the current course design practices. Without knowing why courses look the way they do, it is hard to know whether the solution lies in better system defaults, stronger governance, or external tools.",

I have worked with a few that all have employed some type of \"Instructional Designer\" that was in charge of aiding the teacher, setting up a template course, and working with the teacher to input their content. I've been lucky to be in these environments. I know there are are schools where it's only the teacher working on their own course content and unless the administration had a unified system in place to have the LMS administrator copy a course template over for them to work out of, then yes you are correct that teachers are essentially 'on their own' especially without adequate training. In my current environment, when a teacher clicks the \"Course Request\", I create their blank course and then I import a \"Template\" (which is a course that just houses all the consistent visual setup of activities ). The \"Course Template plugin allows other users to copy that course template with out needing me to do it for them, so that plugin is very helpful.",

For screen readers, we seem not to do anything special for that. For example one could imagine that being marked with aria-live=\"polite\", but that example probably illustrates why we don't do that: the other thing that changes is the next thing in tab-order, so what happens should make sense to users of assistive technology.

(It's actually not too terrible in this case, but imagine it when multiple controls are being hidden and it will read the full text of all of them.) The same approach could be used for 'disabledIf'. It is possible to achieve this using aria-live, hidden (screenreader only) text, javascript to write the sentence when needed, and some new language strings.

I recently revisited an earlier post I had made and realised I needed to give a clearer explanation. Essentially, when navigating through the accordion menu in the lefthand Course Index, the current state of a collapsed or expanded item is not read out to the screen reader user. Instead the next action they might wish to take is read out. So for example, if a Course Index item is collapsed, \"expand\" is read by the screen reader. This can be confusing for the user as can lead them to think the item is expanded when it is collapsed. We think it would be better if the current state of an accordion item is read out first and then the action of expand or collapse is read out if they go to activate it. Also, when the user expands an item with the space bar, you hear \"space\" and not \"expanded\" and when the user repeats the action you hear \"space\" again and not \"collapsed\". Many thanks for your support. Hope it is ok to post this here. I am new to this forum! Kerry",

Having looked more closely, it appears that it is no longer supported, but we weren't aware. And there is no Moodle 4.1 version - we are upgrading to Moodle 4.1 in the next few months. In terms of a replacement, I have seen talk of the Brickfield Accessibility Review block, but that is for teachers, not students. I would usually encourage students to use the many tools within their web browsers to change font size, contrast etc. But we have a particuarly difficult Degree Apprenticeship course that has very strict criteria for students when they are engaged with the VLE. So is there a replacement for the old Accessibility Block? What are others doing? Many thanks in advance for your help. Catherine",

Fortunately, there are a lot of resources to help with that. Then, existing content can be checked and improved using tools such as the Brickfield Accessibility suite. Following that, it's up to the participants to work with this content and use whatever aiding technology they need. Keep in mind that most current laptops have pretty good tools on board to help with accessibility issues, that are quite a lot better than what the TTS / Accessibility block had to offer. And finally, there are specialty integrations available, such as ReadSpeaker, which can be added to provide online and state-of-the-art text-to-speech solutions in multiple languages. From my personal experience, I can recommend this tool (comes at a price, though), because it not only offers text-to-speech for all course content, but also provides a user-friendly document viewer/reader for all text formats in your course (PDF, MS Office, Open Office, ...).",

The main challenge is with the third-party external ATBar, which is not being maintained at all by its authors, at some point has lost all of its docs, and doesn't have an up-to-date SSL. If someone has funding, and would like to cover the updating of this plugin, we would be happy to engage with you on this. We are planning on sharing a new plugin which will provide guidance to users with their font size, font colour, and other display options, depending on their browser. We will update this forum discussion once it's available. As Joost rightly pointed out, there are many good tools now in both devices and browsers to help with accessibility issues!",

Re: ARIA - We use the appropriate ARIA tags/roles for our user interfaces whenever applicable. Re: ATAG - We currently do not evaluate against ATAG 2.0. However, The accessibility audits also evaluate Moodle's text editors (Tiny MCE and Atto) against WCAG Level AA to ensure their accessibility. Moodle's text editors also provide authors with the means to create accessible content. For example: Ability to designate headings in the text content Ability to create accessible links and images Provide the means to attach captions to uploaded media content Accessibility checker tool for the authored content Moodle also has a built-in accessibility toolkit that organisations can use to help them create accessible course content As Marcus said, Moodle HQ has no control over the accessibility of third-party plugins. So, it will be up to the institutions installing the plugins to evaluate their accessibility. Hope this helps.",

Keeping just manager as her role, stops all emails at once, thus she doesn't know who has submitted the quizzes yet. Keeping both manager and non-editing teacher as her role spams her inbox with email from all groups. Looks like, her being a manager makes her teacher of all groups, which triggers the spam . She is an elderly person, and i don't want to burden her by teaching something new as a work around, but rather a new custom made role might solve this problem. Please help me go about it.

          "Text": "Good evening, We have a moodle 3.9 with several online activities . Normally each of them has 3 open questions where they are answered with free text. When it comes to corrections, it becomes very tedious since you have to go to each response item per student, and when the popup for said response opens you have to click on rate to be able to enter a score/feedback and save. This multiplied by 3 questions for each student and 150 students is a horrible number of clicks. We would need to continue with the online questionnaire format since we have implemented a staggered entry that allows the system not to collapse. The alternative of uploading a file instead of an online assignment has been tried but it causes more problems than the one we use since there are problems with the students due to the format of the file and the possible closure of the activity before they upload it. With the online activity, it is sent automatically when the time is up even if the students do not click on the send button. The problem at this moment is basically the teacher's task to correctand how to make it more bearable in some way by maintaining this type of activity but reducing the number of clicks to correct. Any ideas? Greetings.",

So for example if somebody wants to make say a custom cert activity available only for users who finished a test activity first it is pretty simple. In such case you can work with activity settings here, because we have all activities in the same course. In our case however the course availabilty should be subject to activities not in the same course. In the best case the whole target course is not visible if the pre-conditions are not met. Maybe it is easier to hide activities via settings  again. But under \"restrict access\" in the course settings I can only find criteria from the same course. Maybe it is possible to go a totally different way with the enrolment method \"cohort sync\". So my idea would be to let students enter a cohort / global group automatically triggered by an event such as \"completion of course xy\" . The members of the  cohort / global group become member of the target course and view it. Can you help me to achieve this ? Thanks a lot ! Best, Benedikt",

Although we were able to make some changes on our end, we do not have access to the complete code, limiting our capabilities. Here are the main issues that we believe are important to address: Information is lost on certain pages (especially the Dashboard ) when stylesheets are disabled. Tables within courses cannot be linearized (e.g., participants). It would be necessary to add a role=\"presentation\" attribute in the HTML code. Empty and unnecessary 'h' tags have been overlooked in several places. There is no notification to alert users when a new page or tab is opened (e.g., when accessing a course file). We appreciate your understanding and support in resolving these accessibility concerns. Best regards,",

I've followed the usual steps for associating a competency with a course and a specific activity, but despite this, the system does not recognize the competency as achieved when the activity is completed. Here's what I've done so far: I created a course and enabled activity completion in the course settings. I created a competency framework, including a specific competency (A1-1) that I want to link to my course. I correctly linked the A1-1 competency to my course via the course settings. I created a 'Label' activity, and in the settings for this, I stipulated that upon completion of the activity, the A1-1 competency would be achieved. I also created a dummy user (\"demo\") and enrolled them in the course. When I log in as this user and complete the 'Label' activity, the course is indeed marked as 100% complete, but the A1-1 competency is not recognized as achieved. I've double-checked the course settings, activity settings, user enrollment, and competency configuration for the user. Everything appears to be in order.",

(see below) I managed one upload where the vision and the subtitles worked, but the sound wouldn't play. I worked around this by making an MP3 version of the video sound in VLC and uploading it separately. I then added the MP3 to the video as a separate file and set it to automatically start with the video. The sync between the vision and the sound is slightly out, but it is the best I have been able to manage. Any suggestions on what might be wrong?",

          "Text": "Hi Elizabeth, many thanks for your question. With the Brickfield Starter checks, the only way to stop it showing up in the report is to remove the “open in new window” option. We will update our starter language string appropriately in the next update. To provide some background, there are very few valid reasons for forcing a user into a new window and there are many reasons why you should not do so. I love one quote from the Nielsen Norman Group , or NN Group, an industry recognised World Leader in Research-Based User Experience, \"Opening up new browser windows is like a vacuum cleaner sales person who starts a visit by emptying an ashtray on the customer's carpet. \" Here are some reasons why you should not force links to open in new windows For everyone, bouncing people into another window is a surprise and not a good one (like a box of chocolates). This will further create problems for users with low sight or cognitive disabilities who may not see that a new tab has opened. Opening a new window or tab resets the back button in that window. Users with screen readers cannot go back to the page they came from. This breaks the navigation experience for that user. Whenever someone clicks a link they should be able to go back. The back button is a heavily used feature in browsers. If the person is using a terminal - they force one window only generally, so putting a link into a new window literally means they cannot navigate between windows/tabs and will either lose the existing site or not access the new link. Navigating multiple windows/tabs is a pretty horrible experience and can cause a lot of confusion on mobile devices - especially phones - this is not an experience you want to force on your users The core, starter version flags these issues for your action. With our Premium product , we have helpers that offer different ways to handle opening links in new windows. In short - let the user decide if they want to open a link in a new window or not - and perhaps add “(external site)” as text so they can tell if it’s external.",

We're using the assignment activity to have users upload documents and then have an assessor view the document and mark it.  In the course, the student can see whether they have yet to do an activity (it will be marked \"to do\") and whether they have completed an activity (so it's been marked).  It will show \"done\".  But is there anyway to show \"submitted\"? This is particularly relevant if they're using the app, so they can't access plugins like Completion Progress. Thanks for anyone's thoughts on this.",

It seems to work fine, and I think it's a great feature, but I have a few questions: Once a course has chosen Submit for analysis, the Brickfield analysis cannot be de-activated for that course, is that correct? To hide all the analysis information from the course page, one has to add the Accessibility Review block and use the view/hide button? Is there any way for the teacher to set specific warnings to be ignored? I do think the teachers would like to have the continous monitoring as an option, and most of them would prefer to mainly check the accessibility now and then. And teachers wanting to try out the accessibility check and deciding not to continue using it, will get annoyed by not being able to completely remove it.",

(I don't create child accounts) Named certificates, quiz, results etc are duplicated in each instance according to how many children they have. If they have one child (as defined in their custom profile field) I want the Child 1 tile / resource / activity to display If they have two children (as defined in their custom profile field) I also want the Child 2 tile / resource / activity to display However, if they only have 1 Child, then I don't want the Child 2 tile / resource / activity to display. Or, if Child 2 has only been entered to take part in an activity, I don't want the Child 1 option to display. So is it possible to hide a tile / resource / activity by profile field or hide if restricted. Thank you",

I need help with reducing the size of my file-heavy Moodle courses, and at the same time simplifying the movement of course, with pdf files, to different Moodle instances.  None of the Moodle instances are in the Moodle Cloud . I assume that I would use the standard Moodle folders, but I am not sure of the process.  I manage the PD Moodle instance myself on the Bluehost site, so I can get to the filesystem through Cpanel. 1) How should I add files to the courses so that they are in external repositories that can be archives and reinstalled with standard Moodle processes in another Moodle instance? 2) What commands would I use to archive these external files so that they can be delivered with the mbz file? 3) What process would be involved to upload the mbz file in a different Moodle instance, and then make visible the folder containing the files associated with the mbz files?

One of the measures is to give them additional time on all activities where anything needs to be completed. On the quiz activity there is a way to deal with this and I e.g. put every participant who gets 50% additional time into a group \"half extra\" and that works fine. I would like this group override feature generalized so it can be applied to any activity that has any deadlines in it. The trickiest case I can think of right now is in the workshop activity where an override for the submission of a student A would need to cascade to an automatic override for any students B who is the evaluator for A. Ideally, that override for B would only be for those evaluations that have themselves been overridden not for the evaluation of submissions from a student C that does not have an override for their submission.",

          "Text": "Hi, I would like to being able to edit the email-template on account\ncreation within moodle or through a plugin when I create users via bulk\ncsv upload . My use case also includes an automatic pdf creation with an enrolling certificate with the name of the new user. Currently I create new users for the new semester in 2 steps. I\nupload the names, email-adress etc to moodle via csv in the first step,\nin the second step I create pdfs for each student with his name in it\nand then send the respective pdf to each student via let's say\nthunderbird. This is time consuming, especially as after finishing this\nprocess I often receive additional student names and then have to go\nthrough all the process again. I'm aware that there's the string setnew_password_and_mail that can\nbe adapted within moodle to my own needs and which is then used in https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/lib/moodlelib.php but problem here is that it's not possible to include pdf creation and attatching to the email that is being sent out. If I manually add a single user within the moodle admin sites then\nthe normal standard mail should be sent as eg. in this moment I'm adding\na new teacher and not a student. (Teachers don't get the pdf). So my question is: Is this something you see a use case in moodle?\nWould this go into the moodle core or into a plugin? Would it be\nnecessary to adapt the core code so that a plugin can attach in this\npart of the code? I'm willing to make a pull request on github for this feature but first wanted to discuss this before starting to work in it. I asked this question already on the tracker ( MDL-74152 ) and it was suggested to open a discussion here for this topic. What do you think about my suggestion? Greetings",

Does anyone have any idea why it would behave this way when you're logged in as an admin. Moodle is running on an ec2 instance, and we've provided enough resources on the instance. And this issue wasn't always here. It just randomly started. Is there something specific about the admin account that would slow things down? I do get it has more functionality than the other accounts but doesn't make sense still. Is it a network/firewall thing? Is the admin account trying to connect to something that the firewall doesn't like? It's really hard to say what the issue is.",

I need someone smarter than me to help me figure this out.  My boss is insisting that we should be able to pass google auth on to external sites when linking from Moodle.  So here is the layout. User logs in gmail, then They use oauth2 to log into moodle, (so far so good). User enters a course that either embeds or links to an external web site that supports google authentication. When they click the google login, they have to type in their google username and password.  This is not Not the case if they go straight there by browser. At least that is my understanding as it is explained to me.  Can anyone shed some light on why this would be the case and is there any way to make it work?",

          "Text": "Hello, I've embeded some YouTube videos in a Moodle course, and for accessibility reasons I have been asked to provide a transcript of the videos so that those who can't view/listen to the video can read the transcript. If you view a video directly on YouTube.com, you can turn on closed captions and a transcript on the page. I've even been able to extract a subtitles file from it. However, I don't know how to get a nicely formatted transcript that is easy to read on its own. The only method I can think of right now is to painstakingly copy and paste raw text from the subtitles file into my course page, but that's impractical especially for longer videos. Can anyone suggest ways to more easily obtain a well-formatted and directly readable transcript from videos, including YouTube videos? Thanks!!🙏",

For simple filtering though, it adds a lot more clicking to achieve a result. Our most common use for a filter on the participants page is to identify students in the course. This was achieved with two clicks in 3.8 by selecting the filter drop down and then choosing 'Student'. In 3.9 this requires five clicks to achieve - Select the data filter field, select the 'Roles' data type, select the Roles input field, select Student, select Apply filters. It would be good to be able to set defaults for this filter so that a commonly used search was quickly available to users. For our site this would be Role/Students so a teacher wanting to just see the students in their course would only have to select Apply Filters. If they want any other search then they would go through the process as normal. I haven't been able to find any settings for this in Site Administration. Should I be able to set site defaults? Does this seem like a reasonable request?",

Along with this flexibility, there are many items that can be adjusted. What has been requested are \"templates\" that could be configured that capture your most favorite settings, and then can be applied as needed. So, we see the same thing with the Participants Filter. We now have a lot of power and flexibility, but it takes a little more to get everything set. It would be nice to have \"templates\" where one should set up their most favorite filtering criteria. I would like to see both. But until we have templates, I still favor having more features so that I can get to what I want to have.",

My colleague and I are building a grid system formatted Moodle site for one of our School's courses. We are using Books to organise their resources, but they have a lot of resources with date restrictions on, which you can't apply in a Moodle Book. One way of solving this would be to have each Lecture and Practical block having their own section  but but that would create 38 topics in the grid. Basically looking for a neat and tidy, easily navigable way to present lots of resources in specific blocks which can be easily added to by academics AND have the potential for individual date restrictions. Avoiding a resource dump or mass scrolling. Any ideas? Thanks!",

My question is if there is a way to automate the URL 's so that if we move the course or make a new version of the course we won't be required to go in an change each individual link. Example - instead of using the exact url for the next activity www.mysite.com/activity47 There is a way to access the url for the \"next activity\" from a moodle shortcode - so no matter where that activity goes - the \"next activity URL\" will go to the next activity in the course.

For example Some customizations we have done: - hide the side bar (too many options) and we link to the necessary pages using custom html blocks and our own buttons -skip tje “timed quiz activity” pop up. We inform our students on quiz Intro screen - skip the “submit answers” screen - users thought they had completed the quiz and left Things I want to do - if anyone have any ideas on these please share! -- change the “next page” button to an arrow icon - change the font style for “submit attempt” to draw attention to that action - this is a general rant that I think the next big step will be for moodle to allow educators to simplify the UI more easily as all of the options are amazing and allow for the wonderful robust platforms but can be confusing for students and overwhelming for educators.",

My main problem: In the feedback module I often used the \"multiple choice\" and \"longer text field\" question type. Due to the fact that this activity must be available in three languages (The Confederation of Switzerland gurantees 4 languages whereof 3 are regularly spoken), the field for the question is too short. Only 255 are allowded. When I must mark the start and the end of each languages I need 29 digits already. For three languages I lose 87 digits. The remaining 168 digits are faraway from sufficient since I would need space for 3 questions (one in each language). Recommendation: Please replace the too short \"line\" for the question with a \"text field\". Furthermore I would appreciate it, when I could design the text of the question also (bold, character, underline,...). Thank you very much. With faithfully, Stephan",

The Course Section page for this unit of work is going to be very, very long. To assist students I have created labels separating each week's work. The labels will assist students finding the start of each new topic when scrolling down quickly - simply but effective. I would prefer to add a set of buttons at the top of the Course Section which will navigate to the labels I have created throughout the Course Section. At the moment my tests have proved that I can link to the Lesson but unfortunately it opens the Lesson rather than staying on the Course Section page. I would prefer to navigate (like a HTML bookmark) to the label. The label appears to have an id - can I use this id? I tried inserting a bookmark id in the HTML label code but this strategy did not seem to work - well at least I could not seem to make it work properly. We are using the latest version of Moodle, and I am just a teacher/creator - so I have limited access and knowledge of what happens outside this role. Hope someone knows how to solve my navigation problem or give me alternate ideas.",

          "Text": "Hi Rick, Most of our students are enrolled in more than one course. The desire to divert users to a customised start page is motivated by at least two main factors: 1. the lack of flexibility of the Dashboard / Site Home The more I think about it, the more surprised I am that it's currently not possible to land on a standard course page as a front page. This is the first page users encounter - especially new users - so it should be able to be customised extensively so it's welcoming, informative and a useful jumping off point to the content they need. Standard course pages provide just this capability - in contrast to the Dashboard or Site Home. For example, for the Dashboard and Site Home, without resorting to extra css or adapting code... a. some blocks can only be set to the right column and there is no built-in support for setting  columns or font size; not all blocks can be set to the centre area b. blocks available on the Dashboard or Site Home are not universally available on other pages; if they are, they can't always be placed in the centre area (; so for a block showing enrolled pages for a long term user, this ends up being a block that runs down the right margin past any existing centre content) c. if we want a list of enrolled pages that is condensed to just the links and in a small font, this is only available in user's menu > profile > course details The equivalent to this user menu list on the Site Home or Dashboard is the Course Overview. This uses space by displaying info we don't need: in the old Course Overview this was tiles; in the newer version, using the List option, this is category and completion level. 2. the variety of our user groups Our site is used as both a LMS and a staff intranet. Feedback from our users included the complaint that it wasn't clear once they'd logged in where to go to access the info they needed, and that there was info shown that wasn't relevant to them. For new users, this problem is worsened by unfamiliarity with the interface. Options available in the Dashboard or Site Home don't allow easy customising of content for these user groups: t ailoring access to individual items of content is possible by role in Site Home and Dashboard. So to use this option we'd need to create a role for each user group that would only be used on either of these two pages, and then assign each new user to one of these roles in the system context . We have around 75 user groups for 2020, not accounting for students who are in second or third years of study. Users can belong to more than one group at a time. Also, some of our students are enrolled in courses that last only a few days. So they don't have as much opportunity to get used to finding what they need. These students can be pretty much any age. Thanks, Andrew",

There are some types of sites where you want to have a single, central place for users to land, a place over which you have a lot of control. Right now, the only object that could do this is a course. In business sites, having a single course into which all users are enrolled which serves as a general 'hub\" or \"commons\" like course for all users is pretty common. I've built any number of sites like that, and the usual solution to this is to have a link on the real front page that users click to go to the hub course. Being able to automatically redirect would be very useful in such cases. (I usually add one of the auto-enrol plugins to help with this.) +1 and voted up. Randy",

According to the Moodle, Announcements can be restored by setting the number of announcement to non-zero. In my experience: this does not seem to work. Why is the maximum number of Announcements set to ten? Is this way to convey, possible critical, information, prominent enough? I suspect a lot of people will just ignore the Announcement sections .

Dear Fellow Moodlers, So I have uploaded a number of videos into Moodle, for my clinical software training deployment, which were made in Camtasia version 2019.  The videos look great and in Camtasia the video playback with subtitles worked perfectly.   I published the videos and then uploaded them into Moodle.    However, when I play them back using the activity function, the subtitles refuse to appear when I attempt to activate the closed captioning function. I desperately need to get this issue functionality working, as staff are unable to play videos in clinical areas with audio narratives on them.  Closed Captioning / Subtitles would fix the problem. Can anyone shed some light on what I might be doing wrong and help me fix this please? Many thanks in advance.

Teachers dont know where the Turn Editing Button is and the Action Menu has too many options. Asked this question by every new user and on multiple occasions. 2. Teachers want to be able to drag Resources and Activities into a Folder. (In other words, they would like a subpage, only the subpage plugin does not work.) I am asked this question on a weekly basis!! 3. Teachers want to be able to add Sections to Courses running in Single Section per page mode. An example of this is the Grid Format. I have noted that the new Multi-topic format accomplishes this and is very good, but so many of my teachers enjoy the look of the Grid Format, it will be difficult changing them to a format that looks entirely different.",

Then over time, some bulk tools were added internally for those without such external SIS systems (like small schools, not-for-profits, organizations, businesses.) Standard competency sets are large and have always been large. So, it is has been a bit of a mystery why this was not a base requirement of the feature set from the start for competencies to have tools for managing large numbers of items in the UI.

Here's the scenario. I have a catalog of courses that each be taken standalone at-will. We'll call them A,B, C, ... Z. I'll be creating a certification course that requires completing A, C, D, N, and X. Then there will another certification course that uses A, C, F, P, and X. In the system being used now, I can create the cert course by doing a \"copy by reference,\" whereby the standalone course are \"copied\" into the cert course (sort of like each required standalone course becomes a lesson in the new course). The learner enrolls in the cert course and is automatically presented all the courses required. In addition, if the learner takes one of the standalone courses that's used in a cert course, and then later enrolls in the cert course, it automatically shows credit received for the standalone course(s) already completed. I track the cert course only, meaning I don't want to have to figure out if learners have taken the individual courses that comprise the cert course. Is this possible in Moodle? If so, what is this feature called (what do I look up to read up on it)?",

Always, when I come back later, there is the popup open telling me that my session is about to expire. Obviously, by then, when I click Extend session, I then get then error telling me that my session has expired. This is silly and annoying. Clearly, how it should work is: When you get to the warning time, then the pop-up appears at present. And, if you click Extend session before it fully expires, then that also works like it does now. However (and this is the new bit) if you actually get to the time when the session expires, then the contents of the dialogue should automatically change to say that your session has expired. That could give two options, 'Log in again', or, if you have unsaved data on the current page (which, since we have form-change-checker, we can know with some convidence) there should be a 'Close dialogue' button, so you can copy-and-paste any data you want to save before you log in.

There are also many types of activities they need to complete. It would be helpful if the names of students locked in place on the left when scrolling across the activities, and if the scroll bar at the bottom was set so that you didn't have to go all the way to the bottom of the page to scroll to the right. The problem I have is trying to track who is actually doing what without printing the report on an Excel spreadsheet.  Many times I've had to count down the lines to determine where the student is on the report, and then go to the bottom of the report to scroll across to see what they still need to complete.  When I reach the far right I then have to count down the rows to assure I've got the right person. It's somewhat easier if I pull out a small number of student, for example last name beginning with \"A\", but if the name begins with \"S\" it becomes a lot harder as there are so many of them. Just a suggestion - thank you for all the work you do, and the many improvements you've already made. Melanie",

There are a couple of problems, though: - Simple dots (like for an i-dot) aren't displayed. I always have to draw little lines. - The plugin continually saves the draft after each stroke, resulting in many messages and bad responsibility - There doesn't seem to be an \"undo\" button and no erasor so if I want to delete an annotation I have to click on each seperate stroke and the trashcan. This is not really practicable. Am I doing something wrong or is this functionality simply not meant to be used with handwriting? If the second is true, is there some kind of plugin that does this better or is the only way to download the files and annotate in a PDF reader? Another question, not directly related: There's no possibility for inline typed text annotations, right? They always get displayed at the end of the document? Thanks, Tobias",

One thing we are looking for is a way to ensure active student engagement.  I am aware of the Analytics module, but we are looking for a more active way of ensuring student engagement in their classes. Currently we have a custom module that requires students to take a quiz prior to gaining access to each of their enrolled classes. The content on the quiz is basic university based information.  The way is currently works is they are a guest in the class. they take the quiz and their role is changed to student. As a guest they do not have access to the course material, it just holds them in the participant list. and adds to class to their class list. I realize that things may nor work the same with Moodle but we are looking for some sort of gate activity that will help us verify active participation. So is anyone doing something similar to this or are you aware of any plug-ins that will help us accomplish this Just a note. I am new at this institution and worked with Moodle previous to this.

The goal seems to be to give students a bad user experience, by making them jump through some stupid compiance hoop. If you really want to engage students in the course, put in a quiz at the start \"How much do you already konw about this topic?\" full fo interesting and thought provoking questions that the course will explain by the end. Or, have a welcome forum which you actively moderate, again with in intrigueing on-topic question to provoke discussion. I mean, whatever alleged requiremen that the powers that be, or the status quo, seems to be forcing you to implement. Can you dig into it and try to find out what they really want, and then find a way to achieve that which does not tread your students like naugthy, un-trustworthy boys and girls, becuase I imagine that is not the kind of learning culture you really want to promote.",

Moodle has many features, most of which you won't use. And most features have obscure error messages. 72% of all strings translates can easily be 99.9% of strings anyone ever sees translated. If you hit an un-translated string that is really important for your Moodle site, you can immediately fix it in your own site using Language customisation - so you won't be stuck waiting for someone else to translate it. And, translating Moodle is a colaborative effort, so as well as fixing the translations yourself, you can contribute them back to the main project at https://lang.moodle.org/ . Regarding how this is all configured, and how it looks to users, the best thing is to get a test site, and experiment for yourself. You can start experimenting at the demo site https://qa.moodledemo.net/ which seems to have lots of languages installed. You can also read the docs at Language settings .",

My course is entirely built with lesson (containing clusters qs) and book modules. Appreciate you insights!",

But a few hours (perhaps a day) the event had returned, actually added as another event altogether, and now we have two repeated events, one as global and one as course specific. Any ideas on why this would be happening and how to stop it? Even if it has some development implications, I would be interesting to follow the lead. Thanks!",

Import course doesn't transfer student data, so all you copy is just the set up activities and the course layout. From 3.9 onwards (May 2020), the intention is to have a separate 'copy course' functionality. When you copy a course through the import functionality, you can set an end date or completion date on the old course, have it accessible for reference only. If you'd like to 'freeze' the course, you can use the experimental feature 'freeze context ', found in Site admin > Development.",

This is what we have found, please correct us if we have got it wrong: There is no default setting to allow group messaging on course (or system) level The course manager/teacher has to activate the ability for each group in the course. This has to be done for all groups in the course one-by-one. There is no way to change this setting in \"bulk\" after the groups are created It is not selectable for all groups when auto-creating groups Groups cannot be searched and added, the way single users can, in the contacts list. This might lead to: All groups that you are a member of and that have been set to allow group messaging are always visible in the IM, and this might become a very long list. When one of your groups are missing in the IM, because that group has not been allowed to group message, it will be confusing to the user. Users will try to search for the missing group (see 5 above) When a teacher needs to create additional groups, it's easy to forget to give those the group messaging ability. This will cause stress and confusion, when some students complain that they cannot find their group in the IM. Suggestions: A site-wide course default setting to set allow/disallow Group messaging when creating a course: Allow group messaging [Yes/No] A course default setting under the Course Settings: Allow group messaging [Yes/No] The setting for each group remains as it is, but is pre-set according to the choices in 1-2 above When bulk creating groups this should be an option, pre-set according to the choices in 1-2 above The setting should be indicated in the groups overview with a checkbox The setting should be able to be changed in bulk in the groups overview, by using the checkboxes and select all",

I suppose i could create one big group for everyone and set up messaging but then it would all be public - what i need is for that whole course group to be \"private\" between members and teacher role. We have a scenario where we have advisor roles covering many courses with hundreds of students, currently using dialogue, but really messenging should be able to do the job - had hoped it would with this update in 3.6 but it's not quite there yet.",

          "Text": "I have tried to raise this as a Moodle Tracker issue but I get the stern message: Dear Moodler, before creating a new issue you need to demonstrate that you have searched among the existing issues to see if it's already been filed. Please find a similar issue from among the open issues and either start watching it or vote for it. Well, I have searched and it ain't there so I'll have to ask the community. Moodle Tracker wouldn't allow me to post this message. We have a custom grade book for our customer which allows them to click through from the grade to the assignment in mod/assign to allow them to grade or update grade details in mod/assign more easily. This worked in Moodle 3.5. We are currently testing an upgrade to Moodle 3.7.2+ When the user clicks through we get the error \"No student selected\" in the top panel of mod/assign and the assignment is not showing. I see the new built-in gradebook does not allow this click through action, The web service request for ListParticipants now contains the attribute sortable:true The affected method is in: mod/assign/locallib.php \n```text\nif ($tablesort) {\n// Resort the user list according to the grading table sort and filter settings.\n$sortedfiltereduserids = $this->get_grading_userid_list(true, '');\n```\n This method attempts to retrieve the data from the cache but if the user hasn't been in mod/assign and is viewing the gradebook the session variable will not have been populated. \n```text\nprotected function \nget_grading_userid_list\n($cached = false, $useridlistid = '') {\n if ($cached) { \n   if (empty($useridlistid)) { \n     $useridlistid = $this->get_useridlist_key_id(); \n   } \n   $useridlistkey = $this->get_useridlist_key($useridlistid); \n   if (empty($SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey])) { \n     $SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey] = $this->\nget_grading_userid_list\n(false, '');\n    } \n    return $SESSION->mod_assign_useridlist[$useridlistkey]; \n  } \n\n  $filter = get_user_preferences('assign_filter', ''); \n  $table = new assign_grading_table($this, 0, $filter, 0, false); \n  $useridlist = $table->get_column_data('userid');\n  return $useridlist; \n}\n```\n This is a nasty recursive function but again if the user hasn't been in mod assign before it might not have all the information to retrieve the user list. Since this could be called via a web service would 2 sets of results be returned? First with data, second without because it's recursive? In order to workaround this and short circuit this we have set $tablesort = false; in list_participants() in locallib.php to make it work like Moodle 3.5 at the moment.",

I am having a problem with course creator permissions. After a course creator created a new course, he is not automatically enrolled as a teacher in the course, and he also cannot edit or change anything in the course that he just created. When logged as the course creator and open the new course that was created, no gear icon was displayed. The site administrator icon, when clicked, only \"manage course and categories\" is available. When clicked and browse to the courses that created, the course name is displayed on right panel with only the delete (trash bin) icon is there. No edit (gear icon) or hide (eye icon) is available. When I logged in as administrator, select the course, and go to the couse administration > enrolled users. The participant screen shows there in the roles column that the user is enrolled as course creator. I can edit that role setting and add teacher (editingteacher) and save it. Only after i did that, the the user will be able to edit the course setting, the gear icon appears, able to set editmode and other setting options. But doesn't it supposed the course creator will automatically enrolled as teacher in the course he created? Doesn't it supposed the course creator is able to edit the setting of the courses that he created? for your info, the setting in user policies \"Creator's role in new lesson \" was not changed from the default which is Teacher(editingteacher).",

This blog on coding horror is from 10 years ago, and it addresses the problem of log-in timeouts and even suggests programming solutions with JavaScript . I'm using Moodle 3.7 (I think) and would expect if Moodle's smart enough to warn me, I could allow me to renew the token via a pop-up window or something so I won't lose my work.

Currently my organisation is using Wordpress as our sales site with Edwiser Bridge synchronising students and courses. All our courses are free and the clients we provide our courses to need their staff to gain instant access pretty much so this sync works well. What we dont have is the ability to provide a client portal for each client for them to view their staff completion status, check the courses that their staff are registered into and effectively self-manage their staff progress. It doesnt look like Edwiser comes with a 'client' portal (although it does include a 'user-account' page for students which is a start) so i'm wondering if anyone else uses wordpress and moodle, are there other plugins that could do this? If not, any suggestions on how i can possibly use moodle for this. Set up a nominated user in moodle who would have access only to staff in their organisation? I believe moodle has a parent profile. If it works the way I'm expecting, I could manually pair each staff user with the 'parent' employer but that would be a manual process and I'm trying to push for self-service solutions wherever possible since i'm the only staff member handling online learning.",

It seems like this would have been discussed but a forum search here was not turning up relevant results for me. Anyhow, my institution has been using a custom course block plugin that just lists all of a users courses, separated by category. I really like the new course dashboard block in Moodle 3.6+ and want to transition away from the custom course block in the future. But, I have a couple of usability questions: 1) For \"regular\" users like students and teachers, it seems like a search filter in the block would be a no brainer addition. Yes, they can sort by future/current/past, and star or hide courses, which is great. But often a teacher might just want to quickly jump to a specific course that doesn't happen to be displayed in their current view.. Is there a way to suggest/vote for this feature in core? 2) For admin users, the custom course block has a global course search. I hid the block on my dashboard and find myself missing this functionality. The quickest way I've found is to go to Site Admin->Courses->Manage Courses and Categories, where there is Course Search field. I tried adding this page to my Admin Bookmarks but it doesn't seem to be possible. Surely there is a quicker, built-in way to get to course search? Or should I look for another plugin.",

It doesn't have the power of Moodle in many areas, but it does make content creation easy using a lot of on screen Ajax calls when editing.

They are almost always too light, since even #777 does not pass the minimum contrast required (example and nice discussion here: https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/ ). In general, the semantic use of color as the ONLY mechanism to convey information is a basic accessibility error to be avoided. Here's the official statement: \"Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\" from the W3C document: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color . You will notice that some places in Moodle that used to have only grey-out colors to indicate hidden or other items (eg the dimmed style class), have been updated in recent versions so that they have additional text indicators to show status in addition to color; for instance, course activity items that are hidden or stealth hidden from students now do this, which is an important improvement and good practice to model.

The following SCSS selects a number of items from the course management panel and makes them bold. It can be inserted on the raw css field in the fordson Theme's color settings. \n```text\n.teacherdashboard a.list-group-item {\n\n\n  &[href*=\"/user/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/enrol/instances.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/group/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/course/edit.php?\"]\n\n\n  {\n\n\n    font-weight: bold;\n\n\n  }\n\n\n}\n```\n A similar code would hide items. In this example the options view live logs and view course activity report . \n```text\n.teacherdashboard a.list-group-item {\n\n\n  &[href*=\"/report/loglive/index.php?\"], \n\n\n  &[href*=\"/report/outline/index.php?\"]\n\n\n  {\n\n\n    display: none;\n\n\n  }\n\n\n}\n```\n When selecting links to disable, just right-click the link in the panel and select copy link location. Then strip the course id and domain name from the front and back. E.g. https://yoursite.edu/report/loglive/index.php?id=54 becomes /report/loglive/index.php? Hope this helps.",

Many volunteers participate in Moodle.org (like myself) and if I see a post that is a bit off-base, sometimes I will ignore it because I don't have the time to help the poster be more specific. I only have so much time in a day. In your case with this post of yours, you can see that both Tim and Daniel have provided responses. Having said this, there are many \"feature requests\" in Moodle Tracker that are great ideas, but might take time to implement. In my own case, I have probably posted several dozen feature requests (let's say 36) and probably 12 have been implemented. My last feature request to get implemented took 8 years, but it then happened in Moodle 3.7. Moodle's track record, for me, has been significantly better than the other LMSs (BB, D2L, C) that I have used. Piggybacking on what Tim said, I would agree, I sometimes start here in Moodle.org with a post, kind of like fishing and testing the waters, then I will post in Tracker. If something looks like a bug, I post in Tracker and follow-up here in these forums. In Tracker, if something about my idea is out of place, Tracker has the ability to \"close\" an item. I believe that posts here in these forums last a very long time.",

I know the Topics tabs are there for that reason, but I feel a user should not be so constrained - they should be able to group things into different hierarchical levels if that is their desire. And folders/sections should be able to sit anywhere on any page. The process should be: Create a folder (a flexible section closed) Drag labels, resources and activities into the folder Go into the folder, and repeat the last two steps if necessary.. This will put an end to the scroll of death. In many ways the flexible sections format simply needs to be upgraded to look like a folder, with better drag and drop enabled especially if the section/folder is closed. just some thoughts..",

They dont want to create a new Section, they simply want to be able to group their resources in something similar to a Folder . And they dont like the look of the Flexible Sections format at present - it also isn't compatible with Sharing Cart. If Moodle doesnt want to change the Folder resource - as in keep it only for Files that's okay. But perhaps creating a Collection resource which can be used to contain any group of Resources or Activities. I think it would be a very simple addition to core functionality. The Collection could either open on the page dynamically or go to its own page. If users could drag their Resources and Activities into the Collection, that would great. It could also be a very easy way to move multiple resources around the page. When I have time, I might create a Moodle Tracker for this.",

However, when I try to add an audio file to a question from \"server files\", all I can see is the folder \"System\". To reiterate, I wish to add files from the server command line to be able to interface with in the moodle software. As for the audio, my apologies, I meant to specify for the students to be able to record audio when answering a quiz. Thank you for your response, Anhad",

Poodll offers more flexibility in my opinion: see https://poodll.com/audio-assessments/ and https://poodll.com/poodll-recorders-vs-moodle-recorders/ For the respository, if you’ve set up the file system repo properly, it should show as a separate instance in the repo list; you wouldn’t access it via server files. See the image in this section of the docs , which shows the file system repo in the section called, in that example, Faculty (File system) . D o you mean you wish to be able to search for and upload/link files already on your server? The file system repo allows you to put files into that directory and be visible to all users who have permission in Moodle - kind of like a virtual drive . I suspect you’re maybe wanting something a bit different, possibly akin to the Dropbox or Google drive functionality. There is a WebDAV repo, which may work for you.

If we enrol all users onto these courses then they appear in the course overview block and they can then 'star' or remove from the course overview, but then the mycourses list in the drawer is very long, too long (20-30). So we thought we would just open the information courses as guest access to everyone. But then users can't 'star' these courses. Or am I missing something? Basically I want the mycourses in the nav-drawer to have their enrolled on core courses (about 5) and then users can favourite guest access information pages. The course overview block the user can edit themselves so it's as much of a problem. Has anyone found a good way to use all these things together without long lists in anyone place? thanks, Simon",

Surely a case could be made for the ability just to view, without the need to update let alone delete. So I'd be interested to find how many other people find this arrangement unusual.

I don't think both are correct. Reading the entry for \"Proper noun\" in Wikipedia I have understood that proper nouns are distinguished from common nouns using a capitalised first letter. In the case of  single-word names, this is quite easy and most english people agree and more or less use the rule. For multiword proper names though, there are some doubts (only first letter of first word or first letters of all words). The problem starts when people that give a name, use it for so long that they come to think it is now part of the language i.e. common. But for a newcomer these words look strange or jargon. To be fair we need to be objective and have in mind as many users as possible. Power or long time users would have no problem either way. Most users would sooner or later discover the rule if it is applied uniformly. New users would very easily be instructed that names of things in Moodle have a first letter (or first letter of every word) capitalised. And that would help them a lot. My point of view is that of a translator so I can assert that it would be a tremendous help in many doubious strings in every language. p.s. I am not sure if I explained everything right.

I am referring to the exception of proper nouns. If e.g. I create a new type of block and I name it \"Exceptional New Grades\" how should the following message refer to it? Add a new \"Exceptional New Grades\" block. Add a new Exceptional New Grades block. Add a new Exceptional new grades block. Add a new exceptional new grades block. In other words, why is \"The Activity results...\" using a capital \"A\"? And why is \"Add a new activity...\" using a small \"a\"? (from the forum's description)",

After the update from 3.2.5 to 3.3 the icons (overwritten by Line Awesome) are not displayed correct (needs some css ). I need to decide which way we're going right now. The best approach would be to take what the moodle core has, but we want the light style. When you desire I can upload some screens, so you can see how it looks like! Thanks for any tips and help!

This stuff really needs to be pluggable as-is, to enable use of any version of FA (4, 5 or newer, free or pro) just by unpacking the FA download into the right place. Otherwise it's way too hard to use Pro, which is a pain for users and rude to the developers of FA itself. Personally I'd like to see this (and bootstrap & other similar stuff) completely outside of themes - a plugin to install, which a theme can depend on if desired.",

We have one course that is meant to be \"unlocked\" after students have completed the previous courses. This final course contains a course evaluation and custom certificate. We have the auto enrollment plugin on the other courses so that teachers do not need to approve enrollments. However, because we want the course evaluation & certificate to be dependent on the other course completions, we do not want active auto enroll for that course. I'm trying the Course completed enrolment plugin (moodle site seems to be having some issues at the moment), but I'm noticing that it doesn't seem to \"automatically enroll\" the students into the course - the teacher would still need to approve. I'm not too familiar with learning plans or groupings, would this be an easier/more reliable way to achieve this? Thanks in advance for your help! Sarah Ruth",

          "Text": "Hello, I noticed that a teacher will only see group events of groups he doesn't participate in if he views a certain course in the calendar. If he views all courses in his calendar, he only sees group events of groups he is in. Does anyone know why this difference in visibility exists? It seems arbitrary. This is the code that shows all group events to teachers if they are viewing only one course: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/4bd4b46070b3906e5b1fd3126b524b9fc2ba2271/calendar/lib.php#L2084-L2090 This is the commit that introduced it: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/7fd5786e6f24db2a6c702062705e33bef514bbac#diff-3762eee05a549dc356ad7f041fdf86f2 And this is the Tracker Issue for it: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28557 To a teacher this can be very confusing. If he has events for all courses displayed and creates a new group event (and isn't himself in that group) the new event won't show up for him. He needs to know that he first has to select the course that that group belongs to in order to see the event he just created. Do you agree that this is not very intuitive? Would it be better to just show all group events for each course to teachers when they view all courses? What would speak against this?",

However, we set up course to default to a weekly format with 16 sections. Previously, faculty could easily change to a topics format with even zero sections, if that worked better for their class needs. Now, going from 16 weeks to zero topics is a HUGE pain. Even going from 16 weeks to a more standard five topics is a big pain. This strikes me as a big issue and a bug. I see the reasoning for taking the number of topics/sections out of the course admin area ( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-57769 ). However, I don't think that the current remedy is suitable. I know there are a number of trackers addressing this issue. However, I did not see an open issue to address the difficulty in adjusting the number of sections down. Granted, having to few sections is worse than having too many. However, too many sections are ugly and possibly confusing to students. Should I create a new tracker, or is there one I can vote up?",

Maybe someone can help me out with the following issue: The calendar block in our study portal is shown on the course overview page, as well as in each course. We use global events and course events. Unlike the global events, course events are only shown as soon as they are available for the student. As some of our global events are identical to course events, we want to avoid a double-displaying of the same event, as it does not look very nice. Therefore we would like the calendar on the course overview page only to display global events and the calendar within each course only to show course events, by default. Is there any way to do put that as a default setting without any manual action from the student himself? If anybody could help me with that, I would be very grateful.",

So the problem is: We have a course where we uploaded a .ppt which the users have to read and learn, and have a test which the users have to pass. There are two check-boxes for the curriculum and the test. The moodle sends automatic reminder e-mails to all the users who are signed to course about. The desired behavior would be that, the moodle only sends reminder e-mails who are not passed the test already (not checked the 2nd box). Obviously the cause of it to make the moodle to remind people who have not fulfilled the course already to do it until the deadline. Is it possible to make? Thank you in advance, Robert",

The page on which the SCORM is activated would unlikely to be able put in a redirect, as it would be a very tricky thing because of the nature of the HTML link pointing to something inside Moodle.

Version, theme, and so on will often have an impact onhow you can retrieve information about your courses. In the most simple case, you may be able to generate such a report from the database if you install the adhoc report plugin from the OU. If this is not possible and you have phpMyAdmin or some other query tool to search your database, then you will need to build a query using that tool. The database has changed significantly since the last time I have done anything like this so I don't know which tables you might need to define connections for building such queries.

The file itself is it an entire course file or just a single page of text, text and images, text, images and multimedia files? If it is just a text file, unzip it, then upload it or copy and paste. If it is text and images, or text, images and multimedia, can't help you there. Unless you want to, in your course, create a page, add an image and/or multimedia files, back it up and then download it. Change the download file type to zip and unzip it. Use this file as a shell, changing the xml code as required. Zip it up and change the file type to mbz, then restore.  (This used to be simple but since v2.0, it is not as easy as it used to be but the security restrictions should be able to be gotten around, look for the patterns for file linking.) If it is an entire course, and it has all the Moodle required xml files, in place, change the file type to mbz and upload it as a restore. There is probably an easier way of doing this, but I don't know it, based on the little information provided.",

A couple of students needed to be given the chance to reattempt the quiz, We know that you can set a user override for a student, for example, giving them 2 attempts. You can also delete a student's attempt within the quiz results screen so that they can then have another go. However, is it possible to simply change the status of the submitted quiz to unsubmitted so that the student can continue working on their attempt? If not, I don't know if it would be possible for something like this to be added in some future iteration of Moodle? Or, are there very good reasons why this is not a good idea? Any answers on this, even if this is just to explain the rationale for not allowing a tutor to change a students submitted quiz from submitted to unsubmitted, would be really helpful and I can then go back to the tutor with what can be done or a reason for why this is not possible.

It is possible to undo all the database changes that happen when the attempt is submitted, but it would be a bit fiddly to get right, and so no-one has had the time or inclination to implement it. However, it certainly would be a good idea to make this possible, but it is not going to happen until someone has a strong-enough motive to do the work. So: Good idea in principle. Only not been done before because making it work would be hard and time-consuming. In the mean time, just give students a second attempt.",

Of course this can be a process that is learned over time, but those links are serving no purpose for us and only add to confusion. If it is possible to remove them, I would sure love to know how.

Now, as for changing the file, I am very new to all of this and I assumed this file would be located in my server with the rest of my Moodle files.  I went there and went into the themes and the templates, as you said but I could not locate anything related to the Fordson theme in my server.  I know I have it set up because my course is now using it. I did find the file you were referring to in the main boost theme and even found the line you said to remove, but since you said this was the way to do it in the Fordson theme, I didn't want to remove it from the boost theme on my server until I checked to make sure I was in the correct place and doing the correct thing.. LOL I also went into development in the Moodle site itself and found the line you referred to, but I do not see how to edit/remove anything in there.  Sorry for being so novice at this. Learning as I go. Also, could you tell me where to get assistance with a couple of things in the Fordson theme?  When I use the theme that creates an upper image and a main background image, the main background image gets embedded behind the upper image and I have a dog with no head on my lower background..

          "Text": "Hello, when you launch Chrome with a Moodle tab from yesterday still open you get multiple \"servicenotavailable\" error boxes. If you then reload the page, you get redirected to the login page. Users shouldn't see this \"servicenotavailable\" error if the problem is that they're not logged in. This occurs on Moodle 3.4.1 (Build: 20180115) running on CentOS 7.4.1708 with Apache 2.4.6, MariaDB 5.5.56 and PHP 7.2.2 when accessing it with Google Chrome 63.0.3239.132. I have already tested and debugged this and found out the reason for the error: In this case it is AJAX calls being performed while the user is not logged in. The user is not logged in because his last session timed out. Normally when he opens a Moodle page he would get redirected to the login page. However, what happens here is: Chrome opens the Moodle page when being launched because that page was open when Chrome was last closed. But it doesn't refresh the page by sending a new HTTP request which would redirect the user to the login page. Instead it displays the page as if the user was logged in which leads to the AJAX calls failing. How do I prevent this from happening? Just using  another browser or changing some browser settings won't work for us as we don't have control over that. I also don't want to \"hack\" Moodle's core code as that would make it harder to maintain. Any help appreciated, Thanks",

A constructive approach to solving your issues would be the best course of action to take. As far as I understand it, your main issues are with the new My Overview block that has replaced the old block Course Overview as core. This block can still be installed and used instead of the one you're somewhat unhappy with, if you're a systems administrator for your Moodle. If you're not the systems administrator, you could point the person in charge of this to the correct plugin, so he/she can install and enable it. There's just one caution: at some stage (in a little over 2 years), the legacy Course Overview block will cease to function, with the release of Moodle 3.7. I strongly hope that you will have gotten used to the new and improved My Overview block by then and that you can see some of the positives of this new redesigned block: - a timeline for detailed information on what's expected when - sorting courses according to Current, Future and Completed - more detailed course completion details - ...",

We have an external course provider that says this doesn't happen on other sites.   They provide the files and we restore the zipped files.  We manage to put up about 6 (totalling 1.2gb) then Moodle stops. Running a course size report shows that these courses are the largest. Any help much appreciated.",

In regular Moodle course formats like Weeks or Topics, everything is loaded upon entering the course, which may cause problems if there are a lot of huge files to process (image, audio, video). If there's a timeout because of the sheer volume of data to be loaded, you may need to have a look at how the media files are incorporated in your courses. Embedded external media works better than having the complete files as part of your courses.",

E.g. no database (so mostly no $CFG), no moodledata, no caches. So, it has to be implemented with the simples possible code, and be completely self-contained. The way to customise this with minimal code code changes is: Make a function that renders your own error page. A place like local/customerrors/lib.php might be a neat place to put that. Find the place in  where Moodle renders its version of the page (the early_error_content static method in boostrap_renderer in setup.lib.php). Change that function to call your function instead. That is, right at the start add: \n```text\n// Customisation of core code starts.\nrequire_once($CFG->\ndirroot\n . '/local/customerrors/lib.php');\nreturn my_early_error_content($message, $moreinfourl, $link, $backtrace, $debuginfo);\n// Customisation of core code end.\n```\n Now I think about this, we could have an option, set in config.php, like $CFG->custom_early_error_page, to avoid the need for core code changes.",

Will the students use a gigantic computer lab? Will they use their own home computers? Do you have an example quizz to illustrate how many large images are there? Making many exams in Moodle is a frequent situation in UNAM. I would suggest you to visit the UNAM Moodle admins and developers free site .",

It's always annoying if sites don't support that, because aiming for the close button is usually harder, especially on touch devices. There are exceptions, though. For example, critical warnings should not be dismissible by touching the background. In that case it is okay to raise attention to the message this way, as it cannot be closed as easily. Also, if a modal is a form, it would be too easy to close it accidentally by touching the background. I think in that case Moodle should also keep on relying on the close button (or buttons of the form).",

Moodle 2.7 Upgrade documentation ( https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Cron ) shows the below information: Cron in Moodle 2.7+ Cron has received a major update and now has support for both scheduled and adhoc tasks - MDL-25499 . The benefits of these changes are: The schedule for every task can be configured by the admin. See Scheduled tasks Tasks can run in parallel Cron processes use locking to prevent the same task running at the same time by different processes A result of this is that cron can be run much more often, which means (for example) forum posts can be sent out sooner. Admins can keep cron running at the same schedule as before, but it is strongly recommended that they increase the frequency of running cron to at least once per minute. But I don't know if the cron.php can be run in different servers since it can be run in pararell, or it just can run in parallel in the same node since it is recommended to run it every minute. Thanks in advance, Ángel",

If you would like to find out next steps with that piece of research, please refer to our post on moodle.org. We’d love to get your feedback, ideas and thoughts again! Now, we  would like to once again invite interested Moodlers to participate in another important usability study, running from Friday 11 August to Friday 18 August (note: the study will close 7:30 AM UTC Friday 18 August). We would like to hear from English-speaking Teachers/Instructors, with editing rights to Moodle courses (or administrators who frequently access Moodle course settings), to join a usability study that will help with future Moodle development. What’s involved? Involvement in this research study means: Spending  approximately 15 to 30 minutes trying out a prototype and giving us feedback, and/or we might interview you about your current experience using Moodle. A Moodle HQ researcher will set up a remote screen-sharing session with you on your own computer. Sessions may take place outside of typical business hours depending on your local time zone. We’d like to hear from you if: You can participate in the sessions online using Zoom Meetings (which involves sharing your desktop screen and audio) You have access to a microphone and a broadband internet connection You provide consent for Moodle HQ to record video and audio of your interactions using Moodle on your desktop screen.

I've just upgraded to 3.3 from 3.1 and I've noticed that the eye (course item visibility) toggle is no longer inlined along with each item's title, but hidden under a dropdown menu, which means an extra click is needed to get to it. I always start the year by importing last year's course and hiding the activities I don't want my students to see right away, so I use that toggle a lot and it was nice to have it next to the activity. Is it possible to move some of these actions back out so that they are more accessible? I've tried both the Boost and Clean themes but both behave the same. Any alternate way to change the visibility of a lot of activities without lots of clicking around would actually help. Thank you!",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm posting this under usability as that's where it is a problem for me - but forum admin might decide it sits better elsewhere. I have courses with groups of students undertaking separate activities - lets call it differentiated learning. I'm preparing for upgrade to version 3.3 and want to fine-tune activity completion so that the course notifications are more accurate. Currently it works as follows - when students view a resource, take a quiz or whatever the completion box is ticked and it is tracked on the activity completion report. Unfortunately, the activity report doesn't take account of whether a student is permitted to access a resource - it just lists everything that has a completion option, even if the student isn't able to complete (for example because they don't belong to the only group with access). Once we move to 3.3 I'm anticipating this might go catastrophically wrong, with students panicking as Moodle tells them they've only completed 1/3 of the course activities, but they can't see anything that they haven't done. What I think SHOULD happen is that when the activity report displays, it is individualised for each student. If as a result of activity restrictions a student has no access to an activity, the report should have a gap (instead of a tickbox that will never be ticked) - and that the completion notifications and tracking should likewise only consider the activities available to that student, regardless of what else might have completion tracking switched on in the course. Can anyone enlighten me about whether this issue has been addressed in the 3.3 version of Moodle - or if there is a workaround? If there isn't a solution I'll raise a bug report as this will impact really badly on student perception of the new Moodle progress notifications if it hasn't been thought through. It's bad enough as staff wanting to check progress and having to constantly refer back to see why students haven't completed tracked activities, it'll be far worse if students are being told they haven't done something they don't have access to.

The problem is that the plugin that do exist do not seem to work (for me) and cannot be modified after registration which means all the user already in courses are not added to the cohort. And if one has to change it cannot be done. Right now it is all manual , a new user registers, I add them to the right cohort(s) which is synced to the course. If they change cohort I have to do it manually. The problem with this is that I am never aware of when a new users registers or makes a change . So I end up with half users in cohorts the others half floating around which makes them invisible to the ones supervising the grades of their groups. What I want : User registers and chooses cohort from dropdown menu on profile, automatically added to cohort which then adds to course/group. If user changes cohort (from dropdown menu on profile) they are then deleted from the old one and added to the new one. Simple . To take care of the grade loss all users are in a general cohort. Everyone is in that one to make sure all info is kept in case they are deleted from another cohort. Is there anyone who as a way to do this? Is it something that can be done ?",

          "Text": "I have had much trouble in the past attempting to implement system messages such as when a student needs to reset their password or confirm their new accounts. The fact is only by setting the Server > Support contact > Support email to an email address having the @yoursitesbaseurl.com for its suffix, will it work. And this email address doesn't even have to be a real one. It simply needs to have the exact same address after the \"@\" as your website's url. In my experience, setting this to anything else totally disables the Moodle system from sending system messages to students. Furthermore, what if, after you manage to get it working, you want to monitor every email sent by your system? Where is the Moodle setting for this? How can Moodle send your system admin a copy of every email sent by the system? Shockingly, there isn't a Moodle setting for it. You have to hack one into it. Here is how: In your config.php, add this line after \n```text\n$CFG->bccmails='somename@someaddress.com';\n```\n If you need a second CC, add this: \n```text\n$CFG->bccmails2='someothername@someotheraddress.com';\n```\n Also, you must edit a part of the Moodle base code. In the lib/moodlelib.php of your base server directory, locate this line: \n```text\n if ($mail->Send()) {\n```\n Then add the follow just ABOVE the \"if ($mail->Send()) {\" \n```text\nif (!empty($CFG->bccmails)){\n\n\n   $mail->AddBCC($CFG->bccmails);\n\n\n    }\n\n\nif (!empty($CFG->bccmails2)){\n\n\n    $mail->AddBCC($CFG->bccmails2);\n\n\n    }\n```\n This will give you ability to add two unique CC addresses to send all system emails to. if you want a third, you can see how the code differs. Simply duplicate the code again and change the \"bccmails2\" to a subsequent number. I hope this hopes someone. I know there are SMTP setting options built into Moodle. Unfortunately for me, I have NEVER gotten any of that to work. Only the above settings work for my system.",

Could this be done using a customized block that would be added to each course? Could this be done by customizing the \"My\" page so that, instead of showing a long list of individual course, it would show a program container/section, under which individual courses would be shown under it? Some users have used meta-courses to create \"program home pages\" and then enrol other courses into them, but that only adds another site to a user's \"My\" page and doesn't really help them know where to go. I'm interested to know what others are doing to address the issue.  Thanks.",

Not sure if it would be practical, but might be worth testing. Also, there is already a tag block so it would be easy to test/try out and see if it would work.",

Your second point is too general for me to understand what action might be taken and I am not familiar with the term PACR. With reference to your last point, the source code to Moodle is made available freely under the GPL license and you can install and run it on your own machines without any financial cost and without any advertising component. Could you indicate which clause of the GPL you are concerned is being breached. It is possible to pay a very modest fee to remove the advertising from the MoodleCloud service. I am not aware of the EU restricting the ability to use advertising as a way of supporting a web based service and would be interested to know what you are referring to.",

We are using using Moodle 3.0 and the Essential theme. We use the site for customer training. All trainings are eLearning\nmodules I will try to be succinct but want to provide all relative information. We “push” students into Moodle from a proprietary application,\ncreating a Moodle user record automatically and logging them in and onto the Moodle\nlanding page. Our customers subscribe to specific products and we only\nwant them to see or enroll in courses related to products they subscribe to. I\nuse course categories aligned with products to store courses relative to that\nproduct Since I know what products they own when they log into the proprietary\napplication I can push that data along with their user info into Moodle and using\nscripting and the cohort auto sync plugin I have the student’s auto enrolled in\nonly the courses I want them to be enrolled in. What I want to do now and have had challenges in building is\na method to display the categories and or courses the user sees.  I can get the courses to display in the My\ncourses block but it can be a long list I don’t want them scrolling through\npossibly dozens of courses. Making the Dashboard page the home page doesn’t really\nwork either. What I would like to do is show the student a list or icon set of\nonly those categories that have courses they have enrollments in, they can then\ndrill down into the category and start the course. I realize there may have been other ways to accomplish what we have so far but there were strict business needs that drove the design. I would appreciate any suggestions or pointers if anyone has\ntried something like this or alternative methods. Thanks",

Sure you can use a CSV file but better be sure you have all your commas in order. We have long dreamed of having a simpler way of getting kids into courses where they do not have to browse or search 100's of courses.  Bigger sites create headaches for younger kids. We are in the process of developing a new enrollment plugin which mimics the functionality of Google Classroom and Edmodo.  It is almost 100% functional now but we are testing still.  It uses 6 digit codes that are entered on the homepage of Moodle and instantly enrolls the user into a corresponding course or group within the course.  It also functions independent of other enrollment plugins so you can utilize manual or even self enrollment if you desire.  This plugin ignores those enrollment keys and uses it's self generated codes. We believe this will greatly simplify getting kids from the homepage to the learning content. To take this one step further... we can even enroll students with a QR Code!!!!!! Video coming shortly as we just got this functionality working.",

The default is from 1900 to 2050, which puts 150 options in the list. In most cases dates are set in the future, and as Moodle is used for teaching they are not set very far in the future. I'd suggest that in most cases no more than 5 years are needed in that list. Currently it seems that changing the default years involves changing the 'code' in .../moodle/calendar/type/gregorian/classes/structure.php, lines 81 to 97. Are there cases where such a large range of years is needed? Is there an easy way to change the default years, for those who can't access the code on their server ? If not, I'd like to propose adding the default dates to the config file, which I have tested out on a local Moodle server. Thanks",

I can see this particular date selection form in several settings pages for Assignments, Quizzes etc. In all those places only a small number of years is needed. Know of any other places? In the Admin pages, we can add a date field to the user profile. In that case the min and max years can be selected from a list (drawn from the default min_year and max_year). So we can assume the date form function can respond to local variables as well as the default ones. So seems to be variuos possibilities for setting these years? Mal.",

In any case, Moodle 1.9 has been out of support since July 2012 . It will be difficult getting help with it any more. Looking at the file and line you have mentioned in the code repository , there is no \"iscomplete()\" function call. I searched that entire file and could not find an occurrence of that call anywhere. I also did a search of the entire 1.9 codebase and could not find any occurrence of the \"iscomplete\" function. My guess is that you have made customizations in your code. And somehow you have lost some of those customizations. If you have another site with the same code at that line number, and it is working, then it must still have the customizations you need. Looking at the attachment you provided, the file has definitely been customized. It looks like it has the old \"Activity locking\" hack added to it (probably this - https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Development:Activity_Locking#Table_of_Versions ). The function that hack provided has been part of Moodle since some version in Moodle 2. It would be best if you upgraded to a the latest (3.2). Hope this helps.",

A few years ago, users could choose a \"Screenreader\" option in their User Profile but I don't see that option any more.  Is there anything that can be done to make a Moodle quiz (Multiple Choice, Matching, Short Answer) fully accessible to users who are blind and using VoiceOver?  I tried to access it in the Moodle App but it appears that the Quiz is not currently viewable and I can't find a setting for making the quiz viewable in the app. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

But we do have full access to the source code and the development team so all things are possible. However our requirement is very precise and will not change in the future.  The resources in Moodle will always be single activity SCORMs.  The users will always be known to both LMSs.  Enrollment on to the Moodle courses is a hidden (to the user) process driven through the Moodle webservice. So I wouldn't want to use a sledge hammer to crack a nut as it were.  But equally wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel. Any thoughts on time taken to implement LTI would be welcome but in my experience these things are never as simple as they might seem in theory due to their generic nature. I was thinking more of having a link from the non Moodle LMS and automating the logon and opening of the relevant course.  As the Moodle instance will only have this task (the running of single activity SCORMs from this one non Moodle LMS) we do not have to be concerned by other types of processing, types of resource, and/or other requirements.",

          "Text": "I have a pretty long thread here https://moodle.org/mod/forum/user.php?id=2074405 where I detail my struggles with organizing course structure while enabling say pdf popups. The gist of it is, why on earth?!!! can we not enable popups for e.g. pdfs, docx, images etc in anything other than main topics pages? The second whinge if you like, it really would be ideal if we could change file behavior from withing a file manager. Migrating from a 10+ year old platform, which although has a really diabolically ugly GUI, actually does all of the aforementioned pretty competently. Have had a look at plugins for enabling web-viewing of pdfs and word within the browser, as far as I can tell there are only a couple, which are reliant on third-party cloud hosting of files. Word is less important (and guess licensing issues apply), but pdf's are nearly universally viewable on most browsers regardless of platform (win, android, mapple, etc)...why is this such a problem for developers to address? At present, it looks as though you need a separate 'topic' for each subject where you want to enable pdf popups or on a separate browser tab. Thus instead of a course structure where you have say..main subject/theme/topic/subtopic (with pdfs, quizzes, external links, media etc), you end up with 100+ Topic/( activities , quizzes, documents, media etc). This structure may well work for 'week to week' course structures, but is far from ideal when you want the whole course accessible and navigable for students. Any ideas? Is it just me or do others find this laughable? How hard can it be to implement pop-up functionality of items within a folder/subfolder? Otherwise am really impressed with the platform...have used Blackboard and It's Learning way back when in undergrad and grad school (10+ years ago). Just not looking forward to having to restructuring the course into one 50+ topic long mess just to enable pop-ups. Doing this for a friend/client who doesn't want to deal with pages/atto editor...and with a lot of mathematical symbols, copying from word, can understand why. Copy/paste is not an option for maritime navigation course with associated charts etc! Would take months... Any plugins or suggestions very welcome! Just need students to be able to view pdfs in pop-ups, and have quizzes linked or in same secton.  Of course caveat being...around 5-7 'chapters', with 3-10 subtopics. 50+ topics with no organization seems pretty messy. Thanks appreciate feedback.",

A shame as it seems this is pretty much one of the few limitations which prevents moodle from eclipsing aforementioned altogether.  The rest of the platform is really solid, and well thought out. But this (idiotic!) oversight is really holding it back... Essentially it limits moodle to short courses organized week-by-week, or where there just isn't that much content to be distributed. Am well aware it's free! and kudos to developers! Not all of us have access to institutional MS and Adobe licences tho.....!! Would be nice if the developer community could fix this...",

I don't like the zero privacy cloud servers like Puffin or Proton nor do I want to rely on a YouTube account.

I installed Videoeasy which I could not get to function so, uninstalled it. That seemed to have killed inline playing with Flowplayer. Instead of playing the flv when the page is opened as it used to do, now there's only a link appearing on the page and clicking it starts a download to the desktop and playing in the default player on the desktop. Not saying it's an issue with Videoeasy but it definitely affected the native Flowplayer which doesn't work at all now.

Before for example I had question with 3 choices with 1 to 3 correct answers. Student had to answer every choices for + or - sign if thinks that that choice is right or wrong. F.e.: What are colors of Finnish flag (correct answer is blue & white): a) blue    + b) green   - c) white    + So if maximum points are 1 then each gives 0,33. If there is no - sign in 2nd answer then student only get 0,66 points. If I have understood right I cannot do like this with Moodle... Now I don't get it how I could manage this with Moodle that choice without answer is not a same than wrong answer... Do you get my idea of this? Or do I have to change totally way of doing this? Idea of this is that student cannot get full points by choosing all choices but at the same time choosing wrong answer and get minus points would be little bit difficult to do at this schedule -> that affects a lot total points of exam. Is there a possibility to create sub-questions like my example before and in each choice student have to chooce yes or no?",

Even though every quiz is open for a week, many are unable to complete it within the timeframe. The only way to get get them into the quiz is to configure an exception for them to have access to the quiz/site after the deadline which is too difficult for me to manage among the 7 courses-250 students I teach every semester. It would be wonderful if MOODLE would contain a feature to set an amount of points to automatically subtract past the closing dates for quizzes. For example: Subtract 5 points for each day past the quiz closing date or grace period. etc... This would greatly enhance the success in my courses!

This would highlight which items have changed be another teacher or instructional designer working on the course. A list of deleted items somewhere could also be a useful part of the picture. Labels like \"New\", \"Updated\", \"Deleted\" is what I envision to the right of each item as a general rule. Looking to emulate some of the benefits of track changes in other platforms (Google Docs, etc.), this could help streamline the communication flow for the collaborative course design process. I am not a developer, so this would end up falling to others if the interest was there. Cheers!",

However, it is fundamentally a visual task, so it is never going to be accessible to a blind user. So, we have to ask what we mean by these question types being accessible. They are in many ways as accessible as possible. For example, they do not require the use o a mouse, or touch-screen. They can all be done using only keyboard. That is one ADA requirement. There is a known problem with drag-and-drop into text. The labels are not as good as the could probably be, so it is not as easy to complete these questions while using a screen reader as perhaps it could be. However, Moodle's existing Cloze question type suffers the same problem, and I have never been able to work out a good solution. Suggestions welcome.",

          "Text": "Hello all - I have a faculty member who is having troubles editing Calculated Simple question types.  He indicates that when trying to edit any aspect of existing question, the variable limits are reset to 1 and 10, rendering the calculated answers incorrect because they don't match the originals.  This feels like a bug to me, but perhaps there's some aspect of the question type design that makes it a necessity?  I thought before filing a bug report I'd see if anyone here had seen similar behavior. To ensure I haven't misconstrued something, here's his original report to me: The bug present in this version of moodle is easily reproducible. It appears to be an error specific to the Calculated Simple type under the “Create a new question…” option in the Question Bank section of a course. When any question of this type is made you must set limits for the variables the question will use. The default setting for these variables is 1 to 10. If you modify these variables to fit your question and save, the question appears to work just fine with the variables you have set; however, if you go back and try to modify ANY characteristic of a question of this type ( name of question, a typo in the question text, the tolerance of answer that it is willing to accept, etc.), these variables revert back to the defaults of 1 to 10. This then renders the calculated answers incorrect, as they do not match the set put forward by the original calculations. I assume this is an error in either how the variables are stored, or how they are indexed to the particular question. Thanks much for any guidance you may have!  We're running Moodle 2.8.7+ Brian",

I suppose my question is, what are the consequences if I were to use \"Course Completion\" to unlock different badges even if the whole course was not complete at that point?  I could have a badge at 50% of points, one at 75%, etc, that students work obtain progressively.  This seems, intuitively, like a bad idea because the student will not have completed the course and be done with it yet. My work around has been to tie the badge to an activity the student gets access to based on point total then can self complete, something as simple as a previously hidden Label.  This is okay but seems a little clunky.  I could end up with a whole bunch of Labels to stash somewhere in the course.

This might be something like for hand created courses in the edit.php file you would add ... $bc = new\nbackup_controller(backup::TYPE_1COURSE, $templatecourseid, backup::FORMAT_MOODLE, backup::INTERACTIVE_NO,\nbackup::MODE_IMPORT, $USER->id); Then execution code and $rc = new\nrestore_controller($backupid, $course->id, bla bla bla What do you think?",

I think most of us would be familiar with the idea of templates, long before we get ti know Moodle, so how difficult is it to extend that idea into our Moodle courses? EDIT: Then I find this in the Docs and after a quick scan see, that Admins are going to have to teach their course creators how to do that, then provide them with the agreed template. In an environment where such standardization is a demand of the workplace, it will work nicely, but where it is not, or where the people who are leaders and are not Moodlers, they are just not going to demand it. They wouldn't even understand the efficacy of such a solution, just looks complicated and for more than a few Admins, I suspect the same would apply. I work in an environment where \"diversity\" is \"encouraged\"... sort of... well- not really, it is actually \"anything new is dangerous\". For the Teachers... oh a Maths Moodle is not the same as a Humanities Moodle... they have different priorities and what worksd ... blah blah... into a round of endless blabbering descending into inaction and meaningless drivel.

With other ways of creating content, e.g. by hand or with authentication such as LDAP you only get the course settings (e.g. the format such as Topic or Date).  I suspect there are more courses created with those technologies than by CSV. With LDAP the course is created when the first person enrolled on the course logged in, zero teaching of course creators and so rather attractive to admins. You don't get template content when creating by hand either. I think it would be very easy for Admins to overdo the use of templates and there are only so many commonalities between subjects. Some examples that spring to my mind is having a link to a reading list and details of course re-take policies and contact details of course tutors. This would be blanks requiring completion once the course is created. It's easy to imagine some tutors forgetting to do it and ending up with text such as \"Course Tutor Details go here\" or similar, but you could do a database scan to nudge on these. \" Or am I being too cynical? \" Possibly, or you might be an experienced realist?",

Thus if I've got a downloadable file I'd not only add it as as resource but also add a picture of the resource that can be clicked to download it. However , I want to create courses that can be duplicated and customised further by individual teachers.  My traditional technique for doing this won't work as the graphics will all link to the original resource. Would anyone have a good suggestion how I can link graphics to resources 'dynamically'? This would mean resources - even SCORM elements - could have a really nice visual clue with a large graphic.

In order to get an easy installation I suggest the inclusion of a manifest. xml (or something similar) where the author of the plugin could describe his plugin better.

          "Text": "Hello, As far as possible I've tried to find solutions to the issues I have but I'm just not finding the solutions I'm looking for. I've completely wrecked our sandbox a few times trying this and that. I also think I don't always have the terminology right when searching for solutions. So I thought I'd reach out and explain in layman's terms what I'm looking for. A bit of background of how we are using Moodle: We're a non-profit/charity delivering services to persons with disabilities. The bulk of our training is various internal medications related training, this is delivered to roughly 1000 people; and compliance training delivered to roughly 1600 people. After care workers have completed medications related training, the training remains relevant for 1 or 2 years, after which they will either do \"refresher\" training every 1 - 2 years OR they will redo the training course again. The compliance training is the same. This needs to reflect as a separate event of some kind. We need to have a track record of when they've completed the same training over. Currently our two biggest issues: - Objective : When a student has been enrolled they get an email sent to them telling them this. A link to the course would be great. - Issue : We don't want any kind of self-enrolment so the solutions out there don't seem to support the admin doing all the tasks. - Current workaround: Don't have one. Currently sending a manual email notification. - Objective: Our internal courses are valid for 1 or 2 years. - Issue: I don't seem to find a solution to make their yearly training to expire somehow in an efficient way. I hope I've explained my situation well enough, however I'm sure you can see it's not the usual way of using Moodle. Any suggestions are welcome. Cheers Steven",

          "Text": "Summary: Which video format should I use in Moodle activities (e.g. html5) and what software (e.g. VideoStudio Pro X8) do users recommend to record these videos to ensure good usability across devices and operating systems, particularly basic iPhone users. Full: I am looking for a reasonably priced video solution and approach that is compatible with as many mobile and desktop users as possible (and also on the Moodle App, if possible). I'd like to avoid any poor UX approaches such as users having to install plug-ins, browsers, enabling features, etc. So, I'd like to know (1) what software to buy/ download and use and (2) what format to export. My research so far has led me to use VideoStudio Pro X8 and export to html5 as a best solution. My sense (unconfirmed) is that html5 typically uses neither javascript nor flash so will basically work on anything but has less functionality than most SCORM packages. So that is not a great answer, but a sufficient one. Sounds like there may exist SCORM approaches that don't use flash, and the best answer I have to this so far was this previous post ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=152379 )  but these seem a bit too technical or unverified.  VisualStudio can screen record, has good reviews, and is affordable. We're not doing a whole lot on that end so it seems more than enough for my needs. Thanks! Tom",

There are a few changes I would like to explore to make grading easier.  I plan to assemble a fix-list to send to the University when they upgrade and maybe others might appreciate my finds. 1) minimize (remove?) the e-mail column as default.  I wonder if it has any value since it is not even a useable link. 2) Change the grade column from percentage to a fixed width or set it to a thinner column. 3) reformat the Last Modified column to numerical dates instead of spelled out words which take up a lot of space. The list goes on. I am not asking how to do these things, I am just asking for someone to tell me where to go.",

We've seen that Restore course link is added in this section, and we think it could be nice to add \"Add a new course\" link the same way \"Add a category\" is. Also we think that \" Upload courses\" and \"Upload users\" (CSV feature) have to change their text. We have many users failing to restore course through this links, because they are uploading mbz files instead of csv. We recommend to change the text by Upload bulk users/courses or something similar, in order to reduce this errors. Otherwise, We also recommend to review all the restore vs import texts. When you try to restore a new course, the first section ask you to import a backup file... and there are many things like this. Import is always aiming to import activities while restore is used to restore backups. But the user is not alsways thinking about restoring a backup, many times the user is thinking abou importing a course they downloaded for free from another website... What do you think about that?

For example, one part of my site will allow students to set goals.  In order to do this, they must set an overall goal, then determine how to reach this goal.  They will then set up numerous sub-goals (with even more under these - as many goals, sub-goals, and levels of goals as necessary) to help them reach their main overall goal. Is it possible to set this up in a way in which they could come back periodically and review the goals they previously set?  They will need to check off completed goals, review and update future goals, make notes about previously achieved goals, etc.  This will not require a time frame in which to work, nor exams, grading, or many other things associated with normal coursework/ Moodle. This is just one of a number of things of this nature that I can see as being beneficial to my students, so this would be a great feature to have for my site. If you need any more information, please feel free to ask.  I'm typing this at 11:30 at night, so I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out vital information.  Thanks for any help that you may be able to offer!

While this is valid HTML, it is not handled well by screen readers (from my research and testing with NVDA). Now the date and date time mform selector is not very accessible (there is no accessible structural connection between the label and the form entry fields) and I was wondering what the approach should be to fix this. My first thought is to make the label the legend for the fieldset, but as screen readers don't handle it well, it's not a great improvement. Another thought is to make it labelled by multiple controls, but again that isn't handled well by screen readers. The question becomes, should we work towards valid uses (and wait for screen readers to catch up - I'm not sure how well they can do this) or work towards something that screen readers can support now (and I'm not sure what this is yet)?",

Nothing changes as far as the user is concerned and only a small amount of programming is required to make it work. I'm not a programmer so I would need someone make this a reality.

What you propose sounds like a good idea, but the problem is that there are not that many people in these forums who do that much coding. Many do not know anything about coding, or are not interested in it. Most, I suspect, are like me, have little or no idea about PHP, but know something about coding, and will tinker with their Moodles, and other PHP apps they use, but there are very few full time developers. Those who are, are usually too busy to help with such a project. The tinkerers knowledge ranges from little to lots, and can usually give good advice on how to do some things, but they do not trust their own project development skills, and often with good reasons. Perhaps your best bet would be to continue your design work and start the basic structural work yourself. As you learn more, and start to learn what questions you need to ask, there are plenty of people here, and elsewhere, who could help with specific advice, even if not the actual coding, in the Developers Forum. There are also other forums where tutorials and further support for PHP- MySQL / PostGres app developers can be found, I am sure. You might want to start with the Zend forums. Good luck and I hope it works for you...",

When I clicked the next button after spending a very long time typing text and completing the task on the page I was left with only some debug info on the screen. This was a v2.6.1 so no autosave and I lost everything I had typed. Not good !!!! This is hack will let you run a quiz with very long tasks while maintaining a short session time out. While the quiz attempt pages are open it keeps the users session alive - forever. Once the quiz has ended the session will timeout as normal. This is for quiz mod v2.8.1 but easy to get working on older versions. Copy the attached files to mod/quiz, flush your cache and the go to : Site administration -> Activity\nmodules -> Quiz -> quiz | keepalive To activate session keep alive tick the box and save. You will see a security warning at the top of your quiz. Also a good idea to make sure autosave is turned on. The keep-alive is set for 4 mins so even the shortest 5min session timeout should not timeout. If anyone shows interest I may add a select box so the user can set the ping time. Longer is better.",
