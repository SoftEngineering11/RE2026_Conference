So I have decided to fork it and create a new redesigned Interactive book module . The idea of improving Book module came from the participants of Moodle Moot DACH 2025. I will submit it to the plugins database later next week after implementing basic test coverage and fixing compatibility with Moodle 4.5. For now the prototype can be installed in Moodle 5.0, it may work in 5.1 too. Anybody interested in trying it out?",

Some of that should be only visible to teachers, some to everyone. The data should be persistent over years (so not tied to a course but to the school itself) and it should be a living document, which everyone on the staff can edit. My dream is, that after a school conference we do not send an email with the protocol around, but rather during/after the conference directly update the respective parts of the living document and everyone interested will get the email with the deltas (which are the 'protocol') automatically. I currently consider to use a set of Books for this tasks (e.g. one that defines internal procedures, one that defines school wide rules). Is this a valid use case for Books? Or can you recommend alternative approaces/ activities /...?",

The amendment Pages are for the \"Past\" group and should be conditionally displayed to that group only. If there are amendments in \"Book\" resources, then in order to achieve maximum clarity for current students, I would recommend that you update the material in the book, but also create a new amendment \"Page\" with the revised information for the \"Past\" group. Each new amendment should be a separate new Page. If a new amendment replaces a previous amendment, use the date condition to hide the old amendment page from students. That way you can track completion of each amendment separate, and avoid resetting any completions. Label your amendment pages wisely, so you can easily understand the tracking data.",

You would have to repeat this process for each book though. If you have access to Microsoft OneDrive, it has an excellent text search facility, so if you exported all of your books into Word files in a OneDrive folder, you can search for the terms across all books at once. If this is a regular occurrence, a better approach would be enable and configure the Global search facility on the Moodle site, but this requires significant resources.

Each chapter usually consists of a header, immediately followed by the embedded video, then a litte text showing the length of that video, that's it. Currently there are 'previous' and 'next' buttons on top of and below the video, what doesn't make much sense to me. I want my students to FIRST see the video and then the interaction buttons. That said: to declutter the page I'd like to remove the top navigation buttons . So it shall look like this . Problem is: the CSS code I can use in the inspector to hide ('display: none;') is the same both for the top and the bottom navigation buttons, so when adding that to my custom CSS, both navigations are gone. Question: How can I avoid that the top navigation is rendered? Which PHP file of the plugin code would I have to edit (if necessary?) Thanks for your support in advance! Stefan",

If text was copied from Word and pasted into a book a long time ago, for example (before the Atto\neditor cleaned up this content automatically), then this could happen. There are a number of steps you can take to get around this. 1. Open each chapter in the Atto text editor and save it again. Atto will clean up the content when it saves it. 2. If that doesn't fix it, export each chapter individually and identify the one causing the problem. Open that chapter in the Atto editor, go to raw HTML view (expand the first icon in the Atto toolbar (a down-arrow), and then click the last icon\nto see the raw HTML (\"</>\")). Copy and paste the HTML text into an online HTML Tidy website like https://htmltidy.net/ . This might do a better job cleaning it up. 3. If neither works, try installing a plugin to export (and import the book to an ePub (cf. https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=56 ). Then export to ePub, which should ensure the output is valid XHTML . Re-import it into a different book, and export that book into Word format.",

It is a plugin that has a bunch of rather cool little games that link into quiz, glossary and Book. Using Book with questions you might be able to hide the book (available, not visible) and use the game where each question covers a section. Then you can prove they at least viewed every page if you have a question on every page...that might be a lot though. Maybe that's just me, when I create books...well, they're BOOKS. Like Gone with the Wind size books (>1000 pages). Gone with the Wind is shorter than some of my books, to be honest. But I agree with @Shirley...require view. I think maybe book can require view of all pages? But that still doesn't indicate they read it. Maybe add a compulsory \"I agree that I read this information in its totality and I will...\" statement they have to accept to get credit for completion. My old employer had an IT Security course for years that did that--there were three policies and they had to agree to follow the policies and acknowledge their responsibilities before they got credit. If they didn't get credit, they could lose their network access and be fired. A couple people tried the \"I don't agree\" option and...well, it didn't go so well for them.",

Another couple of possibilities is the iContent and Simple Lesson plugins. They also have something you could call a, \"table of contents,\" but it is at the top and bottom of the displayed content, so they don't matter as much when viewed on small screens. The nice thing about both, is that you wind up with content that can be displayed like you want in a web conference, the content can be used by the student as a self paced lesson, and both let you include questions. iContent, even acts very similar to a slide show presentation and also lets students keep notes and post doubts (questions) to the teacher.",

Not sure why it does not work in a book, but the other part you mention, that one works and two do not, I think might be due to not having unique identifiers, which causes only the first one on a page to work.. You might have more success if you try and build etherpad into a bundle for the Generico filter, and do your embedding with it. Every time I have used a Generico filter in a book, it does work.",

For instance, you could set up a, Questionnaire activity, with a rating scale question for each page of your book. You could also probably use the Feedback activity, with a similar set up. If you add pages to the book, you will have to \"modify\" your questionnaire or feedback activity to include rating for the new page(s). You could also probably use, Hot Question. With it, you can set up an entry for each book page and let students \"Vote\" for the page. You could also just let the students create the initial entry for each book page and then vote. With Hot Question, if you add a new book page, you can dynamically include it into Hot Question. Note: Since you are probably going to want to keep info about each page of the book in order in Hot Question, you can over ride the \"Vote\" order by setting \"Teacher Priority\" to control the order. Questionnaire and Feedback will require more direct work from the teacher to set up than that required by Hot Question. Personally, if you have a place for testing, I would try out all three, then adopt the \"best\" one. Oh, you might be able to do a rating with the Quiz activity, too.",

Building each page as a separate page is a chore. I saved each slide as a jpg to keep each book page in a consistent size. I would not recommend copy and paste from a Microsoft product into Moodle.

          "Text": "Thanks Shirley ... What I am trying is to import each SCORM slide or content, into each page in a book. So, the purpose is to have in the book the same number of pages as there are in the SCORM, with the same order, an index well built with all the names correctly written. My SCORM contents do not come from a PowerPoint or anything from Microsoft. They have all been built using an IMS / SCORM editing tool called eXeLearning ( http://exelearning.net ). When importing, each \"slide\" or content from SCORM is just perfect as a book chapter. The problem is the index, as it has an order that has nothing to do with the original. As I read somewhere it seems to follow the order in which it was written in the filesystem, but that's not at all the intention. Additionaly index items have no title, so it becomes quite a mess to look for what title needs to go in each book chapter, and also moving each chapter till it corresponds to the original intention. So, what I need to know is if there is any way, script or not, to have a complete import done the right way.",

Not sure if it is a Book tweak or a O365 repository change.

Unfortunately, if you click on the bullet list icon in the Word Home ribbon menu, it applies the formatting, but without applying the correct style name.

          "Text": "G'day All, Last week I gave a presentation at the Australian Moodlemoot titled \"How and why do people use the Moodle Book module\" . The presentation shared some early explorations of how the courses, learners and teachers at one Australian University used the Moodle Book from 2012 through 2015. I'm sharing here in case some of the findings might interest others. I'm also interested in hearing from folk at other institutions who have any insights into whether these findings are similar or very different. This blog post gives an overview of some of more interesting findings, including links to interactive graphs of the data. In summary, Only very small percentages of students tend to read every chapter in most books. Courses using the Book module tend to have large enrollments. Surprisingly, until recently they also tended to have fewer online only students than is common at the university. The median number of Book resource per course was 3 and the median number of chapters per Book was 4 (though there were extremes - 80 books, 100 chapters, over 74,000 words). Almost no-one is using the import chapters functionality David.",

So I went back to the Sandbox, tried different settings, logged out as faculty, in as hypothetical students: one student with navigate set to image. This showed up as arrows only, with the last arrow, on the last page, pointing somewhat downward, not horizontally. a different student with navigate set to text. This had words, and arrows. The word on the last page was Exit. Both those options worked, and the blue check showed up for each student. This took time on my part, logging in, logging out, as my self, then as two different hypothetical students. Not to mention the  time it took, in the past, and now with Moodle update to 3.0, to persistently defend the case of why hypothetical students were needed (weeks, to months; not hours or days!).  So that preliminary work made possible the current resolution to the problem.",

It imports any images embedded inside the Word file, and also automatically splits the file into chapters (and optionally subchapters) based on the heading styles used in Word. Heading 1 styles are considered chapter headings, and Heading 2 styles subchapter headings. It is now available for download on the plugins directory at Microsoft Word file import . As it is a first release, I would be grateful for any comments and suggestions. The underlying code is based on older, more mature plugins ( Question format: Microsoft Word table format and Atto editor: Word import ) so it should be reasonably stable.",

I think I saw one in the Intro course that there is a benefit to bringing a page in, rather than just linking to a page or website.  In case the link gets broken, or a PRD goes off the internet, etc., etc. It seems standard practice to just link to websites however. I'm wondering if it refers specifically to a PRD that you download from a site, the upload into your Moodle course, so if it ever 'goes away' you still have the resource on your course.

After import I see that all ordinary links to chapter1 are relinked to moodle (and look like \"http://localhost/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=1&chapterid=1\"  but links which contain ancors are  imported like \"http://localhost/moodle/mod/book/chapter1.html#section1\" and lead into the void (404 error).

I would rather correct the typo in the html file and when a user clicks on a Moodle Book on any of the five installations, he/she always gets to see the content from the html file on the server.

You'd have to rely on some form of funky work around or making some changes to the Book module code. A look in the Book tools part of the plugins database doesn't reveal anything that might help. Wonder if there are any other workarounds out there in the wilds? I'm in the early stages of thinking about how the content for a Book module might be linked to version control software (e.g. git ). But even then I'd been thinking of the need for the book to be updated to reflect changes in the repository. But you've got me thinking now.",

Basically these are accesskeys, but also some other things. So these modifications have to be done on each update... At theming side it is not possible to have the theme using accesskeys, you have to modify the core. Our layout does only use 2-columns, hiding of blocks is disabled and each course does have the same basic layout. What we have additionally done some months ago was to include some more accessible themes for visually impaired (high contrasts are used; black-white, white-black, blue-yellow; based on accessibility switching theme from Moodle theme section).

Here is a good article: http://www.brightcookie.com/2011/02/book-v-lesson/ I have a quick question for Mary and other Lesson gurus though. Is there any advantages (or disadvantages) in terms of \" accessibility \" between the Book module and Lesson module? Have these two tools been heavily tested against some of the mainstream screen readers such as JAWS? Can we say Book (in general) is more accessible than Lesson module (or are they equally good)? Also is the PDF file generated in Book module considered as \"accessible\" PDF files? Thanks! Wen",

The pages contain many images which are applied through the use of a stylesheet, for example: \n```text\n.scopebanner {\n\tbackground: url(scatefiles/scope.jpg) no-repeat;\n\tbackground-position: left top;\n        padding-left: 180px;\n        padding-top: 52px;\n\theight: 140px;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 24px;\n\twidth: 520px;\n\tcolor: #990000;\n}\n```\n For some reason when these files are zipped and imported into the Book module, everything in the above style works as expected except the background image. When I use the Files tool rather than the Book, the image displays properly. However using the Files tool would mean we would have to add custom navigation to all our pages.

Inserting the style tag in a web page is a bad idea, some browser will let you do it but it is not a good practice to do it, style should only be in the head section.  In Moodle, if you really need to add some custom styling, html or javascript , you can add it in the following section:  site administration -> Appearance -> Themes -> {Your theme} -> custom css  OR site administration -> Appearance -> {Your choice} (css should be in head section) The better way: Depending on your version of Moodle, you can use predefined styles to do what you're looking for, the recent Moodle versions (not sure on which version it started exactly) uses bootstrap v2.3.2, you can use the grid system http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem Hope this helps",

With our courses, student cohorts get their own instance of a course in each study period, which requires courses to be cloned from study period to study period (works fine, generally). The root cause was that the media that was inaccessible was uploaded to the book as part of course ID 345 (specific ID not important) then at the end of the study period that course was then copied using the moodle web-service to course ID 678 (again the specific ID isn't important). The content of the book was included in the copy/clone, but it was using the previous courses details through the m_files table, the m_context table and into m_course_modules. My understanding of the \"new\" moodle data file system structure and concepts were that new links to this media should be created directly to the content when the activity was cloned, rather than simply copying the old link. Students in course id 678 have no rights to view content added to course 345, so this is why the link is inaccessible at this point to the students. Is this a bug or has something else happened? Happy to raise a tracker issue if this is believed to be a bug.",

To get more control of your visual layout you could import images into pages of your book, or abandon that approach and use pdf documents which can be sized and shaped to fit your designs and images will remain where you have placed them. I sometimes export a presentation (ppt/keynote) as a series of images and put them in a lightbox gallery as it gives you the ability to rapidly flick around a presentation. If the presentation is set to be the size you want the images, then the exported images should by default be the size you want on screen.",

I then inserted each slide as a page content titling each page as the slide number. Then in \"Content 1\" I put \"Previous\" - jump to previous and \"Content 2\" - jump to next. I'm not sure this is the most efficient way to do this, but it works. I'm using 2.5.1 If you need to change the content of just one slide in PowerPoint, then when you select Save As... you get the option to save the entire presentation or just the one slide. Hope this helps. Regards Ray",

My question is if the IMS content package created by exportimscp can be imported to another (IMS-compatible but not Moodle) LMS? Seems to me that if it really generates an IMS package according to the standard is should. I have many very simple books (with embedded Flash files) that need to be created in standard format (my client's requirement) so they are usable (sellable) by other major LMSs.  I can create them nicely in Moodle (and prefer to author there as Moodle will continue to be the main LMS) and would like to avoid additionally regenerating them in an external authoring package. I'd appreciate any input or suggestions. Thanks, Heidi",

Doing it this way means I have only one place where I have to make updates if I need to make changes to the book contents. The down side is that students have to enroll in all the different resource classes they happen to use. I have mine set up for self enrollment and the enrollment key is listed in the classroom assignment description. Like you, I sometimes wind up with a book that would have an extremely long TOC. I break it up into separate books. I make one book the TOC for all the separate books and link to them via URL's. It is even possible to have links that go to ANY page in a book because it's URL contains both the book ID and chapter/subchapter ID. Hope this helps, AL",

We have tried: Backing up each book in 1.9 to restore into an existing course (merging) or new course in Moodle 2.2 Exporting the book from 1.9 as an IMS package, but adding it to the Moodle 2.0 course makes it un-editable and we cannot see an option to import into a book (the docs says ‘Import Chapter’ for 2.3, but we don’t see that option) Putting the books into Equella (file repository) to somehow link to them (with no success) This is now an urgent issue. Can anyone out there please advise what they have experienced? Kind regards, Alex",

This is how I fixed it: Open the file mod/book/lib.php and edit lines 261 and 264. The modified lines should be: $action = new action_link($url1, get_string('printbook', 'book'); $action = new action_link($url2, get_string('printchapter', 'book') ); In this way, the text whole book or the chapter that the user has selected will be opened in the same browser window, keeping all the menu options.

          "Text": "Hi Gilles-Philippe, It is possible to override the images from within a theme. You can do so in the following way: \n```text\n \n\n\n\n// Original path\n\n\n\nmod/book/tool/print/pix/book.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// Path in theme\n\n\n\ntheme/mytheme/pix_plugins/booktool/print/book.png\n```\n When looking for an overriding image the following path is used. 1. theme (static) 2. themename => mytheme 3. area => pix_plugins for plugin images, pix_core for core images, pix for theme images. 4. plugin type => booktool 5. plugin name => print 6. file name => book It then searches for the image with the following extensions gif, png, jpg, jpeg in that order. Hope this helps. Its not always the easiest thing to work out, I myself had to look at code to remind myself how it all worked. As such I've updated http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Themes_2.0_How_to_use_images_within_your_theme#Overriding_plugin_images with this information as well. Cheers Sam",

Even stranger, this particular user COULD see the books when we checked a week earlier, when we first heard reports from another user that he couldn't see them.\n\nIt doesn't appear to be a browser or extension issue, as the HTML code doesn't list the books, and I had this user try with a different browser altogether with the same result.\n\nHas anyone else seen this issue, or know how to resolve it? Failing that, is there anything I can do to track down the cause?\n\nThanks,\n-Conrad.",

If you run into errors, use your PHPMyAdmin (or an SQL manager) to delete the 2 book tables. Also, go into your Logs Display table and delete any references to the book module (normally the last things that will appear) Now, rerun the admin. Everything should work fine. Dave",

I once caught myself working/making changes in the wrong database on a server that had five different Moodle installations on it. I kept wondering why my changes were not making any difference till I realized what I was doing. Another possibility - I had a similar problem once. I fixed it by changing the version number in the module I wanted to install so that its version was one digit higher than the one I wanted to replace. Moodle then would perform the \"upgrade\" to the \"new\" version. Just had to remember and redo it it when I updated versions of Moodle later until I did a new from scracth install.

It seems that it has been an Editor bug during the time I have created my books, but it looks like it has been fixed later (newer books are working fine). My solution was to modify each link of a book to the format \" http://mymoodle.tld/file.php/course-id/file \" which works find during backup-restore and import.

Where the Book module finally sends its main content out to be rendered (and I don't know exactly where that is) the code could be modified to first pass that material through function glossary_filter($courseid, $text) located in mod/glossary/filter.php. This will insert the necessary HTML code for Glossaries that are available on the highest (site-wide) level, as well as for Glossaries that are specific for a specified Course. Such a Glossary could be created for a dummy Course, and the corresponding $courseid could then be supplied as an argument for the function. This might be a satisfactory solution for many purposes. Can anyone on this forum give a more exact suggestion about where in the Book module code to make such a change?",

I noticed the \"mod/book:edit\" capability indeed renders the book editable but fails to display the \"Turn editing on\" button, hence preventing book editing. In the code (lib.php, function book_edit_button), the visibility of this button is controlled by : \n```text\nif (isteacheredit($courseid)) {\n```\n which I replaced by \n```text\n$\ncontext\n = get_context_instance(CONTEXT_MODULE, $id);\n\n\n$allowedit = has_capability('mod/book:edit', $context);\n\n\nif ($allowedit) {\n```\n Is the code wrong, or am I ?

I'm looking for a way to create about 20 books each for about 50 courses which will all differ in content. I've had a look at mdl_book an can see the content is just html which introduces the idea of injecting books straight into the moodle database . I'm wondering if its possible to write queries to edit mdl_book and just inject all my books into moodle? As other tables might need editing too for the books to work, can anyone list the tables that i need to look at? thanks alot really appreciate any help.",

This file format, when\nopened in a web-browser is a lot more accurate [loss of formatting and\nelement placement occurs in converting into .htm format unless things are\n'corralled' in a table] and images are clearer]. In addition, you can\nconvert .doc, .xls, .ppt, .pub file formats in Microsoft Office - both\n97-2003 [well at least 2003] and 2007 versions.\n\n\nProblem is Moodle does not seem to recognise .mht file format - on\nuploading into course files folder the file icon has ? and it will not\n import into a Moodle Book resource.\n\nWould be nice if we could import .htm files into \nMoodle books\n as:\n* it simplifies process - don't have to zip if uploading just one\nconverted file\n* reduces the number of files in the Moodle course files - not a major issue.\n```\n Does anyone know how to overcome this obstacle?

Firstly, I receive course content from academics in .doc format, which I then convert to .htm in MS Word. I save these files as 'p1-Heading of chapter' (where the p1 is the page of the book; p1, p2, p3...etc) and sub-chapters get saved like this 'p1-sub1-heading of sub-chapter' (where sub1 is the sub-chapter of the parent chapter; sub1, sub2, sub3....etc). I save these into a folder, which then get's zipped and uploaded to Moodle's file system. They then get unzipped and imported into a book. My problem is, once unzipped and imported, then name of the chapter/sub-chapter is the location and file-name of the particular file on Moodle's file system. All the chapters look great, until I have to edit them to change the name to something more appropriate (removing the file location etc..). This cause the HTML content to do some strange things, and changes the formatting, fonts, etc. The content only contains basical text, with minimal formatting (text colour, paragraphs, font decoration, etc). I guess I have a few questions:",

          "Text": "We experienced something similar. The HTML editor in Moodle allows the use of <font> tags, but there is a stylesheet applied to the book that overrides all <font> declarations. If you have access to your Moodle code, have a look at /mod/book/book_print. css I reproduce the relevant section here: /* just some hack - ignore user defined <font> */ font { color: #000000; background-color: #EEEEEE; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; This is obviously frustrating for users who do want to specify styles in the HTML editor. Essentially, the HTML editor ceases to be WYSIWYG , because your changes are overridden by the stylesheet. If you're confident with CSS, you can remove sections (or just comment them out using /* to mark the beginning of the block you want ignored, and */ to mark its end). Alternatively, you can rename book_print.css and create a new, empty file named book_print.css. I haven't tried this, so it might make more of a pig's breakfast of the layout, but at least your styling choices will not be ignored.",

Can anyone tell me how I might also control where the popup window appears in the main window of a chapter? In other html instances \"left=400,top=400\" alongside toolbars, location etc determine characteristics of windows, but I can only seem to get book chapters to respond to height and width instructions. I'd also like to be able to open a picture file in the same way (without setting up an html doc), much as you can link to a file as a resource. This just seems to shrink the picture when I try it in a chapter. Any ideas?",

There is no easy way to import PDF into a Moodle Book. You can try a PDF to HTML conversion tool (such as the one provided by Adobe ). But the results are usually disappointing. Most documents created with PDF do not have the needed formatting information in them to create a good web page. Even where there is formatting, it is very poor and does not suit online viewing of the document. The good news is that it is very easy to convert from a Moodle Book to PDF and to other formats such as ebooks. I spend a lot of time copying the text from PDF documents into web pages for my Green Technology Strategies course. But then I was able to produce a Moodle Book and from that publish a printed book and ebook. My hope is that ebook formats with better formatting will one day replace PDF.",

We are running V 1.9.7 and I see that for the Book resource one cannot allocate a Grouping to it, you can assign a Group. Am I correct in saying that Grouping for the Book does not exist as a common module setting.? I can see I can allocate visible or separate groups but I can't see the Grouping option. I have looked at Moodle Tracker http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-1651 and I can't quite make out whether the issue raised about Grouping has been resolved. Can anyone help? Duncan",

Surely if the core code didn't support groupings for the book then we would have had to do something more than just follow the install instructions.",

I have tried copy and paste, importing, saving the word doc as a web page and importing, nothing is working. I understand that there can often be formatting issues, but is seems that the main issue for me is that it's chopping off a massive chunk of the document. I have tried many times, including pasting the remainder of the document after the initial save, but nothing is working. I appreciate that it is not advised to use copy and paste, but for a 12 page doc complete with a load of tables, i'm sure you can understand that I don't want to retype it all. Also as mentioned, it seems that it's missing most of the document. I should add, that after the copy and paste, the whole document can be seen in the editor, it's only when I hit save and view it that a large part of the document is missing. Would really appreciate some ideas here as i'm pulling my hair out. Thanks in advance, Susie.",

I added a background-color command around line 17 in book_theme.css: .book_content { text-align: left; background-color: #FFFFFF } However, that only changes the main content area to white and leaves a space around the white area to the black outline.

If I remember correctly, the mthml format is the single file web-page format and I found it doesn't work! You need to save in htm/html format where you obtain a html file and a folder that contains images of the page. Both need to be uploaded to the Moodle course files - easiest way is to put both into a folder, zip it into a single file, upload the zip file to the Moodle course files, unzip it. Then when you import into your 'Book' you just choose the htm file you uploaded. Hope this makes sense and works - cheers, Tony",

Unfortunately the images did not appear when programmed so the developer has had to create a separate page with a link from the original e-book page. Her comments are below: At the moment we have put it as a link as when it is embedded into the page it does not work. It seems the Book DHTML editor manipulates the javascript and than it doesn’t work. We are just looking into ways around this so put the link up in the interim. Does anyone know how to fix this little glitch?

But when I make a change to the original file(s) on my computer using Dreamweaver or whatever and upload the edited file, is there any way to tell the book module to recompile or reimport one or all chapters ?  Does the link to the original file persist? I can copy and paste the code into the chapter editor, but that will not have the appropriate links to graphics etc. I can delete all the chapters in the book one at a time (slow process) and then reimport the directory, but this Is in efficient and time consuming. Wish there were a way to select multiple chapters! Best practice?",

I have a two issues that I would like to solve as we might be doing something wrong: When we upload an html page with graphics (we zip the directory with all the graphics and html pages and unzip it in Moodle) and then use the \"import\" option in the book, it looses all the src links to the grahics. it looks like the relative link for example \"screenshots/image.jpg\" needs to be replaced by \" http://www.tl21.org/hobartcollege/file.php/3/Instructions/ Screenshots/image.jpg\" (The html file resides in the directory \"Instructions\") I don't mind changing all the src statements when importing html files with embedded graphics, but most of the teachers are not really familiar with html coding. Do I have a corrupted copy of the book block or is this normal? If the latter it would be nice if the needed absolute src link can be inserted automatically, (my php coding is not good enough to attempt such a change!) Finally, is there a way to have the book open in a new window so the student can have both the book and the course window open.",

First you call your directory s creenshots/image.jpg then you call it S creenshots/image.jpg (You see the two \"s\" of screenshots - once lowercase, then uppercase) If you´re running your moodle on a kind of linux/apache system the case does matter... that´s what I would try first: set uppercase and lowercase straight.

I have uploaded a complete web site structure with graphics and all. When I use the import function in the book the links to the graphics are kept as a relative src link (the html source statement in my case is Screenshots/image.jpg). Instructions in the book manual state that all links will converted to absolute src statements. Somehow that is not happening during the import with text and graphics). However, if I go into edit mode of that particular page that should have a graphic and alter the src statement to a absolute link (in my case http://www.tl21.org/hobartcollege/file.php/3/Instructions/ Screenshots/image.jpg) By the way the text html file resides in the directory Instructions so when hence the relative src link statement to Screenshots/image.jpg But the book import functions does not seem to convert those src statements for graphics to the absolute path needed for the book. Is it a bug or I am doing something wrong?",

That makes the front page a course from which you can import certain things to other courses. - Go to the admin-panel of your destination course - select \"import\" from the admin panel - you´ll be lead to a mask, where you can choose from which course you want to import something - select your backuped front page course - on the next step you gotta de-select everything except the book which you want to transfer. - continue the following steps which are self-explanatory. - there you are.",

I am an American working in a school for disabled children in China and, on an almost daily basis, find myself getting frustrated over the lack of opportunities for disabled people/children to learn. When I started reading your site I got very excited because I think this software has something to offer all of the students I work with. In trying to understand the details of this software, however, I find that I am getting a bit lost in all the detail. I submit a plea for your help to get me over this hump. My present students are all students with cerebral palsy, which, simply put, means they have trouble controlling their body. I am trying to find software that will let me give tests, present lessons and even will allow me to create a kind of ebook, with m/c quizzes at the end of each chapter - preferably with links so that if students don't know a word they can click on the link and find the definition. I am sorry for posting such a mundane question but I need some help seeing the big picture before I can understand and appreciate the trees better. If moodle will do this it would be helpful if someone could send me a url to a site that has an example of this kind of use. Thanks in advance! If you want to see my incredibly cute students you can go to www.hischopsticks.org",

          "Text": "Hi Tom, I don't think the limitation for what you want to do in Moodle for your students is within Moodle itself. Moodle is a browser based web application so you would need to scout out some of the technologies developed over the past 25 years for computer assistance. In 1984 I produced a training video for the University of Virgina on a retinal scan camera device that was fairly non-intrusive, which allowed someone with CP to easily move a cursor around the screen by simply looking at what they wanted to do and blinking for click. I'm sure this technology has evolved considerably but I've not kept up with it. I have seen special trackballs and a few other gizmo's. Try Googling computer devices for accessibility etc. Your students at www.hischopsticks.org look like some of my wifes students.... the faces of angels! I've often wondered what the response would be to introducing this student population to virtual environments like SecondLife, where they could experience a sense of greater mobility while learning. Would they find this interesting?",

The book module changed the links correct. We had one problem related to the Indesign export to HTML. Indesign exported the pics in preview quality and not with high resolution. But that is a Indesign problem. It works great in 1.8. Today I tested the import of a Word Document. I opened the Word Document Office created automatically multipages in HTML, zipped them, uploaded and unzipped them, imported in book module and the pages were uploaded correct, but the href-links to the pics were not converted in 1.9. Is this a bug? I'll add it to the bugtracker also. Ralf",

I'd love it if some of our Book experts could look at this and point me in a direction. Ok - in our 1.8 installation of moodle, we've added the book module. In the \"0\" block in a course, if I edit a label and inside the label want to add an image - I click on the image button in the WYSIWYG editor. A list of the folders in my course appears and I choose the \"images\" folder I created. NO PROBLEM! IF however, I add a book to a block in the same course, and then inside one of the chapters in the book I want to add an image - this is what happens: I click on the image button in the WYSIWYG editor. Instead of a list of the folders appearing that are in my current course, I get the default Moodle site folder. My \"course\" folder isn't there, meaning my images folder isn't there. AGH!

I've installed it like all the other Modules but for some reason it is displaying as module name but when I choose that option I get an error message saying 'This module type dosn't exist' I've checked in the Activities area and it is there as book_16. I've installed to most up to date language pack but that has not made a difference. So my quesiton is, does the Book Module work with 1.8?\n\nThanks,",

          "Text": "In this forum, there have been several posts reporting successful installation of the book module in various releases of Moodle (1.7, 1.8, etc.). Where did you get your book module? Did you download it from the modules and plugins database , or did you get it from CVS ? The CVS module is version 20070406. The module you get by clicking the \"Download latest version\" link in the modules and plugins database is version 20060312. The two versions are different . Do you know if the differences are important to you? Have you thoroughly tested your installation? The above questions are really not specific to the book module, but since there is no \"third party modules and plugins\" forum, I had to raise it somewhere. Moodle 1.7 has broken a lot of third-party modules, and users obviously need a more reliable way to determine compatibility of modules with Moodle releases than we currently get from the rather static view that we get from the modules and plugins database. In this discussion , Tim Hunt proposes adding a voting mechanism to the Modules and Plugins database that would turn the database into a tool for collaboration. Voting is a way of capturing the results of testing by a large user community. If you are looking for the answer to the question 'Does this third-party module work with 1.8?' it is much easier to look at a vote count than search the forums (the votes could carry short comments, so as not to detract from the forums). What do you think?",

In the Administration block, click Admin -> Configuration -> Language. You will see 3 links, including \"Edit strings\". Clicking \"Edit strings\" will show you the complete list of language files. In this case, the string is in the \" book .php\" file, so you have to click on that to get the list of strings for that file. Scrolling down you'll see \"Table of Contents\" on the left, and to the right you should be able to type whatever you want to change it to. Hit the save button at the bottom of the page. In later versions of Moodle, the menus have changed, so it may be a little different. Look for it -- you'll find it.",

You can create PDF's that are protected so that the text and image can't be extracted (i.e. cut and pasted) but its fairly easy to beat those limitations. But again the PDF format is designed to allow the document to be freely shared while providing a consistent appearance (fonts, page layout) and some degree of protection against alteration of the document. It's almost impossible to insure that anything available on the internet can't be captured and sent on to others. If I am interpreting your request correctly you want to have some form of DRM on the text files. You may want to research some forms of Document DRM or MicroSoft iDRM. In terms of MOODLE you are asking it serve in manner completely contrary to it's design. The social constructionist philosophy says share everything and see what happens, it's usually good. MOODLE does have the ability to restrict files to selected groups of users (think classes and/or groups) so you can post a file that only some users can access, but has no ability to determine what they do with the file once they have it.",

It downloads to your computer as a zip file with name book_16.zip you upload this to your server into the moodle/mod directory. you unzip it there you change the name on the unzipped folder to book you go to the admin section of your site it should go through a quick \"updating book module\" process. you click on modules in your admin section and check firstly if it is there - if it is make sure the \"eye\" is open. If not, then I'm not sure what you have done! If you have used the module before and there is left over in your database , you will have to clear that out. Can't go searching for you now, but the method to do this is outlined in another thread. Hope you get there. I like the book module! Thanks to those who created it!",

If i log in as a teacher/administrator and switch to the student's account with \"Login As\" button before I open the book I(the students) really can not see the image(only see the alternative name) But if I opened it once as a teacher/administrator and read the chapters and \"Loggin As\" the students again the image can be read (from the same machine). We use Moodle 1.5.3 and Firefox Browser. I have checked the server side and the image files mode is correct. Thanks. Andy",

The content itself is not so long, only three pages in MS Word but it contains multiple tables. There are also some images, but I assume they don't count, since they exist in the file only as links. Moodle seems to leave out the end of the file. A table brakes in the middle of a row. Also the arrows below the chapter leading to previous and following chapters are inside the \"chapter box\" (a thin grey line around the chapter, the appearance may depend on style) where as in shorter chapters the arrows are outside the box. A picture of this is at http://www.hurri.org/diipadaapa/moodle_book.jpg I tried to simply copy and paste the rest of the text and tables to the end of the chapter in Moodle editing view but the end of it is always cut off when saving the changes.",

From a user's perspective the bookmodule definitely belongs with the resources (and I believe in between all of the security stuff Petr is rewriting it to become a multipage resource type). But looking at the code you can see it has a lot more in common wih the other activity modules, and I guess that's why it is still there with the other activities.",

You also have a \"book\" folder inside the \"book\" folder, I presume. Move the contents of the inner \"book\" folder to the upper \"book\" folder, so you would have for example a path like /moodle/mod/book/README.txt.",

Also, I made the mistake of unzipping Book.zip on my computer then using Adobe Golive to FTP it to my site.  When I ran it through Golive, Golive  changed the links in Book and resulted in the 404 error I mentioned earlier.  I deleted the whole thing and reinstalled it using AceFTP and it worked fine.  I have the Book Module working now.

Since \"Book\" will not be in v1.4 many of us who like this mod can take a deep breath and ponder about some of the things we would like to see in this simply wonderful module by Petr . He really should get a lot of Kudos about this mod because of its intuitive nature, applicability and interesting interface. The main problem is, as with all dreams and desires in Moodle , coding is necessary. Many of use have no coding experience or limited coding experience. Maybe we can do a collaboative thing with Petr at the helm, if he is willing, on developing a Book \" Format \" [possibly laid out similar to the \"Social\" format] as well as the . Book \" AddOn \" module. What do other folks think about this? What kind of layout would you want to see in a potential \"Book\" format? Let's put some layout images out there.",
