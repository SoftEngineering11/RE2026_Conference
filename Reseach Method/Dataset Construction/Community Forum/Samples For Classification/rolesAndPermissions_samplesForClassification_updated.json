Basically, I get a list of roles that are granted grading permission on the assignment, and then look for users assigned that role relative to the submitter.

I guess I am left with two questions: Does what I'm doing here look completely silly to anyone? If not, why do we not normally look for people assigned to the desired role at the user/module/course/category/system level, instead of starting at the module level? Here's the code: \n```text\n\n```\n /* Check for users assigned roles with grading rights for this assignment, relative to the given user.

I duplicated the Course Creator role, and allowed her to create subcategories. Which worked fine.

If you want other people to have a lot of permissions, but not all the control, you must set a role specific for them, and if you want them to have different set of permissions in different contexts, you must assign them specific roles for specific elements (as I suggested you in my previous post). Think about it. You want those so called \"admins\" not to able to admin certain courses, nor edit roles (because obviously if they can edit roles, they can regain all the permissions).

I have tried the following with no sucess: Assigning a user with admin access at the system level to a student role at the course level. This resulted in keeping all their admin permissions. I have read forum postings stating this can be done by creating a category and then assignment the roles to a category, but I want this to be course, rather that category specific (if possible). I also realize they can switch to student view with the drop down, which will solve my immediate problem of testing, but I wonder how to solve this when I need these teachers really as students for online professional development.

[I use groups/groupings for a course where I want students to see just specific activities/resources related to a subject area (topic) but students can still see/read about each topic -- they just can't get to the activities other than for their particular group. Students log in to the course with a specific enrollment key which assigns them to a group. It works OK for my purposes, and actually promotes students wanting to do the other topics they read about.

It seems administrators have security around this restriction. However, it doesn't seem possible to create another role who can also get around this restriction. I thought the \"View Hidden User Fields\" would do so, but apparently that only works for those settings on the \"User Policies\" page. What I want is to have fields which are visible to the user (but not other students), but some elevated roles other than administrator that can see these fields. Since we don't allow students to see other students profiles, I guess I can do this by changing the \"Who is this visible to\" to Everyone, and be OK. Is there something else I'm missing here?",

Could someone please confirm if they are experiencing the following problem. We have just upgraded to moodle 1.8.2+. On the mymoodle pages students are able to select \"Edit this page\", but the Add blocks combo list is not displayed. I can confirm that students do have site wide permission to allow mymoodle/mangeblocks, but this appears to be having no effect. As an admin I do see the Add blocks combo list and can add blocks. If anyone else can verify this as a bug, I'll add it to the tracker , or advise on a suitable fix. Thanks. --Stuart Anderson Uni of Manchester, UK",

I have been working on a few courses.  What I am trying to do is make certian courses visable/enrollable based on the rank of the member. I have included a custom profile field called rank and it has a drop down menu of items i.e. (  chief, deputy, captian, Lt, fire fighter, rookie) So I want the \"Rookie\" members only to see and have access to certian courses.  Then as they get promoted they have access to more training. I have done alot of reading about groups etc but it doesn't make sense. Thanks for taking the time to read and possibly help.",

I am reluctant to just delete the role since there are users attached to each one but it seems like a daunting amount of work to review each record individually. Is there a simpler way to do this? Ideally I would like to make any user with a copy role (eg, \"student copy 2\", \"instructor copy 6\", etc.) to be replaced with the standard \"student\" or \"instructor\" role.

Doesn't need to be an exact match, but I want it to be approximate. E.g. all Project Managers in one branch, all members of Continuous Improvement in another, all members of HR in another, etc. The goal is to allow managers of one job function to get reports for their job function in any given course. My impression is that ELIS defines the hierarchy through User Sets - so we'd have separate user sets for Project Managers, HR, Continuous Improvement, etc. It also appears you can auto-assign users to user sets based on Profile Fields. so if we set up a Profile Field called Job Function, and have the items Project Manager, HR, Continuous Improvement, users could be assigned to one of these Job Functions and will be grouped together within the hierarchy. Since we have several hundred employees, and they could change at any time, I'd like the Job Function profile field to be automatically imported over LDAP . Can this be done? Any help is appreciated!

I also created a custom report that shows the course completion of users and a block to display that report and the role (coordinator) has access to that block and report. However, when the user assigned to the role (coordinator) views the custom report, they can view ALL students' course completion data rather that it being limited to only the students in the cohort that the coordinator is assigned to. This is a privacy issue.  Does anyone know how I can limit the ability of the (coordinator) role to only view the course completion status in the custom report of those students in the cohort that the user is assigned to?

Manager is a real role (that happens to be defined to have most capabilities by default.) If you really want to make someone an admin, look at admin/roles/admins.php.

I've got a number of staff members who need to have access to all courses and the ability to edit settings, but do not want to receive any actual course information.",

          "Text": "Hello all, I need to know if I'm on the right track or if there's a better way to do this. This is our scenario: The staff on our university IT Service Desk (SD) assist teachers with their Moodle problems. The SD staff have individual accounts with the Manager role site-wide. Occasionally an SD staffer will take a Moodle course as a legitimate enrolled student while continuing to work on the Service Desk; this happens several times a year and is on the increase. While we trust our SD staffers implicitly, in the interests of good and appropriate security we need to disable an SD staffer's Manager privileges, but only in the particular course they're taking . When I started working on this last week, (and after a little testing) I thought the way to do this would be to define a new role (called \"NotManager\"), set Prohibit on all the capabilities that weren't available to the Student role, and apply that role to the individual staffer in the Course context . It's been a long and ugly slog, comparing Student and Manager capabilities and making the corresponding Prohibit settings in the NotManager role. Am I on the right track? I want to make the actual process of restricting the SD staffer's privs in a particular course fairly straightforward and simple. Is using Prohibit this way appropriate? It seemed more cut-and-dried than Prevent, which felt like it could be overridden by multiple-roles-in-the-same-context calculations. Is there any easier way to transfer the intent of the privs from the Student role to the NotManager role? I tried exporting the settings from Student and importing to NotManager, but didn't get the results I was hoping for. (The difference between Not Set and Allow, I think.) I'm also concerned about sustainability -- what happens to the NotManager role when/if new capabilities in either the Student or Manager roles arrive? Comments and suggestions are warmly welcomed.

The assumption is that anyone you put in that role would have the integrity to, one: not be snooping around on the server unless there is some kind of an issue to deal with and two: be expected to follow a strict confidentiality policy. People in IT have to deal with this kind of an issue at all times because they will always have access to everything on a server unless the files in a users folders are encrypted. In the LMS I don't believe that it is possible. If you don't want this person to see what is in that particular category then I belive that you have a couple of options: 1) Create a specific role for administration of certain things and then assign that role at the category level and don't add that person to the role in the secure category. 2) If you really don't want anyone to have access then setup a second instance of Moodle and only put your senior staff on that server with a trusted person set as the administrator.

          "Text": "I'm mostly following the tutorial for \"Course list viewer role\", a variation on scenario 4 where I want to limit what students can see to only a few limited categories (even a single one) https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Course_list_viewer_role I removed capability moodle/category:viewcourselist from the authenticated user role I created a new role with this capability for the category context Now let's say I have a hierarchy of categories : category1 category1.1 category2 If I assign a student this new role in category1, it works - student only sees courses from category1 and subcategory. If I assign a student this new role in subcategory category1.1, the student gets the cannotviewcategory error when accessing the category index (under /courses/). Notice the student can still access the subcategory with its id in URL (e.g. /courses/index.php?categoryid=10). I dive into the code, specically core_course_category#user_top() which \"Returns the top-most category for the current user\" and I found this cryptic comment at the end, when no top category is found : \n```text\n       // User can not access any categories on the top level.\n\n\n       // TODO \nMDL-10965\n find ANY/ALL categories in the tree where user has access to.\n\n\n       return self::get(0, IGNORE_MISSING);\n```\n https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/course/classes/category.php#L329 So this means this use case is not yet implemented ? But MDL-10965 is closed (maybe I should have posted this in the developer forum)",

Advanced Teacher has the roleid 8, while normal teacher has roleid 3. If someone requests a course now and we approve this course, the requester is added to his course as this advanced teacher not only as a normal teacher. To make it it a bit more odd, if we change the sorting of the roles in the roles section, the default role for course requester changes too. Now it becomes the light teacher. We still are using moodle 1.8.2 and it seems not to be resolved by 1.8.4 in our testing environment. Does anyone experience the same or a similar problem? Best Regards Sven",

          "Text": "Hi, first up I'm relatively new to Moodle and was not involved in the set-up and design phase of our Moodle platform, so please bear with my limited knowledge in this respect. Currently we enter in all our users in one big 'admin' list (via Users > Accounts), which just displays in default alphabetical order. This works ok for now, but in the future this list will become rather large and we would like to be able to sort based on group (e.g. monthly intake); teacher; whether student is active/non-active; etc... I know there is a multiple filters function on this page, but my question is two-fold: 1. To begin with, how do we define users so that they are associated to a particular group (monthly intake), teacher, etc... We currently have students assigned to particular groups within the specific courses (based on self-enrolment via enrolment keys), but for purposes of 'Front End Admin', is there a way to set up these associations? 2. How do we then get the filters we want to show up on the filters page so that we can select them to sort our students? Also, ideally we would want a particular state to only have access to view students they manage (students in their own state) instead of a huge national list. In saying that, at a national level, we also do want access to view the entire list. How have others gone about this? Any answers/ideas are much appreciated. Liz H",

I know Moodle can be customized but I want to know if it can be customized to help us do the following things: 1) Create a workflow whereby the student can press a button to 'Submit to coach' or 'submit to advisor.' If sent to coach the assignment is put in a queue for the coach (with a notification), the coach gives feedback, returns it to the student, who can then make further changes. The student can then submit to advisor who actually assesses and assigns a grade. We envision that the coach would be able to see all assignments and progress of the student but this workflow would make it easy for the coach to see what the student wants feedback on. 2) Create an end of year repository for each student of all files submitted during the course of the class so that they can be compiled and used in case of auditing. 3) Create dashboards for administrators, advisors, coaches, and students to graphically show their progress through the course (our course is laid out at the beginning of the year and mostly remains static thereafter). Is this possible and if so, how much tinkering (in general - no need for specifics yet) would be needed to accomplish this goal? Thanks!",

The difference is between having a role and being assigned a role. If you assign someone student role at site level, that means that they have the student role in all courses, so you'll see them listed as a student in the participants lists of all courses on the site. But this role assignment is made only at the site level, you won't see this person listed as a student under 'assign roles' unless you actually added them at that level. In terms of permissions, it makes no difference. If someone is a student in a course, then they get student permissions regardless of whether the role was given to them at the course level or the site level. Hope that clarifies things.

Here is my Moodle Structure: Category: High School o   SubCat: A High School § Math § History § Etc. o   SubCat: Another High School § Math § History § Etc. I want the teachers (called \"course creators\") to be able to create their own courses at that third level (Math, History, etc..).  I have assigned roles to give them the right to create courses at both the SubCategory and Sub-SubCategory levels.  It LETS me set those rights at both levels.  BUT it does not actually GIVE the course creators the right to create the course at the Sub-Sub-Category level.  They can create courses at SubCat level (their specific high school) but NOT the lowest level.  I CAN create a course at that level as an administrator!  So I think it's possible… just a setting off or something. Have you encountered that or do you have any ideas on what might cause that??  I thought maybe these are inherited rights that are allowing them to do this in the upper levels but not in SubSubCat.  But not sure if that's it, or how to fix it.

So then, I guess the only way for a Teacher to alter permissions within a course is to through the \"Override permissions for others\" capability. Given permission, the teacher can then apply overrides to Student, non-editing teacher, or guest, or any other role that has been checked (by the admin) in the \"Allow roles override\" table.

I have an activity on the front page, and I want to assign a user to the 'teacher' role on that activity so that she can manage it. I've found that the user must be explicitly assigned to a front page role before she can be assigned to a role on the activity. If I assign the user to one of the default roles on the front page, such as student or guest, I am able to add the user to a role on the front page activity. However, if I create a new role (either from scratch or by duplicating an existing role) and assign the user to that new role on the front page, I cannot add the user to a role on the activity. The activity's assign roles page tells me there are 0 potential users. So, it seems there is some difference in the way default roles and created roles are handled. Or am I missing something? The front page activity is a hidden feedback, so I need the user to be able to see it. The role I've created is a duplicate of the Authenticated user role, with viewhiddenactivities set to allow. I'm pretty sure this worked in a previous version of 1.9.x (mid-summer or so). At this point, it seems that I have to assign the user to both the created role and one of the default roles on the front page in order to be able to give her a role on the activity. Any ideas?",

When a teacher is assigning roles on their course, they can see a list of all the users on the system and their email addresses.  I'm trying to prevent all users from displaying and instead only let them choose from a pool of users registered in their course for role assignments. This means that users in the teacher and/or course creater role needs to only see users in their participants list, while allowing administrators to see all users when assigning roles. I am also trying to accomplish this without touching the core moodle code; only using administrative options, roles/capability assignments, etc Basically, I want to see if there is an easy way to accomplish this rather than developing a separate solution outside of moodle. Any thoughts?",

I've added Role A to the categories as students and Role B to the courses as students - so the restrictions are fine but I don't want Role B to see what they can't have access to.

I can see that this is being caused by checking the setting in the new role that allows it to be assigned at the course level. I do need to be able to assign this role at the course level but I do not want it to be assigned by default when I upload new users. Any thoughts? Thanks, Chase",

          "Title": "Use \"parent\" role to grant assignment grading access?",
          "Text": "Hello On our installation of Moodle, students are enrolled on courses and have a course tutor but they also have a \"supervisor\" who meets with them regularly to monitor their vocational voluntary work while in training and gives them advice on their voluntary professional work and on the course in general, so akin to a personal tutor. Assignment of supervisors to their supervisees is done through a customised \"parent\" role in the context of the user. The supervisor needs to be able to view all grades for their supervisee, which I've been able to do via a front-page block thanks to the My Mentees Plugin, however the other requirement is that they also need to be able to grade some of their supervisees assignments related to vocational work they are supervising. For a course with 20 students, there will be one course tutor, but there might be 8 different supervisors for different students, who are not directly involved in the course and shouldn't have access to student identities or information other than their own supervisees.  Individual supervisors will supervise students from many different courses. I've been able to get it working using a custom role at the category level to provide basic access to the courses.  The role doesn't have permission to see students details or grades so normally when they go to the grading/submissions page of the assignment they can't see any student details, however by making the supervisor the \"allocated marker\" for their supervisee, they can see their entry only and grade it. This works, but for 9 assignments per course, 20 students per course and 15+ courses we're looking at over 2,500 manual allocations each year so this isn't ideal by any stretch. Who is supervising whom is already recorded in our installation of Moodle through the \"parent\" role in user context which is currently doing well providing access to supervisee grades, but I'm trying to work out if there's any way with permissions or otherwise to give the supervisors access to only their supervisees in the assignment grading/submission page based on the supervisor being assigned a role in context of the user. Sorry if that's a bit of a convoluted way of explaining or doing things.  I would appreciate any advice on how to achieve this without manually allocating supervisors each year, especially because the supervisor can change mid-year and the information is already in Moodle! Thankyou in advance CW",

This user may also be assigned another group in another course, and so on. The person would view grades only; no editing or approving of anything. User would not need access to view course activities. We do not utilize forums, discussion boards, etc. Basically for a supervisor to view progress of his/her assigned employees with scorm activities and quizzes, other activities like viewing files, lessons. The role would be assigned at the course level and then to a particular group. Do I create the available role in each course, or is there a way to create it so that it is an optional role for each course created? The supervisor would not have a site-wide role, just a course role (but multiple courses). I did view the docs for Grade Viewer Role, and wasn't certain about the last bit on restricting the role further. I would not want the Grade Viewer to be able to view any course activities site wide, only the courses in which the Grade Viewer has employees (and then to their specific group.) It sounds like you create the role as administrator and then with the view courses without participation to non-set; then the grade viewer would only view activities to specific courses. The grade viewer role would then show up in each course created as an assignable role ... ? The grade viewer would not need access to each activity, but just the completion status/grade. Or does access to the activity come with viewing grades? Please provide any feedback regarding whether this sounds like a \"parent\" or a \"grade viewer.\" Thank you!",

Would there be one that you can think of that would be preventing the grade viewer role to show up with manager and course creator in the assign system roles? I utilized \"archetype: Teacher (non-editing)\" then for context roles where this role may be assigned: Checked Course and Activity Module. Perhaps that still needed to be system; and then the further restriction to have it set by course was just a permission setting. Update: So I changed the context to system; and I was able to assign the role of grade viewer to a user. However, when I go to a specific course, I cannot enroll the person as a grade viewer. It shows up in the list of role renaming in course settings. I only have the choices of manager, teacher, non-editing teacher, and student when it comes to enrolling and then giving a role. When I select other users, the user who is a gradeviewer is listed (but not enrolled in the course.) I should say I am using the adaptable theme. Update #2: It looks like it is working by just enrolling the person as a student, it goes back to grade viewer. There are a few things accessible that I wouldn't really want accessible for this role. But looks like making progress. A person can edit the settings for the gradeviewer role without modifying settings for other roles, correct? If I need to, I could always just delete this new role or not use it?",

I really want this to be a simple straightforward way for a manager outside our organization to view the grades of their students, and not other students (I will have them in separate groups within courses.) So the grade viewer really needs very limited permissions to view grades of certain groups within certain courses. No messaging, no posting, editing, calendars, anything. When I go to limit permissions, is prevent just as good as prohibit? I built gradeviewer off the archetype non editing teacher.

Here is what I have hacked together so far.  I created a Category role called \"Reviewer\".  I gave it all of the \"view\" type capabilities. This isn't working like I hoped.  For one, I still have to add the users to the individual courses, even if I assign them the role for the whole category.  I somewhat expected this but, hey, I can dream can't I?  At least we can batch job this part. The other MAJOR problem that I have found is, in order to view all assignment submissions, the user needs mod/assignment:grade set to allow.  This means they could grade, as well as view, the assignments.  This is obviously not desirable. I think my next step would is going to be to look into a way to add a new capability, maybe something like mod/assignment:viewall.  Then either modify the core as needed or in some form of plugin. I have only been working with Moodle for about 4 months though, so there may be a beter way.  I am very open to suggestions/better ideas.",

Problem: Trying to create a role that was able to view and edit all courses for a handful of expert faculty / teachers so then can look at other teacher's courses when helping them with course design problems or questions. These teachers also helped to create courses, and other not site specific configurations. 1. Giving them course:view rights, allowed them into all the courses but listed them as participants, and the email spam that comes with being a participant. 2. Giving them site:doanything would remove all restrictions below it but would stop listing them as participants, and would stop the email spam from courses. 3. Hidding their assignment with course:view didn't stop the email, but hid them from the other students in a course. Solution: 1. Assigned Administrative (site:doanything) rights at the category levels. Then assigned site specific rights they needed, like user:create and user:delete at the site / global level. This allows them view and edit all courses without being listed as a participant or recieve email spam, and at the same time, the ability to add / delete users. This may help those wanting to have a littleAdmin type role, but don't want to assign all site level functions. Please let me know if you see something admist with my logic, if not, enjoy.",

As far as I’ve understood your problem, you wish to assign a manager role to the user. FYIthe manager role is by default provided in Moodle 2.4.  The site map for the manager role is given below. Please have a look at it. Home ► Site administration ► Users ► Permissions ► Define roles Now, specifically to resolve your problem ie to assign a manager role to the user, please visit the site map given below; select the role “manager” and then assign accordingly.

Steps I've taken: I've created a new role with legacy permissions of non-editing teacher called facilitator. Site wide I've enabled groupings, and in the course, I've created a group, with a grouping name and I've assigned the facilitator to that course. The course is set to force groups/separate groups Logged in as this role of facilitator, I am able to see scorm /activity reports for every user assigned to that course. However, for reporting I can only see those users assigned to the group. I need to prevent the facilitator role from seeing scorm/activity reports for all the users. I've tried the Mentee block, but this will be inefficient - some courses will have for too many members in a group for the facilitator to manage from the home page. Can multiple groups with different facilitators be added to this course and can I set it up so that the facilitator will only see reports, scorm, grades for the users in their group? Hoping someone can help.",

This role suppose to provide the ability to see all the courses in the system. Part of the viewres at the system, should have some additional \"powers\". Let's say it's posting to a forum and watching other's profile. There are 2 ways do define such a role: way 1 : to add another Role, named let's say Super Viewer & define all it's capabilities same as those for the Viewer but ALLOW posting in a forum and ALLOW watching other's profile. way 2 : to add another 2 Roles, one named let's say Forum Poster and other Profile Watcher. Forum Poster Role will have the capabilities for posting at the forum (only those!) and Profile Watcher will have only ALLOW at watching users profile capability. Then, any person who assigned to the Viewer Role and needs for more \"powers\" - will be also assigned to Forum Poster Role and Profile Watcher Role. As i see way 2 is better, as it allows more flexibility and clearity for a complex-multi-users System. Your opinion? (it's regarding 1.9 version, didn't find the sepparation for the versions in the forum)",

Trying to understand what is wrong, I looked in the database and found something in the table mdl_role_capabilities which I don't understand.  There is a row where the roleid is the id of my Calendar Editor role, capability is calendar:manageentries, permission is 1, and contextid is 1 (the system context ).  So far so good.  However, there is another row with the same roleid and capability, but contextid is 2 and permission is -1000.  Contextid 2 is the context with level CONTEXT_COURSE corresponding to the first row in mdl_course, the \"site course\" I guess you call it. There are a couple of things about this that are confusing.  In general, why is there a contextid on the role_capabilities table?  I understand why there is a context on role_assignments because a user has to be assigned a role in a specific context.  But I don't understand how capabilities themselves are assigned to different contexts. More specifically to solve my problem, my user is evidently blocked from adding site events because of the row in role_capabilities where contextid is 2 and permission is -1000.  What action do I take to change this?  How did it get there to begin with?  I don't want to just delete rows from the database of course, I want to do it correctly through the user interface, but how is that done?

Essentially we need 3 types of Permissions/Roles in our Moodle that need some basic configuration: Before I explain my 3 Roles, I have to explain how we intend to set up registration or access to our Moodle. We turned off email authentication and we will use Manual accounts. So we will manually set up or import our users with a default password they will need to change. We plan on using 1 Enrollment key for every Course Category. Most of our users have 12 months of access to the Courses in a Course Category  and can enroll into as many courses as they want within that Course category. One enrollment key will make remembering this easy. And since we are manually controlling access, we have tighter controls. 1. Guest Access: Guest can log in as a Guest, and take any course that requires Guest Access; like our Forums. With Guest Forum access they can view only, no posting. a. I think this is standard with moodle 2. Forum Access: People we manually enter with Forum access can post to our Forums that have Guest Access. a. They can also take any Guest course automatically. They can view all our other Student courses, but they cannot participate in any way. They can only participate in Forums. b. Even if they have a Student enrollment key, I want their Role to Prevent them from gaining access to Student Courses. 3. Student Access: People we put into Student roles, have Student access to Moodle and they can use their Enrollment key to gain access to Courses within a Course Category. a. Example: We have a Course Category called Widgets - Widgets A  …with 7 different courses under Widgets - Widgets A . We would like to enable 1 enrollment key for the entire Course Category Widgets A, and a student has access to only those courses in the category. i. Example continued: We also might have a Course Category called Widgets - Widgets B with one enrollment key, however I do not want Students who might gain that key the ability to enter the Course Category called Widgets - B until I enable them.

The default roles should work the way that person would logically expect them to work. 1. A teacher of a specific course should have course editing capabilities for that course and no other courses.  With the default settings, I tried to assign a user as a teacher for a specific course, and the user did not have course editing capabilitites. 2. A non-editing teacher of a specific course should have the capability to run the course without being able to edit the course.  Have not tested, but if the above does not work, there are probably problems with this one as well. 3. A person who is a global course creator, and a teacher of a specific course, on the main page for the courses they should be listed as a teacher, not course creator.  In terms of running a course, a teacher has a higher rank than a course creator.  Usually a course creator would be a secretary or a counselor or a department head.  A student does not care who created a course.  They care who is teaching a course.  Maybe make an option.  Assign teacher: <user A>, list as \"Teacher\".

Turn editing on (where ever the block is). Click the actions button (also known as Configure and Editing) on the block. Choose Assign roles in *** block.  It will tell you that this is not possible. Go back to the Administration block and choose Permissions. You'll see a short list of permissions and you can add/remove roles to these permissions, as needed. Since everyone is an authenticated user, it shows up for most blocks but with custom roles, you will probably have to add the role to the permissions.  Hope this helps.",

By overriding the Teacher role, you gave your teachers permissions that they have no way of using. That's because the Teacher role is assigned in the Course context, while the things you want to enable them to do (like create new accounts and edit profiles) are in the System context. Create a NEW role with just the needed permissions and assign it to selected users using Site administration -> Users -> Permissions -> Assign System roles. Then reset the Teacher role using the Reset to defaults button.",

          "Text": "Hi Debbie, The capabilities afforded by Permissions granted in Moodle are dependent upon \" context \", and are mainly summative where many roles apply. The 'Authenticated User\" is a role for everyone who is logged in. So if you're dealing with something on the Front Page the predominant role will be the Authenticated User. Note this can be set to any role you wish, but check Moodle Docs Front Page for more help. In a Course, those enrolled will also have the Student role, so any hiding of a block will require you to delete permissions for the Block for both Authenticated User and Student roles. You may wish to read through the Moodle Docs on Permissions , Roles , and Context , as it is a little confusing at first, but once you get it, you see how powerful it is. As an aside, the permissions aren't always summative. A Role can \" prohibit \" a function / feature, which means that even if it is allowed in one role, setting the prohibit permission in another role will ensure it is not available. In that case, using prohibit on the Authenticated User role would stop anyone but a Site Administrator from accessing the feature, so be careful. kind regards Gary",

This way, students will not see what groups they are assigned to from their profile. As for the Participants list in the Navigation block, you may not want to go to this extreme, but you can make that clickable Participants link a non-clickable link (so, preventing students from being able to navigate to the participants page) by setting the permissions of moodle/site:viewparticipants and moodle/course:viewparticipants to n/a.",

I don't know if you are using 1.9 or 2.0 but it doesn' t really matter in terms of roles - you don't need to define special system roles for this - you can use the normal \"student\" role for the first four and simply assign your students (users)to the relevant course category where you want them to be working. If you put passwords on all the courses then they won't be able to access any other categories anyway; only their own. CTP is more complex as I don't know if you want them to add users from outside of Moodle (which is either the admin role or a customised one that you will need to define) or a teacher (1.9) or manager (2.0) who would be in every category.",

For this we have created some users and addigned them as guests in the assign system role for a period of seven days. We have enabled guest access to our course with an enrolement key. I have created a test account and assigned the account as a guest user, but when i get to the enrolement into the course i enter the enrolement key and nothing happens. I recieve an email welcoming me to the course but i still cant access the course.. as in it stays on the same page.

If all you want them to do is be able to view the course as a guest, meaning they can't participate in any of the activities , you don't even need to create any accounts. The guest role is used, for the most part, to allow access to courses for those that have never logged into the site. To accomplish this, just go to your course settings and allow guest access with an enrolment key. When they access the course without logging in they will see an enrol me in this course screen that says: \"This course requires an 'enrolment key' - as a guest you must enter it each time you enter the course. You should have received it from (course teacher name)\" After they enter the correct enrolment key they are allowed to enter the course as a guest. If you want them to be able to participate in all activities then you can create some guest user accounts, enrol them in the appropriate courses and just give the guest users the username and password and let them login in and participate in the activities. After the 7 days change the passwords and you should be good to go. If you need more clarification just let me know. I would also recommend that you remove the users that you assigned at the system role level. Generally you don't want to assign users at the system level.",

It is basically a 'super user' with most of the privileges assigned to the administrator *apart* from being able to view or do anything with grades and is a global role for the whole Moodle site. This way my colleagues in the library can assist with Moodle help without having to become system wide administrators. However, this has had an unforeseen and unpleasant side effect. The two users who occupy the role of LMS are getting a barrage of emails from faculty who are posting to the News forum in their courses. It seems that they are defaulted to being participants in each course and therefore they are automatically subscribed to the News forum. Is there any way to repress this behaviour? The role functions that seem to be relevant are View subscribers, Manage subscriptions and Initial subscription but I can't see how these could be manipulated to prevent auto subscription in the News forum. Anyone got any ideas?? Cheers Mark PS I do think that the Roles/Capabilities system is extremely clever and double-plus kudos to those developers who thought it up and implemented it.",

If your users are redirected to the My home after login, you should try configuring it with the block Course overview which shows courses where users are enrolled in. Best would be upgrading to Moodle 2.4, where the Course overview block is much better crafted than in 2.2: http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Course_overview_block",

I need the courses that person is responsible for managing to be listed somewhere. I do not want them enrolled in the courses cause they are not participating. I have the courses block turned off as we do not want people to see all courses in our site. I am only using the vanilla blocks since I'm new and do not have help with administration. I have navigation turned on for my front page after login which shows people only the courses they are enrolled in. I thought I found the ability to allow for this manager role to add the courses block, but it didn't seem to do anything.

We go live in July to start rebuilding old courses from a very broken Moodle 1.9 and another broken 2.3. My sysadmin knows very little about Moodle and we have no developer. It's a risky situation already which is why I am trying to stay as close to vanilla as possible. I appreciate the links. We are an arts college and certainly want a non-corporate solution. I'm just looking to give certain capabilities to certain folks. I thought it would be easier. It seems to have more to do with the displaying said courses than anything else. I was writing more here just as you posted: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=260426#p1128788 I was excited when you wrote. Your posts to everyone are always so informative.

I don't think that plain vanilla Moodle can do that. You need to rethink the navigation/structure/access or do some code hacking. One approach could be to have two Moodle instances, one for administrative sites and one for teaching sites, for example. The overhead of having two instances is not much and gives you more flexibility to optimize site settings for their users. Also, enrolling those special users invisibly in the courses might bring you closer to your goal since they will have an explicit role but others won't see that.",

          "Title": "A historical curiosity, the original design document for Roles",
          "Text": "There is some speculative talk about changing how roles are combined for Moodle 2.0 ( Development:Role overrides revisited ). I am worried about this, because there is not point simplifying things if, in the process, they no longer work. After all, 7 hard-coded roles was a very simple system, and we had to change that because it was insufficient. I accept that, if anything, the current system tends towards the other extreme, of being too flexible at the expense of being too complex. Anway, in the process of trying to understand why the current system is the way it is, I wanted to see what was originally proposed. Amazingly, sam was able to put his hands on it even though it is 2.5 years old. He said it was OK if I posted it publicly, so here it is. (Sorry for the inconvenience, but I had to Zip it to make it fit in 100kB.) It is interesting to see the differences between what was originally asked for and what got implemented. I was a bit disappointed that this is only a design document. I don't think there was ever a clear statement of requirements. So the closest thing we have are probably the examples from the end of the document. They provide some motivation for the design. I also made a half-hearted attempt to start reverse-engineering the requirements on Development:Roles use cases . I guess I should add the original examples. Also, it occurred to me that some of Helen's Useful things a teacher can do with roles would also be worth looking though. Anyway, if anyone any thoughts about what we actually require from the roles system, please feel free to edit that use cases page. I was also rather amuse to see that some of the great innovations I have introduced for Moodle 2.0 are actually very like things that were in the original specification, but then forgotten about.",

          "Text": "Hello Tim, I am quite satisfied with the roles model. Improvement of the usability of the roles could be done, but that's more an issue of design and structure how to assign and manage roles. (assign roles with ajax would be less time consuming) There is also a problem with the roles hierarchy between the guest role und the authenticated user role. Generally the guest has more capabilities than the authenticated user, whereas the authenticated user is the user who I trust more than a guest and should have more rights than the guest (A guest just does not have to login and I can configure my moodle installation that only trusted users can login) So why place the guest user in the capabilities hierarchy over the authenticated user? That's the theory, but in real life this has following consequence (example) I want that a database with Moodle ressources can be updated by everyone who is logged in, but not by guests who are not logged in. If I override just the authenticated user role for the database, to be allowed to add an entry, the user can't do it, because he is considered as a guest. So I have to change the guest role too and allow a guest to add an entry. So a guest not logged in sees the \"Add entry\" tab but too, which is not wanted. (And the guest can't add an entry even if set to allow, that's good, but confusing). Only if the guest is authenticated user and guest he can add an entry. This is inconsistant. My proposition: Abolish the Authenticated user role and replace it with authenticated guest role (an authenticated user is automatically guest + authenticated). That would make more sense than the actual roles definition. Rollen Beschreibung Änderungen Administrator Administrators can usually do anything on the site, in all courses. 0 Course creator Course creators can create new courses and teach in them. 0 Teacher Teachers can do anything within a course, including changing the activities and grading students. 0 Non-editing teacher Non-editing teachers can teach in courses and grade students, but may not alter activities. 0 Student Students generally have less privileges within a course. 0 Authenticated guest All logged in users. They are generally considered as guests, but are allowed to enter text in some cases. 0 Guest Guests have minimal privileges and usually can not enter text anywhere. 0 What do you think about this inconsistancy and the solution? You can find the described problem under following link http://www.edumoodle.at/edulab/mod/data/view.php?id=6451 You will see that you are allowed to add an entry as guest, but can't add an entry. Only auth. users can do that. So the role model has to be revised for those two roles. Yours David",

My courses all have enrollment keys. However, I find that any registered student can enroll to a course without having to enter the enrollment key. Why is this and how do I fix this?

You are right that that is likely not causing your problem. It sounds like the frontpage roles that you have listed all of the students as students of the frontpage. If that is the case then they are automatically enrolled in every course. If you remove them as students you may find that there are things on the frontpage that you want them to be able to do.

Since this machine resides in a virtual machine in my computer memory, it gets shut down on a daily basis. Back to the actual topic... I found out that the actual reason for my problem was due to the fact of my courses (for purposes of short-term memory loss) had the same enrollment key and therefore drew it from my cookies causing anyone to be able to enroll to a course. I am the only person using this server so I would play the part of all the students signed up with this server. Thank you for your reply. I appreciate your time.

I think maybe I'm reading more into how things work than I should be. I saw the role definition as something similar to groups. Where you place a user under a certain definition and this in turn creates some form of access control. From what you've said it's kind of what I'm looking for, but not quite in the way that I've been seeing it. A perfect scenario would be: 1. 10 new users log on to the system. 2. As administrator I set up a \"parent\" role, allowing access to grades and forums. 3. I assign the role of parent to each new user. 4. The newly defined parents can now view their child's grades 5. Parents can also reply to forum posts by the school, but NOT students. Number 5 is a big stumbling block for me at the moment. I'm not sure if I should be assigning Parent role to the course that contains the forums, in some attempt to restrict access to Parents only; or if I should be simply setting an enrolment key or group definition instead.",

Please note that it only allows a parent to view their child's activity reports, grades, forum posts etc - it does not allow a parent to access their child's courses. If you want parents to be able to reply to forum posts by the school then the easiest way would be to enrol them as students in a course containing these forums i.e. assign users the role of parent in the user context and the role of student in the course context.",

I've followed the intructions in the Bug Tracker at http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-10585 and got the user set up to be the person on the course enrolment key page. (Pity this role seems to have to be assigned on a course-by-course basis?) When my test student clicks on the support user name (before enrolling in the course), they get \"The details of this user are not available to you.\" What capabilities do I have to give my Support role so that users can get in touch with them? I'd like it to be similar to the way learners can click on the teacher's name before they enrol in a course. Thanks, Mark",

In the same time, those persons might also be teachers in some courses and have be assigned the Teacher role on those courses.

That works fine, the user can \"look in\" on all the courses under that category level. BUT: In those courses where the user also was assigned the Teacher role, the user still could not edit the course activities . So, the role assigned on Category level seems to also set the limits for what a user can do on a course level, even if the user is assigned a \"higher\" role there.

Quite opposite really as each role should only have the relevant permissions set. In your case, you may want to revoke the capability to receive notifications from all roles, and then create a new role like \"Notifications recipient\" and assign that to selected users. Note this is just general approach I though, I haven't checked into details if that applies in your case, too. Let us know how it went!",

So if your question was related to this scenario, then the answer is yes. However, attention must be paid with roles assigned in higher context level, such as a category level contexts or site level context. Such roles are inherited on lower child contexts, so a manager role assigned at category level by default has the same capabilities on child contexts, such as courses belonging to that category.

I have a metacourse with a number of child courses, but I'd like to be able to add students to the metacourse who are not in any child course. When I try to do so as administrator I get the dreaded: 'Can not assign this role to user \"Jane Doe\" because Manage metacourse capability is needed.' I'm assuming it's possible to add students as the help file states, \"Participants may be added via the Student area within the Administration block in the Meta Course.\" I've tried the override function. When I turn on the override for admin, it doesn't help, but when I turn it on for student, I can actually enroll the student. The problem is that the student can then indeed manage the metacourse, i.e., they can add and delete child courses. What am I missing? Thanks,",

One is CONTEXT_COURSE_SECTION - sometimes we need to restrict access of particular students (or teachers, or editors) to particular sections of the course. Capabilities may be view, view hidden activities /resources, update existing activites/resources, grade activities and add new activities/resources and so on. This is very useful when sections are thematical parts of the courses and different people responsible for the materials in them. Another missing context is CONTEXT_ACTIVITY_ELEMENT, which allow modules to handle access to the individual elements within the instances. Existing schemas for some modules (such as wiki, where you can have student, group or global wiki, or the forums) are as rigid as old permission architecture of Moodle. It will be nice to have capabilities to restrict students right to edit wiki to the particular pages in group wiki, or restrict rights to post to specifical discussion in the forum.",

Regarding access control of course sections, you can configure the activities you have in that section individually. For example, if you want to disable students from doing anything in that particular section you can just override the student role with prevents in those activities in that section. At the moment CONTEXT_ACTIVITY_ELEMENT would be very hard to implement because unlike activities or courses, there are no central place to look up/track the instances of activities elements.

One option may be Nick Latronica's post about different role / different entry in header.html (thanks everyone). I Have been asked to have a site which has content that is visible depending on the user: guests auto login and can see a few topics, post only to a questionnaire and see course calendar entries ( for example 1 and 2) users type 1 can see and use access those plus a few more topics & resources (for example 1 - 4) users type 2 access a different group of topics (for example 1,2, 5,6) super users type 3 can pretty much act like course creators We can easily take guests to a course by a link in a topic on the front page (as often used), and simply add links in header.php for that course's theme to restrict navigation. The question is how do I hide the various sections /topics from the different users? Using roles must be the way but I do not seem to fathom it. The information all inter-relates and so putting it on one course is preferred. Only the super-users need some technical knowledge, the rest need it as plain to use as possible. Many thanks",

Up to this point, we have had instructors issue enrollment keys or add the students manually to their classrooms.  With the advent of the Fall 2012 semester, all of our instructors are required to have a Moodle classroom wherein they will keep their gradebook.  For this to work, all the students must have accounts and be entered into the various classrooms.  This necessitates either a massive amount of email being sent to students, or the instructors adding each of the students to their classrooms. In the face of these rather daunting options, we looked at the cohorts, which not only allow us to pull information afterward, but would be a simple way to add the students into the classrooms. Sounds rather nice and easy to be able to do that, except...  400+ classrooms and just one of me.  We have figured out the script to be able to export a list of students with their usernames and put them in their proper cohorts, the results of which create a file to import into moodle.  But then I would have to go into each classroom and add the cohort to the classroom. This would be rather time consuming and I'd like to avoid it if I can. Much nicer to have each instructor pick their 4 or 5 cohorts to add to their classroom(s). I don't want to have the instructors create cohorts or manipulate them in any way.  I just want them to be able to add the required cohort to their classrooom.  Since this is not an option, does anyone have any ideas on how we could possibly make getting the students into the classroom a little easier on me?  Please?",

At the same time, I would like to be able to set up a parent->teacher forum or some other online communication tool without student participation. Roles are obviously very powerful, but i'm tending to believe that due to the nature of parents being linked to particular students, parent access almost needs to be developed into its own module. I imagine it's all possible with roles, but the navigational interface doesn't really exists. Of course I could be missing something very simple, and I expect that once we understand the process for setting this up, the rest of these requests will fall into place.",

In my Moodle 4.3 platform, I have some resources added to my homepage (/?redirect=0) made available but not visible and then linked in the footer: one Page resource, one Database resource, and one Glossary resource. I have had these for almost a year without any problem -- until I noticed that the Glossary and the Page resource are only visible for a split second before redirecting guests (not logged in) to login/index.php. This doesn't happen with the database. I am 100% certain that it wasn't always like this -- the Glossary activity contains the FAQ for my website, which have been visited and read by guests. Now they are not available to guests anymore, which is an issue since I want non-logged in users to be able to read the FAQ. What I've tried / checked : Switched theme to Boost, but the problem was still there so it's not a theme issue Verified in the Page and Glossary activities that, in Permissions, mod/glossary:view and mod/page:view included 'Guest' (they both had all roles in 'view': Guest, Authenticated user, Authenticated user on homepage, Student, Teacher...) Set a permission override for 'Guest' in Activity: Glossary > mod/glossary:view to 'Allow' Does anyone have further suggestions on how to solve this? Thank you a lot.",

          "Title": "Roles vs. LDAP",
          "Text": "We have around 2,000 users connected to our Moodle, which is currently sitting at version 1.5.3 and connected to our Win2k3 Active Directory. I am in the process of testing 1.7 on a parallel install and finding that roles, while very powerful and obviously built on the sweat and caffeinated/sleepless nights of the developers, doesn't permit the automatic access that previous versions have permitted when tied to LDAP . In previous versions, LDAP integration allowed you to specify which OUs could login (students) and which OUs could create courses (teachers). Teachers could only administer their own courses. In 1.7, when using LDAP, the roles system throws a bit of a wrench into this system. You can still specify which OUs can login (students), and you simply need to define the default role as \"student.\" You can still specify when OUs can create courses (teachers), with their role automatically assigned as \"course creator\". However, in my reading and tinkering, I can't seem to find out how to keep these automatically created \"course creators\" from having access to all courses (I really need them tied to just those that they create). It seems that the ability to confine a teacher to a particular course category introduced by roles has a trade-off in that auto-created LDAP users get \"global edit\" capability. Am I missing something, or do I understand this correctly? If I understand this correctly, this puts me in a quandry. Moodle has always run \"transparently\" for us...teachers and students get an Active Directory account upon hire/enrollment in the district, which automatically gives the teachers the ability to login and create/run their own classes (only) and students the ability to login and enroll in classes for which they have the key. While roles offers some really great granular control of users, it takes away this automation by ironically weakening the security of the system. The only seeming way to fix this is to create a course category for every teacher, login as that teacher (to autocreate the account in Moodle), logout and back in as administrator, and then assign the teacher course creator rights only on this individual course category. I think, for simplicity's sake, I might be better upgrading to 1.6 and avoiding 1.7. Any comments, clarifications, or (hopefully) corrections would be much appreciated.",

Capabilities/moodle/course:view doesn't do what one might expect (it only allows/prohibits viewing a course without enrolling). If Moodle had something like \"Capabilities/moodle/course:access\" or \"Capabilities/moodle/category:view\", I might control access through role assignments. Thanks again, Ted",

          "Text": "Sounds to me like you want a cohorts setup... Shouldn't be too much work, 2 cohorts and modifying the enrolment method for\na hundred or so courses. Essentially you get rid of the self-enrolment and setup cohorts of your\nregular users, 1 or more depending on how many different groups you want\nto consider e,g accounts staff can access this set of courses; warehouse staff\nanother set etc. By the sound of it though you'd only need 1 for your regular\nusers as they can access any course. Then you add another cohort for the\nexternal users. With the cohorts established you use the cohort sync enrolment method\nand enroll the regular students into all courses while your externals can\nbe enrolled onto selected courses. There wouldn't be any need for enrolment\nkeys or the use of conditional access. With cohorts the user is effectively\nalready enrolled on the course by way of their membership of the cohort, even\nthough they haven't accessed it. The external users would then not be able to access any course that didn't\nhave their cohort as part of the enrolment scheme. You can even have multiple\ncohorts for the external users if you want a certain group of users to access a\ncertain set of courses. I hope this has been of some help but if you need any help please don't\nhesitate to let me know. John Gifford",

          "Text": "At our school, teachers do not enrol students in courses. So, I made a role \"Office Manager\" by copying \"Editing teacher\", and adding some capabilities I figured she needed: SYSTEM moodle/site:sendmessage moodle/user:changeownpassword moodle/user:create moodle/user:delete moodle/user:update USERS moodle/user:editprofile moodle/user:viewalldetails moodle/user:viewuseractivitiesreport AUTHORIZE - ALL CATEGORY ENROLMENTS enrol/category:synchronised I assigned this role in the System context for our Office Manager. Therefore she also got the role in a course. So far so good, but although she could enrol users in that course, she did not get the capability to assign them roles (i.e. a student could enter the course but would not have the role of student in it). In the interface for enrolling users in the course, the dropdown menu for roles is empty. I double checked that her role had the capability \" Allow_role_assignments \" in the context of the course. It did have it in the system context and in the context of the individual course as well. I am stumped. If the role has the same capabilities as Teacher (and then some), plus this one capability needed to assign roles in a course (verified by the permissions check), why can't she? -- Side note: At the same time, I want to restrict the teacher role to NOT be able to enrol and unenrol students, so if someone knows how to do that, I'd be very grateful! Thanks, T",

Each course we have set up has its own Grouping and Group.  i.e Course1 Group is a member of Course1 grouping.  Students are added to the relevant group for each course. However, we have a batch of students that see a complete list of courses when they login.  Even courses that they should not have permissions to view.  i.e in the example a above a student in the Course1 group will also see Course2, Course3 etc. on the logged in home page (MyMoodle is NOT enabled). The admin > Front page > Front Page settings are set to - Front page items when logged in = List of courses Default role on the logged in home page = Students BUT if I turn this off then nobody sees any courses on the logged in home page at all. Even admin. Any ideas about how I restict the list on the logged in home page to just the courses that the student has permission to see would be much appreciated.  Or even just some ideas on what paramters to check?

          "Text": "Hello all. I am working on migrating a large 1.9 site to Moodle 2.x.   Our school started with Moodle 1.5, and have a large 1.9 site now a few years later. Something I noticed on our test upgrade, is that something has changed in the way roles & capabilities combine. For many years now, we have done the following, and it's worked perfectly: -- We have student workers (grad students) who help instructors manage their courses.    They are paid employees of the school.   It is their job (20 hrs a week) to support the instructors. -- The students are given a sitewide role \"Graduate Assistant\" which has moodle/course:manageactivities-> Allow. -- The student role has moodle/course:manageactivites set to Prevent (rather than the default of \"Not Set.\") In m1.9, the clever combined effect is that our student workers can modify course materials for any course in which they are not enrolled. If they are enrolled in a course, their ability to modify the course is revoked by the role math. In m2.x, it appears that the calculation is not the same.   Students who are given a sitewide Grad Assistant role can modify any course, even the ones they are enrolled in. Has anyone experienced this problem?  Is this how it's supposed to work now?   course:manageactivities is just one of many capabilities that we grant to Grad Assistants but revoke in the student role.

Can you explain why?   For my benefit and for the forum history...  Wasn't I doing exactly what the documentation says to do? Grad Assistant role had course:manageactivities->Allow. Student role had course:manageactivities->Prevent. Joe Smith is assigned the Grad Assistant role sitewide.   He also enrols in one class, LIS400. When he looks another class, say LIS200, his sitewide Grad Assistant role should give him the ability to manage course activities . When he looks at his class, LIS400, he has two roles in effect:  GA at the sitewide level, and Student at the course level.   The sitewide allow should be reversed by the prevent at the lower (course) level. I've pasted the docs below...  doesn't the description of Prevent explicitly say it should be able to remove permissions that were set at a higher level?  And the description for Prohibit says it is for the reverse case... when you want at a higher level, to block any lower level from allowing a permission . Thanks again for your quick help! -Garret http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Override_permissions Allow This enables a user to use a capability in a given context. This permission applies for the context that the role gets assigned plus all lower contexts. For example, if a user is assigned the role of student in a course, they will be able to start new discussions in all forums in that course (unless a forum contains an override with a prevent or prohibit value for the capability). Prevent By choosing this you are removing permission for this capability, even if the users with this role were allowed that permission in a higher context. Prohibit This is rarely needed, but occasionally you might want to completely deny permissions to a role in a way that can NOT be overridden at any lower context. An example of when you might need this is when an admin wants to prohibit one person from starting new discussions in any forum on the whole system. In this case they can create a role with that capability set to \"Prohibit\" and then assign it to that user in the system context.",

If the user is a site admin, then YES they can do anything. Otherwise ... 2. Get all the role this user has in this context. As well as the explicit role assignments, there may be other special roles like Authenticated user, or Front page ... 3. For each of those roles, work at the permission that applies in this context. That is, look at the role definition, and any overrides in this context or its ancestors. If the definiton, or any of the overrides are PROHIBIT, then the permission for this role is PROHIBIT, otherwise the the permission is the most specific override, or the value from the role definition. 4. Now combind the permissions from all the roles. If any of the permissions are PROHIBIT, then the final answer is NO. Otherwise, if any role allows the capability, then the final answer is YES. Otherwise, if no role allows the capability, the answer is NO. I will let you work out the consequences of these rules yourself, and hence whether the documentation needs to be updated.

I'm hoping Mary Cooch, who follows me when I don't stalk her, will chime in on this. The usual default role is Authenticated user, so I'm at a loss as to why you don't have that role available. I *think* the \"you are allowed to\" line is a generic Moodle and has nothing to do with what an admin (you) can actually do.

I find that when there is a dual role for a user, the lower privileges prevail so the teachers can no longer administer the course.  I can't figure out how to fix this. Any ideas?",

I need a person with that role to have course:view applied at the site context (in 1.7 terminology). Can Moodle 1.8.0 do this using hidden role assignments? If I were to apply a role assignment at the System context (in 1.8 terminology) and make it a hidden assignment, would the user see a \"My Courses\" list or a \"Course Categories\" list (assuming they have no other explicit roles to other courses)? Is this how hidden role assignments work (as well as not displaying the user on the course listing pages)? This may be the thing that convinces me to move from 1.7 to 1.8, but (since I have a lot of little homegrown hacks in place that I would need to adapt to 1.8) I want to make sure that it will actually solve the problem first.

Thinking creatively, I guess you could do it via creating a conditional activity for each resource and then only showing the document if they have a required grade on the other activity. Then giving each student in each cohort / group an appropriate grade in the appropriate resource would work for it. In fact, you could do it by just having 1 dummy activity which you grade, giving all students in one cohort 25%, and the others 75%. Then add conditional activities to the two resources to be 'above 50%' for one, and 'below 50%' for the other.  If you think they might be concerned about getting a 25% I guess you could do it much higher (eg. 99% and 97%??). I haven't tried this, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Having said that I think it could be something worth considering for the future direction of Moodle, so perhaps see if a feature request has been made and if not, suggest it.",

So it doesn't pass any cell with an unbalanced number of As and Ps and outputs P. I must admit I don't really see how this makes sense in practice. Wouldn't one expect that the System-context is the last \"fallback\" that is never skipped especially when it gives a clear answer? This forces me to explicitly assign roles for the Block (or Frontpage)-context which --- from the users view --- are already assigned at the system context only to make the intended fallback to the System-context work: Role 3 2 Role-Def 3 Block R8 P, A 2 Frontpage 1 System R7, R8 A, A Is there a nicer solution?

I only discovered this detail of the algorithm last October (by reading the code), and it surprised me at the time.

I've started with course creator as the base role, and am adding permissions, here's a list of what I can't get this account to do, and was wondering if somebody could help: * View all courses - (I can turn this on, but then in 'my courses' this user has all courses in their list, i want admin-style behaviour where every course is accessible, but the learner is not considered to be a part of that course) * Edit/Move/Delete course - I've turned on 'delete course', but I want the account to be able to 'turn editing on' at the Course Categories page * Assign system roles - The user can assign roles within a class, but how can this user be allowed to assign system wide roles?

In my opinion we should have separate capabilites moodle:course/view and moodle:course/participate, where the first lets you see the course, without adding you to the official list of participants. 2. There were a lot of bugs with that until last week. Try upgrading to Moodle 1.9.3+ weekly on Wendesday. Hopefully that fixes all your problems. If not, please report any remaining bugs in the Tracker. 3. This is controlled by the same moodle/role:assign capability, however, you also have to make sure the role allow assign settings (on the other tab next to define system roles) lets your subadmins assign the other roles you want them to be able to assign. 4. You should be able to fix this with the right roles settings. You probably need to override the Subadmin role in the front page context to Prevent some things.",

There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this across the whole site, other than drilling into each category and clicking on Assign roles (and maintaining a separate spreadsheet). I have found a way to list all users with site-level and course-level roles across the site: You can search for all users assigned at site-level by going to Site Administration > Users > Permissions > Assign system roles You can search for all users assigned to course-level roles by going to Site Administration > Users > Accounts > Browse list of users > Show advanced and selecting the role you're interested in. This only shows the list of users (but not the courses in which they have the role assigned) but it's still helpful - e.g. generating a list of all teachers. You can see what permissions a user (across the whole site) by clicking on their profile and viewing Settings > Profile settings for XXX > Roles > This user's role assignments. Is there any view that can be generated to list out all users assigned to roles at category level? The above view are all in different areas of the site so I thought there might be something I'm missing... Thanks Sarah.",

To test whether things I set up on my course moodle site (such as quizzes, questionnaires, display of grades, etc.) work as expected, I switch to Student role and take a look. However, in this role, I can't see everything a student sees. And I can't see what the course moodle site would look like at a specific future time when I want to do something (such as hold a quiz). Because of that gap, sometimes I think I've set up something correctly, but it fails when I actually try to use it during a lecture, which is not a good time to fail. For example, I've set up online quizzes and forgotten to adjust all of the several time and visibility settings, resulting in the quiz being invisible to students and requiring me to stop the lecture until I figured out which one of the settings I should fix. I'd like to test these things in advance by switching to the role of a dummy or phantom student who has all the access rights of a real student, and I'd like to be able to adjust the time temporarily to particular periods in the future, such as during a lecture. Would it be possible to add such a feature to Moodle?",

          "Title": "Restrict non-editing teacher's ability to see info outside of its group?",
          "Text": "I'm looking for recommendations on an approach to limit what information a non-editing teacher can view in a course in Moodle 4.4.1. Background We are selling access to a course built in our Moodle LMS. We are using a single course for all customers/schools. In the course we have applied the following settings: Group mode: Separate groups Force group mode: Yes Default grouping : None At this time, we are only supporting self-enrollment using an enrollment key. We create a new Self-enrolment enrollment method for each school that purchases access. Here are some of the key properties we are utilizing: Custom instance name: School name Allow new self enrolments: Yes Enrolment key: we generate a unique key and enter it here Use group enrolment keys: Yes Default assigned role: Student Max enrolled users: we set to the number of users purchased Next we create a new group in the course for the school. Here are the key properties we are utilizing: Group name: School name Enrolment key: same key that was generated for the Enrolment key Group membership visibility: Only see own membership or Hidden So far this is working well for us. We are able to provide each school with their unique enrollment key and when users enroll, they are automatically added to the group. From my testing so far, this has been sufficient to ensure students can't find students from other course groups. For additional context , we have comments, discussions, and messaging disabled so there's really no need for students to find each other. What we desire Next we want to figure out how to get the teacher into the course. The primary purpose for this is so that the teacher can track student progress and to view students' grades. The teacher does not need much else and does not need to be able to edit grades. The assumption is that if the teacher wants to utilize the grade results from this course, they will have to manually copy them over to their own system (until next year when we get LTI with grade sync working). Requirements: A teacher can be added to the course as a non-editing teacher or similar custom role The teacher can view their students in the course participants section, but filtered to just the students in their group regardless of the selected filter The teacher can view the gradebook, but is limited to only the grades of the users in their school's group The teacher can not find any data from users of a different group A single course is used for all schools As you can infer, we are trying to answer data privacy concerns before we allow teacher roles in the course. I'm looking for validation that this is achievable and that I'm not missing anything obvious from my initial testing mentioned below. Questions Is it possible to restrict the data a user can view by a group? Is this actually the default behavior in moodle when using Separate group mode? I tested this by creating a group and enrolling 1 teacher and 1 student in the same group. There are other participants in the course too. When I signed in as the teacher and viewed participants, my view was automatically filtered by my group. I then removed my group filter and applied changes. Interestingly, I still only see users in my group. I then went to the gradebook and I again only see users in my group and I don't see a way to remove the filter here. If this seems like asking too much out of Moodle, what would you recommend to achieve similar functionality? We are trying hard to avoid duplicating courses for this school year. Is it possible to create one self-enrollment key used for students and another used for teachers that both enroll into the same course and group but with different roles? How does a user manually enroll in a group using a group key? I assume this must be possible somehow, but I haven't seen a place a user can go to join a group manually. What gotchas and downsides will we run into with this methodology?",

Regarding adding a teacher to a group manually, assuming they have an account on the site, go go the course as admin, click Participants in the course navigation and click  the Enrol users button and enrol them as non-editing teacher - and then from the dropdown on the left, click Groups and manually move them from the box on the right to the correct group on the left. An alternative if you want them to self enrol is to set up self enrolment with a group enrolment key but make the 'Default assigned role' non-editing teacher (yes you can do this, when you access the self-enrolment settings)  and only tell the teacher that group enrolment key - otherwise students could enrol themselves as non-editing teachers instead of students.",

Login as the user you have assigned to the helpdesk role. Manually visit the \"browse list of users\" page (copy/paste link).

          "Text": "Hi folks, Here I am stirring the pot again wondering if there are more of you who would like selective release functionality built into Moodle like it is in WebCT. We have many teachers teaching multiple sections so that they've become accustomed to setting release dates for blocks of content called learning modules in WebCT. When the course shells are duped, the selective release dates are duped in all the sections. Unfortunately, I've found no workaround in Moodle. Moodle's initial work on activity locking is too granular. Selective release in WebCT also allows a teacher to release content based on a student's name, his former score on a course activity, or group membership. Now, I can create a group and add it to a grouping to restrict content to users but we also want to give teachers the capability to release blocks of content based on dates to all students. Now, I posted this in roles as it seems that maybe this is where this post should go. If you disagree, please move it to the general developer forum or another. Anyway, hope to hear from you.",

A simple example today - some information included on the site that is irrelevant after Monday next week.. I don't want to have to go and delete it manually..

I've been setting faculty as system course creator, but this doesn't appear to to make them the teacher of the course they create so I've instructed them to go back and also make themselves the teacher of the course. In some instances I've noticed after they create the course they end up only being able to enroll themselves as a student and I have to go in as a system admin and set them as a teacher. I guess that means I have a few questions as well. What is the difference between a system course creator found in the system roles and the course creator role found in the course? Same question about the teacher role as well. What I would like is that all users in my faculty AD group are given the ability to create courses. If they create the course, they are defaulted as the teacher. BTW using version 1.9.3 Thanks, -David",

          "Text": "Hi David. If you are a course creator within a category (maybe your categories are faculties/departments like ours -French for example) then you should only be able to create courses in that category. If you have course creator role assigned system wide (via the front page site admin>users>permissions>assign system roles)then I believe this makes you able to create courses in any category throughout the Moodle. It is always better to restrict roles to one department/category/course rather than have them system wide - just as in a school you wouldn't have a maths teacher ordinarily able to set up classes in geography/history whatever, so you shouldn't really on Moodle. As for teachers then - assigning them the role of teacher system wide (via assign system roles) makes them able to teach - edit -and get the grades of students in all courses all over the Moodle. They should only be given teacher role in the courses in which they teach. Or - in the category they teach in , like say, English . It's the same with students and is a common errror made when setting up Moodle. Students should be put into the courses they study and not assigned system wide or every course will have every student and cause mayhem -as it would if they all turned up to one class in the real world! I think what confuses people is that in real life we are teachers or students - but in Moodle, when we log in, we are just \"users\" who could be made teachers in one course and students in another. If you as a teacher wish to have a look around a course of someone in another faculty you would be a student in there. Likewise if you wanted to give your class editing rights on a Moodle page to run a school club for example, they would be given the teacher role in Moodle even though they are \"students\" in the real world.",

Our Moodle has been mis-managed since before I started and essentially all members of staff were system level course creators.

One work-around I've been using is to go to Assign Roles > search for \"Mr\", \"Miss\" etc. and adding them that way as they are labelled Staff / Teacher and I can ignore the ones labelled Parent. I can see this taking a while if I have to do it to a few categories. I've also gone to \"Bulk user actions\" and there I can search for \"Teacher\" / \"Staff\" rather than Miss / Mr and get a comprehensive list, but can't see a way to bulk assign them to a role. Any help would be greatly appreciated - let me know if i'm not being clear and i'll try to clear it up. Stephen",

Instead of having teachers as system roles, I add them now for individual courses. I changed the permissions for the system admin role to having permission for everything, instead of undefined permissions (the far left option - think my wording is incorrect). Which brought about the issue that the admin is denied permission to view all logs but the course logs. In trying to solve this one, I added the admin as a system teacher, to see if this changed the access to logs. It did, but in a bad way because I was no longer an admin, but a teacher with fewer permissions.\nAfter a bit of sweating I managed to restore admin access (thanks to great forum documentation!) but am still left without access to the logs.\nIdeas? thanks Ann-Marie",

This facilitated teacher idea and content exchange without confusion to the student of who the \"real\" teacher was.\n\nAs a convenience, we also added library staff as hidden teachers at the Category level so they could add supporting course materials.\n\nLastly, we added department chairs and principals/division heads as hidden non-editing teachers in their relevant categories as this helped them keep track of what was going on.\n\nAfter checking earlier forum posts, it appears that my only option to accomplish this is Other Users - Managers. The risks of inadvertent changes being made are higher than I would like. Has anyone found a good alternative yet?",

You probably want to start by copying the teacher role, but then change: name, shortname and description moodle/course:view permission to Allow. Context types where this role may be assigned to Category and Course Then you can add people to the course (via other users) or the cateogry in this new role. The 'hidden role assignments' thing in Moodle 1.9 was always a bit of a work-around for the fact that Moodle did not really support this way of working, and the new options in Moodle 2.x are meant to be an improvement. I think they are, anthough they may be a bit more complex to understand at first.",

They do not have access to areas such as Security, Server , Plugins, Appearance, or Advanced Features, which are reserved for those in the Site administrators group .\" By default, on each of my 6 Moodle sites, when I give someone the Manager role they see, and have access to, the entire Site administration menu (including Security, Server, Plugins, etc.). The only features that are available to a Site Admin that are restricted to Managers (that I can tell) is that they cannot edit the Site Admin profile, they cannot give the Admin role to another user, assigning a system role is limited as is their ability to use Capability overview (under permissions). I have avoided assigning this role to anyone because of this. Now from the above documentation it is clear to me that this should not be the case. My question is simply how can I change this; limit the overly extensive access/privileges for this role? I cannot find any settings which control or restrict the Manager role to areas mentioned above (ones that should be only available to the Site administrator). If these are to be found under the Define role capabilities, I certainly cannot find them. Also note that I have not changed any of the default setting in this area. I am using the default settings.

Our high school counselors would like to be able to check the grades for the students assigned to them.      Is there a way to limit the ability to loginas for the counselors?   With a few thousand students and a couple dozen counselors, assigning 'mentor' role to the counselors would be a headeache. We use LDAP for enrollment information.   I was thinking of creating an LDAP group for each school, then make all the counselors 'teachers' of that class(LDAP group).  Could the permissions be set to allow the counselors to login as the student, but block them from other school's students?",

The problem is a logged in parent cannot see the activity reports for a particular course unless the parent is enrolled in the course. Example: Patricia Parent sees her son Samuel Student in the Mentee's block when she logs-in. Clicking on Samuel Student shows his profile and courses. Clicking on \"Calculus\" then \"Activity Reports\" gives me the error \"This course is not enrollable at the moment.\". Now, if I enroll Patricia Parent as a student then she can see what she needs for Samuel student, but then she can do everything a student can (such as respond to homework assignments). How can I have it such that Patricia Parent can see Samuel Student's activity logs without being an enrolled member of a course? I have the following permissions as \"Allow\" for parent: moodle/user:viewdetails moodle/user:readuserposts moodle/user:readuserblogs moodle/user:viewuseractivitiesreport",

Here is what I've tried (beyond double checking role permissions and setup as per the Parent_role documentation): a.) allowing guest access in the course: this allows the parents to see their student's activity logs within a course. problem: the parent can also see and submit journal entries?? Nothing I have tried on role overrides has stopped the parent access to the Journal module both in reading their student's entries and being able to submit their own. I thought Journals were supposed to be private? If I could find a way to make journals private then I think this could be a decent solution. b.) allowing enrollment in the course and enrolling the parent: this also allows the parents to see their students activity logs within a course. problem: now parents can submit their own work to assignments and activities within the course. Also parents are now listed as participants et. al. which would really confuse things for teachers. I'm at a loss at this point as I'm not sure why the permissions aren't propagating as it seems the documentation says it should. Any ideas?",

I've found a way to do it, but I can't see how to add a new capability in order to chang the behaviour of an existing component (in this case the calendar) . When adding a new component I create a folder 'db' and a file 'access.php' that sets the new capabilities. If I'm looking to patch the existing calendar, should I just do the same and create a version.php file so that it can be updated in the system or is there a generic place to set new capabilities?",

The current approach is to make everyone a site administrator, which as you can imagine is a bad approach. Less is more. So I'd like to go back to 2 site administrators who can designate three types of managers: - one to manage users (add/delete) - one to manage SQL queries (some institutions use them a lot). I don't like these two roles, as they offer access to all users, but I don't have a choice. I think they'll be in system context , if I've got it right. Where I will have a choice is for the third role, on the functional side. Each institution is going to have a Functional Administrator, who I would like to have rights only in a root category (Our Moodle has 7 course categories for 7 institutions), so in category context.",

The problem is that each teacher is responsible for  1-2 or 3 days of the entire course and at the rest of the days he has to be able only to see course/participants information but cannot change anything since it is not the assigned day for him to teach. Let's say I have course A and teacher a , b and c . a is teaching mon and tue b is the teacher for wed c is the teacher for thu and fri I assign for a , b and c the teacher role limiting it for the time interval in which they actually the teacher. I need that a will be able to see information about participants also from wed to fri when he is not the teacher. So I thought to create a special role for the days the teacher is not actually THE teacher and assign it to a from wed to fri BUT I understand that I can assign few roles to same teacher but only one time interval (start time-end time) and not a time interval for each role. Is there a way to do that? with some plugin or other solution? Thanks!!",

They simply stop to have access when their enrolment period is over. This is to alleviate our workload. * the course is set to authorise guest access (sothat anyone can have a look at some content before choosing to enrol) And this problem: students whose enrolment has expired can still access the course as a student . Since their enrolment period is over and that their enrolment status is \"Inactive\" (or \"Not current\" as displayed), you would expect them to receive the guest role. It's a serious problem because they should not be able to do what regular students are. A first logical answer to this is to simply delete these enrolments. Of course that's always possible but for different reasons it is not very practicable. So I'd like to know what settings would prevent this behaviour. Thanks Sébastien",

So I went and assigned all the students the role 'student' and adapted it to what I (think) is what permissions I want them to have. When I tested by logging in as the student, they were enrolled in all the courses?!?! I has only enrolled them in a few courses before I assigned them the role? Is there a silly little radio button I accidently allowed or prohibited I wasn't meant to? I went through it all and couldn't see anything would allow it? Any help would be muchly appreciated!",

          "Text": "Hi all, BEFORE: I used Moodle 1.9 before and when I created users for our system, I assigned \" Teacher System Role \" to all of teacher users. And the problem was every teacher could see and access to every courses in the system. However I didn't want like that so I just let \"Authenticated Role\" as default for every users. Then for each teacher, I assigned him/her with \"Teacher Role\" into his/her courses only. Next, I created a \"Custom Teacher\" role, and assigned some teacher users into this role. Then I set permission on some sections / activities and so on for this custom role. NOW: I upgrade to Moodle 2.6 . And I try to create a new \"Custom Teacher\" role, but I don't see the area that allows to assign users into it like the previous version of Moodle. I am using a \"All User List\" plugin and I try to add this block into Front Page . I'd like every teachers can see this block and edit every students' profile (such as \"Changing Password\", ...) I change role for this block, I just see the Teacher System role and Custom Teacher role in the list of roles. However every teacher users just have \" Authenticated Role \", they don't have \" Teacher System Role \" as I describe above. So they can not see the block in Front Page. If I assign \"Authenticated Role \" for this block, every authenticated user, even students in the system can see it. My English is not very good so my explanation seems to be long, I'd like everyone can understand my situation and support to me and tell me more about Roles in Moodle. Thanks, Toan",

Either that, or start with the Student role and remove the permissions that result in gradebook entries - but what are those? Rather than re-invent this wheel, can someone help?

The \"Student without grades\" approach would likely involve fewer changes, but of course the trick is figuring out which permissions result in the creation of grades in the gradebook so they can be turned off. Either approach would like end up with the same result... Again, I was hoping that someone who has already done it would be willing to share.

(Using Moodle 1.9) I would actually like to be able to go further than this and create \"labels\" throughout which would only be visible to teachers.... to give them \"hints\" on how to teach a particular section etc. I hope this makes sense and someone might be able to help me or guide me in the right direction to look.",

In 2 years, no one has accidentally managed to unhide the resources or the labels. If they did, we'd just go back and hide them. So, I'd vote to keep it simple and just use hide. But here's a cumbersome workaround. Make two classrooms. In one, you enroll the teacher(s) but not the students. Place all the resources you want kept secret in that classroom (it's your repository). Make a second classroom in which students are also enrolled. Put hidden links in this classroom to the resources in the other classroom. Students will not be able to access resources in the other classroom, but teachers will. If you work like my organization and mass duplicate classrooms, the above will require manually inserting links to the first classroom in every classroom you duplicate.

I'm using Moodle 2.03+ (Build: 20110525) and it's running on a Centos 5 server using MySQL . Thanks!",

          "Text": "OK, you are probably wondering why I would wish to do such a thing. When we first moved to Moodle 1.8, I left the default roles in place. However, I quickly learned that the \"Teacher\" role had the short name of \"editingteacher\" and the \"Non-Editing Teacher\" had the short name of \"teacher.\" Each enrollment period I forget to set the default role short name correctly, so this year I edited the roles to make the short name \"teacher\" go with the role of \"Teacher\" and edited the properties to match those of \"editingteacher\" and the short name of \"editingteacher\" has a name of \"Default Teacher role (carryover)\". It didn't take me long to realize this was the wrong solution. So, what I would like to do now is convert every \"editingteacher\" role to a \"teacher\" role and then delete the \"editingteacher\" role. It seems to me this should be a trivial MySQL statement, but there may be multiple places that need to be changed and I don't want to go off half-cocked. If anyone has experience in this or can provide some guidance I would be very appreciative. Thank you, Richard",

My site role default is set at \"guest.\" However, I wanted everyone to be able to post in some forums that I have on my home page. In order to do this I had to modify the guest permissions to allow guests to post in forums. I then realized that I didn't want them to be able to post in the site news forum, so I created a role override to prohibit them from posting in it. It didn't work. I should clarify... it did work, but only if the person was actually in the \"guest\" role. As of now, everyone on my site has no role in the context of the site. I thought that they would automatically get the default permissions of a guest, but it appears that they don't. In that case, what does a default role really mean? When new users sign up on the site, they don't become guests... they just have no role like everyone else. Do I really have to manually put all 1000 users into the guest role and check back frequently to make sure that I put newly registered users in this role as well? Please help, I have wasted many days messing with this and I need saving while I still have hair.",

          "Title": "Firefox extension to help with copying roles",
          "Text": "We (UMN) have multiple Moodle instances (dev, test, prod, 2.2, 2.4, archive, ...) and so far couldn't seem to find a tool to copy roles from one instance to another. While waiting for development of a tool that properly copies data from the role_* tables, we thought that the most tedious part in the manual process is to match the capability/ permission from the existing role to the new one, so we whipped up a Firefox extension to see if it can help our Moodle admins a bit. Usage: After installing the extesion to Firefox (menu File > Open ..., select the xpi file, no restart required), when you are in add/edit role page (the URL looks like /admin/roles/define.php?action=edit&roleid=1), right-clicking in Firefox will show the context -menu with an entry \"Copy Moodle role settings\". After copying, another context-menu entry called \"Apply Moodle role settings\" will appear, allowing you to apply the copied role settings (to another role tab/window). So, instead of copying the roles from one server to another, we go the long route by copying the role's capability/permission through the browser, from one tab to another. Note that the extension is purely in-browser, nothing changes until you hit the \"Save changes\" button on the add/edit role page. This extension simply read the radioboxes values from one tab and apply to the radioboxes of another tab. I picked the generic name \"moodyfox\" with the plan to add more features to make Moodle easier to use with Firefox. Feedbacks are very appreciated. Source repo: https://github.com/hqhoang/moodyfox Binary (xpi file): http://dl.bintray.com/content/hoang027/MoodyFox/moodyfox_2013040901.xpi?direct Note: the extension only activates if the URL matches /.*moodle.*\\/admin\\/roles\\/define\\.php\\?action=.*/, so you might not see the entry \"Copy Moodle role settings\" in Firefox context-menu if your server doesn't have \"moodle\" in its URL. Maybe I should relax that matching rule a bit?",

You can add \"Sticky blocks\" under site administration->Modules->Blocks->Sticky Blocks. On the page type select \"course page\" and then add an html block. Edit the block to add your link and it will now show up in every course. Not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for but it might be an option. Good luck!",

In general: If you do not need to customize, then do not customize. If you need a custom feature, try to achieve it by a plugin without changing the Moodle core. If you need to change the Moodle core, do it wisely: minimise changes, keep it well isolated, maintain a custom git branch, do not alter core DB tables and APIs. It is important to realize that any such change is not a one-time task. It is not a thing you do once and use it forever. You will have to look after every such change. Re-apply it on the next upgrade, re-test it, deal with eventual conflicts with upstream changes and so on.",

Please note that I don't want to enable the course:ignorefilesizelimits capability within our site's standard Teacher role, as this will obviously make it possible for *all* teachers across the site to take advantage of this capability. So, I thought the easiest way to manage this would be to assign the course:ignorefilesizelimits capability to the teacher role at the course level itself via Course administration > Users > Permissions. However, after having added the Teacher role as described, nothing actually changes. Teachers within the module in question still can't upload files larger than the course upload file size limit. I must admit that I haven't had occasion to use course level permissions much in the past, so I'm unsure if I'm missing something obvious here... Interestingly, when I add the Teacher role to another, separate capability within Course administration > Users > Permissions e.g. add a block that otherwise only Administrator and Manager users can add, this also doesn't have any effect. Consequently, I'm really scratching my head here. Do course level permissions require some other settings to be configured also? Any help would be very gratefully received!

          "Text": "Our moodle site has two sets of users, our employees and our customers.  I would like to make it so that the employee's courses could be open, self-enrolling without an enrolment key but I want to keep the customers out of these courses.  Having the employee's courses hidden completely from the customers would be even better.  I have come up with a solution that almost meets my needs except that it doesn't allow for exceptions..ie giving a customer rights to an employee only course.  Here is the solution I came up with, perhaps someone can see what I'm doing wrong or can confirm that what I want is not possible (or that there is a simpler solution.) 1. Create a new role in Moodle - called customers.  In the customer role (a copy of the student role), set the View Courses field to \"Not Set\". 2. Assign all customers to the system wide role \"Customer.\" 3. In the course I want to keep customers from enrolling in I go to the Assign roles/Override Permissions tab and in the Customer role, set the View courses permission to \"Prohibit\". The result is that customers can see the course listing but if they try to enrol in the course, they get the message asking if they are really sure they want to enroll in the course but if they press Yes, nothing happens.  So far so good. However, there is no way to allow an exception, I tried enrolling the customer in the student role but they still can't enter the course. On the Assign roles/Override Permissions tab and in the Customer role, I also tried setting the View courses permission to \"Prevent\" but then the customer can enroll in the course.  I feel like I'm soo close, what am I missing? Thanks for your help!",

I also went through \"how permissions are calculated\" and have not been able to figure this out. First question: I like the permissions available to a non editing teacher and need it for my application. However, certain permissions are not available that I need them to have access too. My entire course will be an topics based course where they will be hidden and opened up by this level of administration for the student to view and complete. I have unlocked view hidden activities (this made the hidden topics visible leading me to believe topics = activities on the database ), hide/show courses, control section visibility, and set current section. With this available the instructor could not have the abilities I mentioned. However, when adding the \"manage activities\" option all these became available. The problem is I don't wish to allow them to manage the activities. Is there any way to do this to only give hide/show and highlight. It seems that these options are somehow linked together with \"manage activities.\" If that is true where in the code might this be located for me to pass this information on to my site designer. Another option, if enabling what I have does allow access to the show/hide and highlight features but just doesn't make them visible I can pull them up using the code. I just need to know if they are not available at all without opening \"manage activities\" or if they are just not visible but would be available if called upon by an outside source (lower level CMS system).",

We set all the dates before the course opens. Then it runs on autopilot in regard to opening the lessons when students need them. I think because you do not want them to have access to the activities that the best route is to set open/close dates for the lesson . Maybe you have one person who you can assign this role to to? Question 2. We set dates on the quizzes too. This way they open on the day needed and close on a given date too. To add a quiz to each individual topic, you just move your quiz to that topic area. For us, each topic represents a lesson. Within that topic we have the lesson, quiz, forum for discussion and any other resources that go with that lesson. Hope this helps a little.",

This is posted in the development section too, sorry standard users, and please take no offense, but if your unfamiliar with the hierarchy used in the systems code you likely won't be able to help. IE what exactly needs to be unlocked for the instructor to only do that, or is it even possible. It seems the system requires activity management to open up the options that I need, is there an easy way to bypass this? Is it a mistake, or is the system designed to do that, it seems sloppy unless the options for editing were tabbed in such as: Manage activities >>>>Hide/show activities >>>>Control section visibility This is how it appears as though it is constructed though I have not sifted through any code yet to look for it.

          "Text": "Dear people, Recently we developed a strong need for custom created roles in Moodle. We've had a few, but they do not seem to work like they should. Role 1: The Mentor This role needs to be able to view the grades in the courses This role should not be able to give grades This role should not receive mail when students turn in an assignment This role should not have the courses in the 'my courses list' where the 'the Mentor' role is set Role 2: The course viewer This role must be able to see all the resources and activities This role should not be able to see grades and not be able to turn in assignments or make tests This role should not have the courses in the 'my courses list' where the 'Course Viewer' role is set Role 3: the question pool coordinator Small Introduction: The major shortcoming of Moodle is that learning is too much course-based. Roles, grades, questions, etc. are often limited to a course. This role must be able to manage questions at a higher level than a course, preferably by category This role should not receive mail from students who turn in assigments This role should not have the courses in the 'my courses list' where the 'Question pool coordinator' role is set Moodle has a number of default roles that you can copy and then customize the rights for these roles. However, a check mark for receiving mail when students turn in an assignment and a check mark for appearance of the course in the 'my courses list' do not seem to exist. The roles 'guest' and \"administrator\" for example will not see the course turn up in the 'my courses list'. The role 'Administrator' does not receive mails from students who submit work. I would like to know how to set these specific rights. Who can help me with this? It's quite a challenge",

I haven't tryied to set it up yet, but I've already found a problem that doesn't seem to have an answer (at least from wht i've read so far). In my moodle instalation we upload users using a CSV file, is there any chance of doing this to setup Parent accounts as well? If not, It would be very hard to implement as we have a great number of students in our site, so we can't add each account separately. Has anyone found a solution to this? Thanks in advance",

So we need our teacher role to have some changes made so there\nis this flexibility. Recap of key features for the Teacher Role: 1.

Also, you mentioned that if we just deleted him, he'd need a new username later on -- this isn't possible, unfortunately, since our Moodle usernames are tied to our LDAP database. The problem seems to have originated from the fact that he logged in using a username that's a \"secondary\" username on our LDAP server , instead of his primary username. For whatever reason, Moodle just doesn't seem to handle non-primary usernames correctly, so if a teacher's (or student's) account on our LDAP server has more than one username associated with it, we've found that they have to be very careful with which one they use when logging in to Moodle.",

Usually, we just use the course search function to find the course and enter. My understanding is that the way around this, is to allow the administrator \"Do everything\" role ( moodle/site:doanything) - and turn off \"view courses\" but then this means I can't prevent the user from seeing gradebooks, etc. - even if I move all those little buttons to \"Prohibit\".

We're having trouble defining a role for graduate assistants in our office who provide support to our faculty.   Our graduate assistants (GAs) work with any instructor who want to use moodle to support their teaching... Sometimes it's just a consultation thing, but for less tech-saavy instructors, we may need to jump in and do the work for them: creating a syllabus, creating course resources, etc. The graduate students are students themselves... so we have a rule that they don't support their own class, only other classes. We've created a site- context role called \"GA\" which basically gets them instructor capabilities for any class in the system, with a few exceptions (grading, for example). We also have the default student role (i.e., the GAs are enrolled in their own classes, with the student role set). Here's the question, in short... how do I make the student role override the site-wide GA role?   I want the more powerful GA role to only apply to classes where a GA does not have the more restrictive student role.

I do not really understand what you are trying to do, but you could consider the override function in roles. If you want your GA role users not able to do some things you can override some capabilities for the GA role in certain courses. Cheers, Yu",

She remained in the course as a student, but needed to help me input grades for her own class. What we discovered was that she could be assigned a teacher role and still add grades to her name, along with everyone else. (In fact, for some reason, even my name shows up in the gradebook and it's possible to assign grades to me.) Then, at the end of the semester, we needed to have her included as a student in order to properly calculate the weighted and curved grades for the class. We removed her from the teacher list, added her back to the student list, and fortunately, her grades hadn't disappeared. I'm just posting this so that if anyone else has the same trouble, you don't have to wonder whether you will lose the grades you entered when you make the role switch. Ideally, there would be some kind of customizable third/dual role that allows for my situation as well as the graduate assistant situation described above. Another situation is when I want to let my colleagues \"lurk\" in my courses to learn about how Moodle works. I give them teacher status so they can see the gradebook, etc. When I give them a teacher role, they show up under the list of teachers visible to students.",

The short answer is not really, because apart from the admin (and possibly a site wide manager) the role of student and teacher are defined in each course and not globally. In other words -you could be a student in one course and a teacher in another. While it is possible to have \"students\" and \"teachers\" site wide it is not recommended. Have a read of Assign roles and then come back and ask some more questions. It is possible, for example, to assign teachers and students to courses with those roles via a csv file.",

First Problem when trying to log into courses within this category, course creators are being asked if they want to enrol, when they say yes, the question is asked again and again and again. Thus they never get into the course. Second Problem I am additionally confused by the fact that although I have allocated the roles at the highest level, the screens that show who is a course creator etc do not tally with this high level information. I have tried going into reset to take out this information, and I've tried changing it and it just doesn't seem to say what it should,. I have gone into an individual couse and removed all of the roles and still I can see 2 people in as course creators on the front screen. So I am now more than a little confused. Help",

The courses are populated with students and I have begun to set up the Mentors with their respective students - so the mentors can access student blogs, posts etc. which after a false start or two I am able to do. The courses are set up as meta courses with a core module and up to eight child courses The problem I have is the SL also wants the mentors to be able to participate in some course activities - chat, forum, news and he would like to give them the ability to set up new discussions etc. I am trying to find the simplest way to proceed - I spent 8 hours working through things yesterday and I feel I am still no further forward. The current capabilities assigned to Mentors are these: Talk in a chat, Add news, Reply to news, Start new discussions, View discussions, Download responses , Respond to survey, View responses, Edit wiki pages, View courses, Edit user profile, See all user blogs, See all user posts, View user profiles, See user activity reports. Is there something missing from this list? I enrolled the mentors into the college Moodle, directly into the modules where there students 'live' but whenever I log in as a mentor I am either asked for an enrolment key or a message appears stating public access is not allowed. The mentors can have a number of different students in their 'charge' and not all mentors are mentors in the same modules. Is it possible to upload users as mentors in the same way as students or teachers can be uploaded via csv files and where would I find the 'type' for a created role? If I assign a role to a category does that role migrate to the courses in that category? If I assign roles in meta courses are do they migrate to child courses? If I duplicate a role and then change the capabilities does that affect all users of the role? Any help will be appreciated.",

Quiz and Lesson have one (and so has the new version of Questionnaire in HEAD) Well, even with a user's manage capability set to Forbid , it is possible for a user to create and update an instance of Quiz, to create a Lesson (but with error message) and Questionnaire activities . Does this mean that the manage capability does not include the capabilities to create and update such activities? And further, what exactly does forbidding a manage capability prevent a user from doing (in those modules)? In Quiz, \"manage forbidden\" allows a user to create and update a quiz, but not to put questions in it. In Lesson, \"manage forbidden\" allows a user to create a new lesson, but upon completion, displays a Navigation: first page not found error message! \"manage forbidden\" does not allow user to update a lesson. Question: is there any way to use the Forbid setting of the manage capability to prevent creation and editing of all activities which have this capability available? At least, could there be some consistent common behavior of that setting for all moodle activities??? Joseph",

Most of the links are gone, somehow i managed to reset back with adminfix.php. This is what i want: We are a small college, therefore we have some students, lecturers and IT Administrator. Our users (students) are pulled from windows active directory, so these students when logs on to the moodle for the first time, their users account will automatically be created in moodle systems. When their users accounts are created they automatically can do lots of things in moodle like creating blog , create new tags, access chat, add news, forums. We dont want these users to do these sort of things, so all we want them is to click on course and enroll and go thru the notes, syllabus. So what do i need to do to achieve these tasks. This is how im doing now but its taking lots of time: I have created a new role name \"moodstudents\"; this role is duplicate of moodles native student role. In this new role i have edited to prohibit things like creating blog, create new tags, access chat, add news, forums. And from the USERS->ASSIGN SYS ROLES->MOODSTUDENTS and added all those users pulled from active directory. BUT is there anyway this things can be done automatically or is there any better way of doing it. thank you.",

Course B: How to manage high school life For course A, I want it to be available to both groups of users.  But for course B, I want it to be available only to teenager students. To achieve what I want, I thought about using Categories.  However, since a course can only be assigned to one category, my category tree may get complicated soon when I get more courses, more user groups and more user/course permission combinations. Besides using Category, what else can I use to control who can view / enroll in a specific course?",

Description « Hide When enrolling a student in any way shape or form, the user \"enrols\" in the course, then when you click on them from the course participant list, they are shown as not enrolled in the course, they also do not recieve rights to access the course, we are currently relying upon all people accessing as guests. This is an extremely serious problem, no students can properly use moodle because guessts are unable to submit information to the courses activity modules... bug number - MDL-8379 cheers",

I was unable to do this as these new admin roles could not restore from backup files stored in some of the the courses, this seemed to be tied to the \"do anything role\". If I de selected do anything, and enabled every other option, the user still lost the ability to restore from these files. If I tried the other way, giving users do anything and removing some of the admin settings, do anything would (as I expected) override the \"prohibit\" on the other permissions. Can anyone tell me whether they have ever been able to create such a role, i.e. can you create a role that does anything site wide except change the technical settings? I am working with 1.9.1",

The reason is, is that we have some courses that any registered user can access then we have other courses that only users who have gone through our external application process will be able to access, and also we have some courses only our staff members can take. I soon found out that Moodle doesnt work this way and that there is no way to limit the access of a course to a specific user type. Does anyone know of a way to do this? I then thought that I'd just use the enrollment keys to make this work. I set up a course with an enrollment key and ran into a few problems. 1 - The course I set the key for also had a cost associated with it. While testing I paid for the course and was then given full access to the course even though I had not entered the enrollment key. What is the point of the enrollment key then if I can just pay and get in? 2 - There doesn't appear to be any automated way to give a user an enrollment key. I had thought that maybe after you paid you'd be sent the key and then could enter it and access the course. Why isn't this the case? Thanks for the Help!",

Just click the X to remove all roles except 'Trainer' or other appropriate roles from the View capability. Do a 'Login As' a user in the site who is not in the Trainer role and check that the block does not appear. I think this might work. Mark",
