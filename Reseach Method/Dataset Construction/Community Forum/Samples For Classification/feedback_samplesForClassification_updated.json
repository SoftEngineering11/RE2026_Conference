          "Text": "Hello, Our teacher questioned the tip's text (the question mark) on Feedback, Settings, below \"Question and submission settings\" on the line \"Allow multiple submissions\". Text is now (Moodle 4.1.x - our: 4.1.14): \"If enabled for anonymous surveys, users can submit feedback an unlimited number of times\". Same is translated from this correctly same to Finnish. The question is: Should this be automatically allowed to answer multiple times when it is \"Anonymous\" - selection above? The tip gives the idea to that way. Should the tip's text be: \"If this is enabled, answering multiple (or unlimited) times is allowed \". Simple as that. And also translations must be changed to similar. Reality in functionality is that this must be selected in any case to \"Yes\" when multiple answers is actually allowed when this is anonymous or not. If there is \"No\", all participants can answer only once (and quest access does not allow doing activities like write to this forum). Next point is the instructions to this: https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Feedback_settings \" Allow multiple submissions Choose here whether or not to allow users to complete the feeback more than once. This is important when using Feedback for anonymous surveys on the front page as it will allow non-logged in users to complete the feedback.\" Should this be even more clear and more understandable (and of course fix the writing error \"feeback\" to \"feedback\" on text)? This leads to think that Activity completion does not work if it is anonymous and allowed answering multiple times. Reality in our Moodle version is that is works in any case. Checked on the course with quest access allowed, feedback is not possible to use. No need to say \"... non-logged ...\". Maybe Google Translator translates this incorrect to mean \"non logged people\" like meaning \"quest access\" because guest cannot complete the feedback or start to answer it (at least what I know and have tested). Or does this mean that if the site front page (not course) is feedback as anonymous then ...  I don't quite understand. Teachers cannot set Feedback on site front page and I see this instructions page targeted more to teachers and less to site admins like me. And if I (or anyone our site admin team) cannot understand the tip or instructions page's message, how many teachers could understand it better (well, someone can but the point to most less technical people)?

But don't worry, I have a solution that will save you a lot of time and help you resolve this in a practical and efficient way. 🌟 The first thing I would recommend is using a plugin I developed called \"Local Copy\" , available on GitHub here . This plugin was created specifically for repetitive tasks like copying activities between courses, without the need to restore the entire course from a backup. I had the same problem and made the plugin. This is the most direct and efficient way to solve your problem, without the complications of formatting CSV files and bulk course restorations. I hope this tip is helpful and that you can complete this task much faster! And if any questions arise along the way, we're here to help! 🤗 Eduardo Kraus Teacher / Developer / Passionate about Moodle / Innovation and new products",

Same thing if they are submitting text. However, if it is text, I would then change my recommendation for you to use the Diary plugin, which I maintain. If they are submitting images or multimedia, again you could use the Diary. Currently, Diary does not include the capability for file uploads, but it is on my TODO list to add that someday soon.

          "Text": "I created two feedback activities  last fall using (Moodle 3.9.1 and was able to edit prior templates and update questions. The first survey ran in October 2022 and I could list participants and review the results.  In December, I upgraded to Moodle  4.1 (20221222) and subsequently migrated the entire site to a new PHP 8.1 server in February.  The second survey opened in May 2023. Everything else in the Moodle seems to be working well....but today I discovered this May feedback activity is acting oddly. I am listed (manual enrollment) as the teacher for the course when reviewing the course listing as Moodle administrator. But when I go to the course after logging in as my teacher username, I am offered tabs to edit or preview the activity questions but there is no analysis tab or list of participants who have / have not completed the survey. When reviewing feedback activities for prior years in courses where I am the teacher, I can also no longer see the results. The only administrative feedback module setting involves allowing completely anonymous feedback; this is set to no, since all Moodle users must log in to get to the feedback activities. I have the sense that I missed a setting somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Moodle: 4.1 (20221222) OS: Linux VPS running PHP 8.1 and Mariadb 10.4.19 ACTUALLY, I did figure this out eventually.  The tabs are gone from the edit page, and now are options in the feedback activity block.  I'm not sure whether there's 4.0+ documentation pointing out this shift in display thinking, but if there is, I missed it. If you read this far, thank you for your time.  Now back to our regularly scheduled chaos...",

          "Text": "I'm finding that targeting the \"Preview Questions\" button with a CSS rule by using the ID doesn't work in Moodle 4.x because the ID changes every time the page is loaded or refreshed. I wrote and am using the following CSS on two self-hosted Moodle 4.1.1 sites and one Moodle 4.0.5 MoodleCloud site, all using the Boost Theme: /* hide Feedback activity Preview Questions button */ div.feedback_description div.navitem:first-of-type a.btn { display: none; } /* show Feedback activity Preview Questions button in Edit Mode */ body.editing div.feedback_description div.navitem:first-of-type a.btn { display: inline-block; } Both rules are needed. The first rule will hide the \"Preview Questions\" button for students, guests, facilitators, course creators, and parents. However, it also hides the \"Edit Questions\" button for managers and teachers (because the \"Edit Questions\" button is the first button in that div) making it impossible for them to edit the Feedback activity questions. The second rule displays the \"Edit Questions\" button when \"Edit Mode\" is turned on and hides it when \"Edit Mode\" is turned off. Although this means an extra step for managers and teachers, they can at least still edit the Feedback questions. A downside to this method is that it hides the \"Preview Questions\" button for facilitators so they can no longer see what questions are being asked in the Feedback activity. I haven't found a way around this. This method will only work as long as the \"Preview Questions\" button is in the first div with a class of \"navitem\" inside the div with a class of \"feedback_description.\" If the HTML changes, the CSS will need to be updated. I'm using this as a workaround until https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-70586 is resolved. It would be much better to be able to handle the display of the \"Preview Questions\" button via role permissions.",

          "Text": "Moodle 3.11.4   I am struggling with making an\nactivity ' hidden but still\naccessible ' in an orphaned section. In my previous Moodle version, I\nhoused my feedback question information in a section that was orphaned so\nthat - in an earlier, available course section - the feedback link took the\nstudent directly to the page after 'answer the questions'. In the 3.11 Moodle\nversion, if I use the topics course format, that doesn't give me the ability to\nsubtract sections and make them available to students, but orphaned. If I use\ncollapsed topics, it gives me more control over adding and subtracting sections\nbut it also adds additional labels that aren't needed for me. If I hide the\nsection or topic, the student sees, 'sorry this activity is currently\nhidden'. I was trying to send\nthe student directly to the feedback activity, without requiring him/her to\nclick on the 'answer the questions' button. In my previous Moodle version, the\nfeedback activity lived in the orphaned section, and the student was only\nprovided with a link to the page following 'answer the questions'. So it seems that my problem is the inability to add a section,\nput accessible content in the section and next subtract the section, so\nthe student never sees it. This version doesn’t offer a + - section option at\nthe end of the page. I only used this for the feedback activity. If orphaned sections are no longer available, is there another way to offer the student a link directly to the feedback activity page?",

So far I have been doing all of this manually, entering each course separately, extracting the feedback results to Excel and copying them to a separate file with an overall summary. But that's extremely time-consuming. Is there any way to make it automated? Any help will be much appreciated! Can someone maybe point me to the direction on how I can build an SQL query to have a one set of data from a lot of different feedbacks?

A couple of thoughts though...1. If your students are having to enter the course to respond to the feedback then their answers really are not anonymous as it is easy to track which student gave which answer through the logs. 2. I tend to put a single feedback on the frontpage and make it accessible to users that are not logged in. Then I make the first question a drop down where they select the course they are giving feedback for. This has two advantages - it is truly anonymous. You can pull your data for all courses at one time through the feedback activity.",

Currently, because I've already completed the activity once, it's showing that I have already completed and submitted so is not \"allowing\" me to redo the activity.",

I use Feedback in anonymous mode. One of the strengths of Feedback over competing modules is the template functionality. I currently run a big new e-course over 30 course weeks. The template functionality allows me to monitor each week with minimal labour for setting up the questions. Excellent! However, my course has a challenge. Each course week contains 3 - 4 quizes that need to be passed with at least 80 %. Then the week is passed in a binary fashion - either passed or not passed. Students have to pass all 30 days. I had trouble implementing this simple algorithm in standard Moodle and implemented a custom SQL query with the \"Configurable Reports\" plugin. However, there could be a much simpler way of settings things up if the \"Feedback\" activity had a grade. I would restrict access to the week's Feedback activity until all Query modules are passed with >= 80 %, then everyone who submitted feedback would get 100 % for the feedback activity. The course total would then be the sum of all feedback activities in the course. Kind regards Martin",

There were the same general questions for all students to answers. Our instructors were required to turn on the course evaluation during the final week of classes, and then they were not able to view the results until two weeks after the course had closed, and even at that time, the results were anonymous. These were the settings that I inherited in my role and they were fully functional until about 3 months ago. Now instructors are not able to view the results at all, unless I give them manager rights. I have gone into the system admin section under users->permissions-> define roles and made sure that the instructor has access to the results, however this has not changed, and instructors still do not have access. I am curious if anyone else has run into this issue and could assist in a resolution? Or if anyone is new to setting up a similar scenario and might have some tips for me in the event that I have to recreate the entire feedback evaluation? Thank you in advance, I appreciate any assistance that can be offered!",

We add them in by uploading a csv set to restore from a Feedback Template page that only contains the Feedback activity but we need to remove the old instances from every page first before uploading fresh ones for the current year. Is there a way to remove all instances of this plugin in one go? Or is there a way to uninstall it then re-install it afresh? There is no 'Uninstall' option for it within the 'Manage Activities' page and just removing the Feedback folder from the Mods folder causes a site error, presumably because this is a core plugin. I have tried truncating the various mdl_feedback_xxxx tables associated with the plugin but as soon as I start importing fresh instances it repopulates the course pages with the old instances as well, resulting in multiple instances of the Feedback on each page. Is this related to the references in the 'mdl_course_modules' table ('module' column)? Hoping someone can point me in the right direction with this. Many thanks Dominique",

They will repeat the feedback survey for all the students What I would then like, is students to be able to access their own feedback and download it as a PDF. Their feedback needs to be private from other students. Is there any way I can set this up? Even if there is a plugin that I can download.

An alternative that I have been working on is a plugin called Event Trigger but I have not found the way to make it work as I need it but I have only managed from the same plugin to send the mail when a person sends the individual response of their survey after running the cron.

I want to run a further feedback but have found that this little trick does not work now as it seems that required questions only prevent movement to the next page if they are not completed when visible.  If the required question is invisible, the user can just pass to the next page without providing an answer, and continue with the questionnaire. I can't make all the questions conditional on the answer to the first as some of the late questions have their own conditional requirements.  Can anyone think of how I might be able to make this work?  I'm running Moodle 3.5.",

Feedback Tool displays much better on a mobile phone so thats my preference between the two. In terms of pushing a survey into course spaces I've seen the \"map course\" functionality, is that still current? https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/Capabilities/mod/feedback:mapcourse Can Feedback Tool ask a branching logic question: i.e \"if they answered \"b\" then also ask an extra question\"? I am assuming not but if there is a way it would be good to know. Can a question be locked, as part of a template, so that course owners can add more questions but not delete core questions? I am assuming not, but again, if there is a way it would be good to know. Questionnaire Tool provides a printable version: could there also be a printable version of the Feedback Tool? (for accessibility purposes, or for spares if students don't have devices with them). (and obviously a printed version isn't compatible with branching logic). This is a whole bigger ask, but could there be a way of aggregating reports so that category managers / people with higher level permissions could download multiple reports / multiple results as combined CSVs? If Moodle could do a little more on the data handling side it would be powerful. Plug-in/integration suggestions welcome (cheap!). Grateful for tips/suggestions on any of the above. Amber",

So I thought I would try to add a question to the Feedback that would tag the responses -- such as a date.  I noticed that there is a question type called \"Information\" which said it could supply the course name, the course category, or the date responded.  Great!  Except the date option wasn't available -- only course and category.

          "Text": "We use the Feedback activity extensively for standardised evaluations amongst c 1500 courses per semester and we feed the data out to an analytics tool. I don't think this is really feasible through the web interface - we do it using the raw data. There's a complex set of relationships that are intended to obfuscate who the respondent actually is for anonymity, but you can indeed map each response back to the specific user if you need to through linking various tables (we have done this because one project wanted to compare evaluation feedback with course outcomes for each student - so we had to \"unanonymise\" them, combine them with completion and grade book statistics and then reanonymise the whole lot again. But to be honest, since Feedbacks can be used for lots of different things, it is tricky to be able to capture all the data without holding elsewhere a list of course module numbers that refer to the specific feedback activities we deploy centrally as evaluation forms. I was considering forking the feedback activity, to create something specifically called \"evaluation feedback\" so that for people like us who want to know the answers to the same set of questions to measure student experience across the whole institution, nobody else could tinker with them. But to answer some of the OP 's original questions: No, we could not find a way of \"branching\" questions. Yes, it can be locked at deployment time, but no, that means they can't edit it at all. We created a \"course evaluation extra\" feedback for if they wanted to ask additional questions on the basis that responses to these questions would not be extracted to the learning analytics system. But as I say, most of what we do is done a. by using data from the Moodle database rather than pre-built reports within the Feedback module itself, and b. the analysis is done by a back end stats package that we transfer data to.

Students should be able voice criticism or problems that they don't want or aren't ready to talk to by person. The first part of this idea is pretty obvious and easy: I already created a Feedback activity with record user names set to anonymous and a couple of form elements. However, there's a big problem: I don't see a way to respond to their submissions. Which would be fine in many cases fine, but I cannot help someone if they tell me something important and I have no way to reach them. Did I overlook something or are there other ways?

The radio button list is generating nicely and writing to the Feedback database correctly. The problem I am experiencing is the 'Show responses' tab is not displaying the answer entered into the Feedback and only displaying the dummy data I loaded into the add question field while building the form. I thought I had bypassed this via the get_options function. Can anyone shine a light on the reason why this is not displaying and why it's referring back to the dummy info stored in the form?

When a page break is used and all fields are required it is impossible to navigate (using the previous button) back to the first page without filling in the required fields of the second page. This creates some confusion particularly when using conditional fields on the second page based on field content on the first page, made worse if the user has chose the wrong answer on the first page and cannot understand why the field expected does not appear on the second page. If any of that makes sense? Thanks Ross",

          "Text": "Hi Mary I working with Guest feedback and that's where it became apparent, but it fails with authenticated users in the same way. I came across what may be a second issue with guest access to feedbacks. problem 1 A guest fills in the first page of a feedback and proceeds to a second page. It appears Moodle saves the first page entries to the feedback table linked to the guest account. The guest either cancels the feedback, navigates to another page or closes moodle without saving the feedback. When another guest accesses moodle the previous guests entries are visible to them. Even after closing moodle  and clearing history and cookies. The information seems to be getting stored with the guest account rather than an anonymous feedback. It would seem moodle is treating the guest user as a standard authenticated user by allowing them to continue where they last left the feedback. Problem 2 An extension of the original issue unable to navigate forward or backward through page breaks if there are required fields. When the second guest is presented with the entries of a previous guest who has aborted their multi page feedback where required fields are present on all or some pages. Being unable to navigate forward or back through pages to clear the other guests entries forces them to abort the feedback, possibly rendering all future feedbacks of this instance unlikely unless some bright spark works out what's going on. I have tried this on several feedbacks and the fault is reproducible. Many Thanks  Ross",

Back in M2.8 users could submit their answers and reopen the activity to review their selection or make changes to the selection -> initial answers where shown to the users. Now in M 3.1.1 when users submit a feedack and repopen the activity they do not see their initial selection and if they submit the form a second time a second response will be created. Can anybody confirm? Is that a bug or is it an intended feature? Thanks and regards Tobias Moodle 3.1.1 (Build: 20160711)",

Unless there is a reason to have no ability to set defaults, maybe you can create Moodle Tracker asking to give admins the option to set defaults for this module. * In the meantime, consider downloading the Sharing Cart plug in. Then you can create a 'template' that you'd like to base all of your Feedback modules on and save this template to your sharing cart. Then whenever you need to add a new Feedback module, just turn on the Sharing Cart block, and download the Feedback template into that course. Nice an simple! *",

Example: imagine this very simple feed-back to measure degree of satisfaction at the end of a certain course: 1. Question 1: who has been your teacher? The user has to choose between two possibilities: John, Theresa 2. Question 2: How was he/she? The user has to choose between two possibilities: Good Bad. Because of the way the Excel is exported, we will know how many students had John and how many had Theresa. We will also know how many students think their teacher is good and how many think he/she is bad. But we won't know how many students think John is a good teacher. This would be solved if the export to Excel just follows basic table structure like this ANSWERS Question 1 Question 2 student 1 John Good student 2 John Bad student 3 Theresa Good This Excel could just be downloadable from the \"Show responses\" tab. This is just a suggestion. Our teachers usually miss this. Thanks, Gabriel",

I deleted the entries whilst logged in as her, and the data has now disappeared from her view. However, I am at a loss to explain why this old data remained visible, months after I deleted it.

          "Text": "As most people know, the feedback module is one of the few modules that guests can access.  As a result, it can be used for many purposes, such as a quick survey, contact form, etc.  One feature that is a bit difficult is the fact that the results are randomized and the email notifications do not include the submission values.  This makes it difficult for using it as a contact form.  For example, if a guest fills out the form and submits it, the admin gets an email saying the form was completed.  The link in the email sends the admin to the list of submissions, but since the submissions are randomized, it makes it nearly impossible to determine which one was just sent. Before Moodle 2, the Questionnaire module was handy for this because it sent all the form data in the email.  However, this cannot be used anymore with guests.  Joseph's suggestion is to use LimeSurvey, but I find it to be a bit cumbersome and also I don't want many to many systems for my sites. As a result, I created a patch for the Feedback module that will send the results of the feedback in the email.  Only two files were edited: lib.php (patch attached) complete_guest.php (only one line edited - shown below) Edit for complete_guest.php: Line 256, Moodle 2.7.1, replace \n```text\n                feedback_send_email_anonym($cm, $feedback, $course, $userid);  //Original\n```\n With \n```text\n                feedback_send_email_anonym($cm, $feedback, $course, $new_completed_id);  //Edit\n```\n It works well for us, however, I would appreciate any feedback as well as some help with fine tuning it. With the patch, every feedback submitted sends email to the \"teacher\" of the courses.  I would like to add one additional setting in the initial settings of the feedback so the person setting it up can decide whether to have the submissions sent to the teacher in an email or keep the original functionality. Maybe something like Include submission values in email (default no) Once this is in, I can make the appropriate changes in the two files to honor the setting. Any \"feedback\" would be appreciated (no pun intended... well, maybe some pun was intended) Thanks!",

Not the group filtering, as per the current setup, but the group that the student is a member of for the resource which is assigned a grouping . I can adapt the code where there is a group filtered to include it within the export, but I can't get my head around getting the group information out when there is no filtering. I think I've narrowed it down to the feedback_get_completeds_group function in the mod/feedback/lib.php file - or is there a better place to put this in? Any help/advice with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

Define some access conditions to that url. In your case the condition that the feedback is filled out. Hide the settings block where the link to the gradebook resides. Now the students will get the link to the gradebook just after the feedback completion. I can imagine that there are some other ways to go to the gradebook. So my described way might not work.

The reason I am looking for dependencies is because I don't want to ask every person taking the survey every question but rather tailor the questions to a specific level. Unfortunately the questions have relevance in trainee and level I categories. I have found a basic work around but if forces everyone to be asked a base set of questions then at the end expands on that based on if they are certified at all. I think the option for multiple dependencies would be a nice features in the feedback activity and allow a more tailored or branched set of questions.",

The documentation is clear in that Guests can only use Feedback successfully on the front page of the Moodle yet, when Guests log in and access a Feedback within a course, by default, Moodle allows the Guest to click on the preview icon, fill out the form and click Continue.   The Guest doesn't necessarily know this is only a preview and that the results will not be saved.  There is no error or warning message and it appears to let the Guest complete the Feedback which is misleading to the Guest and the Teacher administering the site. I have found a way to get around this by modifying the Guest role so they are not able to view Feedbacks but my question is why would a guest even be allowed to access/preview a Feedback in a course if the functionality is disabled here?  What purpose does this serve if they cannot save results?  If there is a use-case for this, It might be useful to implement a warning at the very least so that guests are aware they are only previewing the Feedback and not actually completing the feedback.",

          "Title": "Moodle 1.9 Feedback calculation of averages",
          "Text": "We’ve been using the Feedback module for some time. Up to now, the Feedbacks are set for single submission, using: · ‘Required’  ‘Multiple choice (rated) single answer allowed (dropdown list); and · Optional ‘Longer text answers’. This setup works entirely reliably and the exported Excel workbook provides calculated averages for the numerically rated questions – which is what we need. The calculation of averages is based on the ‘requirement’ for each respondent to give a numerically rated value before the Feedback will be accepted when ‘Submit’ is selected. If a ‘required’ answer has been omitted, the individual’s responses are no accepted, and the user is prompted to supply a numerically-rated answer. For every numerically-rated answer, the average is calculated as the sum of each numerical value x the frequency of that value/the total number of people submitting responses to the Feedback. I’ve just introduced a different style of Feedback set to allow ‘Multiple submit’. This means that students can complete one Feedback progressively through an 8-week residential course. When they select ‘Submit’, their answers are recorded and saved. They can then re-enter the Feedback to add new responses and, if they wish, amend earlier responses in the light of course developments. Again, the Feedback employs a mixture of ‘Multiple choice (rated) single answer allowed (dropdown list); and ‘Longer text answers’. · However, it is not practical to set the Multiple choice (rated) questions to ‘Required’. · If that were done, then in, say, week one, all the students would have to give ratings for every week covered by the Feedback in order to ‘Submit’, even though the course had not yet dealt with the topics to which the questions related. Unfortunately, the Feedback calculation of averages does not cope with unreliable human beings! For each numerically-rated question, the average is the sum of each numerical value x the frequency of that value/the total number of people submitting responses to the Feedback. The algorithm does not take account of the number of people answering the question . The two are not necessarily then same, and therefore the automatically-calculated averages are not correct. Our need for this new style of using the Feedback module will increase in importance. So… Is it possible to modify the Feedback module to calculate averages based on the number of respondents to each question, rather than the maximum number of respondents to the Feedback as a whole?",

Then you can map this feedback to all courses you want to be able to complete this feedback. Or you just leave it as it is and it will be available in all courses. If you don't need the possiblility to filter the responses for courses so you can put the feedback block easily on the frontpage. I hope it helps a bit. Best regards Andreas",

Each face to face will most probably have a different trainer. What I want to be able to do is now measure the feedback forms via the trainer who ran each course so we can measure knowledge and satisfaction. I understand that I could group learners into a group for each trainer, but that learner won't have the same trainer for each face to face.

Is there a way to pick from a drop down list, who the trainer was on the face to face so that I can then pull responses by trainer? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",

I generate automatically a feedback with 2 questions for each new assignment. For instance, we have 5 assignmets with their respective feedback (imported by template in xml ), and for now on the new assigments I want to add 2 more questions in my template without losing previous results. It's like modifing the template without duplicating the xml because I generate the feedback autocatically. Thanks.",

I tried to set it to enabled, and this made teachers able to answer feedbacks site-wide. What I would like is that I have to option to give them this role on select feedbacks.

The PHP setting error_log controls which log this goes to.

Performance info perfdebug Default: No If you turn this on, performance info will be printed in the footer of the standard theme Show origin of languages strings debugstringids Default: No This option is designed to help translators. It shows the language file and string id beside each string that is output. (Changing this setting will only take effect on the next page load.)

We have a generic feedback survey we want to make available to students participating in any course. By generic I mean the questions are the same for each course, except the first question asks which course the feeback relates to. Reading some of the postings in the forums, it seems to me that creating a metacourse containing the feedback activity is the recommended option, and I have done this. I have linked in child course enrolments. However, once a participant has completed the survey, it seems that they cannot complete the survey for another course. Is there a way around this? I'm also still trying to find where I can reset feedback for a particular enrolled participant. Any suggestions, much appreciated, Thanks Paul",

Can the migration be made without losing the data from saved surveys? Do I have to uninstall the module before migrating, as 2.x has it in its core? Or do I need to uninstall it after migrating?

Student: \"blah blah blah\" Q3 What Os do you use at home? This is not logical . I would expect that if the student answered \"Never\" to question 1, the Survey would skip question 3. Scenario #2 So I modified question 3 to make it dependent on Q1 \"every day\": What Os do you use at home? (workathome->every day). Here is the new scenario. Q1 Do you work at home? Student: Every day Q2 What Os do you use at home? etc. it works OK until the end Scenario #2b Q1 Do you work at home? Student: Never it takes the student to the end of the Survey. The problem is that the choices \"often, some day, seldom\" should also go to the question about \"which OK so you use\", but they don't. The way to do this is to add new questions, like this: What Os do you use at home? (workathome->often). What Os do you use at home? (workathome->some days). What Os do you use at home? (workathome->seldom). It would be nice if we had a feature to add in the \"depend item\" \"depend value\" field not just one value, but a list of comma-separated values. So, in the example at hand, we would not have to multiply the number of questions, but have all \"depend values\" together in one question. Joseph",

Is it possible to have a single form, have the user complete half, save it, then have the line manager complete the second half? If not I guess it would need to be two forms?

If \"Yes\" is chosen, the user is taken to another series of questions that depend on question #8 having been answered \"Yes\". When the user finishes answering those questions, they are able to click \"Submit\" and all is fine. If the user answered \"No\" to question #8, they are taken to an information questions that states they are finished and they can click \"Submit\". The problem is here: when they click \"Submit\" the form says they have not answered all required questions. Do you know what is causing this? I hope I have given you enough information.

One of the critiques when anonymous was first introduced was that by logging it might be possible to determine who submitted which entries. I tried to randomize that but then folks said that you could just put a single user in a group and then sort by groups and see a particular users response and thus defeat anonymity. So then there is no logging of anonymous which means you do not know whether a particular user has completed an entry or not. As a teacher, I can understand wanting to ensure that every student has completed a feedback activity; however, if you compare it to the paper version of a survey there is no way to ensure that every student has in fact completed it. They can always turn one in blank and you would not know who that was. I would have to go back in and check to see if on an anonymous survey the viewing of the feedback is logged (as opposed to actually submitting one). Peace - Anthony",

          "Text": "Feedback is great module. I like and use it much. I have some suggestions / wanted features. I checked the forum and I have not found such a topic. I know Andreas is busy enough anyhow here they are: 1. Please add question type \"grid\" or \"scale\". I mean something like docs.google.com has for forms. In one question there are more rows and columns. In rows are options and in columns are weights. Weights may be open or 1,2,3.. or the Likert scale options: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, Strongly agree ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale ) or Moodle Survey options: Almost never, Seldom, Sometimes, Often, Almost always. Answers are/should be stored in separate fields with names of rows (at least this is how it works in G. docs) 2. In setting-up the feedback (Edit Setting) add option (maybe in the Feedback options section) to Hide the \"Not selected\" No/Yes as a default option for the whole feedback (which will be default setting for the new feedback or will overwrite already set question (with warning)). In other words: additionally to the option provided for each question set the same for the whole feedback already at setting it up. 3. If the question is edited (not a newly created.. I guess you may check if the question is not the last one or question editor was reached by click on edit button) then please add in Edit Question on the bottom the new button \"Save and edit next question\" (next to buttons \"Save changes to question\" \"Save as a new question\" \"Cancel\") (and move to edit next question). 4. Pre-fill the labels field with something like SingleA1, MC2, TextS3, TextL4, Drop5 or similar for single answer, multiple choice, short, long text, drop down list etc. I mean something like: type of question+ number. The reason is that in Excel it would be meaningful to know the type of question (at least for me) without checking answers. It does not matter that user may change labels. I am guessing that most users let them empty anyway. 5. Small thing: in my installation (Moodle 2) in Templates/Use a template the text: \"No templates available yet\" is rendered in two lines. Just one would be enough. This is just a case when there are no templates. I just looked into the source and found that it is because of size of div.fstaticlabel. Maybe I was not clear enough. Do not hesitate to add comments, suggestions.. Thanks Miro",

The Feedback module allows you to create your own surveys, and that would be well and truly policed by any schools, anyone else, well that would be an organizational thing so I doubt FERPA would even apply. As a general rule, one of the core policies of Moodle.org has been to preserve privacy wherever appropriate. The definition of \"appropriate\" applied by Moodle.org, in my view, has more than a touch of hysterical paranoia about it that is unnecessary. In so many areas Students should not even have an expectation of privacy from Teachers or the School, in general. Obviously this is limited by common sense and good taste, elements of our society that have been sadly lacking in recent decades. Unfortunately, the times we live in dictate that teachers are obviously suspect for wanting to work with children and therefore need to be limited by law to the point where they can no longer perform the duties expected of them. Obviously then, when it goes wrong, as it is, Teachers are being blamed for all of society's problems.",

Student groups don't share all instructors and may not remember their names; so, they must select each instructor by recognizing his/her picture. They must pick and evaluate only 10 instructors (1 per subject) from a pool of over 50 instructors. Posting all instructor pictures would be a mess, so I thought about putting their names in 10 drop-down menus (1 for each subject), and by selecting a name the person's picture would automatically show up. Once the picture shows, the students can positively recognize each instructor and start individual evaluations. -Once the survey is completed, each student must receive a PDF file (matched to the MOODLE username) via e-mail containing individual scores for the course evaluations (these evaluations are applied in paper, not in MOODLE). An alternative to sending an e-mail with an attached PDF file would be, displaying a table showing the course evaluation results (this table should get the information from an uploaded database ).

Per course uses the mod as an activity but you can only access the reports per courses - which is time consuming for an administrator. We are using 1.8 on MySQL and the block wouldnt work, but we wanted it to appear as an activity in the syllabus rather than a block within the course as the students might consider it very optional rather than part of the course. So here's the step by step of what we did: 1) Install feedback module and create an instance of the Feedback Survey on the HOME page of Moodle.  Create the questions and save. 2) To map the courses - type in something to filter your course selections with.  All our course shortcodes include the term month (_Apr).  This builds a list to select from. 3) Once the survey is complete and the courses have been added - you can add the survey link to the actual courses.    I used the following:   Add resource, Add link to file or website.  The URL used was the direct link to the survey in the HOME course with an added parameter of courseid = Course.id   This ensures that the data is associated with the course. Any course that has this link that is not mapped yet - should display an error.",

          "Text": "I work for a FE College in the UK. Our moodle has around 700 courses on it, and depending on the students on the course, they are asked to complete one of four surveys using Feedback. The problem is that while the results of the feedback are visible within the scope of the course, the survey is a cross-college survey and as such we need the Feedback to be in the scope of the whole Moodle, if that makes sense. (Basically, we need details of every survey collated together on one page.) I have seen that a Feedback can be palced onto the front page of Moodle, but then it does not collect the course the student is taking, or the Teacher of the course, which we also need. Our current solution is to hack out some PHP which queries the feedback tables in the database directly, looking for instances of \"Student Survey 1 - Feb 2009\" or similar, and gathers results, producing a custom-build page of textual results. This page has no graphs and is not something which could easily be ported to other Moodles (id-specific user authentication and such), as well as repeating all the text in the questions, so if the questions change (which they inevitably will) the code neds changing too. Is there the possibility that Feedback can be extended to include surveys in the global scope? Ideally we need more information to be collected which we do not currently store in Moodle (such as which department the course is in, e.g. Hair and Beauty or Automotive) but that's for a different discuaaion thread.

The module will not be hosted online (for a long long time) the main intent would be for it to be delivered via CD....as long as the user has an internet connection - can I still capture their survey results?

          "Text": "I guess I used the wrong tool for the task but it occurred to me that I could use Feedback to collect data about our students submissions of their final projects but this has become a little nightmare. The idea was simple and I don't know why it shouldn't work. I created a little survey where the students had to introduce (as the answer to different questions) their first name, their last name, the name of their project and the name of the project supervisor. I thought this would save us a lot of time since we would not have to write the title of each student's project in a spreadsheet. The first problem I encountered is the organization of the data. This is my fault because I didn't check how Feedback would output the results into a spreadsheet. I thought that I could export the data into a spreadsheet in the following format: Last Name First Name Project's name Project supervisor Smith Axel How to build a... Peter Brown Seifert Nina Analysis of... Principles of Dana Peterson Peter Brown But Feedback exports the data like this: Last Name Smith Seifert García First Name Axel Nina María .... ---------- Well, that's not the real problem. I thought I would simply cut the columns for the different sections and paste them next to each other to achieve the desired format (as in the table above). I was horrified, however, when I saw that the columns are not ordered! So for instance, I would get: Last Name García Seifert Smith First Name Axel María Nina Project's name Analysis Principles of How to build a.. Project supervisor Peter Brown Peter Brown Dana Peterson So when I paste the different columns next to each other I get things totally mixed up: the Last Name from one person, the First Name from another, the title of the project from a different person, etc. What on earth is going on? I can understand that Feedback will organize the results as a single column instead of rows and columns. But why doesn't each column follow the same order? (where each position in the column for each category or question corresponds to the answer given by the same person) This doesn't make sense. The order of the column for each category seems to be totally random. I have more than 100 entries! Does this mean that I will have to access each answer through 'show responses' and add all the data by hand in a spreadsheet? Please tell me that this is not so. Is there anyway out of this mess?",

Have you ever heard anyone do this?  Also, I am worried that maybe I am misunderstanding the potential of feedback.  I intend for a student to fill it out on a one form per course basis.  Is this possible?  Do I need to do something special to make this happen?

We really like the idea of using hidden feedbacks on the front page , mapping them to the individual courses, and using the feedback block to access them. However, we're very concerned about the performance impact of hundreds of feedbacks on the front page. Ideally, we would like to place course evaluations in a separate course, with the feedbacks mapped to the individual courses. Is there some way to make feedback course mapping work from a course other than the front page? Any ideas appreciated! Thanks, -Ann",

Now i create a zip-file from this book, load the zip-file in this course in the folder files, choose this zip-file to install from this zip-file a IMS-Content Resource , is everything fine. Now i install in this course a feedback (feedback module). I have the possibility the import an xml -file from another feedback from another course. Here i mean it comes to an collision, because i can not choose the feedback xml-file to import this file in a feedback. I mean is has nothing to do that i have install a IMS-Content Resource, i think the imsmanifest.xml inside the zip-file can be the problem. When i delete the zip-file i created before from the book, the import of the feedback xml-file works without any problem. I hope someone can follow me...!? Andy",

Create a Feedback \"My first Survey\" In Feedback \"My first Survey\", go to Roles / Override roles tab Current context: Activity module:My first Survey / Role to override: non-editing teacher Capability / Core system / Access all groups moodle/site:accessallgroups: Prohibit Save changes. Log in as various students from groups A and B check that each student can only view the responses from other students in his own group: OK Log in as John Doe (non-editing teacher in group A) Go to Feedback \"My first Survey\", go to Show Responses tab -> John Doe can view the responses of ALL students (in his own group A and also in Group B)...

Today I got an email from a new entry in one of my anonymous Feedbacks. The person who sent the Feedback was logged in into my Moodle-system.

Little hardware background: Currently I'm running Moodle 1.8.2, coming from 1.6.1+ directly to 1.8. I have not changed any roles. I hope you can reproduce this behavior now. Regards, Daniel",

So \"Stupid\" of me for not update the block but just the activity feedback. Thanks for your patience and your effort in creating such a wonderful feedback module. But there is one wish-list that I would like to see in the next version of Feedback module. A feedback question that have unique answers for each question. Let me explain further.... suppose a feedback has 3 questions - Q1, Q2 and Q3. So, there will be at least 3 answers - A1, A2 and A3 (and so on) If the student select A1 as the answer for Q1, then the student should NOT be allowed to select A1 for Q2 or Q3. Same goes for A2 and A3. (Each answer can only be displayed ONCE in a question AND there should be more answers than question or else there will be questions without answers). Do hope to see such features in the Feedback module and your comments about this. (Can see my other post on Feedback: New Feedback Question Format for details too) Good Luck in creating such feedback question!",

Anyone have a similar experience?",

To correct this I changed line 118 of the /mod/feedback/complete.php file from: add_to_log($course->id, \"feedback\", \"submit\", \"view.php?id=$cm->id\", \"$feedback->name\"); to: add_to_log($course->id, \"feedback\", \"submit\", \"view.php?id=$cm->id\", \"$feedback->name\",$cm->id,$userid); This explicitly passes the course module and userid.
