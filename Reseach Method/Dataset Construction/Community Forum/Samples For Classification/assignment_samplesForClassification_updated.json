          "Text": "Hi Zahra Have you read through the Single upload vs Advanced upload discussion? Some would argue that removing the more flexible option would be more restricting. However... we have done the opposite by removing the single upload assignment type. We saw the Advanced duplicated the Single and our staff likes the response files option. We added the following line to config.php. \n```text\n$CFG->assignment_hide_uploadsingle = true;\n```\n I guess if you type the following it would hide the Advanced - please try and test on a test site first! \n```text\n$CFG->assignment_hide_upload = true;\n```\n I hope this helps Cheers Teresa",

I noticed that adding this line alone doesn't work in my old 1.9.2+ dev site so I had a quick look and found that deleting the mod/assignment/upload folder AND altering the $standardassignments array in the 'assignment_get_types' function in mod/assignment/lib.php like this: was \n```text\n$standardassignments = array('upload','online','uploadsingle','offline');\n```\n I changed it to \n```text\n$standardassignments = array('online','uploadsingle','offline');\n```\n I have to say at this point I'm not a programmer but can 'read' code (to a certain point!). I HIGHLY recommend you make a note somewhere of this change so you know what has be done in case things go wrong! It will also need to be changed and fully tested again after a Moodle upgrade. I've altered the name of this thread in the hopes someone with more Moodle programming knowledge will come in and confirm/fix the suggestion I've made! I hope this helps Cheers Teresa",

I've just chatted to my colleague who tells me that there is one additional modification required if you add $CFG->assignment_hide_uploadsingle = true; to your config.php The //Not wanted if statement should be added to the mod/assignment/lib.php (a few lines under the $standardassignments array. \n```text\n $assignmenttypes = get_list_of_plugins('mod/assignment/type');\n\n\n foreach ($assignmenttypes as $assignmenttype) {\n\n\n if (!empty($CFG->{'assignment_hide_'.$assignmenttype})) { // Not wanted\n\n\n continue; }\n\n\n if (!in_array($assignmenttype, $standardassignments)) {\n\n\n $type = new object();\n\n\n $type->modclass = MOD_CLASS_ACTIVITY;\n\n\n $type->type = \"assignment&amp;type=$assignmenttype\";\n\n\n $type->typestr = get_string(\"type$assignmenttype\", 'assignment');\n\n\n $types[] = $type;\n\n\n }\n\n\n }\n```\n Cheers Teresa P.S. I have also tested removing the ' uploadsingle ' folder from mod/assignment/type and changing the $standardassignments array in mod/assignment/lib.php to $standardassignments = array('upload','online','offline'); and the dropdown does only have the three wanted types (that is without the above if statement). I visited the Notifications page just to make sure the page refreshed correctly so I'm not sure why it's not working for you?? Edit: code formatting",

The courses are mostly assignments, with a ' download a word document, fill it in, re- upload it' type structure, and a course might have 40-80 assignments. So marking is a case of compiling all assignment either for a user, or all submissions for an assignment, downloading the submission files to a dropbox, manually marking them, and using the grader tool to write the score/grade in for each user. It's very labour intensive. The submitted files don't need to stay up on Moodle, however, the record of the submission need to live there for years to come (no unenerolment / removing of users). To date, assignment submissions have been just left in place, so they have built up to 20+ GB of files across dozens of courses each containing several-tens of assignments. What is the most expedient way of removing these files submitted for submissions that have been graded , without removing the submission itself?",

This block will show your son all the assignments that are due across all the courses. However, even if he has already submitted to an assignment, that assignment will continue to appear in the Upcoming Events block. So he needs to manually check if he has submitted his work.",

Im trying to deploy a course based on Flash made activityes (swf interactive movies). I want each swf file to be contained in one activity (so I can have grades of students and stuff) so when the students succesfully end them they get graded on the gradebook. Im planning on using AMFPHP to write the grade from within the swf logic, but I'm not sure wich activity module could I use to deliver the activity content. For now I've seen the offline assignment could be using (displaying the swf movie on the description section, and using some css to improve the appearance) but I would be glad to hear some ideas if possible.

Settings on both activities are: Store Student Papers is set to \"Standart Repository\" Check against stored student papers is set to \"YES\" I've checked also in the \"Moodle Direct File Browser\" and found the same document from two different accounts.

Our University is currently using Moodle 3.2, please let me know if some of them were fixed later (even though physically moving to the university to upgrade Moodle installation right now is problematic). 1. Is there an easy way for the teacher to save annotated PDFs? I was only able it by switching to the particular student's user, and then I have to re-login as a teacher. The scenario is like this: a student uploads a PDF, I annotated it with errors and give the student another attempt to improve their work. Now, a week later, grading the new PDF I want to see my annotations to the previous versions to quickly remember what these errors were. 2. Is there a way to use Unicode characters in annotations? Unicode characters look well in comments while I'm doing them on Moodle site, but in the annotated PDF the students get they get changed to question marks. Is this some Ghostscript problem on the server - I guess some fonts are missing (and how to fix and test it?) or principal problem of Moodle PDF annotation plugin?",

Although I am the teacher, I also appear on the list of students when I view submissions; is there anyway to remove me from that list?

That usually put my students who had not completed it all together so that I could easily see who my slackers were. I remember thinking or reading (or possibly dreaming) about a feature request whereby for assignments, quizzes, etc. basically any time a teacher is looking at a list of student names for a module that there by a check box for the teacher and an option at the bottom of the page to send a message to the selected students. The idea is to replicate the functionality available on the participants list but make it available where it is most useful (namely, when the teacher is looking at the grades). It should be fairly easy to do since it is taking already existing code and just incorporating it in. If this request does not already exist in the tracker I think we should definitely add it. I ended up using browser tabs to copy and paste a message to each student which at least kept me from writing something down on paper. 2. If you have access to the code, you can modify line \\mod\\assignment\\lib.php as follow (from my diff file): @@ -981,3 +981,3 @@ - $teacherattempts = true; /// Temporary measure + $teacherattempts = false; /// Temporary measure Set to False //JCP-07 $page = optional_param('page', 0, PARAM_INT); Now to translate in case you are not a tech person. In the \\mod\\assignment\\lib.php file around line 981 change the value of $teacherattempts from true to false. This will change it for all teachers. There may be another way of handling this in Moodle 1.8 with roles; however, I have not seen it and used this solution on our production server . 3. I'm not sure what is happening with the gradebook and custom scale. How did you define the scale?",

          "Text": "We would like to use Moodle for participants to simply hand in an assignment which we can mark as pass/fail. Is there a way to do this directly within any of the recent Moodle builds? I have found several workarounds in 2.8 (for example setting the pass grade very low and entering a higher mark for passing) but this seems unnecessarily complicated, especially when Moodle then reports back that they have Grade X rather than just \"you have passed\". Overall I suppose I'm looking for something much simpler than \"Assignment\" as it currently stands in recent builds, but with the functionality of teachers being able to have notification of submissions and grade simply, etc. I'd really appreciate some help with this one!

Please if someone knows the complete and perfect solution, private message me with a thorough answer.  I have read different threads, tried different solutions, been trying to mess around with it for months now and nothing is working.  Infact, the problem is escalating.  I am getting names and roles that were not part of the original problem.  My issue is with managing assignment notifications to the intended teachers / non-editing teachers / etc.  I want to prevent all notifications from all roles in all courses.  I want to set only local roles to receive the notifications that I want and in the courses / forums I want.  But I mean not roles (like teachers, non-editing teachers, etc) but I actual and specific usernames.  Example:  I want the notification email of assignment submissions to be disabled in all roles and in all courses, and I went to edit the course ABC which has 5 assignments and set local roles to receive the notification message every time a student submits an assignment in a file format (uploading a file).  I want that the first essay to be set only to user: cindy123 who is a teacher to receive the notifications that students have submitted files for essay 1.  Then, I went the second essay to be only set to user: mark456 who is a Non-Editing teacher to receive the notifications that students have submitted files for essay 2, and so on. I hope I made myself clear.  If someone has a question for clarifications please ask me. Again HELP !!! Awny",

          "Text": "Hi Samuli, The two areas serve two different purposes. The \"Groupings for student groups\" setting under the \"Group submission settings\" area is relevant when you want only students that belong to groups in a specific grouping to submit their work, and of course to submit as a group. The \" Grouping \" setting under \"Common module settings\" is relevant when you want to control how the activity would work with groups and let you filter its data and/or audience. For example, let's choose the default \"Announcements\" forum that exist in each new course. If you would choose \"Separate groups\" or \"Visible groups\", and enter the activity, you would see that now a dropdown appears at the top of the activity, that let you choose a specific group that you can write to (and not the entire course). The same goes for assignment - in group mode you can filter a specific group so only its students submission would appear in the submissions table. The \"Grouping\" setting, of course, is relevant when one you want to limit the group mode to a specific grouping. I hope it's clear. I don't have much time to edit this answer, and wanted to give you an answer as soon as possible.",

The site calendar will also show all of their assignments and of course they have to be logged in to see their assignments. Another option is to use MyMoodle and set up a sticky block for the calendar and/or the Upcoming events block. Good luck!",

To make things easier, I gave a front page role of teacher to the four teachers in the Moodle. This made it such that we were never more than two clicks away from being able to grade someones work. Out of the box it worked with a limited number of the main Moodle default activities , but used a plugin system so that I was able to add a few others for my own use.",

          "Title": "Modify Grading Reports so Parents do not see Late Submission",
          "Text": "The vast majority, if not all assignments for our students at a small high school in Florida, are offline activity. Only 1 teacher, rarely, ever requested or required students to submit assignments online. Consequently, when teachers get around to entering grades (I understand it is still a PIA for teachers to complete grading of assignments in a prompt manner), it could be as much as 2-3 weeks after the assignment/test activity was completed. Consequently, when parents view their child's activity report, they might see that an assignment was submitted 3 weeks late. Not good!!! I have searched the forums and cannot find any threads/posts explaining how to modify the Moodle settings so that such late grading does not result in a activity report reflecting 23 days, 15 days, etc., such that parents will not believe that their child turned in their assignment late. At the same time, our teachers find it extremely useful to have a due deadline setting on their assignments, so that students have no reason to argue that their assignment was not late. I would appreciate any guidance from someone who has tackled this issue before, or may not have but knows how to adjust Moodle's settings to accomplish this goal.

That sounds like students are authenticating via the student information system or LDAP and the students no longer attending the univ  have had their accounts on the SIS or LDAP disabled. The student account might still exist in the Moodle, but cannot login because their credentials in LDAP have been changed/hidden/blocked from being used to authenticate. If there is some automated setup where the students no longer have access to the authentication server then they are also 'removed' from Moodle, then the removal of the student could erase all of their work. Student work is not kept in one table/folder in the sea of files in moodledata/filedir/ ... depends upon class and mods/ activities .   Assignments have a set of tables for all courses ... not each course ... as do forums, as do other things like blogs, etc. So what to do to archive?    At the close of the academic session, before the student is removed from Moodle, make a full backup of the course - that includes students and their work/grades/ teacher comments, etc... Download or put that full backup somewhere on LAN/WAN or download for restoring. OR, hide that course .... make a no user backup of the course, restore the no user backup for use the next academic session. OR, once you have a full backup downloaded, reset the course removing all students work and account.   That leaves the teacher and all resources/activities, etc. in the course and the course visible and ready for new students.

One of the instructors is using a 250 point scale in Turnitin but it apparently can't translate back into Moodle. I created a custom scale and the young lady assigned that scale to her Turnitin assignment in Moodle, but Turnitin refused to use it with a rather nasty message that the scale was not an integer. My next theory was to alter the standard 100 point scale to go to 250 but I can't seem to locate the code that creates that particular scale. For the moment what we're doing is turning off the grade book in the Moodle classroom and the lady is going to use Micrograde instead. This isn't really a solution though. We're using 1.9.5+ build 20090909 on Fedora 9, mySQL 5.0.77, apache 2.2.9 and php 5.2.9. I'm not sure what version of the Turnitin module we're using because... well, mostly because they tend to put version notes on every file instead of an overall version and every one of the version notices seems to be different. The most recent numbers I found on any of the files are as follows: /** * Extend the base assignment class for assignments for Turn It In API * v 1.1 2007/02/01 10:00:00 Northumbria Learning * * v 2.0 2007/06/27 8:50:14 Northumbria Learning * Adapted for Moodle 1.8",

This allows them to demonstrate all of the formatting skills they need for their academic writing, and teachers can access the files and use Turnitin for grading and plagiarism checking. All of this is creating a fairly smooth workflow and opportunities for feedback. However, there is a problem with test security. Although the test is given in a controlled environment and the files are removed from student computers immediately after submission, it is possible for students to download their assignment submission from Moodle at any time. This means that students can share their test essays, including the writing prompt, with future classes. While writing prompts can be changed, the ability to download previous test materials creates a strong temptation for students to \"help out\" their friends. Sharing of previous test materials is seen by my institution as a form of academic dishonesty. This could be easily nipped in the bud if it were possible to restrict student access to past assignment submissions. Is this possible? Or is there another way to administer the assessment outside of using an assignment? Thank you for your ideas and support!",

Firstly set the assignment to be marked as complete on submission. We then use activity completion restriction to restrict access to the assignment - you have probably already worked out, that you cannot do this directly, e.g. the assignment itself won't appear within its own list of possible restrictions, but you can create a triangular relationship to do this as follows: I use either the checklist plugin or the pulse plugin: If using the checklist you set this to contain 1 item (the assignment) and mark it as complete if 100% of items are ticked off. So the checklist will mirror the assignment's completion status. You can then add the checklist as the restriction to the assignment.",

Que a muchos gobiernos tanto nacionales como provinciales no les insteresa la eduación sino la formación de individuos capaces de ocupar un puesto en una línea de trabajo creo que es algo que no tiene discución. No quiero decir con esto que la educación no nos debe preparar para el mundo laboral, pero creo que esto no debe ser uno de sus objetivos, si dejamos que las empresas pauten la dirección, el sentido y la magnitud de la educación, nos estamos equivocando feo dicho de otra manera: Personas humanas y no operarios ciudadanos y no clientes.

          "Text": "I work with younger pupils who often forget to saveold work and create new versions of their work as they progress through a projects. One of the major marking criteria is how they have improved their work so I need to collect work in at various stages. To do this I use separate assignments (no grade) each week and then a final assignment at the end that I actually grade. I know that I can now use teh advanced upload to allow them to upload multiple files at the end which is fine for pupils who have saved different versions of their work. I could then look back at teh no grade assignments for the other pupils. What I would really like is for all of the files from the whole course (only 5 or 6) to be handed in separatly each week but for them all to show up in the final assignment to make marking easier and faster. Has anyone got any ideas? The only thing I can think of is to create links each week that link to the final assignment, but I'm not sure if this will confuse pupils as it will not have the assignment icon and it will only have the instructions on the upload page for the final assignment, listing all of the pieces of work that need submitting for the project.",

          "Title": "see previous rubric results while grading after resubmission in Assignment",
          "Text": "I use Moodle 3.3.1+, and I recently did an assignment in which the students submitted their work in groups. Groups consisted of two, but sometimes only one student. I used group submission, so if one student of a group submitted, the other student automatically was considered to have submitted the work as well. I used a rubric for grading, and the students could submit their work in multiple attempts until obtaining a passing grade. When the students submitted a revised version, I used Edit > Update grade to grade the work again. This sometimes brought up the rubric filled in with the scores in each category that I gave for the previous version (with a green background in the rubric cell chosen), which was very practical. But sometimes there was no indication of previous scores, only the overall grade was shown at the bottom, and that was quite annoying, since I wanted to compare with the previous scores. I noticed that for a group with two students, only one would have the previous scores in the rubric, the other not. For these groups I simply picked the student with the old grades showing to do the grading of the next version. I assumed it was the student that submitted that would have these previous rubric results visible, but it turned out that it was the other, non-submitting student that had these results, and that these were actually the results of the previous attempt, since the feedback and the attachment of the previous attempt were also shown, but there was no warning that I was modifying a previous attempt. I would insert my new comments above the old ones and replace the attachment with my new version. This was less practical, but at least I could see my previous scores and remarks while grading the new version. For the groups with only one student, my only option was to edit the feedback on the previous attempt deliberately, with the View a different attempt button at the bottom of the grading window. It would be great if there was way of seeing the previous grade details (in a rubric or with other grading methods) and comments when grading a resubmission of an assignment without modifying the previous attempt. I personally do not use the PDF in the grading window (I enter my corrections and remarks in a text editor and upload the file as an attachment), so there would be room for a split window design with the previous attempt on the left. Another improvement would be to update the total score for the current rubric on the fly (or at least give a button that allows to calculate the total score as it is at that moment), without having to submit the grade first.",

I installed Assignment (zipped from the 2.7 moodle and uploaded just that folder) , which did install the table and the automatic upgrade started. The majority of the rest of the assignments went through without any hassle after that using the up-grader. It appears that although it seems like was in the 2.7 zip file, something deleted it before it ran an upgrade and thus no table was created for that function to run. I am baffled as to how/when it was removed. Adding it back into a 2.7 moodle allowed the table to be setup (saw this in the Assignment setup xml file). I guess I could remove it again now it has all gone through.",

          "Text": "We are currently experiencing some bizarre issues with the Assignment activity in our Moodle 2.4 installation. We've hit a brick wall, and are hoping that someone has some ideas that might help. Here are the issues: When grading, instructors have the option to add a feedback file. They go through the process of browsing their repositories and uploading a file. When they choose the file, and save the grades.... everything gets saved except the Feedback file (the grade applies, feedback comments appear.... but the Feedback file column remains empty). The students have confirmed that they do not receive the file. We'd like to be able to use Feedback files, any ideas on how to fix this? If an assignment is set to Students submit in groups - Yes and \"Require students click submit button\" to Yes then we have another issue. The student who submits a file only sees an \"edit submission\" button. They do not see a \"submit assignment\" button. But, all the other members of their group see both an \"edit submission\" and a \"submit assignment\" button. We'd like the original student who submitted the file to see the \"submit assignment\" button, too. The final issue we've run across is for any assignment that does not have the maximum submission size set to \"course upload limit\", then any one who submits their assignment has it go automatically into a draft mode. They do not have any options to submit their assignment as a final submission. We haven't been able to find any information about these issues. If anyone can point us in the right direction, we'd be very thankful! If it helps, our current configuration is: Moodle 2.4.6+ PHP Version 5.4.23 Apache 2.4.6 Thank you for any help you can provide!

When one student has submitted, the other members of the group will be able to see who still has to submit. https://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Assignment_settings#Students_submit_in_groups As for #3 issue, draft mode is a result of \"requiring students click submit button.\" The idea is that students can submit drafts, teacher comments and then reverts to draft, ad infinitum.

Very similar situation to our issue #2... just as the result of different parameters. We did think about separate threads for these issues... but with the similarities and the fact that they all have to do with file submissions in the assignment module... we were wondering if there might be some sort of common setting (maybe even something in our LAMP configuration) that might be affecting all these issues.

What do you actually see down there where the submit assignment button should be? My first thought is that the html is getting truncated as it feeds to the browser. I'd be inclined to view source for a page returned with \"submit assignment\" and one without and compare. If they are different (they probably are), the question becomes \"why is the html being truncated?\" There is a similar tracking item here https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-44099?jql=text%20~%20%22submit%20button%22 with a screencast, but I think that case is confused by the browser having both a student and a teacher logged in at the same time.",

However, sorting is still an issue since \"No submissions\" are still mixed in with drafts when I use the \"Not submitted\" filter and then sort for \"Last modified (submissions)\". I see this as a design flaw especially since 46 out of 310 students are posting their work to the dropbox as drafts oftentimes when they mean to submit their work for grading.  Hopefully in future versions of Moodle, this flaw with sorting can be fixed.  Ideally, I would like to be able to sort for submissions that require grading  and drafts using one filter for both.

More generally, \"Using Moodle\" is a worldwide collection of Moodle users and developers discussing different aspects of this course management system. But the short answer is to Go into your son's Moodle classroom Scroll down, looking at the middle column, until you see something like \"Assignment #1.\" Click on it. Likely, there are directions right there, but even if not, there are two basic ways to submit an \"assignment.\" Copy & Paste into a text box (like the one you composed your question in) Upload a file, which is typically done by clicking the \"Browse\" button, navigating to the file you have created, selecting it, clicking open, clicking \"Upload this file,\" and clicking \"Continue.\"",

          "Text": "Thanks Josh for the help. The problem I am having is that there is an expediated way to upload grades into gradebook that works first from downloading an Excel form that captures temporary IDs, which are formed after some algorithm of \"Participant\" + whole number. You then use this worksheet to enter your grading information that you then upload into Moodle's gradebook. The IDs (ie Participant + nr) that gets produced are only temporary, so I cannot use them from assignment to assignment because I have a full off-line grading tool I have built and works off one main ID that is always permanent through the semester (or even spanning multiple semesters). In addition, the strategy Moodle 2.4 uses with this option does not work at all for me because it forces you to only use comma delimited files. Within the feedback I generate to students, there can be commas as part of my narrative - this hangs the import process for CSV files - so I need to use tab delimiters, which are not accessible from that interface. When I generate feedback, I have automated algorithms that wrap my commentary with HTML tags, and there can be regular paragraph type narrative with all the expected punctuation one uses when writing - doing this produces easy-to-ready feedback, which is the point. (As an aside, in my recent experiments with Moodle 2.4, I have discovered that what I can have in my feedback will create parsing problems for the Moodle algorithms - eg, I discovered that ellipses and double-quotes makes the import function hang. Therefore, in my grading tool, I now have a little alert that is displayed if I forget and use either mark in my narrative.) There is a more full way to do this I discovered by working directly in the gradebook. While I can successfully upload everything, and set mapping between the fields I have in my grading tool with Moodle grade book fields, as well as set the delimiter to tab, it would be so much easier if the expedited approach could be modified to do the same thing by making two simple adjustments: allowing settings to be made that set the key field (ie for user ID), which isn't a temporary identity, and set the delimiter. I need to do all my grading outside of Moodle (or any LMS) because I am also developing methods that leverage new learning analytics to support more meaningful grading, monitoring student progress, and allow me a means to leverage technology to generate a more personal experience for the students by capturing specific things they do and incorporating that into my feedback. It would be nice to share my approaches so that they could be integrated into Moodle or other LMS, as I see that the present state of LA is still in its infancy as it is being currently used here. I don't get the impression though anyone is really interested. -George",

A student submitted a paper (uploaded to the repository) in the normal assignment. When it was uploaded, the student received an e-mail saying their TurnitIn profile had been created. Now, we know that normally happens when a student uses the TurnitIn assignment for the first time, but this happened for a non-TurnItIn assignment. We're stumped as to why the student had a profile created. The only thing our team can think is that the TurnItIn assignment setting enabled TurnItIn to check against the student repository and it created an account for that reason so that TurnItIn could check against it.

I checked the activity log for each student and it does have an entry for them uploading a file to the correct assignment.  The file is located in the proper place in moddata assignment folder under their user id.

There aren't any role overrides or special role assignments.  As I said, all the other 90+ students' assignments are fine.  If you upload a file and then delete it, there is a \"Last modified\" date in the assignment submissions view, but in this case, the box for \"Last Modified (student)\" is completely blank.

          "Text": "It's probably related to the same underlying issue. After digging through the moodle database and server logs for a few hours, I think I have an explanation for my case.  We have experienced quite a few issues like this, and part of the problem may be that we use CAS authentication. The scenario: A student views an assignment at 10:30pm. The student leaves their web browser open overnight.   Meanwhile, working late in MS word, he writes his paper. In the morning, the student logs back into Moodle in a new tab. The student finds the already open tab with the assignment page they loaded the night before, and uploads their submission (a ms word document). That's a sesskey mismatch... the form from the night before was stale, and referenced a session which expired. The assignment handling code accepts the file, and stores it in the appropriate moodledata directory for that course and assignment.    But it rejects the rest of the operation because of the sesskey mismatch. By my read, this code is wrong: assignment.class.php, line 119: \n```text\n            require_once($CFG->\ndirroot\n.'/lib/uploadlib.php');\n\n\n            $um = new upload_manager('newfile',true,false,$this->course,false,$this->assignment->maxbytes);\n\n\n            if ($um->process_file_uploads($dir) and confirm_sesskey()) {\n\n\n                $newfile_name = $um->get_new_filename();\n```\n \n```text\n                ...\n```\n \n```text\n            }\n```\n I think Moodle should check the sesskey first.   I don't see why it should call process_file_uploads regardless of whether there is a sesskey mismatch. It should be something like: \n```text\n            require_once($CFG->dirroot.'/lib/uploadlib.php');\n\n\n            $um = new upload_manager('newfile',true,false,$this->course,false,$this->assignment->maxbytes);\n```\n \n```text\n            if (confirm_sesskey()) {\n\n\n              if ($um->process_file_uploads($dir)) {\n\n\n                $newfile_name = $um->get_new_filename();\n```\n \n```text\n                ...\n```\n \n```text\n              }\n```\n \n```text\n            }\n```\n Since moodle processed the upload, the file got stored on the file system, and the instructor could see it.  Yet Moodle didn't log a sumission for this student (in the mdl_log or mdl_assignment_submission tables). Of course this all relates to a bigger issue, which I hope is better in Moodle 2.x.    Moodle needs to do a better job of handling session (and auth token) timeouts that are discovered in the middle of an operation.    It has come up before in the tracker. http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-11972 Best, -Garret",

We have tried http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=30613 , however that is a source modification (we would rather use modules and not fork from the core) for an old build and not without its problems. Our requirement for this improved \"General Assignment Module\" can be briefly defined as: • Allow any member of a group to submit an assignment on behalf of the whole group, as well as allow individual submissions, and offline activities requiring no submissions (only marking and feedback). • Assign any combination of participants or groups in the course the task of marking that assignment (and therefore all its members). All grades and outcomes must propagate to the group members’ gradebooks. This includes self and peer evaluation within the groups. • Assignments must appear to be coming from the group in all contexts and not from the individual who uploaded the assignment. In fact the uploader can be any group member or individual (such as a marker, group leader, or teacher). Cheers, Mike Kulesza",

The key code from this is the line \"$this->record_submission($submission); //ALAN\" and the associated \"function record_submission($submission)\", \"function copy_dir($from_file, $to_file)\" and \"function copy_file($from_file, $to_file)\". 2) studentsubmissions.php should be placed in /course (this is a new file). If you access the URL : http://yoursite/course/studentsubmissions.php?id=X where X is the userid of any particular student you will get a history of all submissions and a history of all grades for that student. On my site I have a way of navigating to this page for each student, but that part is specific to my site and would not work for you. Before using the above code, the relevant database table will have to be created by hand with the following SQL commands... CREATE TABLE mdl_recorded_submissions ( id BIGINT(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, This code is tested and works with the 20090520 weekly build (although that part of Moodle is stable, so I think it will work with builds going back, at least, to late September). The only assumption that I can remember in the code is that it assumes the database prefix is mdl_ (the default, I know that is lazy.) One other thing is that there is some other code in lib.php which is specific to my installation but which will not be triggered by your installation, so should not be an issue. Please tell me if it works for you. If there is something specific to my installation that I have forgotten and causes you a problem, I am willing to change it for you. Alan.",

          "Text": "If you want students taking the same course from a number of different teachers to have the same program of study then using what I call cohesive Moodle course is the wayto go.  All teachers use the same resources (though they may add their own also if it accomplishes the same learning outcome) and give the same tests etc.  This has the added advantage of producing data about student outcome in the course allowing it to be used in evaluating teachers (though I would not necessarily focus on that).  To get teachers to accept this model will require some up front training and discussion of benefit to students.  I have taught in this model for a number of years and like the collaboration process that it requires.  With all of the free online resources for working collaboratively it should not be a problem for teachers at different geographic locations to work as a team.  Two heads are better than one and when uploading etc the individual teacher does not have to do all the work. Warning though-teachers will likely balk at the idea initially so it may need to be presented as a requirement to get it started. Hope this helps, Kathy",

Mostly found in the general math and English classes, our teachers run multiple sections of say Algebra 1 or English Lit 1. The sections (or Periods since the sections are taught at different periods during the day) are ALL the exact same curriculum and so teachers don't want to setup 7 courses (one for each section or period)... the answer is Groups. We ran this way last year and our teachers reported no problems with either students seeing other class work or teacher having issues managing the courses. The only issue that was initially raised was a question of pacing. That is, one class (or section or period) getting ahead of another class. This is only an issue if the teacher did not want to \"expose\" the next topic until a specific assignment was complete or date had passed. Hope that helped...",

I thought about a functionality like you have in tests, where you can select one or more users and drop their results. Backup and restore of a whole course is no real solution for me, and I won't suggest this to my teachers. Reset a course is also no good solution, because only the entries in the database are deleted (or maybe hidden), but all uploaded files from assignments still exist. Regards, Daniel",

          "Text": "Hi, in 2014 there was a discussion here in the forum on the same topic: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=257428 Unfortunately the discussion has been closed, so I have to open a new thread. The scenario described in the discussion cited above is this: - Have your students hand in group solutions for an assignment no. 1. - For assignment no. 2 students change the group and hand in a solution with their new group The problem here is: If a student is in Group A and receives a grade for Assignment 1 and\nthen moves to Group B, the student will suddenly have Group B's grade for\nAssignment 1 if Assignment 1 is re-graded. The proposed solutions were to either a) use a new grouping for each assignment or b) not to -re-grade Assignment 1 anymore once Assignment 2 allows the handing in of solutions. Imo neither of this is a real solution. Solution a) makes the organisation of assignments especially in large groups (>500 students) very uncomfortable and unnecessarily complicated. The problem here is that it is not enough to create new groupings for each assignment, you also have to create new groups. This puts a lot of workload on the teachers which seems all the more unnecessary as in our scenario not all students  change the group but only those whose partners left the course or want to join a different group because they don't get along well with each other. And this happens quite frequently at the beginning of a course. What makes it more complicated is the fact that in our scenario students can choose their group. So creating new groups and having the students choose a new group each and every time extends the process a lot, especially as some students tend to forget things and will not choose a new group which means a lot of additional support for the teachers. Solution b) also is not really a solution as it is not safe and it is very hard to tell all the teachers using assignments at a university not to re-grade assignments if groups have changed. What is more, with assignments in large courses and on a weekly basis it is not possible to (finally!) grade the whole assignment before the next one starts, even with a dozen of tutors. So my question here is: Is there any other, clean and preferably technical solution to this? Kind regards Harald",

          "Text": "This is a general problem with the assignment module which either wasn't considered when the module was designed or it was deferred as there do exist workarounds. But as Harald says we can't use these workarounds. In my opinion this is a bug and should be fixed in the core. Would anything speak against that? The problem is this: For each group submission the groupid is stored. If the submissions are graded, then a student switches from one group to another and then his grade is changed again, Moodle checks which group he's currently in, who else is currently in his group and updates the grade for all of them. Instead we'd need to have separate DB tables like \"assign_submission_groups\" and \"assign_submission_groups_members\" where we would store group info and group membership at the time of submission. It could look like this: assign_submission_groups id assignment idnumber name description descriptionformat picture hidepicture 1 1 g1 Group 1 1 0 0 2 1 g2 Group 2 1 0 0 3 1 g3 Group 3 1 0 0 4 2 g1 Group 1 1 0 0 5 2 g2 Group 2 1 0 0 assign_submission_groups_members id assignsubmissiongroupid userid 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 6 4 1 11 5 2 4 6 2 7 7 2 8 8 2 10 9 3 1 10 3 5 11 3 9 12 4 2 13 4 3 14 4 9 15 4 10 16 5 5 17 5 7 18 5 8 19 5 11 In this example you groups of (up to) four. For the first assignment you have 11 students (IDs 1 through 11) in 3 groups. After that assignment the group compositions change: Students 1, 4 and 6 drop out. The remaining two students of group 3 move to groups 1 and 2. Student 10 doesn't like it in group 1 so he asks group 2 if one of them wants to switch places with him. Student 11 agrees and they switch places. Later they hand in their submissions for the second assignment. The DB table \"assign_submission\" would then no longer have a column \"groupid\" which refers to the \"groups\" table but an \"assignsubmissiongroupid\" column that refers to the new \"assign_submission_groups\" table. I haven't looked at the PHP code yet, so can't say how much would need to be changed there to make it work. Would something like this be an okay solution? Am I missing something? Edit: The group info (name etc.) stored in the new table wouldn't be updated if you change the group info after the assignment. This might cause confusion, possibly. But a) I'm not sure most people would even want the group names in old submissions \"updated\" and b) even so it's still better than unintentionally changing student's grades (and not noticing it!).",

Let's assume a teacher is willing to go this extra step. In our case usually the students choose themselves who they want to work with. So they choose the group. As Moodle core doesn't offer this you have to use a plugin like groupchoice. So in addition to the teacher having to create new groups and do the grouping again (I'm talking about courses with several hundreds of people and a large number of groups accordingly) he has to create a new activity groupchoice. Then the students have to choose a new group although most of them will keep the group members they already worked with. This is osmething our students have already been complaining about in the past so we changed that with our current system which is not Moodle. So, the teacher has to make sure that the group choice activity expires before the next assignment starts. That's already complicated as usually with weekly assignments the deadline of the first assignment ends with the publication of the next assignment. So you have to find space for doing the groupchoice and have to make sure that really all the students have chosen their group before the assigment starts. And I'm still talking about several hundred students here. You have to make sure that the groupchoice has been done before the assignment starts as it is not possible to be in no group or more than one group with group solutions. In both cases a student doensn't hand in a solution for a special group but for a mysterious standard group the teacher has never seen before. In this standard group there are all the students that have more than one group or no group. If a student creates a solution for this standard group he hands in a soluton for other people without even knowing it. If students have not chosen a new group in time (and you know how students are) the teacher has to put in extra time and manual work to put them into groups. This is the result of my tests. Maybe I oversaw an easier solution but doing all this work will be very complicated for teachers that have far less time to spend on learning to understand Moodle than I do. That's the problem I see here. About the second thing that you mention: If student X works in group A for assignment 1 he should get the grade for that solution. If he changes to group B for assignment 2, why should he get the grade of that group for assignment 1? He didn't work with that group and their solution at the time of deadline. What if group B gets a weaker grade than group A for assignment 1? Then the student would complain, and rightfully in my view. What would be your scenario where it would make sense? That's what I tried to find out but couldn't so far. Best regards and thanks for your answers! Harald",

          "Text": "That makes sense. But, I think the problem is that whatever solution is found has to take care of all scenarios.  What if assignments overlap and students start jumping back and forth between groups.  How is Moodle meant to know where that student's grade comes from for each assignment?  Hence groupings...not the easiest way, I know, but I cannot think of a better way to be sure that student gets the correct grade without locking down the flexibility that is available now.  You cannot use the assignment due date because some courses do not have due dates.  You could say they get the grade for whatever group they were a member of on the day of submission but what if they have already switched?  Or what if the group is allowed to resubmit later and the member has moved groups?  So many scenarios where your proposal does not work... I am not disagreeing with you that teachers need an easier way, I just have not figured out how to make it work...I wish you luck in finding something that will!",

(In case you let the students choose their groups through a plugin like groupchoice this still means you have to do all the groups again, I guess.) So, if S1 ist part of Group A for an assignment and wants to join Group B for the next assignment, then the teacher has to create a new Group C with S1 and the members of Group B. And he has to create a new group D for the remaining members of Group A. Because for the new grouping you cannot re-use the old group A (and neither you can re-use Group B). Another Group E that remains stable from the first to the next assignment can remain as is but has to become part of the new grouping of course. The groupings in this scenario are Grouping 1 (Groups A, B, E) for Assignment 1 and Grouping 2 (C, D, E) for Assignment 2. So, basically it works with groupings but still to me it seems rather complicated and difficult to explain to users. Best regards Harald",

As a school wide plan we have agreed to assess students in the following weighted categories - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Category 01: Work Ethic                             Weight: 10 Category 02: Collaboration                          Weight: 10 Category 03: Written Communication             Weight: 30 Category 04: Oral Communication                  Weight: 10 Category 05: Content                                 Weight: 40 So some assignments will be assessing the students in all of the categories and others in only some of the categories.  The sample list below shows how some assignments would be in one category and others are in multiple categories. Assignments                                                01      02      03      04      05 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Presentation Notes                                     0/30     /0      /0      /0      /0 Oral Presentations                                      0/75   0/50   0/25   0/25   0/25 Rough Draft-Peer Check                               0/50     /0      /0      /0      /0 Rough Draft-Content Check                            /0      /0      /0      /0    0/40 Collaboration Points-Group Division                   /0     0/50     /0      /0      /0 Is there a way to create an assignment so that it is in each of the categories and  can be assigned a different value?  And only create one assignment? I have looked at outcomes and that is the same for each time something is associated with that outcome- so that won't work. I looked at Rubrics- and that will only allow the areas to be weighted for that individual assignment and I can not look at how they are doing collectively within a category. Right now I see the only solution is to create the Oral Presentation assignment five times once in each category so that it will add to the weighted grade. Adding the same assignment 5 times is a lot of work- if anyone has any solutions please let me know.",

Adding the same assignment 5 times is a lot of work- if anyone has any solutions please let me know. From a brief look at what you're trying to do I would have to agree that you need to create 5 iterations of the Oral Presentation each with a different grade. This might not be too difficult using the Sharing Cart though which would allow you to duplicate the assignment and then change the associated grade. Check out the Downloads -> Modules and plugins page for Sharing Cart. The latest version can only be obtained via CVS apparently but if you're stuck contact me and I can get it to you. Another reason for using 5 separate assignments is that you're probably going to need 5 separate due dates. Hope this helps Mark",

An activity might have more than one outcome, and each may have a grade against it (usually on a scale ). Other terms for Outcomes are Competencies and Goals . In simple terms an Outcome is like any other grade except that it can be applied to multiple activities . When the activity is marked, a mark should be given for the submission itself and for the outcome.\" They need to be enabled at site level and each outcome appears as a separate item in the gradebook so you can provide different weightings.

If not, then your moodle is using the built-in phpmailer which can't pass muster on systems bent on protecting 'customers' - and there are more of those than just gmail.com. A good SMTP relay setup will pass muster with Google checks ... those checks are SPF, DKIM, valid no-reply address, etc. - multiple. Ask those students to check their spam .   Also, if they had previously gotten something from your Moodle, ask them to look at the 'Show Original' of that message.   That will show the full header of the email message which shows the mail servers that message ran through to get to their inbox. The 'Receivied' lines in that header are the important ones. 'SoS', Ken",

In Moodle, I left everything as default bar entering in my client id and client secret (from the google dashboard ). As we aren't using it for a login alternative (just for assignment conversion for grading), I only have configured and discovery with green ticks in Moodle. I am using my webmaster email at this screen for the system account connected spot which is different to the one I had to use on teh google dashboard (wondering if that might part of the problem - maybe). I was unsure for the scopes in the instructions what/where that URL was supposed to be placed/used???  So could be a problem that I've not done something without correctly.

At this point I have NOT added the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive as I am unable to due to not using https and even trying to use the free ssl site you kindly provided, I can't set it up. However... When I then go back into the assignment to test the PDF converter works for real not just the Moodle test of it, it still does not convert the docx file (and docx is listed as a compatible file type) I tried also creating an assignment from scratch as I've seen some people say they had to do this. Still does not covert. By not convert I mean says its doing it but just gives a blank page. So some success with getting the test to at least work... but now the real use isn't still... Jayden",

          "Text": "We're creating a B2B course that helps organizations to figure out the most important factors to focus on when they create an incentive plan.  In itself this is quite unique, so I'm hoping that there are modules which may be able to handle these various requests that we'd be asking the \"students\" to do.  (background: the incentive plan is designed to change behaviour within the organization so that ultimately it becomes more profitable, with better cash flow and generally speaking a better employer) There will be 2 components: the learning section with quizzes to test understanding and the doing section (and it's the doing section that's causing me some grief).  In the doing section we won't be grading the students but we will be providing guidance to help them along the way.  They will be \"grading\" themselves in the sense that they will be weighting ideas, discarding most and calculating the value of them (we will be helping/mentoring/coaching along the way). Assignments will be along the lines of: Create a flow chart of primary activities Cycle Point Evaluation worksheet (areas for improvement with an importance rating... which I hoped that the weighting function might be able to handle... categorization between a long term or short term objective and categorization between a hard or soft objective)  This info is stored and used later Objective Evaluation Worksheet (uses the previous worksheet and any items with a rating of 3 or higher gets kept for further review/analysis which includes scoring/weighting the objectives with scores for 4 other variables.  The weights are added together with the importance rating for a total score) Then they complete a series of worksheets (some where we ask questions, others where the objectives from previous worksheets are selectively brought forward) and summaries are required where they look at a number of factors which impact the objectives and rate each objective with a score They take the objectives that have the most value and look at the financial implications, again by inserting variables for each objective and Finally, they create rules for the incentive plan (rules are what are used to determine who earns points, rewards or recognition for what behaviours... we won't be using Moodle to track those results ... thankfully!) Any suggestions about which modules to use for each of these 6 main assignments?  I'm assuming that nothing will fit perfectly, so if there is any advice about further plug-ins or even programmers that can work with the modules to make it work I'd appreciate it. Oh, BTW , I'm learning Moodle as I go along and my past experience with dbases/programming has been as a client who scoped out the requirements and let the programmers make it happen... what have I got myself into?!? Thanks in advance... I realize this is a weird request! (and I have another one which isn't as weird but I'll post it separately!)",

Now the question changes: Is there a way for Teachers to submit to an assignment? We were thinking of creating a new course(B) and enrolling all the teachers form course A to course B as students and meta-linking the course, but we assumed that seniority would give them Teacher abilities only even though they have both roles. Is this correct? -Thanks!",

It would for most teacher be really easy to create at least all assignments by just uploading an excel sheet with columns like: start date end date topic etc Where the script will write the excel sheets into the database . Then all assignments are there already and a teacher only has to add extra resources. Of course the same possibilites could be there for other modules. I'm not a programmer so I don't know if it's possible but searching the internet I already found some ways to upload Excel data into a Mysql database. Jeroen",

          "Text": "First off, these things do not just happen, so what's changed? Find that out and it might answer your question. There are three areas where filesizes can be limited, the Server, depending on the server, so that can be altered in the iis .ini file in windows Server, the httpd.config file in Apache to set the file sizes to a particular size. You will need to discuss these changes with your Systems Admin people to get these changed. The second place to change is the php.ini file. the values of max_file_size, max_post_size and max_time_out need to be increased to suit your need. There should only be one useable PHP instance on your server so there it will be. But again, you may need to check with your Systems admins to get this checked. You can look at the PHP.ini file values by going to Site Admin > Server > PHP info, unless the System Admin have turned it off. The last place is inside Moodle, there is a site wide setting in Site Admin > Courses > Course Default Settings    and see what the Site Maximum upload size is. There is also a limit placed in all courses so in Course > Edit Settings > Files and Uploads. That should cover it all. AFAIK , Moodle has never had an issue with differentiating User uploads, so is there something the Users have done to limit their own uploads? Never heard of any such thing, but anything is possible, I suppose. Don't know about uploading from a phone though....mmmmmmmm",

          "Text": "Hi, we're using the Humboldt Upload & Review assignment type in Moodle 1.6.1 and are having a problem with the reviewed files that teachers are uploading back into the assignment. Once a teacher uploads a file that has been corrected or marked up in Word, the reviewed file becomes invisible in the assignment. Any idea what's happening with this? Also, in researching through the threads about AU, Upload & Review, and the new Upload (1.7 version), I'm thoroughly confused as to the future of this sort of an assignment type. What is currently in 1.7 that provides this sort of Upload & Review functionality and is it indeed backwards compatible with 1.6? Finally, today when I went to make some changes that were recommended by Mark Pearson in lang/en_utf8/assignment.php, the changes were already present in my stock assignment.php file and included the necessary strings for the Upload & Review assignment type. Thanks!",

The problem is that without a grade, students do not have access to the response file. Enter a grade, and voila, students can see the response file. It seems that there is something in the PHP that says, \"If there is no grade, then the student cannot see the response file; if there *is* a grade, then students can see the response file.\" I need the code to be written such that \"grade or not, students can see the response file\".

Something like \"grade pending\" would be fine, but what I'd really like to see happen is just have the gradeless file released at the PHP level, without having to muck around with setting the grade to \"pending\". @Gary I'm using 1.9.5 here. I'm not sure there is a reason to block release of the response file either, and if the teacher really wanted to block all feedback (response file + grade), they could go into the gradebook and force hide it. I see no reason to have the response file hidden simply because there is no grade assigned to it yet.

One thing I can't figure out though: I have an offline activity (how does the student do the interview with the customer?) that has to be scored by the teacher on a number of criteria (how is the use of language, does the student show patience with the client, etc). It seems that the offline activity is only suitable for one criterium. Any suggestions on how to achieve my goal? Thanks in advance and have a nice day! Ronald",

          "Text": "Hi Ronald, I would suggest you try the Marking Guide for this. You choose 'Marking guide' under 'Grading Method' in the settings. The Marking Guide gives you the opportunity to set up a form with different marking criteria; you can award a grade to each criterium and Moodle calculates the grade for you based on your previous settings. It is a bit tricky that when you choose 'Marking Guide' in the settings, you don't get to set up this form yet, so you don't see the advantages of this method straight away. You can set up the form after creating the assignment: when you have chosen 'Marking Guide' as your grading method (Instead of Simple Direct Grading) and you have created the assignment, you can see 'Advanced grading methods' under 'Assignment settings' in your settings block. You click on that and there you have the opportunity to set up the marking guide exactly to your specifications. This can also be used to allow students to see in advance how the grading criteria are set up. I hope this answers your question, good luck with your offline assignments!",

I could go for a full LTI plugin but this seems way overkilled. Bonus : after the automated grades were uploaded, a teacher would still be able to manually fix them ... because you know, automated software are not always 100% reliable :/ I have begun to build such a webservice but we must not be the first ones to ask for this workflow.

Turnitin Account ID, Turnitin Shared Key, Turnitin API URL setting are ok. But it has a connection error. Could not connect to Turnitin. Double check your API URL setting. I have contacted to Turnitin Support. They advice to update following? Do anyone has any idea; how to resolve this issue in Godaddy cpanel shared hosting? If you encounter connectivity issues while using the Turnitin Moodle Direct V2 integration (error: Turnitin API Base URL incorrect or unavailable, or error: Double check your API URL setting) this could be related to a CA certificate being unavailable to cURL. Viewing the Turnitin Apilog files will identify if this is the case. The Moodle Direct plugin uses the server operating system's implementation of cURL. If cURL has an out of date (or no) CA certificates, the interaction with Turnitin will fail due to cURL performing peer SSL certificate verification and not being able to verify the Turnitin SSL certificate.  Until cURL 7.18.0 some CA certificates were provided, but after 7.18.0 no CA certificates have been provided at all. Because of this, the Moodle server administrator would need to ensure that an up to date CA certificate bundle is used. For Debian and RedHat based distributions: CA certificates are distributed in the ca-certificates package. Gentoo servers provide them via the app-misc/ca-certificates ebuild. It's also a good idea to make sure that the OpenSSL libraries (libssl) and cURL libraries (libcurl) are up to date on your server. You will also need to place a file with the Bundle of CA Root Certificates (downloadable from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem ) on your webserver and make a curl.cainfo reference to this file in your php.ini.",

It is just that the submission comments of the assignment activity are not notified (the feedback comments work fine). I believe is because Moodle does not trigger submission comments notifications, so just wondering if I can \"activate\" them without touching the code (something like Site administration > Messaging... etc), but it seems it is not possible (perhaps this deserves a Moodle Tracker ?). Everything comes to the context . I have students that need to submit assignments, but they can submit just one or ten (or one hundred) assignments. Some of them prefer one big assignment, whereas others like several but small - and that's totally up to them. So we need to \"mark\" them individually, so as a workaround we have set up Maximum Attempts = Unlimited and we use submission comments for the feedback of each attempt. It would be great if they receive a notification every time there is a new submission comment from the teacher. (another thing we can do is create individual assignments, but this will be super messy and confusing).",

To stop him accessing any other course you need to put enrolment keys on the other courses - you can do this via the course settings from the admininstration block again. Alternatively, once you have put enrolment keys on all your courses you can TELL the student what the enrolment key is for his course and he can enrol himself. You could do this for once he has completed course number 1 -you could give him the key for course number 5 for instance. The other way if you have a lot of students is you can enrol them straight into the course you want them in via csv file -Take a look here http://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Upload_users",

I've been looking at the documentation and watching videos of development of Moodle plugins but still don't fully understand what is going on.

Finally given me a chance to look more closely at how things work. After some investigation, have discovered that no matter what is done in the set up (except for cut off date which defeats the purpose) - student can edit their assignment after they have submitted, including after the due date. So, students can go to the assignment and click edit submission anytime after the due date and upload a 'new' assignment. Styaff will not know as usually notifications are turned off There are 2 ways of preventing this, markers need to either prevent changes or lock submissions. However, still in shock that students can delete and re-upload after the due date. Possibly after the tutor has marked, given feedback, and then the student then makes changes. Should that student ever appeal their grade in the future, the assignment will be [much better], and there is little chance that whoever is taking the assignment out of the back version will notice the date stamp. Am i completely wrong in my thinking here? It seems to me the following is more appropriate - Resubmissions prior to due date, no submission changes except later submitters after the due date... Is this achievable?",

          "Text": "Hi, Madhusudan. I saw your post in another thread and decided I needed to understand this possible feature gap better. While I really need the cutoff feature myself when I teach Composition or other related rolling deadline type coursework, I agree that a site admin should be able to make decisions based on what is the general protocol used at his/her institution/organization. I think I am understanding a little bit better now. Since I personally always either used the submit button or cutoff date options, I didn't understand that the \"attempts reopened\" option (which I usually set to manual for myself from the default never) is also highly dependent on using the submission button. I just tested it for myself and found the same results that \"Edit submission\" was still an option after the due date if the submit button and the cutoff date are not used. Sooo...if I'm understanding it correctly, the use-case demand in this thread is that there be a way to set a hard deadline without using the submit button as the main default control, which I totally understand. From the other thread where it was suggested that a tracker item feature request be suggested, it seems there may be something in the tracker worth looking for on this subject. I will have a look today as I do understand why this option would be preferred in many organizations.",

          "Text": "I did a little digging and found that others had the same query here: Submission@assignment: Editing submission is possible although it isn't allowed MDL-43494 where the assignment maintainers confirmed that this is expected behavior if the submit button is not used, and I just confirmed in Moodle 2.8.7 that the edit button is still there for my student after I graded it if I didn't use the submit button or the cutoff date option (since I had never really tried that myself before). In this case, it may be that some of the language around what does what needs to be refined, perhaps, as it does say \"submitted for grading\" whether I require the submit button or not. But the student cannot submit or change anything after I grade it if I do turn on the cutoff date whether I use the submit button or not. Which brings me, I guess, back to the question of why this cutoff date feature is insufficient to meet your needs and why you think teachers will not understand how to use it. It is pretty standard practice in many institutions/academic departments to allow late submissions for a period of time that get huge deductions in credit if they are late and then NO credit after being so many days/weeks late. If I am teaching a course where I am using the use-case you describe as having students turn in something at my desk that I will absolutely be tracking for timestamps/timeliness, then I also understand it is my responsibility as the instructor to be at \"my desk\" to receive the assignment if I am using the delayed cutoff date. This can be done a couple of ways if you use the marking workflows. If I want Moodle to control absolute timestamps and not have to be at \"my desk\" so to speak, I can set the cutoff date to be the same as the due date. It isn't that much of an extra step, really. You can set your site defaults for the assignment to turn on the cutoff date by default so that teachers will need to make that decision the same way they need to make the decision to have a due date or not.",

See, for a teacher coming over to Moodle Assignments from the world of paper, the natural expected behaviour is \"the due date is the due date - they are no late submissions\". Late submissions are allowed in an instructor dependent manner in many Universities (including our own) but they then contain other possible fancy stuff like - penalty based on how late the submission is (late by 5 minutes is different from late by 1 day). I think that allowing late submissions should not be the default as it is highly dangerous for some teacher who does not read all the docs and makes semantic assumptions on the basis of what is written. In my case, I realized that the submissions were open a week after the deadline as I had just assumed that the due date was the due date. Imagine the sinking feeling I had when I realized that the submissions were still effectively open. Should the cut off date exist as a control - absolutely. There are use cases where this would be useful (time dependent penalties where I can write an expression for a function with values between 0 and 1 which multiplies the score received would be amazing). My argument is about default behaviour.",

I very much sympathize regarding the misinterpretation of terms as I have done similar things in the past where I found out, much to my chagrin, that certain grade-related terms did not mean what I thought they meant in the country where the functionality was developed (In other words, it was a moment of, \"Huh, I guess that does not mean the same thing in Australia as it does in the U.S. Who knew?\"). That said, at first I thought it was mostly just a language issue that could be refined by just better naming conventions. Then when I tried out your scenario for myself, I did really wish that whatever the cutoff date functionality is called (it is really the final, absolute due date), I could use it without having to set a due date, per se--meaning that from a user perspective, I do agree that it would make the most sense to have the ability to set the cutoff date as the date that shows up on the assignment info page communicating to students what is due and when and that if it could be set without a due date, it would essentially BE the final due date. Not sure how that would work or if it would be possible to do without causing havoc in the code. It is good that you have brought up this issue here as now we can find out more about what is possible from those who know the code, explain the basic requirements for the change, and then have someone take the pertinent parts of the discussion to the Moodle Tracker where we can have the nitty gritty functionality/feature change request discussions with the developers. In addition, from there votes will tell them how many of us who use the module think this would be useful.",

It would be interesting perhaps to find out what the majority use case is in terms of defaulting late submissions to be allowed or not, but for me I think the way it is set up at the moment is certainly perfectly in line with what my institution does and my awareness of what other institutions do. Without that late submission (or if it defaulted to not allowing them and relied on tutors remembering to turn it on) we would have to set up a different way of getting late submissions in and returning feedback and grades for them.",

There are some faculty colleagues here who have done away with any notion of a due date (it is mentioned but it does not mean anything). Most don't run their courses that way. However, the default case should be something that does not do violence to the notion of a due date, and removes any possibility of unfairness. Let us take two worst cases: 1. Due date = cut off date is adopted as a default in a place that allows late submissions as a matter of course. End result of an instructor misunderstanding the meaning: inconvenience for the instructor and students. 2. Due date = malleable, cut off date = actual hard stop date as a default in a place that does not allow late submissions as a matter of course. End result of an instructor misunderstanding the meaning: unfairness for the students as soon as some students figure out the loophole, and resubmit their assignment after the instructor releases the solutions (usually on the due date). Shall we weigh inconvenience vs unfairness and a complete ethical disaster? It is clear that scenario 1, though it runs counter to the current Moodle practice is the safer option. I am not sure if I can explain this better than that. My experience of two countries (US and India, at least in engineering) suggests that the due date is the due date - if you want a late submission, make a special request. Maybe it is different in the UK/Australia/elsewhere.",

          "Text": "Hi, Davin. I guess I'm a little confused as to why the three main controls you have mentioned for the assignment module (lock changes, prevent changes, and use cutoff date) are not satisfying your requirements. As someone who has used the assignment module extensively for writing workshops where rough drafts can sometimes be VERY rough, I will say I absolutely needed the ability to allow my students to submit a new draft to me between the deadline and the cutoff date if they completely missed the mark on their original submission (and by \"missed the mark,\" I don't mean they fell short of a good grade; they actually missed the point of the whole exercise the first time they tried it or some other similar misunderstanding occurred). It is part of the learning process for developing writing skills, so with that type of assignment, deadlines really are just metaphors. You are right, though, at a certain point, they should not be able to change their work and should have to live with their submission as is for that particular learning experience. The cutoff date worked for me there. Where I needed even more restrictions, I would also employ \"restricted access\" dates or other criteria so that they could not change work after whatever date I communicated as the absolute last day they could pull that assignment back into a portfolio somewhere (for me this was usually the end of the term). Perhaps restricted access would give you the additional \"off\" switch you are looking for on editing requirements if the other options are not working for you. If you don't find this option available to you in assignment settings, you just need to turn it on at the site level in Site Administration>>Advanced Features. It is a small tick box for conditional access.",

If you are able to provide a patch or links to your Git repository branch, please add a patch label so we will spot it. Otherwise, how about posting in a forum on moodle.org and encouraging people to vote, comment and/or come up with a patch. See tracker: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-58995 Why this post.. I like the challange, though I am curious of more users stumble in this issue and if so please vote for the tracker to show your support. As well, I am open for all comments/suggestions/examples that are available. You can either share them on this forum, or place a comment at the tracker. New MUA project? If in the next 3 months this idea get's more vote and input, I will work out the details and first will try to make this a MUA project. Gemma",

I have 11 groups of teams of four under a grouping . I set the \"grouping for student groups\" to the grouping, and also Grouping under Module settings. I thought that the new groupings feature would let me assign a grade for one member of each group and that the grades would then automatically be given to all students in that group. I can grade each student individually if I go through the groups one by one, but that is a lot of work for 44 students. Am I missing something obvious (as usual)?",

          "Text": "Hi Steve, Don't be so hard on yourself. I will attempt to explain how Groups and Groupings fit together as a concept, since I'm not sure you understand this area. The idea of \"Groupings\" is that they are sets of groups. They enable you to organise your students in different groups for different activities . For example, you might group 40 students into 10 groups of 4 for Activity 1, and 5 groups of 8 for Activity 2. You would create 10 groups for Activity 1 and assign those groups to a Grouping called \"Activity 1\". You would then create 5 groups for Activity 2 and assign those groups to a Grouping called \"Activity 2\". You would then assign the Activity 1 Grouping to Activity 1, and the Activity 2 Grouping to Activity 2. That way, the membership of groups within each grouping is independent, and when you are working with students' work in each activity, you can only operate using groups that  are linked (via the Grouping) to the relevant activity. Now one of the settings for the new (2.3+) Assignment module in 2.4 is the setting for \"Students submit in groups\". If that is selected, I think that allows you to grade each group's submission and have the grade applied to all members of the group. I'm not sure I've made it any clearer for you, but... Cheers, Rob",

Specifically, I have a file upload assignment in my course and I am trying to set the default option for \"Notify Students\" on the Grading page to \"No\". So I go to Administration -> Plugins -> Activity Modules -> Assignment -> Assignment Settings and find the option labeled \" Default setting for 'Notify students'\". But this setting is confusing. It is a single checkbox with the following description: >Set the default value for the \"Notify students\" checkbox on the grading form. First of all, the \"Notify students\" option on the grading form is not a checkbox--it's a combo box with the options \"Yes\" and \"No\". Second, this default setting has a default of \"Yes\", but it is supposed to be a setting for changing the default?? How can a default setting itself have a default? How can I change the default setting of this default setting?? I tried saving with the box both checked and unchecked, but neither seem to make any difference. Is there yet another default setting somewhere I am missing? Any knowledgeable assistance would be greatly appreciated. I am working with Moodle 3.0.3+ (Build: 20160331) Version 2015111603.04",

With regards to the text on this page that says 'Default: Yes', this is simply informational text letting you know that the default in a clean Moodle install is to have this setting set to yes; it doesn't mean your chosen setting hasn't taken effect. You should find that if you change the Site Admin setting and create a new assignment, it has indeed taken effect. To change the default setting on an existing assignment, go to the individual assignment's settings, scroll to the Notifications section and change the default setting there for that assignment's grading form. I think this is likely what you are missing. Of course, the grader can then override this for each submission.",

Related, is it possible to automatically display the name of the person who last edited a particular 'Page'? When a 'Page' is edited, it automatically shows the date and time that the 'Page' was last updated/edited, but it does not show who wrote that 'Page' originally, nor who last edited. Looking at the mdl_page table in the Moodle database , I note that the table has a timestamp field, but no author/last edited by field, and looking at the php files just hurt my brain ;)  but if anyone has any suggestions on how I can edit the table and/or php files so that every time I create a 'Page' (or modify it), my name is recorded and displayed. Does anyone know if there is already a plugin that would do this or can point me in the right direction to modify the code in order to do this? Thank you very much in advance! Laura",

          "Text": "Hey, All: I have a user requesting a fix for what may or may not be a bug in Moodle 1.7.x; I'd appreciate the community's view on this use case: 1. an assignment is created out of 100 2. a student submits, and is graded 80 (80%) 3. for some unknown reason, the teacher/tutor realizes the assignment should really be out of 50 and edits/updates the grade for that assignment 4. the gradebook now shows that the student got 80/50 (160%) 5. instead of the teacher now adjusting the student's mark, I am asked to make the gradebook automatically change the student's grade to be 40 so that the student still gets 80%.... Intuitively, it seems to me like there are two practical solutions: either the assignment activity should lock out editing the grade after at least one assignment has been submitted, or perhaps this should just be a human workflow issue related to the flexibility of the tool: if you make a mistake and decide to change things later, you may have to go back and adjust where necessary.",

With normal assignments the loading times for the view all submissions is few seconds, with group assignments this pumps up to 20 to seconds. We looked into this and it seems that the view uses a query that takes 682ms to plan and 0.351ms to execute in PostgreSql , but it runs the query 30 times to create the view -> 30 X 0.6seconds = 18seconds. This seems little excessive. We do realize that part of the problem is the amount of groups & group members in our system (we generate them automatically for all courses that have groupings in SMS) : avle=# select count(*) from mdl_groups; count ------- 30662 (1 row) avle=# select count(*) from mdl_groups_members; count -------- 302825 (1 row) but this behavior is making the view all - view unusable. Our environment is load-balanced 6 nodes ( VM ) with hardware DB (Postgre Sql 9.4), yes it's a large installation... Any ideas how to proceed?

          "Title": "\"Multiplicator\"? can any one explain this?",
          "Text": "Let me get you started and you can pick it up from here: In mathematical group theory , the Schur multiplier or Schur multiplicator is the second homology group H 2 ( G , Z ) of agroup G . It was introduced by Issai Schur ( 1904 ) in his work on projective representations . The Schur multiplier M( G ) of a finite group G is a finite abelian group whose exponent divides the order of G . If a Sylow p -subgroup of G is cyclic for some p , then order of M( G ) is not divisible by p . In particular, if all Sylow p -subgroups of G are cyclic, then M( G ) is trivial. For instance, the Schur multiplier of the nonabelian group of order 6 is the trivial group since every Sylow subgroup is cyclic. The Schur multiplier of the elementary abelian group of order 16 is an elementary abelian group of order 64, showing that the multiplier  can be strictly larger than the group itself. The Schur multiplier of the quaternion group is trivial, but the Schur multiplier of dihedral 2-groups has order 2. The Schur multipliers of the finite simple groups are given at the list of finite simple groups . The covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups are of considerable recent interest. Schur's original motivation for studying the multiplier was to classify projective representations of a group, and the modern formulation of his definition is the second cohomology  group H 2 ( G , C × ). A projective representation is much like a group representation except that instead of a homomorphism into the general linear group GL( n , C ), one takes a homomorphism into the projective general linear group PGL( n , C ). In other words, a projective representation is a representation modulo the center . (-:",

When a teacher/user restored her carefully-crafted course from our development environment to our production environment, all the TIMEAVAILABLE and TIMEDUE settings on her assignments changed to a date about 8 years and 1 month into the past. And it happened again in a second course she restored the same day. We have the restorelog.html files with entries like: -------- Assignment - Weekly Assignment Chapter Question/Answer TIMEDUE was Wednesday, 16 January 2008 TIMEDUE is now Thursday, 9 December 1999 TIMEAVAILABLE was Monday, 7 January 2008 TIMEAVAILABLE is now Tuesday, 30 November 1999 -------- We've been able to reproduce the problem (at least on the surface) by choosing a different term start date when we restore the course; but she swears that she didn't change it. I tend to believe her -- because although it happened in two courses that she restored on the same day, it's such an *odd* date change. It's like she accidentally dragged her cursor over the drop-down term start date selection and dragged to a different year... and a different month, and a different day -- *twice*?",

At first I came up with a similar solution, only the other way round: I designed a new teacher role without notifications and enrolled teachers in the course under that role. Then in each assignment I gave the teacher the local standard teacher role. It's simpler because permissions aren't changed in each individual assignment, but just once in the new role. But it's actually better if the role used for enrolment is the standard teacher role, because teacher are enroled in the course through an SSO/ CSS API with that role, which I cannot change. So thanks a lot for this astute solution!",

As a work around, I've seen faculty require students to export activity results and upload them as a submission to a separate Assignment activity with a due date.  For example, students answer questions in an H5P interactive video activity, export results, and upload the export to the separate assignment activity for credit.  Is this the best work around or am I missing something?",

What the student was looking for was a place to save their work in progress in Moodle (a la Word) and then call it back up again later, revise it, and resubmit it. As I understand what you are suggesting, they would be able to overwrite an assignment with a new assignment, yes? But they would not be able to call up their previous assignment and make changes to it. Which is what they are asking for. Perhaps it's just not a possibility, or is there another module that might do this? TIA, Bob in PA",

The advantage to saving it in Moodle, however, is that they could continue to work on something either at home or at school. They can't log on to the school server from home and pull up files. My workaround for last week was to tell them to email their In Progress file to their home address, work on it there, and then email it back to their school address. It's clunky but workable.

The Wiki is named after the Assignment, and placed just below. Wiki alone will not do, because Wikis are not graded. You can even add a forum. The whole bunch pays off if you have teams of student working on several subjects. You can use Assignment, Wiki and Forum in group mode. - Enrique -",

I have a final year project which is to develop an automatic grading for unstructured essay in our e-learning which is using moodle. Can i know where should i do the editing code for assignment submission so that i can try to do the automatic grading when student submit their answer?sorry for bad english. I hope you can help me with this. You can give me any suggestion so that i can develop this project. This is some introduction for my project: \"Assessment System is an application to facilitate lecturers to mark or assess their students assignment automatically. The application can be developed using linguistic knowledge or the integration of semantic relations between words and their syntactic composition. Currently, Spectrum(OUR E-LEARNING) does not provide automated assessment for unstructured text such as short essays or report. Thus, it is very time consuming for the lecturers to mark the students assignments. Besides that, the subjective nature of essay assessment leads to variation in grades awarded by different human assessors, which is perceived by students as a great source of unfairness. So, this issue may be faced through the adoption of automated assessment tools for essays\"",

Getting a system to look at, evaluate and provide a reasonably accurate grade for a piece of unstructured writing that goes beyond a sentence that can pick out a couple of key words/phrases will require extensive linguistics, model answers, plaigiarism detection (or integration with existing plaigiarism plugins) and so much more besides. The direct answer to your question is that submission and feedback plugins are just that, plugins in the assignment system and you can look at several of them in core or in the Moodle plugins database to see how they work. You would need, I think, to create a new submission plugin to accommodate the work you are proposing.",

For one the sample answers, let say we take the student answer. First i will do a tokenization. I will split the paragraph into sentences, sentences into words. After that, i will filter the stop word. After finish filtering the stop word, i will do the stemming. So, we will have some words that can be use to compare with the lecturer answer. We will repeat the same step for the lecturer sample answer. For the comparing part, i will use vector space model (boolean). Lastly, i will get the accuracy for the student answer compare to the lecturer answer. For example, 0.8 so the student will get an A. I will try to develop this first before improve it with semantic. Can i know how is the easy way for me to understand the backend coding for this plugin. I am new and i have a tough time doing this. Any advice?",

Participants see this when they visit their Assigment page and scroll down to view teacher's feedback. - I am sure this must be related, but participants can ONLY see the first teacher's feedback. If other teachers give feedback later on, it is not visible to the participant, although it is saved and visible to teachers on the grading page. If that same teacher who gave the first feedback edits their feedback, it saves fine and is visible in the grading screen to them and other teachers, but the participant cannot see the additions/edits. More details: --- I am using a non-upgraded install of 1.9, and have already tried re-downloading and installing the Assigment module. Grades are disabled. As a test I enabled grades for that assigment, and gave a submission a grade. As soon as a grade is given to a submission, participants are able to see the date correctly, and they can see all feedback/edits to feedback!",

Current setup: We have a standard course where students upload their assignments, and the teacher for the course marks their work. (Students are assigned to a tutor group within the course). New Requirement: We are now engaging with organisations for this same course where the students are not permitted internet access . The organisations we are working with, do have supervisors for the students so they can upload the work on the student's behalf (uploading scans of the exercises). We're looking for the best setup to allow the supervisors to upload work on the behalf of some of the students that are enrolled on the course. (Those that belong to their organisation.) Questions Can I give supervisors the ability to upload on the behalf of some of the students, or would they be able to upload on the behalf of all course students? Can I assign \"upload assignment as student\" but not grant the supervisor any grading rights? Is there some other solution/plugin/option I have overlooked to accomplish this - perhaps it's not an assignment, but some sort of workflow where the supervisor adds their work as if it was a review step instead of the initial upload? Many thanks in advance for any assistance that can be offered.",

If that is correct, then one way to achieve this is to have one group per teacher - put the teacher and all their students in that group. There is then a permission called accessallgroups which you can set to prevent - (I usually set this for the role of non-editing teacher), this means that the teacher will only be able to see their own group. You can then 'hide' the grades' etc locally at assignment level.",

The only instance I use assignments is as a one way document upload so we can share documents with new employees safely, without others being able to access them - including managers for GDPR compliance. I was hoping that there was a capability that restricts users from seeing these assignment uploads so that only admins would have access to them. I think the easiest solution, just for those who may stumble across this thread in the future, would be to just not enrol managers in this course and have it run by admins only. However, if there is such a capability within mod_assign I would love to know what it is. I will play around with the groups feature as I auto assign cohorts based on office locations, thereby allowing easy groupings by office. Thank you for this suggestion!",

I tried some other LMS like last version of eFront but due to stay \"standard\" I decided to use as main tool nice Moodle LMS. My problem is as follows: I'm teacher of 12 class, divided into 3 grade (6th, 7th and 8th). Each class have 25-30 pupils. It's not problem to upload their name, password ... but I'm tired of particular assignment for each pupils to some units, it's slow and boring. I would like to see is there some ability where I could during the registration user process (pupil) to assign them to some group in order to make more easier assignment this custom group to particular unit, e.g. all pupils from 7th class belongs to group 7grade etc.? Is there some option in new version to create some custom group of users in order to simplify this monthly or weekly task? Thank you.",

I would like to be able to make this process more easier, for example during registration of pupils create some special group, called e.g. class7 and in same time enroll particular pupils to this group. During enrollment pupils to the category and courses, its more faster to enroll only group called class7, as single item, than to do it 120 times for each pupils from this grade.

I have a group of students I need to change the submission date for because they submitted their assignments manually. I don't have due dates (students can submit at any time while they are enrolled). If there is no edit option to change the submission date, are there any implications with having our tech person changing the timestamp on the assign_submission table? This could be a workaround as this is a one off event we need but don't want to cause corruption on the database if that field is used/needed elsewhere. I know editing the database is not recommended but just need to know if the timesubmitted field on the assign_submissions table would potentially affect anything else. Thanks, Nikki",

Some notes: Always take a back up of the database before making changes such as this. Presumably the affected students have made only one attempt. If not you\nmay need to specify the attempt number in the UPDATE statement so that only the records with the correct `mdl_assign_submission.attemptnumber` are modified. Moodle stores date/times using the Unix epoch format . Make sure the values for the new date/times are correct for your timezone. The course and site logs will\nshow the events (for example, A submission has been submitted ) at their\noriginal times. This won't create a problem in the database but may be\nconfusing if someone reviews the student's actions in the\nfuture. When I tested this I used the following queries ( MySQL / MariaDB ): 1. Get the IDs for the affected students: \n```text\nSELECT id FROM mdl_user WHERE username IN ('student1', 'student2');\n```\n 2. Get the mod_assign ID for the affected course activity: \n```text\nSELECT instance FROM mdl_course_modules WHERE id = 123;\n```\n 3. Change the students' submissions' modified dates to 12:30 UTC today.: \n```text\nUPDATE mdl_assign_submission\n\n\n  SET timemodified = UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2024-03-17 12:30:00')\n\n\n  WHERE assignment = 52\n\n\n  AND  userid IN (9, 10);\n```",

It also causes havoc with our extension request plugin, because if the student was \"seconds\" late, we have to then grant an extension to make them not late (providing the staff use their discretion to accept this), so changing the submitted date *may* be a better option...of course as long as the intervention is logged so it can be see in the history.",

On another note I want to use an assignment to track a paper exam, and be able to quickly enter the marks in a column, but I cannot seem to make that happen either because it insists that I \"override\" the grades, or go through the laborious one student at a time grading interface.

If you want students to be able to indicate when they are done, you would need to use an online assignment, maybe asking students to add a few comments or a short summary. Alternatively, you could use a Choice activity with just one option, 'Done'. For tracking a paper exam, you could create a manual grade item in the gradebook, as described in the documentation Grade items . Another possibility would be recording the marks in a spreadsheet, then importing or pasting them into the gradebook, as described in Grade import .",

I have looked extensively in the documentation and can't find anything close to what we would like - an assignment activity is possibly the closest I can find and apologies if I am off topic. This must be a fairly common requirement : we would like to have staff create a list of \"projects\", and for students to self-select from this list. Ideally, selecting (and rating) their first 5 choices. In a perfect woorld there would be some algorithm to work out the optimal distribution of \"projects\" to students (although I realise this is far from what an assignment is and does). It seems there was a \"Project Module\" once worked on but development seems to have stopped almost 10 years ago. Other aspects of what we would like to do for the assessment, such as Multiple Markers and Mutliple Grading plugins are available by assignment/project allocation is still missing. With thanks, JS",

You then change out the ID in address bar appropriately to reflect the other id (the broken ID) This was my temporary workaround, I then dived in a bit further. In the drop-down menu you will see \"My preferences: Grader report\" --> Select this. On this page scroll down to general and in my case I adjusted the \"Students per page\" variable. Once I downsized that it cleared the 500 error. Trial by error/fire. Gotta love it! If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again. ( William Edward Hickson )",

          "Text": "Hello all, I am working with a professor who is using the assignment feature to send out her midterm exam as an additional file, and then using the file submission option for students to complete the exam and submit it back to her. She has since contacted me because she is suspecting that the students are cheating on her exam. She has expressed interest in using groups to give different versions of the test, but she doesn't want the students to know that they are in different groups with different tests. I have successfully figured out how to create the groups, and have tried restricting access to an assignment by only giving a certain group the ability to see, but all students can see the group name that it is restricted for. It would only be a matter of time before students learn who is in each group so they can link of up with the people in their group to cheat on the exam. So basically, is there a way for this professor to create separate assignments for separate groups, but only have the  one corresponding assignment show up on the main Moodle page that applies to a particular group? Thanks in advance! Christina",

Make it timed and make all students have to log on at the same time to take it. Then use random questions in a random order and limit the time they have to take it. That will limit the amount of cheating that happens but honestly, if it is not a controlled environment, then students can google the answers anyway...",

The teacher can see which assignments have become hidden if he goes into \"Grades\", \"User Report\". Selecting a particular user is not necessary. To fix the problem he goes into the course and clickes \"Hide topic\" once and \"Show topic\" once on the eye for the topic that contains the hidden assignment (The course is in topics format)  and then the assignment reappears in the gradebook. This phenomenon is however becoming so frequent that the teacher cannot keep up with clicking Hide/Show to keep the assignments unhidden. We are using Moodle 2.5.2+ (Build: 20131011).

She never grades the assignments via the gradebook, so it's really odd that they get hidden. They also don't hide anywhere else but the gradebook.  Other courses that are setup the same but instead use conditional access for opening/closing topic sections , don't have this problem. Your fix for it didn't work for me, but going into the Gradebook > category items > hiding, then unhiding the assignments did fix it. although I really find it hard to see a connection, It could be some kind of misread for the gradebook when you unhide items that were previously hidden using the topic section show/hide toggle. Another possibility is the items were \"double hidden\" by using the hide on the activity, as well as the topic section and the gradebook doesn't adhere to both \"unhides\" Would be nice to know what causes this but if anybody else has the problem you could try both what Ragnar and I suggested.",

I can see where this is useful if I have lots of students with fewer assignments, and would mark their work as I go. Assuming I had  a high number of assignments but only a few pupils. Is it possible to download all submissions of an individual student across all of the assignments that they have done. So they may have had 20 assignments in a month but I wouldn't want to do my marking until the end of the month. I would only want to download assignments that an individual user  had done. This is more because I also need a printed copy of their work, this would be easier to do per student instead of per assignment. Is this possible Thanks in advance",

Click on the first user's name. Click on 'Complete report' in the user's profile. Scroll through the page, locate each assignment uploaded by this user, and save it to your computer. Go back to the list of users and click on the next user's name. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for all users. I know that sounds like quite a manual task, but if you have only a small number of students, the fact that you can download all submissions from each student via a single page (the 'Complete report' page) should offer some relief. I wonder if an automated process would make sense without introducing an additional layer to make the assignment filenames logical. Even when file-naming instructions are given, students don't always follow them. So even if there is a way to download all the submissions in one go, it's likely that you will experience some confusion about who submitted which document or for which assignment!",

The student must have submitted himself (and optionally been graded) before he can access the submissions by other students. We have another plugin for allowing resubmission saving an historial record of previous submissions. Please, read this other thread . This plugin only knows about files submitted by the \"file\" plugin and text submitted by \"onlinetext\" plugin. No other submission types are managed. Please, feel free to experiment with the plugin and to request any changes or further refinements. At this moment this code is in a \"just works\" state. Code could be simplified, cleaned or refactored. We expect comments, suggestions and  criticism for improving it.",

The two hiccups meant a delay of two hours, 'course prohibitive in Swiss standards! ;-( Can confirm: \n```text\ngit branch --track MOODLE_31_STABLE origin/MOODLE_31_STABLE\n\n\n\ngit checkout MOODLE_31_STABLE\n```\n That said, I am not so sure, whether my trial upgrade was on a fresh set of code. I have no other explanation for the missing files. Git didn't complain and all the key files I know, where there are version information, are correct. Well, don't expect a serious post-mortem, now this 3.1 is in production. (I have a bad feeling though, and in the Murphy country, those bad feelings do get materialzed!) Whatever, will write you a PM on the OT, once the dust settle. Not that we are going to change history, you know...!",

So added to the list of things to check ... plugins/addons ... I knew that ... duh! So now I have moosh installed on all of them .. run the plugins check to make sure there is a compat version of all addons prior to pulling the trigger on upgrading.   Even have to check with 'client' to find out just how significant it is to keep the plugin that hasn't been kept up to date .... 'client' sometimes installs on production to get a look see, then decides not to use (even though there is a sandbox for such things - it's just 'eaiser' for 'client' even if 'client' has been warned to be 'careful' for such play on production). It's their moodle ... and they can use it/abuse it however they like.    Hmmm ... is that why I make the 'big bucks'? (yeah, right). Anyhoo ... glad you got it sorted. Kinda shows this is an area that Moodle will one day have to address ... updating and/or upgrading Moodle from within Moodle itself. That's becoming the 'expectation'. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

Don't have a 2.7 any more to look see and much of below is from memory ... which as we all know declines with age ... ﻿ Don't re-call now which version it was that had the Assignment Upgrade Helper introduced.  Have you run that script? Do re-call, had some teachers restore older backups to a newer site one time an had to run the upgrades again to fix an issue ... but that was many moons ago so can't remember the particulars/errors, etc. What would happen if Moodle no longer knew about that plugin? Do an sql dump of mdl_config_plugins for backup so that when/if you try the following and find it doesn't work, you can recover. In mdl_config_plugins there is only one reference to the old mod_assignment select * from `mdl_config_plugins` where `plugin` like \"mod_assignment\" The version value is 2015111600 ... from a 2.7.highest DB if it were removed?   Try this only after one is sure the Assignment Upgrade Helper ran successfully asn the old is hidden and a plugins overview check shows NO instances anywhere in the site. And here's one that I know might be impossible to answer at this point, but, when you made the first move from regular to git by chance did any old code creep in there and ya did something like git stash or some other to get by a bump? Might be time to do a side load of the 2.7 code ... copy to new sideload known addons ... and then switch the code directories making the side load the site - while sill keeping old code. Trying to get the code to upgrade/update the DB has always been a task. Then there is also the XML editor ... I looked in a 3.0.highest site (loweest I have at present) and didn't see anything related to mod_assignment ... the old.  Is there in 2.7.x?   Course it's 3AM here and I need some zzzzz's.

Since this is in the Assignment module, are we to assume the assessments are being given with the assignment activity type.

With the quiz module you can create a question bank with way more questions than you actually plan to use and have Moodle randomly select questions from the bank. You can randomize question order and also randomize any multiple choice questions. You could also use the security settings that close the quiz if students leave the window (can be defeated with the right know how). You could also set a timer on the assessment so students have a set length of time to complete.",

Looking at the code, the Turnitin module generates its own code for the form unset($options); for ($i=0;$i<=100;$i++) { $options[$i]=$i; } $mform->addElement('select', 'grade', get_string('overallgrade', 'turnitintool'), $options); turnitintool_modform_help_icon('grade', 'overallgrade', 'turnitintool', $mform); $mform->setDefault('grade', 100); While the moodle assignment uses the system wide code $mform->addElement('modgrade', 'grade', get_string('grade')); $mform->setDefault('grade', 100); Is there any reason why I can't swap these bits of code?

Does anyone know if this can be done (or if there is a plug-in with more pen customization options)?

My dilemma right now is that the thick line weight makes writing comments difficult, especially comments that involve punctuation. For example, writing these phrases has caused me trouble: \"D23:F23\" \"Within variation\" Most of the problem arises from difficulty in making small marks (like a dotted i or colon), and my writing has to be over-sized to create legible letters.",

This is really perplexing me, and is very annoying as I've ended up doing several versions of the same assignment - none of which I can delete because they aren't showing up where the editing icons are. I think the version of Moodle we are using is 1.5.4, but I don't see a place to check this. Has anyone else had this happen? Melissa Holloway Bacon",

Additional info: Looking up user roles for the course says that we are able to edit assignment submissions, but the drop down on the assignment submissions screen is missing the \"edit submission\" which the other courses has.

Someone will still have to query the DB to find the contenhashed file names and their humanly recognizable names and script a way to extract those files while one might also have to change the file names so that their are re-cognized as belonging to the student.  You'll also have to query the DB for a grade.   Once you have both, the files you can store again but what of the meta data ... the grade/assignment title, details to the assignment, the teacher involved, etc.. Even if one programmed all that, one ends up with a specialized mini-moodle site just for the purpose of archiving. Seems like a lot time and expense there. Might be easier to clone active site and archive it ... set it up so that it's internal to private network only, read only, no student access any longer, no teacher access any longer, only admins .... access when needed. How many request for such information does your entity get in one year? There's a college on the west coast that spins up a new moodle every academic year ... the previous year is still on line but in an 'archived' setup/state.  Teachers and Students can still access for one year but cannot change anything.  Site then restricted even more after that one year ... no teacher/student access ... only admins.  Am guessing at the end of 10 years, they can finally delete. And to throw a real monkey wrench into the mix .... got any students from the EU in there? my 2 cents! ;) 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

We abandoned cloning it this year because I don't have the skill set to convert a MySQL database to a Microsoft SQL database - hence get the data out. So basically not a migration - brand new install instead. An opportune time to get rid of the clutter! I have seen the idea - new year new Moodle, which if we stay on windows would be doable, but really how much data can we support? At the minute we tend to keep live and the last academic year and that's it, but should we have more? Now looking to the future what I would dearly like to know is what is everybody else doing to meet the needs of keeping assessment data that went into Moodle for the unspecified length of time that an awarding body might want it for and just to top it off - yes currently we are in the EU and have signed up to GDPR . This however is a question for a whole new post and a different forum I suspect! I think it will have to be visit each and every assignment for this year and have a better plan for next.

I assume one could make their own assignment plug-in to achieve this, so I might do that as a last resort, but would prefer to reuse existing functionality first.\n\nThanks for any help,\nMichael\n\nPS.

This is one of the best ways to use the Rubric and complete the task. The problem arises when there are more than 50 students, it's hard for the teacher to upload a file for every Students.

I'll post it here and if necessary it can be moved to the more suitable forum. When using the grading page for an assignment, there are several filters that can be used, e.g. filtering for a specific letter of the alphabet or for no submissions. However these filters do not reset, even not after a fresh login and are also active if I go to another assignment activity. This behavior led to misunderstandings where submissions have been gone because the filter for no submissions was still active but the teacher had this not in mind anymore and these filters are not quite eye-catching that they are enabled. So I think that they should at least be reset with the logout of a user or be related to each activity by their own. What do you think about this issue? Cheers, Kathrin",

For example you occasionally see posts like \"I had a quiz with 300 students, and a half-hour time-limit, and when time expired, and all the student's quiz attempts got submitted, my server crashed.\" Does stuff like that happen with the assignment tool? I don't recall seeing a post like that, but a Google search does not find much. I also searched in the tracker ( https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=component%20%3D%20Assignment%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Performance ) finds a few issues, most of which have been fixed. I guess I am hoping someone can say something like \"we had an assignment where 1000 students all had to submit a 10MB file by 18:00pm one Friday afternoon. Most of them left it to the last minute, and still we did not experience any problems\". Also, has anyone got a script (e.g. JMeter) for load-testing mod-assign? Thanks in advance.",

We did a test with about 40 people each submitting 10 assignments within a half-hour period on our test server which does not have very much hardware (two web servers each with 2 CPUs). Each assignment file was about 10MB. Moodle coped very well apart from one thing. Uploading files was slow, because after each file had been sent to the server, there was a long wait while ClamAV ran. You could see this in the file-picker. If you dragged in a file, the green progress bar would get to 100% quite quickly, but there would then be a ~1minute delay before the upload completed and the file was shown if the file manager. Obviously, MDL-50886 is going to help with this. (Thanks Ruslan and Lancaster University.) Also, it would be nice to have some sort of 'Virus checking' progress message after the progress bar has got to 100% so people know what is going on. If anyone else has any thoughts about this, please let me know. Thanks.",

          "Text": "Hi Mart, I have done this now for 2 semesters, and next semester I will drop the PDF form approach. I need students to submit a bunch of information that I use to review a number of assignment parts that I score, and the PDF form seemed to be a great answer. I designed a well laid out form, that makes it easy for students to collect the information, and that had some visual appeal as well. After 2 semesters of improvements and thinking this through, as I mention, I will now drop the idea and use a web form approach. The reason behind the decision comes from multiple problems: first and foremost, PDF forms are really problematic for Apple OS users. The forms I created are built with Adobe Acrobat Pro 9.5.4, but some Apple OS users do not seem to be able to save the data or the radio buttons I include do not function properly. Then, many students do a bunch of different things, such as saving the file as a print-out, which locks all the information so I cannot access it without transcribing what they entered (which defeats the idea behind the form), or because of their monitor resolution settings, they can't see what they enter into the form, so without clicking on each field, they cannot tell if they entered something (or if it's still empty) or if they have made an entry mistake. This last problem I tried addressing by fixing the font size in the fields, but still they seem to miss entering the information correctly. All in all, because of the mixed OS platforms, versions, and resolution settings, I end up with many problems. Therefore, I started to introduce to Apple users (and any PC user who also wanted to do this) a web form that I created using LimeSurvey, an open source survey environment that I also host in my domain . While the surveys you produce with LimeSurvey were not originally meant to be used as assignment forms, it works just fine. Students go to the website, enter the details, and I can either access and work with the data directly within LimeSurvey, or I can download to Excel and work from there. This solution works best for me and has no negative impact due to OS type. Hope this is helpful to you. -George",

The beauty of PDF is that the look doesn't change across platforms. It is especially important if a teacher wants a piece of paper printed for a classroom that is an artifact of learning. For example, a lab contract, or a signed syllabus, or maybe some physicla proof that the person who signed on actually saw a screen (prints it out and hands it in themselves) I am a huge proponent of paperless classrooms, but there are times when paper must be turned in. That is the attractiveness of PDF, versus HTML, because HTML cannot create a print format consistently.",

I am a math teacher and many of my assignments are ones that are done offline. I have a due date for the assignment (so the calendar works). Here is the problem. I make an assignment on Monday. It is due Tuesday at the start of class. The cron job runs and sends 0's out on all those assignments before I get them graded and entered in the gradebook. The students all politely ask why they got a 0... Can I turn off the \"email out 0's\" feature without having them turn off all email? Thanks...   Tom",

This allows a user group to submit work and allow other groups to easily comment/view each other's work. Ideally, I would like user groups to easily see if this activity has been completed by someone on their team. Forums allow completion to be based on an individual student view/posting, but do not allow completion based on someone in their group creating a post. Are there any methods to base forum activity on groups and not just individuals? Can anyone recommend an alternative approach to this challenge? Much appreciated, Jon",

I also created two seperate groupings Section I (having group A) and section II (having group B) My intention when F1 creates an assignement and grades a student he should see only set of students beloging to his groupings. Vice-versa, the students can only view and submit the assignments that have been created for their groupings. I have already created assignments having \"Group Mode\" as \"Seperate Groups\" and Grouping as Section I. But still, the student belonging to Section II can view the assignment which has been created for Section I grouping. Can you suggest anything on this??",

However you can use Activity completion and Restrict access to make it so that they at least have to click on the lecture before they are given access to the quiz. Also - you could embed your lecture into a Moodle Lesson activity because one advantage of this is that there is a completion condition by time spent - ie - student have to spend a certain amount of time in the Lesson before it will be marked complete. So if you make your Lesson required time the required time of the lecture then they might think to watch the lecture while they are waiting for time to pass and the quiz is released to them.",

OR The teacher needs to enable \"Due date\" and \"Prevent late submissions\" Without these options enabled, the submissions sit forever in a draft state and cannot be downloaded in bulk. The cause of this is: \"If assignment is open and submission is not finalized then don't add it to zip.\", from MDL-30121 This is not made clear in the interface, and may count as a bug in the assignment module.",

          "Text": "Version: Moodle 3.3 (latest as of 28 July 2018) I frequently ask students to read particular pages or other resources and set activity completion for the task. The tasks, however, are not otherwise graded and do not necessitate students'/participants' submitting anything. They are mostly preparatory materials. I wish to count completion of the tasks on time as part of overall course grades. Currently, converting activity completions to grades involves either entering items one by one directly into the gradebook or downloading activity completion spreadsheets, modifying some information in a spreadsheet and uploading grades. However, with nearly 800 students and as many as 800 different activities per semester, the task consumes a lot of time. I would like to be able to convert activity completion states to pass/fail (or, better, pass/late pass/fail) grades automatically but have not been able to figure out how this can be done. Any help would be greatly appreciated. N.B.: Though I am the sole administrator of the Moodle site, I am not even close to expert in administration. Also, I have posted this message elsewhere and apologize for having done so.",

We're wanting to use mod_assign_get_assignments() to to provide information (primarily the moodle IDs of the activities ) to an external system so that system can then extract the grades (using mod_assign_get_grades()). It would appear that the web service is using the enrol_* functions to determine if the calling user can access the course, which means that the web service user has to be enrolled in the class , rather than simply having a non-enrolled role assigned. The reason that I don't want to enrol the web service user that we have is so that it doesn't appear in the participant list. Ideas? Also since I just need a list of ids to pass to assign_get_grades(), this seems to require that the calling user hold the mod/assign:grade grade capability, which kinda opens it up to doing things I'd *rather* it didn't. I think this goes back to the fact that too many capabilities are being used to pull double purposes. Ability to Grade should *not* have anything to do with being able to \"view\" grades.",

          "Text": "Hi All, hopefully someone can help me here - I'm not sure if I'm just not understanding something right, or whether there is an error in the documentation. I'm referring to Grade category settings>Aggregate only non-empty grades . It says: With \"Exclude Empty Grades\" enabled Any ungraded work is assumed to be a zero, which might be used to show students the impact of missing work on their overall grade. This can be a motivator for students to submit all assignments. With \"Exclude Empty Grades\" disabled Students’ averages are based only on the work they’ve completed and been graded for. This is often used to give students the benefit of the doubt until all grades are in, encouraging continuous participation without penalising them for grades that haven't been entered yet. However, my understanding is that when it is enabled, i.e. set to ignore ('exclude') empty grades, it will ignore ungraded work, and therefore only calculate an overall total based on what has already been graded - i.e. the second explanation above. It's puzzling me... I have been doing tests with a 'Drop the lowest' scenario (drop the two lowest grades out of five), and the behaviour when I enable 'Exclude empty grades' does not seem to be consistent with the above explanation in the documentation. Or maybe I'm just not seeing something obvious... And I've just noticed that above that, on the same page, it says this: If this option is enabled, Moodle will ignore any grade item that has no grade when calculating the category or course total. If it is disabled, Moodle will treat empty grades as zero when calculating averages or totals",

          "Text": "Hello, Julian! 😊 First, it's important to understand how the \"Exclude empty grades\" setting really works. When this option is enabled , Moodle ignores the assignments that have not yet been graded. This means that when calculating the average, only the grades that have already been assigned are considered. In other words, if you have a student who hasn't submitted some assignments, those assignments will not affect their average since Moodle does not consider them as zeros. On the other hand, when the option is disabled , Moodle assumes that the unsubmitted assignments are zeros, which can cause the student's average to drop. This approach is designed to encourage students to submit their work by showing the impact that missing submissions can have on their final grade. Regarding your question about the behavior during tests with \"Drop the lowest grades,\" if the \"Exclude empty grades\" option is enabled, Moodle should indeed ignore the unassigned grades when calculating the total, maintaining the evaluations that have already been completed. If you notice that the logic is not applying correctly, it might be worthwhile to check if there are any additional settings influencing the expected behavior.

          "Text": "Hi, I want to present an early version of the assignment module we will use at ULPGC virtual campus the next academic year starting in October. The module is fully functional, but it is not tested extensively (we are in that process now). I have included language files for english and spanish. The module is a gathering of functions published previously here, but rewritten to work together. And adds a new type of assignment: a Group Assignment. This GroupAssignment allows a small team of students (gathered in a moodle group) to make a single collective submission, and the teacher to grade that single submission with grades (and feedback coments files etc.) replicated for all members of the team. Let me show the functions of each assignment type within ULPGCassignment, I hope I am not missing any feature: Students can review sumissions by peers (after they have submitted and the assignment is closed: no new submissions are accepted). all but offline (nothing to show) selectable on/off by teacher Two separate steps: uploading files and commiting a submission for marking upload , uploadfull, groupupload Students can submit several files upload, uploadfull, groupupload selectable on/off by teacher Students can delete their own files (while on 'draft' mode, not after submission) If a student delete all files uploaded, the 'draft' submission is deleted at all. upload, uploadfull, groupupload Teachers can upload one or multiple files as corrections/response files upload, uploadfull, groupupload Both student and teacher files are shown as links in the main submission list upload, uploadfull, groupupload Several teachers can upload corrections files separately. The student see what teacher made each correction file. (However only one grade is admitted) upload, uploadfull, groupupload Teachers can delete all their  uploaded files at once uploadfull, groupupload teachers can batch-upload grades and comments from a CSV text file. offline, uploadfull, groupupload In addition teachers can save a CSV file with grades and comments uploadfull, groupupload Teachers can make a ZIP archive with all files submitted by students uploadfull, groupupload A student can submit a file acting as a group-member groupupload The teacher can set GroupAssesment mode  to see submissions list ordered by groups, not individual students groupupload GroupAssessment mode on/off by the teacher The teacher can assess the group and grade and feedback are automatically assigned to all students members of the group groupupload The teacher can revert to individual assessment mode to assign individual grades to each member of a team/group groupupload The code to perform all these functions comes from multiple sources. Original ideas and some code comes from Echo-assignment and Upload&Review assignment types. Other from the upload  multiple from Gustav Delius and Drop box from AUassignment. However, we have rewritten very diferently the AUassignment to take advantage of OO  nature of the assignment class. The GroupAssignment type is designed to be used in visible/sepasate groups mode. It will not allow to submit to users that are not members of any group. When the students enter the Assignment view they will see a menu to select the group to wich the submission will be atributted. An error should occur if he is not a member of that group. A checking is performed to ensure that any member of that group has not submitted before as member of other group (in a multiple group membership scenario). The  group assigment is designed to be used with groups in where each student is member of a single group. In other words, checkings are performed to ensure that there is a single submission for each student (versus A submission as member of group X and B submission as member of Group Y, that would mess grading). If a student  that is member of several groups gets confused and make a submission as member of the wrong group, he can delete his own submission. I would appreciate any comments on the features and orgatization of this module. We are polishing it yet, but works well enough to test and playing around. I will update when we have a better version. Enrique",

          "Text": "We are deploying Moodle 1.6.1+ next october and this module works for that. Downgrading to 1.5 may function, I haven't tested. For 1.7 we only need to change a few lines to add the 'has_capability' checkings. For installing simply drop the ULPGCassigment folder into your\nmoodle/mod/ folder. Move lang files to wwwroot /lang or dataroot /lang as\nnecessary. Then visit you admin page and the tables will get installed. The module is named ULPGCassignment just to make possible to install it cleanly without touching an exisnting regular Assignment module. However, the aim is to replace the regular Assignment if Martin D sees that as a good thing. We have changed the internals of the  assignment base class  to make it more flexible  and  easier to  introduce little customizations into assignment plugin types without actually having to deal with big chunks of code. If Martin and other moodle core developers review the proposed changes and consider that they are valuable those changes may end in standard release. Regarding the due date extension. I suppose you refer to extending the date for a particular student or group of students. You can always re-set the due date for a running assignment, affecting all students. Is that right? We have not addressed that question, all dates or other settings of the assignment are the same for all students or groups. There are other mods of moodle that may allow what you need, search for conditional activities , or activity locking. I think there was a group hack that allowed to set different dates for different groups. Enrique",

I found one weired thing you might want to pass onto your testers/developers. . .I submitted an assignment as a student, then I logged in as a tutor, viewed the submitted assignment, clicked Grade, uploaded a response file, then deleted the file and instead of being returned to the grading form I was returned to the Assignment Submission Page, but still in the popup window. Do you know if there is a way to limit the types of files being uploaded for an assignment? e.g. for Assignment 1 I only want .pdf, for Assignment 2 only .doc, etc. As for extensions, thanks for the tip, I will have a look around.

In doing this we've realised that we appear to be doing double-handling of this, especially where we as using the assignment activity. The assignment module already asks for configuration information about submissions via it's submission plugins, so for the file plugin it asks: Maximum number of files to upload Acceptable file types This is the same information (at least part of it) that we are asking the staff to ensure students know. This information is also *only* displayed on the edit submission page, not on the initial page where students are given the instructions about the assignment. It would be helpful for this information to be made available prominently to the student earlier. I've put together a patch for the assignsubmission_file plugin that does this. It doesn't require any changes to Moodle API definitions, just for assignment submission plugin creators to follow a conventions of outputting a human-readable configuration statement. Just wondering if anyone else has had thoughts /issues about reducing the amount of work to communicate assignment requirements.",

It seems that once a student enters anything into an assignment, the RequiresGrading flag is set.  In my case, I tell students to write their exempt-explanation in the text-submission box, so moodle cannot tell the difference between \"real\" text and exempted text.  How might I turn off the requiresgrading flag once it is set? 2- is there any other way that I can mark a student's assignment record as Completed or Graded without actually entering a numeric value into the Grade field?  Even a workaround, using another datafield, would be useful for me.    Using the LockSubmissions function might be acceptable, though it triggers an irritating text display.

The final solution will be adding code to the backup/restore of the new module so it can natively restore a backup from either module (and then removing assignment 2.2 from core completely).

          "Text": "See the Frequently-Asked Questions \"glossary\" under \" How do the limits on uploaded files work? \" Martin explains where/how to change the settings. Your upload limit might be constrained by your own server settings, admin settings in Moodle or Module-level limits Here's a copy of Martin's answer: File upload size s are restricted in a number of ways - each one in the list restricts the following ones. 1.\nFirstly, there is a setting in Apache 2 which you may need to change.\nOn Redhat this setting is very low by default, you can change the\nlimit by adding or editing a line in Apache's /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and/or /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf with the upload size in bytes (different operating systems may have these files in different locations): LimitRequestBody 10485760 2. PHP also has two more byte limits, which you can set in php.ini and sometimes in a .htaccess file: php_value upload_max_filesize 50000000 php_value post_max_size 50000000 3. Moodle 1.2 has a site-wide limit called maxbytes that you can set in the Admin -> Configuration -> Variables page. 4. Each course can also set a limit - teachers can do this on the Course Settings page. 5. Activity modules like forums and assignments have their own limits which you set when adding or editing the activity.",
