          "Text": "I am on Moodle 2.0. I have setup a course repository in the file system. I put the folder in the /var/moodledata/repository/ directory, per instructions.  I put a few files in it from the server end.  I can get to those in the course repository.  So, the next question I have is: Can a teacher edit this from the web browser? I think they can add files to it? How can they delete files? If they have a resource file in the repository, such as a word document for an assignment template, can they change that?  It appears that they have to re- upload another copy with a new name.  This is problematic, as it messes up the link in the course itself. Finally, if the files in the repository are pictures, is there a way for students to browse and see previews/thumbnails?  I have made a symlink in the repositories to the openclipart folder on my ubuntu server.  Very cool idea. I'm sure there is a better way that I am missing.",

But I can't find a simple 'disable', only a setting that seems to be warning me that I'm about to 'remove' the plugin. So I'd appreciate any advice on whether I'm lookin in the right place, or not. So after reading MoodleDocs , I'm thinking that I need to be changing the setting in: Site administration -> Plugins -> Repositories - >Manage repositories. But then I get the message shown here: http://www.queenelizabeth.cumbria.sch.uk/temp/DisablePrivateFiles.pdf The thread below seems to suggests that Disable will do the trick - but I just wanted to double-check before I do any damage! https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=177871 Thanks for any advice, Mark McNulty",

We use a URL resource to link the student to the root of the sections within the HTML which is working great. The problem is when I backup the course from my dev server and restore it to my production server. The URL on my dev server looks something like this, /file.php/15/index.html When I restore a package it keeps that URL the same even though the repository number it's restoring into is different. Therefore all of the URLs break and I have to go in and fix them all by hand. So the question is this, is there a way I can use a dynamic variable in the URL that will always render to the current repository's number? I'd love to set my URLs to something like this: /file.php/@@REPO@@/index.html Does such a feature exist? If not, does anyone have a suggestion as to how I can preserve links to legacy content in the backup?",

I am considering disabling (not uninstalling) the Repo so that students can't keep uploading GDocs etc (and thus avoid the issues). If I do this, what happens to the files that have already been uploaded? Are they still accessible by the teacher? Will they still show in Assignments. Obviously, this is a concern. Thanks!

Its horrible to search for CMS these days, if Moodle can do what we want then it will be great. What we concern is Reuse Learning Object, the work flow like this: Our Editors put large amount of different learning objects on the CMS, by category, level, etc; then our teachers when putting their course content they can choose any objects in the pool....... It is good to reuse of objects not only bounded to a cource itself only.. If I can have tags in each learning object in the CMS, it should be powerful, you know, with the tag the teacher can search and assign learning objects to individual student manually (or by intelligent agent).... it would be a powerful function for moodle...what do you think? thanks",

The architecture is to have 5 x separate but linked moodle sites. Underpinning this I have the IMS repository for storing SCORM objects. As you know this is limiting I am now looking at phase 2 of my project and looking to expand the functionality of the repository and implement a Digital Repository for learning objects allowing administrators now matter where they are to create learning objects, store the learning object and make it reusable. The aim of the repository would be: · Store 'learning objects’ making them reusable – a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes no matter where you are in the moodle system · Give us the ability to aggregate learning objects – learning objects to be grouped into larger collections of content, including traditional course structures · Allow tagging with metadata – every learning object to have descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search · Allow configuration and control of learning objects from a central point I have searched and cannot find a Moodle ‘Plug In’. The advice I need is “is there a Moodle Plug In” I have ‘flirted’ with Mr Cute2 and found that it does not work. Are there other digital repositories out there and can you advise",

If that function is throwing an error, then either the uploaded file could not be opened at all, or it could be opened and file was empty or the entire contents of the file was 'null' characters. This means that the problem lies somewhere before this function checks the file. Off the top of my head, I'm afraid I don't know a solution to your problem, but my guess would be something about the server configuration is blocking the file upload, before Moodle can process it (given that this file upload seems to be working fine for millions of other Moodle users and that code has been there for a couple of years now). If you are/have access to a developer, you may need to add some logging code to the process_upload function to see if you can identify where the problem is occurring.",

          "Title": "Enabling embedded links when rolling a course forward",
          "Text": "I wonder if my question fits here. Some of our tutors have been using a moodle 1.9.something or other to teach by generating a lot of web pages and embedding lots of links in them. Instead of putting links to resources at the end of each lesson , they put their resoures for a ten session course into box 11 and then wrote Wikipedia like text with links down to each of the individual resources.  I lobbied for them to teach students to learn to click on the resources link on top left hand side and lost. Now that I have rolled courses forward to 2011-12 wherethe text of the lessons had links embedded in narrative they all point back to the resources in 2010-11 courses. I think that this is something that might not happen if we move to moodle 2 which has a repository for much used resources. We want to keep previous years versions of courses in tact so that it can store submitted work both as a quality record and for the students (who can be on four year courses).  I roll forward by creating a new course space and then importing material (uploaded files, questonnaires etc) from the previous course. Help would be really appreciated.",

If I logged into my site (admin) and I just wanted to browse my Repositories, upload files, make folders, etc., where do I go? Somewhere I saw that there was supposed to be a link under \" Front Page \" called \"Site Files\" but this is not present in my Moodle 2.2 install. Furthermore, anytime I actually upload a file, no matter what Repository I have selected, it goes into my \"Private Files\" and is inaccessible anywere else. I can enable (and I am tempted to, despite warnings that it's a bad idea) the old Moodle course files repository, because at least that one made sense, but then I am faced with the same issue of managing my files through the web interface anyway. I don't mean to complain, but I find it extremely unobvious as to where this file management can happen. Thank you for your time! - george",

I am not sure why you would want to access the file picker outside of a resource or an activity anyway, but you have something in mind. I do agree there is a number of issues around the new file picker, but in some ways it is actually more comprehensive than the old, more flexible that is for sure, but in others it is still too unfriendly. The Moodle file system is more of a mystery than it used to be, which is a response to criticisms of the old.

When I try by selecting \"making a copy\" of the unzipped file instead of alias and follow through to double-click it to unzip and select the multiscreen file I can get it to play. Well, I had hoped that I could actually run these from the File Repository via alias since we will have multiple copies of the same course running on the server at a given time.

After upgrading from 1.9 to 2, Course file areas remain and can continue to be used, but are renamed to Legacy course files . In courses created after the upgrade there are no Course files areas. However, this 'old' feature can be reactivated or enabled: click here to learn how . However, this is not recommended. So, if your colleagues reuse an old and upgraded course, they don't need to upload files again, they'll still be there in the Legacy course files area. However, once they start using a brand new course, they'll have to re-upload files. > Is there a best practice I should provide them over the summer ... I imagine that for large institutions, an external repository is probably 'best practice'. Click here for a recent discussion about this . However, in my case, there are only 10 or so teachers using our Moodle system, so I am trying to encourage them to use the ' Private Files area '. The advantage of this 'repository' is that teachers can manage all their files within Moodle (which is what they are used to), and all files in the private files area can be accessed from any course by the teachers, something that could not be done with the 1.9 course files directory. I was hoping to use external repositories like Google Docs or DropBox. However, as far as I know, at the moment it is not possible to configure the Dropbox repository for multiple users: see moodle docs about this .  I have linked our Moodle to DropBox and was able to access my DropBox directory without any problems. Very neat I thought, but then discovered colleagues could not access their own DropBox directories. The only way to make this work at the moment is to create a new DropBox account and give all my Moodle colleague access to it. We also experimented with the File System repository. However, this quickly went by the wayside when teachers discovered that they'd have to use a different system to upload files to that repository: i.e. ftp or file-sharing on our Mac network. So I think the simple answer to your question re File Management Best Practice is that it depends on the number of teachers accessing the Moodle system, their technical expertise, and above all their willingness to try something different when they feel that the old system (Course files) worked just fine. Hope this helps. It'll be interesting to hear what you end up doing.",

All remained silent. I liked the ability to configure the audio player and added the flv-file to \"path.\" {POODLL:type=audiolist,filearea=submission,path=108850777614861.flv,protocol=rtmp,sequentialplay=true,width=400,height=80} This is not urgent at all. With kind regards, Hartmut",

There is a also a way to display Webtop tree in a frame in Moodle using iFrames. There are many different integration scenarios, it really depends on what you want . But it can be done!!

Can teachers add files to the student's folder and is the files viewable by only the student who own the file? is the stuff stored in the folder remain with the student, should the student changed the course or the stuff would be gone when the student leave the course? any screenshots of how the File Cabinet look like or works? thanks.",

Basically, as a starting point, in the file picker I only want my students to see the \" upload a file\" option. I don't want them to see the server files. When I go to repository settings and change the server files to enable but hidden, the students can't see it but neither can admin??? What I want is for Admin staff to have access to server files in the file picker but not for students. What am I missing???? Is this even possible??? I am assuming that if students can access server files that means they can access any document from any course right??? Really not liking this new system at the moment... I haven't gotten my head around it. Please help!!! Thanks Kat",

These still do not really address what you are looking for as I have found that most users don't even know what to do with the concept of portfolios. The other option is to use the My Moodle page more extensively with the FIle Manager block (if you can get it to work) and the Role Specific html block. I am sorry that I have not offered any real solutions but I am curious if anyone out there has come up with anything better or workable. Can the My Moodle page be more dynamic and include file sharing at the very least? Anyone out there have any solutions or hacks in the works?

If you are running Alfresco as a test locally on your PC alongside Moodle you do need to make sure that they are not conflicting with ports etc (80/8000), and if you are installing on a server then although you can install Alfresco still on 127.0.0.1 you will need to use a hostname via DNS and etc/hosts or equivalent to be able to make a connection. In either case however, you will still always get a username and password prompt from Moodle with the default Alfresco repository plug-in since it doesn't have any code to do a single sign on with Alfresco. If you want to do that you could try the Andresco repository plug-in which allows Moodle users to authenticate straight through to an Alfresco server, and also to do some other neat stuff like upload files from the Moodle interface through to Alfresco, and pull back title and description metadata . You can find it at: code.google.com/p/andresco. Cheers, Michael.",

          "Text": "Hi, I have a question regarding the new file system in Moodle 2.0 Previously in Moodle 1.9, it was possible to upload a SCORM package that would then get extracted and run as normal. An often requirement of ours was to then go into this package and modify individual files (to fix spelling mistakes, update figures, etc.) by uploading a new file to the server or by just editing it within Moodle (as was possible for text/html files). In Moodle 2.0 has this functionality disappeared? It's still possible to see individual files from within the package by going through the 'Server Files' repository in the File Picker but is it not actually possible to re-upload a single file or modify an existing one? Is the only way to do this to re-upload the entire package? This would be very inconvenient as our packages are generally very large and making small edits is quite a frequent task for us. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",

If so, one solution that occurs to me is to use the Groupings and Groups feature and the Folder resource. However, it's not a very elegant solution, and will take time to set up. But perhaps this possible plan will give you a better idea: create a grouping named after each student in each grouping add a group called \"P ersonal Files\" add each student to their respective \"P ersonal Files\" group Then create a 'Folder' resources for each student Each Folder resource should be set as follows: Grouping: choose the grouping named after the relevant student Available for group members only: check upload the personalized files to each Folder resource: only students belonging to the Grouping assigned to the Folder will be able to see the content - in fact, I think the entire Folder will be invisible to other students. The advantage of this is that each Folder resource will be a 'permanent' private directory for each student to which the teacher can upload files and from which students can download . Of course, the big problem with this solution is that it's not very practical for courses with 'lots' of students.",

A quick work around is necessary since I don't have time to develop a peronalized student module as yet.

You can delete the file there, then delete any records in the database that have that same contenthash and it will definitely be gone (but there may still be some broken links to it, if you can live with that). Obviously, be very careful and double-check everything before you do any of the above!",

Maybe installing a reports plugin like one of these https://moodle.org/plugins/view/report_customsql https://moodle.org/plugins/view/block_configurable_reports and then create custom SQL queries would help to find the course links / activity links / ressources links.

Try as I might, I can not get this feature to work. I have a suspicion that what has happened is: 1) The feature Munster university built into OwnCloud which linked files \"dynamically\" to Moodle has not been included in this package. 2) The access controlled link feature is actually a feature that is more intended for when students submit work work rather than for developers to link file to Moodle for students to access. Once I get an answer back from the developers, I can let you know where we stand. In the meantime, try to ensure you have the latest version fo NextCloud installed.",

Providing an iframe to a specific piece of content might be a possible solution so that there is a single source of truth will multiple windows onto this content, then when the source is updated, so all views are updated. I have tried a couple of things in Moodle, like creating a hidden course with activities such as a Page or a Book to act as this \"source\", but really for this to work we need a link to the specific HTML content (the actual page or chapter in a book), NOT to the Moodle URL as this then embeds the entire Moodle site. Is it possible to get a URL to a specific piece of content in Moodle?",

If the file is no longer in the repo, Moodle would just keep the last copy of the file in Moodledata until it sees that it is back in the repo.

          "Text": "I had no problem linking Dropbox & Moodle.  Now, as an admin, I find it very easy to include various files from my Dropbox into courses I am creating in Moodle. However, I've run into one drawback that I believe is not a bug, but rather a limitation for how this plugin is used.  My hope from this post is to receive a clarification that the plugin is in fact performing as expected. The situation:  I'd like to use Dropbox to include files in a course, because in the future I may update these files on my local machine, and, once synced, the course would therefore always show the current version of the file. However, this doesn't seem to be how it works.  Each time a file is accessed from within a Moodle course, it appears that Moodle does not fetch the current version from dropbox.  Instead, when the dropbox is initially used to add this file, it imports the THEN CURRENT version of the file, and stores it statically.  In other words, it behaves the exact same as if I had uploaded the file directly from my hard drive. I would think that a key benefit to using Dropbox via a plugin would be for an implementation exactly as I describe above - so that the files used in the course are always freshly updated each time they are accessed. (By the way, yes, I do know there is an easy workaround for this:  getting a shareable link for a file in my dropbox, and then adding this URL as a resource; by using a dropbox shareable link, the file will always be fresh.) But it would be great if the plugin allowed me to \"mimic\" this posting of a shareable link. If anyone very familiar with this repository plugin could shed some light on its intended behavior, I would be grateful.",

Some scenarios to demonstrate the advantage of your approach: Since Moodle has taken a copy of the file, your course will continue to work even if Dropbox has problems and goes offline temporarily. To update the file every time it is requested, Moodle would need to know your dropbox username and password. That is a big security desaster waiting to happen. Suppose you add an image to your course from Flickr public, and later the owner of that image changes it to be inappropriate or spammy. You want to go on using the image you originally chose. Of course, ease of update problem you identify is a big disadvantage of the current approach, and it is something that Moodle does not currently handle well, but I hope you can see that the big picture is more complicated than you might at first think.",

Can I make a point here though, taking into account the clear dangers you've listed to the unwary user, namely that if I add a URL to my course then I can launch the File Picker, browse my Flickr or YouTube repository, find a target file, and get a link to the file through the API. I am well aware that if I do this then I am making an assumption that the viewer of this file also needs permission to view the file, completely separate to Moodle's permissions. If I (for example) share a hidden Flickr image, then anyone who attempts to view it in Moodle won't be able to (or at least they shouldn't be able to) see it as they don't have the correct permissions, so I really am making the assumption that any file I link to through the File Picker has no security on it - they are freely available to anyone. Question is this though - I know that I can share public links to files I store in Google Docs and Dropbox - and yet these repositories are not listed in the File Picker when I am adding a URL resource! To me this is inconsistent. To be true to your thoughts above then there should be no capacity to view the File Picker when adding a URL at all, since the risks you list above are too great and so I should be stopped from doing it completely. By my thinking we should have access to any repository when adding a URL which supports the sharing of content without any security - including Flickr and YouTube, but also Dropbox and Google Docs. Thoughts? Mark. PS I see there is already a ticket in the Tracker for this.",

I agree with your statement about needing to both allow and improve this functionality, but wouldn't this be achievable by simply allowing repositories which allow direct linking (like DropBox) to be accessible via the \"Add URL\" resource within the File Picker? To me this would be a suitable solution without (I suspect) a huge amount of effort. Thoughts welcome, Mark. PS I would also like to change the term \"URL\" to read \"Link\" in the Resources drop-down - I think it would make far more sense to most humans.",

I thought this would be the solution to server storage problems. I have students submit videos and thought that if they all had their own Dropbox accounts, it wouldn't slam my server bandwidth. So really the repo system is more just makes it slightly easier to upload files from various sources like Skydrive, Dropbox, iCloud etc.  So in Moodle 1.9, you could do the same thing but you'd have to download the file to your desktop first.",

The link is created via the database that the course uses. If someone else uses the same image, or is importing elements of a course to another, what is essentially happening is that there is no assett transfer, only the notional transfer of the link kept in the database. e.g. Instead of a 500kb image a 50byte link is transferred. This system works fine, as long as the original image is available.  If someone deletes the original course, then there may be a problem. I may be wrong on this, but it is very much a swings and roundabouts thing, there are some advantages, eg picking up disk space, but some thoughtlessness, or lack of understanding to be more precise, can cause dramas for other courses. I can see a whole new set of rules about using repositories developing in the future.",

Though I encountered some plugins not able to upgrade and I remove it from the system then pressing couple of refresh and it went fine. BTW , my moodle site are running from IIS7 + PHP under in Windows 2008 server . Now the problem in the upgraded moodle site is that when I try to download any PDF files in the courses, the error message pop up of \" File does not begin with '%PDF-' \". I checked the pdf file in the webroot moodle data (datadir) location and found its working or not corrupted. I can able to open the pdf files. I have no idea why all pdf files are corrupted. I've been focusing this issue since last week and still no luck to fix it. Any help from you guys would be much appreciated. Thanks, James.",

          "Text": "We wil be moving to 2.2(plus) this summer from 1.9.12. I am planning out our internal Moodle repository folder structure so that it is as well designed from the begining as possible. I think I understand it well enough to set that up in our test Moodle, but I am wondering how using internal Moodle repositories impacts a course that is shared later with other Moodle organizations. Will a course package up all the varied files needed from the repository folders and carry them internally to the new Moodle or would the organization need access to our internal repository to use the course in their institution? Information about this may impact whether we use an internal repository or set up an external one. We definitley want to be able to share what we build as well as have the courses stand on their own in case our project fades away in some future year. We would hate for another institution to have to rely on our survival to use a course we pass on to them. I appreciate all of you who are several steps along the path further than I illuminating the path for those who follow behind. :0)",

          "Text": "Hi Tammy, You may want to have a read of this white paper that I wrote about repositories in Moodle2 - http://www.somerandomthoughts.com/blog/whitepaper-moodle-2-repositories/ The core of your question is one of the core issue with repositories. When you do a backup-restore to share with other institutions or even the public you need the resources which are in the course to be shipped with the course (in the zip) or at least there should exist public access to them. When you embed a Youtube video for example it is just the embed code you ship, as the youtube video is public. As it stands (you will see in the whitepaper feature breakdown) when using the repositories that come with Moodle 2, Moodle will copy the file into the Moodledata space and Moodle only offers the option to link to the file in the repository where the API allows it (which assumes direct public access to the file). So if you hook up any repository out of the box with Moodle, when you add it to a Moodle course it will copy the file into Moodle to ensure integrity of the course. There are some non-core repository options which store the files in the repository and not in the moodledata - Equella or ELIS for example which are premium offerings. These are good tools that provide great workflow and tight content controls for where you dont want to have a backup being the full snapshot of everything in the course.",

          "Text": "Hi Matt, There are probably a few ways to accomplish what you require. to be able to bulk upload multimedia files to a central library Use a File System Repository and anything you upload to this file system will be available in the Moodle File Picker in any course which has access to that repository. not to have to adjust php.ini files If php.ini has a high enough limit to start with, you can throttle the upload limits by course.  See \"course settings\" for that. to have consistent file paths, i.e. the file path is always the same throughout all courses and activities Moodle 2.x uses files differently than 1.x did.  A file is considered \"included\" with a specific activity or assignment.  In this case a \"copy\" of the file is made when you add it to an activity so the concept of \"consistent file paths\" is no longer possible.  I saw some posts discussing changes to this to allow for updating of changed files, but I'm not positive if/when those changes will be available. roles based permissions for individual uploads, edits and deletions Ok, when I read this I started thinking about your request in a different way.  What you might consider is having the multimedia files hosted outside of Moodle...  for example in a YouTube account.  The current YouTube repository doesn't have fine control over this but I suspect an enhanced YouTube repository where each YT repository instance connects to an individual user's YouTube account would give you the permissions control you want.  Users control their videos through the YouTube interface and then publish them in various Moodle activities through the enhanced YouTube repository. Another thing to consider is using the Dropbox repository.  This already has user-based access and can support any kind of multimedia file. Not sure if this helps or not, but I saw your post and wanted to give some ideas.",

Does Moodle allow for students to upload / download their own files (not those submitted for grading)? I'm Director of Technology at a secondary school.  For several years we were using an LMS that allowed both upload and download.  This was helpful because students often start papers on the school network, don't finish them, and don't always have a floppy or other media with them to transport them home.  Being able to upload to a common site and then retrieve them from home saved a lot of headaches. If this feature exists, please inform me.  If not, is there any way of suggesting this to Moodle developers?",

This is related to my thread where IMAGES DO NOT APPEAR in the quizzes after we upgraded from 1.9.14+ to 2.2.4 (build 20120717) a month ago http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=210644 Even turning on the legacy file did not work on 2.2.4+ and I found out why. We're missing the images on 2.2.4+ but they are there on 2.2.3+ (legacy file turned on) In our 2.2.3+ courses (and most likey other courses), there is a lot of legacy folders and files that are missing in the same files for the 2.24+ course. Question: How can I bulk add the folders, subfolders and files when I download them as a zip in our 2.2.3+ into 2.2.4+ safely? Assumming I can bulk import the folders and subfolders into our 2.2.4+, how can I make sure that the image url in the 2.2.4+ is referencing the image, when originally it was missing? Or can we download our 1.9.14+ images and just bulk upload it to our course's legacy files? If so, how? Or do we just have to recreate it everything from scratch and relink them? Thanks",

          "Text": "Hi Rob, Thank you for your detailed answer. The \"access-controlled links\" function sounds interesting, but we don't use this scenario at the moment. We have briefly tested both products, but have also encountered some major problems: Moodle Core's OneDrive repository allows teachers to link files in Moodle from OneDrive. This is the scenario that is most desired here. Access to the files from Moodle to OneDrive is well regulated: only those people who are also enrolled in the course have access to the files in OneDrive (I don't know how this is managed in the background). But there is a serious disadvantage: if you embed OneDrive files as a link in Moodle, these files are not updated in Moodle after being changed in OneDrive. There is a tracker entry for this: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72611 When using MS365 repository, files which are embedded in Moodle as a link from OneDrive are also updated when changing them in OneDrive. However, the MS365 repository has another disadvantage: sharing the files works differently. The files are not only visible to the students of the course, but can also be viewed by other students/teachers of the same organisation (if they know the link). This option is not desired by us. You could control access to OneDrive manually, but that is too much effort. However, we still need to look at this in detail to see if the access rights can be managed even better. We have also had good experience with submitting the requirements for the MS365 plugins directly via Github as an issue ( https://github.com/microsoft/o365-moodle/issues ). Maybe developments around the MS365 Repository will also be implemented quickly. Best regards, Anton",

It has a repository directory in the moodle data folder I set up in the root of my server . No problems, works well enough. The other site was 1.9 untit today. In order to covert some courses from 1.9 to 2.1 which simply refused to move between the sites any other way, I upgraded the site to 2.1. I then planned to backup all the courses in the mbz format and move them to the desired site. I went looking for repository in the original moodle data folder for the 1.9 site and realised it wasn't there. So, I created one and added a few folders. Then I added the repository instances. Then I went to see what was where. I backed up a course, then couldn't find it. Curious, I searched the site and found that I have a repository folder (with all the relevant folders like alfresco etc) inside my main moodle folder. It's moodle/repository/ to be precise. Is this normal? I thought repository was set up by moodle in the assigned moodle data folder? It's not the end of the world, but I would imagine that 2 repositories will tick moodle off at some point. How do I fix it? As I upgraded, I believe the data for my old courses must be in legacy folders. Brian",

I've never used Moodle before, so don't know the ins and outs, although I have looked at the fine manual before posting this: What, if any, metadata can items in a Google repository be tagged with? A course I'll be working with has various online and file resources which will need to go into some kind of repository. As there'll be hundreds of these there'll need to be decent metadata (at least DC, plus custom elements for local use), not least because the thing will need to interoperate with other course repositories. I've looked at the following articles: http://docs.moodle.org/en/File_system_repository_configuration http://docs.moodle.org/en/Repositories_FAQ http://docs.moodle.org/en/Repository Metadata doesn't get a mention, as far as I can see. The impression I get is that the native Moodle repository is simply a file store, though you can 'plug in' external repositories. If the native filestore can't handle detailed metadata, then I could write a bespoke repository and try to develop a Moodle plugin for it - is there any documentation on doing this? TIA for any positive suggestions. As a complete newbie to Moodle I could be asking a very simple or a very complex question, so apologies in advance for either. Fred",

          "Text": "I don't believe Google Docs files can be tagged with any usable metadata that Moodle can use.  You can tag files for organization in Google Docs, but I really don't think that's what you're looking for. We are going to use Alfresco as our repository because we really want to try and keep as much content out of Moodle as possible and Alfresco handles metadata very, very well.  We will still have Google Docs as a \"repository\" in Moodle just so users can easily grab documents from their personal files on Google. Unfortunately, using Alfresco means installing and managing another application, for which you may not have available hardware.  Also, Moodle does not currently support uploading files directly to Alfresco.  You can only grab files from the repository through Moodle.  I am developing a plugin that allows importing, and I can at least tell you that it is possible. Those articles you have been looking at don't look very helpful.  My best advice would be to look at the repository plugins Moodle supports (Site Administration -> Plugins -> Repositories -> Manage Repositories) and then do research on each of those 3rd party applications to see what they support.  They will have way better documentation on what metadata, if any, they support. I hope this helps a little and you find a good solution.",

It confirms that Moodle's repository has minimal metadata, so that I need to either develop a custom job and build a plugin for it, or use a third-party repository. Our university uses Equella and I'm sure it'll be trying to build a Moodle plugin for it. My personal preference would be to build a custom job, but that'll depend on available time. Thanks for the tip on Alfresco - I'd not heard of it before. Can you, or anyone else, point me towards tech details as to how to build Moodle repository plugins? Cheers Fred",

So my first question is why can't a manager add a repository for another user?  Isn't this the point of the manager? Next, based on http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-28656 I gave my teacher account the moodle/site:config to try to allow it to add a private instance but I still get a message saying that I don't have permission to do that..  I added my teacher account to the manager role temporarily and that got me the same error message.  I can do it if I make my teacher account a full site administrator.  That seems like a really poor choice in a large site.  Its fine for me but it would be horrible idea for most people.

          "Text": "Hi all, Running moodle 3.9.6, PHP 7.4, on Ubuntu  18 (under Apache with My Sql i) After upgrading to moodle 3.9, I found enrolments weren't updating from an external db.   Looking at scheduled tasks and running cron manually, I got this: Execute scheduled task: Background processing for Dropbox repository (repository_dropbox\\task\\cron_task) ... started 07:35:27. Current memory use 15.7MB. Meanwhile, watching in top, one finds php takes all available memory and then we get numerous reports of: [51100.553022] Out of memory: Killed process 14763 (php7.4) total-vm:8894444kB, anon-rss:8446732kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:0 pgtables:17284kB oom_score_adj:0 I then tried limiting php's memory use, but the result is that although the OS doesn't kill all the processes, php itself stops the process before the dropbox task or any other task is completed: PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 8589934592 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in /var/www/online.blconlinecourses.com/public_html/repository/lib.php on line 570 PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 8589934592 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 20480 bytes) in /var/www/online.blconlinecourses.com/public_html/lib/classes/task/database_logger.php on line 68 So I found this process in scheduled tasks: \"Background processing for Dropbox repository\"  and I disabled it. Now, enrolments sync 😅, and I also find that I can browse to my Dropbox folder in the File Picker and still see and pick the resources from that repository 🤔. So, I am wondering:  What does the \"Background processing for Dropbox repository\" actually do?  Is there a way to successfully run it in my situation?  Is it necessary to run it?  If we get a successful first run, might the load get lighter so that it could actually run as a scheduled task? Thankful for insight and help from fellow moodlers!",

We have a large library of SCORM modules which are shared by multiple courses, across multiple drupal sites. I would like to do the following: Have a single location in our hosting environment where all SCORM modules are stored. These modules should be accessible to all moodle instances. Using the File System repository and some unix directory linking, it is possible to do this and have multiple sites see the location on disk. Given that the same course and modules are used across 30+ sites, this will be a huge space and time saver. Prevent courses from creating local copies of courses. I.E. whenever a SCORM module is selected by a student, they should always receive the latest version of the SCORM module from disk, not a local cached copy. Any ideas on how to achieve the second option above? The only way I can do this now is to go from course to course and reselect the SCORM module.",

I'll apply for production status in Dropbox.  Then I'll see if I can get as far as you've gotten...  having each individual dropbox user access their own Dropbox account.  When I enabled it on my demo site, other users gained access to my personal Dropbox site so that wasn't what I was looking for there. If I get that far, I'll try and test out the issue you've been having.  Sorry again I'm so slow getting back to you.",

You really need to spend some time working with it all to understand it.  Once you \"get it\" it is not so bad, but it seems to be hard to explain. Basically you can FTP a file into a repository. Hooray. But to get that file to appear in your course you will have to actually use the file chooser to go and select the file. Then Moodle will do a little magic to create a link to it that works on your page/label/question. That means that you can't do something like FTP up 1000 audio files, and create question import file that links to each of them, and import it. You need to use the file picker. One file at a time in this case. That has been painful for a lot of us. The workaround is to just FTP all your files into a web accessible directory on your server and then link to files in that directory. This works and I do this for the above situation (1000s of audio files, one per question). But beware, backup and restore and the file chooser won't know anything about your files.",

This is a scenario I would love to see Moodle capable of: Teacher A and B both teach English, using separate courses, but are both members of a teacher-only course called \"English Resources\".  Both teachers are able to upload resources to this course, including other teachers in the English faculty.  If Teacher A would like to use a resource, they simply \"link to file/web site\" using the existing functionality, but are given the option to link to a file in another course that they belong to as teachers.  Teacher B can do the same, as well as the entire English faculty. I'm not sure exactly how it would work in the backend, but you could either grant access to students to files specified by teachers in the teacher-only resource course, or copy the files between courses.  Both have advantages and disadvantages, but as yet I haven't seen anyone developing something like this. I would be very interested in hearing everyone's thoughts.",

I know someone made a SCORM module for Moodle that will allow you to \"upload\" and display a SCORM object. But, this is not what this thread asks to do. Instead of uploading it to one class, it should be put on a server and then many classes can \"point\" to it. That would solve the problem asked here. The missing link in SCORM is .. where is the server software that holds and distributes the objects to the LMS? If someone can find the server software, problem solved. Publish a SCORM compliant object, put it on a server, give multiple instructors rights, instructors place object into class, case closed.

In the moment we have a small problem with the new file manager and the handling of IMS CP and SCORM zips. But it is not very complicate to solve this. The repository can identify the content of a scorm package. Thats a question of system configuration. Its possible to make changes in the SCORM module that the SCORM modules are stored at a central place (repository) and the Moodle SCORM player uses it from this place. An other partner developed an alternative SCORM system. It works outside Moodle but it tracks the SCORM data to the Moodle database. Its possible to call the SCORM unit with a standard web link. We can combine the repository for searching the SCORM content and use the alternative player instead of the Moodle engine. ralf",

The usual method is to tell Moodle to zip the whole directory tree to a single file before downloading. I've just checked the file system repository in a Moodle 2.4 and couldn't find the zip function. A workaround would be to distribute a generic (S) FTP account amoung the undergrads so that they can download the files themselves. Since the files names in the file system repository are not hashed, there shouldn't be a problem.",

We are running Moodle 2.1 with up to 2000 users, and are looking for the best document management solution to manage the number of readings and other files we'd like to have available to our students. The Moodle instance authenticates via Active Directory. Our University has already heavily invested in MS Sharepoint, and I am fully aware that Moodle 2 can connect to Sharepoint via the Repositories plugins. Is this functionality stable, and is the Sharepoint support developed on an ongoing basis? I would rather not invest time in using our current infrastructure with a plugin that isn't going to be developed further. I ask because (logically) I would rather use the University's existing document management infrastructure, than have to set up an Alfresco instance for which there is very little expertise in the institution. Can you read between the lines here? I want to provide something that is sustainable to support, foolproof for our userbase and is fit for purpose. Will MS Sharepoint do the job? Will it do it properly? What pitfalls should I watch out for?",

          "Text": "In earlier versions of Moodle (2.0 -> 2.forgot when) that was true.  You linked to a google doc and it was copied to storage in Moodle.  Not desired.   So corrected.   Most recent versions of Moodle there is a check box that has the effect of NOT copying it to Moodle filedir. A better way might be linking to Google docs, is URL .   The Google Doc, of course, has to be set up for sharing ... to a list of folks, to members of your own entities Google Domain or Read only for anyone with the link (which, I assume, would only BE in your Moodle course).   It goes without saying that whatever is shared a certain way isn't totally protected. Google can change the rules, however.  They can 'giveth' and thus they have the right to also 'take away' ... especially if it's 'free'.  And they have, in the past, done such things. There are limitations to videos and other such documents in Google.   They have a max ... see the last link below.  Many teachers using Moodle and linking to videos/etc.  never see that cause the number of students involved are not close to that number.   So I'd say it's not a place to store and use videos (other files) for a Moodle course that has a large number of students accessing the link to the video. Since I was talking videos: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2423694?hl=en https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494893?hl=en https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/XAT8ICWVd3c Can't seem to find the Google page that explains the restrictions as to hits per, etc.  but it's out there somewhere. Naturally, one has to 'Google' for it ... but https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494827?hl=en Still though ... for videos, other services exist that might be better (overall).  Rare, though, they would be 'free' and even if they were, they also have to the right to 'taketh away'.  Enjoy 'free' while you can and as long as you can.   But, be prepared for alternatives to free.

Moodle grabs a copy of the Google Doc and uploads it into Moodle, right? So..if the doc is modified in Google Drive...it's not synced and therefore out of date. Sure, if you know that it will never change it's convenient but our staff (and most users I'd think) use Google Docs collaboratively or change it at least once or twice a year. It might be more beneficial to train staff to simply link to the doc..takes up less space on the Moodle server , synced to docs, one copy.... On that note why hasn't anyone created a repository integration with Google Drive that does just that? Why not be able to simply LINK to the Google Doc instead of grabbing a copy of the google doc? Why can't it work the same way, except it copies the URL and makes a link?",

Most of my teachers use the repository for assignment submissions.  They want a snapshot of the doc as it was at the time of the due date.  The file picker submission gives them that.

Here is the workflow at a high - mid level... - A user click on the search link at the top of the file picker. - Enters a search term - The search term returns many results -- In the search(), you setup your return structure and page data (page, pages, total, perpage) -- The function returns with more than 1 page of data This is where I'm puzzled... the user clicks on the page 2 link in the file picker.  The plug-in search() function is called again, however the original search term is not passed as an argument.  If search results can be paged, how do we figure out what the original search term is when the user click on one of the page links? Also, the search form that I created has multiple search criteria in addition to the default keyword search.  So it's important that I can keep track of the search options the user has selected when flipping through pages. One way around this it to store the search term in the user's session variable.  However I'm wondering if there is a 'best practice' way?",

A while back, I was told that we could map a personal home drive to Moodle's repository system, so students could access their school work from Moodle automatically. For example, if John Smith logs in to Moodle using LDAP , he can go into \"My Files\" or wherever within Moodle, and see his entire home directory, automatically mapped for him. I know there's a \"Personal files\" area, but I can't seem to work out if it'll operate like I imagine. In the same vein, staff have a curriculum drive that has all sorts of useful documents and photos that they would like to have access to, and link into their moodle courses. Can we set up a \"common\" drive amongst certain Moodle users? I hope that what I'm thinking, is what the person who informed me of this feature, meant!",

This all works because ive been doing it for over a year now.  However, if I want to link a resource into moodle the staff need to RIGHT CLICK on an item from their webbrowser and copy this link into moodle. i.e. the moodle link will be a HTML link to https://mywebdav.net:8080/staffshare1/directory8/mydocument.doc Not ideal but a workaround for the time being.  This also allows dynamic linking (as long as the filename isnt changed on the mapped drive of course!) Internal a person can either navigate the naturally shared drive from \"my computer\" or they can READ ONLY the file from moodle.  Externally they can map a drive at home to the webdav for readwrite - according to their NTFS permissions - (I have a batch file and a VBS to do this automatically for them) or use a READ ONLY link in moodle.",

We have configured Moodle 2 so we can see the Amazon S3 repository including all our buckets, folders and files there using an access and secret key. We can select the .mov in question and add it to the course using \"Add a resource / File\" and it shows up as a link on the course page with a nice little camera icon next to it. When we then try and play it though we just get the player window opening up but the movie doesn't launch and play. We did the same using the file locally and it plays fine and we have also been able to do it by using \"Add a resource / Page\" and including some HTML5 Video code to play it and that also works fine.  We had to set the Amazon S3 security so it was visible to everybody for the latter, but even with that security setting changed it won't work using \"Add a Resource / File\" The problem is the 2 methods that are working would be completely unsecure, and we are wanting to lock the movies down so they are only accessible with the access and secret keys that we have added to the \"repositories / amazon s3 settings\" in moodle. I have a feeling we are missing something stupid here but can't figure out what so any suggestions would be very much appreciated. Thanks Andy",

Unfortunately, as it is currently implemented, the webdav repository only supports FILE_INTERNAL (the current version of the file is copied from the webdav repository into Moodle, but does not update) and FILE_EXTERNAL (a link to the file in the webdav repository is inserted, but the file itself stays in the webdav repository - I suspect this means that a user viewing the file inside Moodle will need permission to access that particular webdav location in order to see it). It may be possible to implement FILE_REFERENCE for webdav repositories; I don't know off the top of my head whether or not there are any technical reasons why this wouldn't work. It may simply be that no one has had time / need to implement this yet (in which case, it might be possible to pay for a Moodle developer to implement it for you).",

Has anyone ever tried taking the data out of the MyFiles block? If so any suggestions for how to go about it or where to start would be much appreciated. Many thanks. Heather",

          "Text": "Hi, I know I'm wandering in a little late but wanted to give some comments based on my experiences with WebDAV in WebCT Campus Edition and Vista. WebDAV does not have to be bound to a document management system. In WebCT, WebDAV is used to access the files and folders in a course's Manage Files (CE) or File Manager (Vista) through the operating system's file manager (Windows Explorer, Mac Finder) instead of a web page. The equivalent in Moodle would be WebDAV access to the \"Files...\" area of a course. With WebDAV, there is no need to zip a collection of files together to get around the limitation of \"one file at a time\" uploads through a web page as we have now in Moodle \"Files...\".With WebDAV, one can just drag-n-drop files and folders. Since the inclusion of WebDAV in WebCT, it has been much more pleasant moving files between a local system and the course file space. Some applications such as Dreamweaver also take advantage of WebDAV so files on the server can be directly accessed by the application. Ideally, I would like to see WebDAV incorporated into Moodle so an instructor can have access to a course Files... regardless of a DMS for student use in collaborative file sharing as part of a group project.

Integration of Moodle and WebDAV authentication and authorization mechanisms should probably wait until Moodle 2.x stabilizes. I've not yet seen a GUI (web-based or otherwise) for WebDAV access control, versioning, etc. This would be a major undertaking. Arguably, in the meantime, Moodle could benefit from a custom hack which integrates basic WebDAV functionality. I expect to concentrate on this approach. Comments welcome...",

Any programming language or software platform which supports TCP/IP can implement a WebDAV client or server; the real question is which language/platform is ubiquitous enough to serve as a GUI for the WebDAV functionality of Moodle? This is the age old question for web developers. Do we go with a lowest common denominator GUI (a web browser and forms), or use something more fancy like Flash or Java, but which requires users to install more software beyond a browser? (A separate but similarly flavored question is: Must we use the same language/platform, i.e., PHP, for both Moodle and WebDAV servers?) It sure would be nice to see an existing GUI for configuring WebDAV access control, versioning, etc. I'm currently evaluating Jakarta Slide in this regard. I don't have access to commercial products such as Xythos WFS, which very well may have a nice implementation of such a GUI. Anyone seen an implementation yet? Addendum: Google for Xythos WFS and read the hits within the top ten entitled \"Xythos WFS\", which correspond to instructions for various universities' installations of Xythos. Kings",

Our 1.9 workflow is: Create a local directory structure (four folders each with many sub-folders) with several hundred files in. Use some command-line scripts to sync these local files into a specific directory on the Moodle server . In a Moodle course use 'display a directory' to link each of the four top level folders to the course. On a regular basis synchronise the files knowing the files available in the course are updated. On a regular basis add new files locally which will be synched to the server and also avaialble in the existing 'directory' resources. In Moodle 2 I have found out how to create a repository on the server, and I can synchronise all my files/folders to this repository. However I can not work out how to display my four top level folders. It appears to me that I can only make course 'folders' and have to manually re-create my file-system tree, and then one by one link to the hundreds of repository files in the right places. I am fairly sure that synchronising these existing files will make the updated files available in the course. However any new files added locally and synched to the server will not show up unless I manually add them. Given I have hudreds of such files I am VERY happy to manage via a repository, but how can I display them (with ease) via the VLE? Have I misunderstood something fundamental? many thanks",

Repositories are really meant for teachers / course creators to access resources that can then be used to build up the course within Moodle (rather than having a list of files already prepared). A couple of possible solutions: 1. Use my drag and drop upload block to move a large number of files quickly into a course page (but these would not be displayed in a sub-folder and would need to be deleted individually when updated). 2. Write (or get someone to write for you) a plugin that could call the repository API and either: a) display a raw list of files to the end user and let them download them directly from the repo OR b) import all the files from a folder (and sub-folders?) in a repo into a folder within Moodle and display them there, with a button to 'refresh' the file list (or have it set up via cron to query every 10 min or so, to see if there are any changes to propagate) I think option 2 is probably the best solution and probably not that difficult to do, but it would need someone to take the time to write it (and I'm not volunteering to do any more spare-time coding at the moment, so I'd only have time to do something like that if it came through my employers at Synergy Learning).",

Unfortunately this kind of extension does necessitate a minor core hack to include a JS file (at least that's the only way I can figure out how to do that...)

In addition, it would be beneficial, but not essential, that such a folder with the relevant permissions is created each time a new group is created. I am comfortable in setting up individual files for groups that only I can see, but I wonder if you know of a quicker/easier way or even as a workaround, if there is a way to put all of these individual files under one page? For example, I would like to be able to provide a link on the Moodle homepage saying \"Your Documents\" which a student could click on and it would take him to a page which the group folder in. I think this would work if there is a way to put all of the individuate group folders together on one page, but with each folder having it's own restrictions to stop other groups seeing it but am unsure if this is possible?

(FWIW, they also have the ipad issue with the disappearing HTML editing tools.) Anyways, the workflow with studywiz works like this. 1. Edit documents in pages, etc. Use webdav and upload it to a personal dropbox. 2. Go into studywiz, go to the dropbox. 3. Move paper from dropbox into assignment dropbox. All good. Here's where I stand with Moodle. I can make a webdav repository that's shared, upload a pages file, and then move it from there into an assignment. Yay! (Using xampp to test, it was a case of playing whack-a-mole with problems one by one. Fun!) But I can't figure out how to provision webdav repositories individually, for each user. It would be one thing to provision webdav repositories for courses. That's a bit of a pain, but it's doable. Setting up 600+ individual repositories is just not feasible. I am working on it now, and trying to figure it out, but I thought somebody perhaps had done this, or could point me to the right docs page. Can't find it so far. This situation I've just described is only get to get more common. WebDav is going to be a defacto requirement in schools as more ipads come in. I prefer laptops and netbooks, but they're just not as cool...",

I searched on google, and I think I read all the documentation, but I haven't found yet a solution to my problem. Maybe you could help me. My aim is to create my own repository plugin and to see it in the file picker. It will use after a web service to get files. (not implemented yet). For the moment, I'm just trying to make my custom repository appear in the file picker, but I'm not abble to do that, and I really don't understand why. Maybe I missed something... Here what I did: I took a template on a github, and I edited it. I put my repository in /path_to/moodle/repository. Then, my plugin appear in the repositories managment. I turned my plugin to enabled and visible, but it is not visible in the file picker... Something I saw in the general plugin list, my plugin appear as an \"extension\", I don't know if it is normal. I can't see my plugin in the role definition too. How can I do ? Please could you give me some help, I'm really desperate, I really have no idea.. I join a zip file where you can find my code. Thanks in advance Oxydium",

I think it would be a kick-ass feature to be able to host videos on Youtube and/or GDrive and only allow a specific web app to embed them. I guess Google doesn't want to allow this on their free services. For now I'll use a combination of \"unlisted\" videos on Youtube/GDrive and videos uploaded to the Moodle server.",

Yes, the information on the sharepoint integration with M2 is related to the new version from them - you would need to contact them directly, but I felt it was important to include for balance. The matrix shows the difference of Alfresco \"out of the box\" integration vs ELIS.  The ELIS integration has a lot more features (same as the ELIS CM for 1.9). I haven't tried the Edu-Sharing one, my german is rusty, but its on my list when i have time to install all that to try it out.  I have emailed them to get a test account, time will tell.

One minor update, the out-of-the-box Alfresco repository interface does currently allow resource-linking (rather than copying) if you add a URL rather than a File. It might be useful to include the particular Alfresco version associated with the various bundles (Elis and Edu-sharing). Earlier versions of these bundles were locked into Alfresco 3 or 3.2, whereas Alfresco 3.4 has been around for some time and Alfresco 4 recently released. Good to know the BFC Moodle 2-SharePoint integration will be available soon. Some final related points. WebDAV , by definition, should allow versioning. It might also be worthwhile emphasising that the WebDAV repository interface could allow 'generic' integration of a whole raft of different repositories. For example, SharePoint, Alfresco, ePrints, Documentum and Dspace all have a WebDAV interface. Cheers Geoff",

Will check on the Alfresco aspect, I dont recall seeing that option to link to Alfresco via File picker alfresco plugin, mea culpa. Regarding WebDAV this a tougher issue I guess. Its not really a repository and as you say, it technically could allow access to many different systems (including Blackboard). Each WebDAV interface on a repository has its own choice of how it exposes the local stuff. So technically it has potential to do anything or very little. Perhaps I should flag it as a special case? rather than say it could do it versioning (which it could or it may not depending if the host webDAV server displays the multiple versions or just the one of the file). Something to think about. On versions of software, the reason I hadn't added them was that it would \"lock\" the general document to one combination of all the versions and just require too much updating. My plan was to release, get feedback (like this) and then release an updated version after Moodle 2.2 is released - Thats the general idea for each of my papers/e-books, to re-update the suite of documents after  each major moodle release. But as someone suggested to me just yesterday, it may be good to have a number of people help maintain them rather than just me, which is an idea to play with too.",

You can store stuff in there but as soon as you bring it out of your private files and onto your course page the file in question will move to the server files as part of the course (and recent files holds the last 50 of your displayed files) When you say their \"course files\" do you mean their files in new courses in Moodle? Or do you  mean the files brought over in the upgrade of the course from 1.9 to 2. Because I would have thought they would belong to the legacy course files area of the course.

All works fine until I start moving over to H5P rather than HTML lessons/pages. In the process of converting existing lessons into H5P I do the following: - Create a DUMP activity page in a course - Add the PDF document(s) as a Hyperlink into the lesson - Save the lesson (invisible from candidates) - Create the H5P lesson - Inside add \"Link\" objects inside the H5P by copying the hyperlink from the \"DUMP\" activity - Save and publish So when the candidate then clicks the hyperlink it then downloads the PDF into a separate brower window. Done. Except, it does't for all files. It has worked for one H5P exercise, but not others. Where a candidate attempts to download by clicking the H5P link it crashes out of the Course completely. If doing this in the Moodle Mobile app it drops out of the course and then re-opens in a separate browser window.",

Clear the Moodle cache or re- upload the PDFs to ensure no file path issues. 2. Check if the links inside H5P are absolute URLs and correctly formatted (e.g. https://www.companysights.com ). 3. Test the downloads on a different browser and / or device to help identify if it’s a compatibility issue. Hopefully one of those works - Good luck!",

If this can't be done I was looking at trying to use Google Drive but as of right now there isn't Alias support.  Is there any work being done on trying to build Alias support or is it even possible? If all else fails I was looking into building a repo plugin that can access that external file server by using the logged in users username(which is how our filesystem is setup) and maybe looking at trying to use Aliasing.

Is this possible in Moodle 2? It appears developers see the importance of folders as it has the option to create them and upload documents into those but not display already created directories.

Unlike MrCuteJr's, MrCute2's Moodle docs are not very helpful. I googled and found this: MrCute 2 for Moodle Manual which helped with the install, but I have to confess I am still confused. I only have configuration options for the Search Repository block. I don't see any option for validation, librarian role or related capability. Am I missing something obvious? How would I uninstall this module if so desired? What about the security of placing your repository in Site Files - with it's warning: Note: Files placed here can be accessed by anyone who knows (or can guess) the URL . For security reasons, backup files should be saved in the secure backupdata folder only. Do Mr Cute's access control settings over-ride this? I tried to see if there is anything useful at the project site ( http://www.learningobjectivity.com/mrcute/ ) but cannot create an account because the site is failing to send emails. Because my moodledata is outside the web root I created a symbolic link from the web root to moodledata/1/lms_repository. The IMS Content Package Resource type is functioning - I can upload and view with no problem. So I'd really be interested in any thoughts on MrCute.  I'd also be extremely grateful for ideas on \" XMLWriter unavailable \" Heli Moodle 1.9.7,   Sles 10",

Ignoring the fake URL / filenames / thumbnails, the problems I found were: 'Title' & 'source' were both encoded as an object with a single item within them, when the filepicker javascript was expecting just a string. The 'date' & 'size' elements appear to be ignored (but all the respositories set them, so probably a good idea to include them). Note: this was all tested in Google Chrome - I've not tried FF/ IE to see what happens with them. The filepicker javascript also appears to be looking for a 'source' element, rather than a 'url' element, so you probably want to change those elements as well (although I note that the 'picassa' repository provides both, whilst other repositories only provide 'source'). I'm not an expert on repositories, but (assuming you're still stuck on this), I hope that helps you out a bit.",

          "Text": "Hello, everyone. I'm just now starting to get a handle on this new idea of \"Repositories,\" but I wanted to see if I could get some suggestions on how to handle our implementation. Here’s my situation. How we were doing things is that an instructor and I had folders for images, organized by Unit and Lesson . We also had a folder for “Additional Resources” -- documents to read, spreadsheets to fill out, that kind of thing. Right now, I see no Repository that A.) we can upload files to through the File Picker, and B.) we both have access to. I understand that we no longer have to create folders and files for images – we can insert them directly into a page and they become “part of” the page itself, no need for an explicit file structure. It took some getting used to, but I think I'm okay with that now (except for the delay between removing the image and having it being deleted from the nebulous place it's stored). But what about PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, or other types of documents? Especially because we’re referencing the same documents several times, sometimes throughout one lesson (“Refer to Dunlop’s spreadsheet” on several pages inside a lesson, for example) sometimes in different lessons. I thought the instructor or I can upload files to our “Private files” repository, and then link to them inside of a Lesson but we don’t have the ability to link to each other’s files, I don’t think (plus, I just ran an experiment on that and couldn’t get a link to a PDF I uploaded to even work when I clicked on it, let alone students). We could feasibly use a separate external repository, like Google Docs, but I’m unhappy with that because I would like to keep things within Moodle as much as possible. The third option I know of is below, the File System Repository, but I’m not sure I’m clear on how well it will work. Will our new Folders show up in the left menu of the File Picker? Can we easily upload files to that “folder” FROM Moodle, or do we need to use FTP to do so? http://docs.moodle.org/en/File_system_repository_configuration Does anyone have any idea on how best to accomplish my two goals? Shared access to a folder that we can interact with and upload to within Moodle?",

I am not talking about a repository where moodle users upload their own documents or even in the terms of a block that will only be put in a course. I mean of a full repository where teachers/admin can upload documents of any kind but in an organize manner so that every user has access to them, can view them and download them. Any steps towards that way? The talks over the years about a repository in the core or something outside the core or even commercial products are only talks. DMS suddenly stopped developing, DOOR that was the most recent add to this talks is simple but cannot provide the same things. I am not a coder, I cannot take something and turn it into something else for my use, I have to unfortunately rely on others to do that, why was DMS stopped? The minute I upgraded to 1.6.2+ the database of DMS did not migrate, I have a broken DMS and noone to ask for help. Maybe DMS was not the answer to my problems but it wasn't supposed to be temp, it was simple, cool, for moodle only and it worked despite the faults in it, I was expecting that the development of DMS would continue but it stopped. I am not here to complaint, all the work put in this wonderfull software, moodle, is praiseworthy, and 1.7 will be a beautiful thing to work with.",

So I set one up and from within a course linked to the index.html and got filenotfound error. Debug info does not provide the path as I have seen it do in the past.

I read that this is possible using Alfresco with WebDAV configuration but it doesnt work. I guess moodle copies the scorm the first time and doesnt check never again.

You would need a script that could authenticate the user and retrieve the HTML file from the correct location. It would then need to rewrite any links within the HTML file to make sure that further files were retrieved through the same script, before sending the resulting file back to the user. The extra complications might be the following: Is there just a single 'class schedule' starting point, or are there different class schedule index.html files for different classes? If there are different classes, does it matter if everyone on your Moodle site can access them, or does there need to be a further check to see which classes each student can access? Are there any additional files (e.g. images, scripts), or is it just HTML? (Obviously there should be no attempt to rewrite links within an image file, but a script file may need some careful checking to see if any rewriting was needed). If the answer to 1 or 2 is no, and 3 can be done via a simple file-extension check, then this is something that a Moodle developer could probably put together in an hour or so (depending on how much customisation you wanted via the UI, or if hard-coded file paths, etc. was acceptable).",

If the access to the thing in question is blocked at that level, then it must be specifically granted in all other roles for which you wish to allow it. We are having the same problem. In our 2.1 version of Moodle I had taken the repository permissions away from the authenticated user, then gave them specifically to the roles I wanted to make it available to (teachers and up) - effectively blocking students from getting in there. However, after upgrading to 2.2.1, our teachers were no longer able to access the file system repository. The only way I had to resolve this was to give access back to the authenticated user, but of course now students can see the repository in the file picker. I haven't reported it as a bug yet because there are couple newer builds out there than the one I installed, but it sounds now like perhaps we should report it.",

In fact, the behaviour of Moodle's File Picker is not what is shown for example in the video which link can be found in the \"Working with files\" page of Moodle's documentation. On a fresh installation of Moodle 2.2.1 ( nightly build as of today, PHP 5.4.0, mySQL 5.5.20, Windows 2008R2 SP1), with all roles definitions checked and reset to default, I've added two File System repositories, one Google Repository and checked several cases. Another test was done on a similar configuration but with a database upgraded from Moodle 2.0 with many courses, once again after resetting roles capabilities to default. For an ordinary student, only the Google Repository appears in the File picker when trying to add a file to its \"My private files\", which is ok for me. It is the same for a user registered as a teacher in some courses trying to add a file to its private file. To my point of view, as long as this user as the editing teacher role, he or she should be able to access all repositories in this case. When the same user edits one of the courses in which he ou she as the editing teacher role, then the Server Files repository and the two named File System repositories appear in the File picker (ok) but any attempt to use them ends up with a \"No permission to access this repository\" message (not ok). Of course there is a workaround : adding the capability to all Authenticated users to use these repositories but this is not an option for production systems. We do not want all students to have access to all resources of our Moodle site. By the way: in this configuration, when a user accesses to a resource uploaded by another teacher and tries to insert it into its private files or in its own course, the name of the creator of the original resource and its license type are not preserved. This is incorrect.",

All the users have the same role on the system, Elearning Admin which is based on the Teacher(editing) role. The problem they have is that when they attempt to upload a resource to a moodle course. The File picker defaults to the Server File repository. When they then try to move to any other repository, like Recent files or the Upload file plugin the file picker just hangs. Eventually they get an error message: Course or activity not accessible. This means that they are logged out of moodle. When running the Developer tools on a browser it shows the following error: GET http://ourmoodlesite/lib/ ajax /setuserpref.php [HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found 120325ms] Has anyone else come across this problem?

Is this right? And if so, why? I can't understand it.\nBy the moment I'm linking files as \"external\" URL but I don't like this way.

So this DB table will always be empty. The SQL error isn't something that I've seen before, we use MySQL for our own systems not Microsoft SQLServer, so I suspect this is specific to the Microsoft database. Since you're not using Lecture Capture Live, the simplest temporary fix here would be to prevent the query from being run. Just comment out the following line from the autoview_cron() method in lib.php: $DB->delete_records_select(\"autoview_keys\", $sql); I'll see if I can put in a proper fix for this in the next release. FYI , I don't monitor these forums regularly, there are far too many messages, the best way to get my attention is to post a message on the AutoView website.",

I have enabled the File System repository and created an instance in a course. The files have been uploaded to a repository\\courses folder under moodledata. The slash arguments option for HTTP is also enabled. Having uploaded the mini-sites by FTP I go into the course and choose to set up a file resource that links to the mini-site folder and HTM file. I choose the copy as alias/shortcut option here and then set main file. When launched the HTM file displays but no layout is included and the links to other pages produce the error: \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found\". I also tried setting up the resource as a URL but cannot seem to grab the URL for a file through the filepicker. Interestingly I have noticed that if a course has acccess to legacy it is possible to get the legacy URL no problem and uploading here works but for new courses that do not have legacy files access I am at a loss. Any assistance appreciated. Ciarán",

          "Text": "Hi Michael, We run on Moodle 1.9 on red hat linux. The way this would work would be a hard link to the directory in each course, however linux prevents us from using this.  Moodle will allow teachers to point to files in a central directory by having a symbolic link in each moodeldata course directory.  However the code for displaying a directory does not pick up symbolic links. The code below assumes a symbolic link called media in each course directory linking to a media directory.  This must be in  place. I needed this badly and so have had to hack moodle to get it working.  The changes are shown wrapped in TGS specific comments : The php you change is mod/resource/type/directory/resource.class.php ( 3 changes ) : } else { $relativepath = \"{$course->id}\"; } else { $relativeurl = \"/file.php?file=/$relativepath/$file\"; } // Tgs specific $tgsresources=array('1','2','3','4'); if ( in_array($resource->reference,$tgsresources)) { $relativeurl=\"/file.php/\".$course->id.\"/\".$relativepath.\"/\".$file; } // End TGS specific $dirs = array(); $dirs[0]=get_string('maindirectory', 'resource'); // TGS specific $dirs[1]='Resources - French'; $dirs[2]='Resources - German'; $dirs[3]='Resources - Italian'; $dirs[4]='Resources - Spanish'; // End TGS specific You also need to put a symbolic link to your shared area in each course directory and then changes perms.  This is a chore so I wrote scripts that run under moodle/root every 5 minutes.  They create the directory if necessary and the link and then change permissions : moodle cron 00,05,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * /bin/bash /export/moodledata/makelinks.sh>>/export/moodledata/makelinks.log &2>&1 script : #!/bin/bash # # Username to access the MySQL server e.g. dbuser USERNAME=username # Username to access the My SQL server e.g. password PASSWORD=password # Host name (or IP address) of MySQL server e.g localhost DBHOST=localhost # List of DBNAMES for Daily/Weekly Backup e.g. \"DB1 DB2 DB3\" DBNAMES=\"moodle\" PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin # Functions # Data sync SQL : mysql --user=$USERNAME --password=$PASSWORD moodle -e \"select id from mdl_course;\" > /export/moodledata/course.txt cat /export/moodledata/course.txt | while read x do if [ ! -d /export/moodledata/$x ]; then echo \"$x directory does not exist\" echo \"Creating directory $x\"; mkdir /export/moodledata/$x fi if [ ! -h /export/moodledata/$x/media ]; then echo \"Creating media link in directory $x\"; ln -s /export/moodledata/media /export/moodledata/$x/media fi done exit $STATUS root /etc/crontab file : 01,06,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56 * * * * root /export/moodledata/chperms.sh >>/export/moodledata/chperms.log &2>&1 script : #!/bin/bash # PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin # Functions # Data sync SQL : cat /export/moodledata/course.txt | while read x do chown -R apache:apache /export/moodledata/$x done exit $STATUS",

As a result, I believe I've resolved my issue. In lib/moodlelib.php, the function get_directory_list checks for \"(filetype($fullfile) == 'dir')\" (around line 4888). I tweaked to check for \"... or ... == 'link')\" also, as our symbolic links to directories in every course were not being displayed when attempting to \"Display a Directory\". This way, they are displayed like any other standard directory. Thanks again, Michael",

          "Text": "How are you managing this migration? If you are just trying to move things via the moodledata folder then you are asking for trouble. The entire database and moodledata structures are setup very differently. Your best bet is to create a duplicate of your v1.9 Moodle, database and all, then delete out of that any third party blocks and so on, anything that is not Moodle core, then upgrade. Delete the v1.9 code, but keep the config.php file, then paste over the extracted v2.1 code and then open the Moodle. All things being equal and with a bit of good fortune, it should all work first time. The new database structure should be generated without wrecking your existing database, and all data should be preserved. Once you are satisfied your system is working, you can then FTP the new Moodle back to your site, change the config.php file, and run the replace.php file to update the internal links.  This method doesn't cause too much anxiety and leaves you with a perfectly good test bed so you do not have to worry about harming your site when you want to upgrade or add in blocks or make other changes. Test it on your test bed first, trial it and when happy, then you can smoothly update your production site.",

I think the links I'm am using are incorrect as I know that the mime types I am using are supported.",

          "Text": "The story so far with finding a decent workable setup in our Moodle 2.0 site... This is less straightforward than I thought it was going to be. I tried just using the moodle upload button (which should probably work, but doesn't upload anything bigger than 1mb, I suspect this is an issue with our host and have contacted them about it and am waiting to hear back). This won't really allow for the version tracking and file collaboration we need anyway. I researched Alfresco integration, which looked good until we realised it was too costly for our budget. I checked out WebDav. I signed up to a drivehq free account to get the file storage space with webdav capabilities online. The built in windows client is buggy for larger files (even just 7mb files) and problematic if the host has slight disconnection for whatever reason. Sky drive doesn't support it (webdav), google docs doesnt support it (neither of which will do the version managmenet we need anyway - google docs does a little bit, but not easily enough for our moodlers). In order to get past the ugly, buggy win 7 native webdav connection client, I tried other webdav clients (e.g. netdrive), all of which cannot connect to our proxy server here at my organisation. I tried dropbox. But the client again wont connect to our proxy because of the type of authentication we use here at my organisation (which is not going to change any time soon). I tried box.net. The moodle 2.0 plug in for it doesnt log in to the free box.net account I created. Others are having this problem too. http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=168674 I tried Amazon S3, which looked promising, until I realised that I couldn't get any of the files I put in the buckets to show up in moodle. The bucket names show up in moodle but when clicked on in the file picker, they show no files inside. I have changed the files to public. They just don't show up in moodle. Does anyone else have a solution that a. Has an online file storage solution that tracks file versions b. That moodle 2.0 can recognize and work with c. That is easy for moodle users to add files into natively in a windows environment. d. That is no or relatively low cost (e.g. box.net or dropbox type pricing) Help or suggestions on this would be great. What is working for you? Am I asking too much from moodle and its repositories at this stage of moodle dev?",

I've consulted with Door's designers in Switzerland and it isn't able to parse Scorm metadata yet. They're reportedly work on it. My recommendation is you package your content using IMS content packaging specifications. Any tool you're using for Scorm 1.2 packaging will probably also give you the option to package IMS content (Your packaging tool wouldn't by chance be eXe would it?) Door works rather nicely with zipped IMS content packages. You can download from your repository, directly into Moodle and you can pluck moodle content that isn't already packaged (all sorts of Moodle content!) up and suck it into Door! Be sure to read and digest the Moodle documentation about IMS content packaging. You'll have to change some configuration settings for PHP and create a folder called \"ims_repository\" in the root folder of your web server . If doing that gets complicated , send me an e-mail and I'll do what I can to help you avoid some of the dumb mistakes I made. The only thing you'll lose is the ability Scorm gives you to track responses on quizzes and verify whether or not students have been into the content modules and units. That's the best I can do for you till the Door team reworks their Repository to parse Scorm content packages. Hasta luego, Bob Blomeyer (BobBl)",

Documentation can be found here: https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/OneDrive_repository From the posts in this forum thread: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=427033 I understand that OneDrive service account is used to create and store files. My questions are: how are the files managed? For example, is there an expiry period, and are files automatically deleted once they are uploaded to Moodle? Also, what type of license are you using for this service account? I'm interest in the type of graph api permission you've allowed for the OneDrive repository. Thank you for your insights, Amar",

          "Text": "Hello Fellow Moodlers! My institution is grappling with making the new File Picker with Alfresco repository integration work for our use-case scenarios and have come up with some action items, brainstormings, etc., that we'd like to share. We don't have the solutions yet - but we're working on them and looking for like-minded to share their experience and contribute too, hence this post. We also recently attended the USMoodleMoot-West Coast. We sat in on the presentation by UCLA \" Testing Moodle 2.0 Compatibility with Alfresco and Equella Repositories.\"  Out of this presentation came a few interesting problem statements. They are addressed in my notes below. So, I'm posting here our the brainstorming notes between our support/training team and application developer team, as we wrack our brains around meeting our use-case needs. Please read on, and jump in! Original Problem Statements [Proposed at US WestCoast Moodle Moot by UCLA]: - If a TA uploads a file to Alfresco and in Moodle links to the file when assisting faculty in building a course, then the file is inherently owned by the TA and not the faculty member as Alfresco is user-centric, whereas the prior Moodle model was course-centric with file associations. - If a faculty member or TA leaves the UCSF system, what happens to the files in their user account that are used to fundamentally run a course on Moodle? [referred to in the UCLA presentation as \"sync\" - a conversation Martin Dougiamas participated in, as well] Possible Solution Our Team Has Brainstormed: - Create a bridge/box/broker [hereafter referred to as the \"box\"] to handle the business logic (that we define) between Moodle and Alfresco. - The box is the backend; the File Picker in Moodle is the UI - but we'll need to edit the UI for the Alfresco plugin. Our General Meeting Goals: 1. Began flushing out some use-case scenarios 2. Mapping out bones of over-arching picture between Moodle-Alfresco using our bridge/broker/box idea 3. Getting into general details of possible permissions and scenarios [business logic box will have to handle] We Came up with: 1. Use Alfresco just for learning objects - accessible by faculty and course creators (in Moodle speak). 2. End users don't ever access Alfresco, they access via one of the integration points (e.g. Moodle, but could easily be any other system also using Alfresco as a joint repository) So that's what we're grappling with in a nutshell. If you've ideas, please comment and share on this thread - or tell me where I should post on this thread or what tracker to post on. I'll be more than happy to! Thanks! - Mary",

          "Text": "I have never used Alfresco, so I may be barking up the wrong tree, but I am confused about how your Alfresco repository is set up. If someone (a TA) is working on a resource in Alfresco that is destined to be used on a course (as in a course your institution studies, not necessarily a course in the Moodle sense) then surely that file belongs to that Course, or the Department that is responseible for the course. It does not really belong to that user. Therefore, surely it should be stored in Alfresco in some sort of 'Departmenttal teaching resources' area, not in the TA's personal files area. Of course, Alfresco will track that the TA was the creator or editor of that file, but that is surely just meta-data. Therefore, there should be no problem when the TA leaves. The whole issues of reliability if a file is deleted in the repository it came from is the reason that Moodle takes a copy of the file at the time you add it to the course using the file-picker.",

With Moodle 2.0's new file system architecture, now is a good opportunity to having these conversations about file repositories and content management systems. I haven't used alfresco but I can see that it has potential - I will report back here when I've taken some time to test the integration. You raised some valid points about the challenges that need to be considered to effectively integrate the LMS and CMS. Did UCSF evaluate other CMS options and if so why was alfresco chosen? In terms of getting involved over at tracker, you can report bugs or suggest feature improvements for repositories at http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL/component/10306 Cheers, Chad",

We are using the latest Alfresco community bundle (3.4.d) installed on the same physical server (CentOS 5 Apache 2.2.3 MySQL 5.5.13 PHP 5.3) as our Moodle 2.1. http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Download_Community_Edition We used the latest Alfesco bundle as it simplifies the installation of all the other bits-and-pieces ( Java , Tomcat, OpenOffice SWFTools etc..) that Alfresco needs. However, we did use our 'native' My SQL (i.e. the same one as used by our Moodle) for Alfresco. Note that using the latest Alfresco has precluded us from using any of the 'off-the-shelf' Moodle-Alfresco bundles such as Edu-Sharing or Elis which (currently) use older Alfresco versions. We have however found the Elis documentation, together with a couple of Packt books, rather useful. http://www.edu-sharing.net/mcportal/web/edu-sharing http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=4894 http://rlcommunity.remote-learner.net/mod/book/view.php?id=17 http://www.packtpub.com/article/integrating-moodle-2-alfresco-manage-content-for-business http://www.packtpub.com/alfresco-3-enterprise-content-management-implementation/book By default, Alfresco installs on port:8080. So, to allow traffic though our firewall (which is closed to port:8080) and generally simplify things for users, we used an Apache Reverse Proxy ( http://www.apachetutor.org/admin/reverseproxies ) setup to redirect, for example: http://www.mysite.ad.uk/alfresco (or perhaps http://alfresco.mysite.ac.uk ) to http://www.mysite.ac.uk:8080/alfresco . A similar configuration can be used for the alternative /share interface of Alfresco. We have set up a single sitewide Alfresco repository in Moodle so users can see and browse to their personal folder/space (see below) in Alfresco through the Moodle file picker or insert images via the button on the editor toolbar. Resources can be copied (default, file duplication, but avoids permissions and course backup issues) or linked (permissions issues?) from Alfresco to Moodle. Had to apply the following fix for the breadcrumb trail in the Moodle file picker. http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-27022 Also, had the strange behaviour that pdf files uploaded via the /alfresco interface did not appear to have the right mimetype associated with them, and so were invisible from Moodle. However (the same) pdf files uploaded via the /share interface worked fine. Not fully got to the bottom of this yet, just routinely using /share rather than /alfresco. We have the same authentication, ActiveDirectory/ LDAP , for Moodle and Alfresco. So, users have the same username and password, but not (yet) full Single Sign On. Have also got basic ActiveDirectory/LDAP synchronisation to work so that user home accounts are automatically created in Alfresco and AD/LDAP Groups are also imported. We are using WebDAV (not yet got CIF working) to map a folder on users desktop (or allow remote access) to their Alfresco folder. So, we have a rather nice, simple system where users (teachers & students) can (via 'transparent' WebDAV) add resources to a 'repository' folder in their user area which is directly accessible from within Moodle. i.e. the use their file system to 'put' files and the Moodle repository interface/ file picker to 'get' files. They don't (necessarily) need to know about the Alfresco interfaces at all. However (and, as I understand it, this is the nub of Mary's original post!), we now need to make *shared* resources available to the appropriate sets/groups/cohorts/courses/metacourses via Alfresco. In the first instance, we are exploring this by manually setting up appropriate groups and spaces in Alfresco but it would be nice there was an automatic way to mirror Moodle courses and cohorts (perhaps groups and groupings) in Alfresco. Perhaps this is already in place in Elis or Edu-Sharing? I have not yet tried these. We currently only use AD/LDAP information for user authentication, not for course setup. Apologies for the 'brain dump' but any questions, comments or suggestions gratefully received. Geoff",

Alfresco need some codechanges and extra code for that purpose. I'm playing around with the Moodle repository plugins for alfresco and webdav in Moodle 2.1. Basically both plugins work as expected, but with some issues for me: 1. If I login with the Moodle filepicker and the Alfresco plugin, I can't see the \"Sites\" folder in Alfresco, no matter if I use it in the editor or with \"URL/Link\". I don't know exactly where the problem is, in Moodle or in Alfresco. I think it's related with the Alfresco api. Can you confirm this behaviour? 2. If I use the webdav plugin in Moodle 2.1 to access Alfresco, with \"URL/Link\" only the path is assumed by Moodle, not the URL to the Alfresco repository: \"/path/to/file\" not. \" http://alfresco.somewhere.com/alfresco/webdav/ ..\" If I use webdav in the editor, the URL is automatically filled in, but the URL is the Moodle URL, not the Alfresco URL (Alfesco is hosted on a dedicated server) Same behaviour with images or videos.

What I envision is that the Moodle upload file function would be removed in favor of an upload form that would place the file in Alfresco.  It seems like it would be a fairly easy task to modify the existing Alfresco repository plugin to allow uploads rather than just file retrieval.  There is a file upload webscript available in Alfresco that should allow this. If anyone else has done this, please share your experience.  I am not a programmer, but I do have some programming experience and have had to program PHP apps before.  If I need to I'm going to dive into the Alfresco repo plugin and see if I can make something work.  I would love some input, though.

Per Helen's request, I am posting here to see if there are others that would find this feature interesting enough for the Moodle dev team to allocate resources for it.  Of the advantages I can think of are the following: Not needing to rely on a single provider for an object storage-based repository Being able to make use of your own host 's object storage service if you are not on AWS (e.g., Linode, Digital Ocean, and more) Taking advantage of cheaper S3-compatible storage options (e.g., Backblaze has a compelling one!) Host your own S3-compatible service ( Ceph and MinIO are two free and open-source such options) All of these would be possible with the just the ability to choose the S3 endpoint without the implicit assumption that it'll be AWS-only.  As I mentioned in the linked feature request, AWS S3 can still be the default, but allow the definition of a custom endpoint that would then take precedence over AWS if specified. If this kind of feature interests you, please vote for the issue in the tracker .",

If you find a well maintained PHP Software Development Kit that supports a lot of S3 compatible services, it is a piece of cake to create a compatible local plugin. But nobody is interested to maintain such a sdk, as people ask again and again to add some obscure storage service, and complain that certain compression settings or other options only generate errors. If it as simple as replacing a url prefix, why do you not add a hardcoded prefix to the local/aws/sdk/Aws/data/endpoints.json.php file and/or repository/s3/S3.lib ? I am a 100% convinced that, if you can prove this solution works in all cases on at least 5 compatible services, this solution will be implemented in plugins in a couple of days.",

I cannot find where the administrator does this.  Do I need to turn on a block tool for this purpose?  If so, which one?  There must be some tool available for administrators to manage files by course, by user, maybe by category, or by site.  Right?",

This is all working like a charm! Up comes moodle 2.0 -I installed it today- with the new and shiny file API. Good greifs! my moodledata got all mangled up in some weird way, and I cannot use my scripts anymore... Wait... I''ll use the \"fiel system\" plugin, but the problems are not solved by this plugin. I cannot seem to simply use FTP to upload a whole bunch of files into a course, nor can I just rsync folders of the moodledata tree. Ofcourse, I'm ranting here, trying to be humorous, but is there a solution to my problem and aren't you guys (devvers) afraid that all hell will break loose with 2.0, when alle those customish things break?

I'd suggest you get a 2.3 install ASAP and put some teachers on it (volenteers of course, hardy souls who can cope with a few fun things and a roller coaster ride)  You have got to get your hands dirty sooner or later.  The sooner the better. The change is significant, depending on how you set up 1.9. I've wondered if really Moodle should say \"It doesn't really give you the functionality an insitution needs which is reasonably big and has multiple teachers involved in single courses\"  You can make it work of course, but it relies on good habits from staff. Legacy files was brought in very latye in the piece, and I still don't really understand how these work with upgrades, imports etc.  See the help. http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Legacy_course_files On the other hand, an optimistic view is this: \"There are a whole lot of cool things in 2.0-2.3.  You have the built in repositories . . .  just live with them, and see how it goes\".  You will need to get your head around the 'link to' option or 'copy from'. Just some thoughts, and good luck.  Others will have some things to say I am sure. -Derek",

          "Text": "Not sure how many Spanish speeking people use moodle.org, so have taken the liberty of translating your post using Google Translate, hopefully you'll get other replies: Moodle can be used for an application like this? Design a database and relational dynamics to allow the registration, updating, data editing and information management and coffee producers Dynamic: to record, edit / update information periodically or annually per producer and organization (s) of producers to which it belongs (contact details, information about the farm and coffee production, batch information, quality assessment results , dry processing and basic information marketing), active members of ACEN register with specialty coffee and other information of the member. Relational: enables the management of information using methods of consultation of the information recorded by each producer and organization to which he belongs. These may include: quantities of coffee given height, scores from quality analysis, production area, coffee with certain attributes (acidity, sweetness, body, aftertaste, balance); make a selection of producers who are members of ACEN with a certain type of coffee and a state of solvency. My take on this is it sounds like you need a specific database to manage the information you refer to. Moodle has a database tool, but it's simple and relationships would not be handled well. If you wanted to communicate with the coffee producers, they could register in Moodle (aka students), adding custom profile fields for additional information about them, and make them compulsary. However they would be able to enter and edit this info themselves - closer to Customer Relationship Management than a database used for recording business data.",

          "Title": "\"Legacy course files\" does not work as expected/intended",
          "Text": "When I read the discussions during Moodle 2 development's process about the new files' management approach, via repositories instead of a \"course files\" folder, it was stated (and I agree) that the old system has two main advantages from a practical point of view: Being able to upload files first, link files later, using that folder as a \"file system\" Being able to put files inside that folder by direct access to it (local folder, FTP ...), giving the fact that each course's \"course files\" area was a physical folder inside the \"moodledata\" directory. Moreover, giving the fact that the files inside it could be directly linked from Moodle, edited files could be replaced by only replacing them physically inside the \"course files\" folder (via upload or via direct access) One of the conclusions was to let site admins enable \"Legacy course files\", to re-enable the old behaviour. But \"legacy course files\" only enables half of the advantages of the old approach: the first point stated. The second one is not reenabled by enabling \"legacy course files\", because files are still stored as a \"file pool of blobs\", not directly as files in a physical directory where you can upload new ones to be directly linked later or update existing ones. Is is argued in the docs that this can be replaced by using the \"filesystem\" repository, and putting files into one instance's folder via direct access. This approach has 2 main disadvantages, one covered in the docs, but not the other: Linked files are not automatically updated if files are updated in the folder, because there are not linked directly You can put files in the folder, BUT YOU CAN'T GET FILES INTO THE COURSE BIGGER THAN THE UPLOAD LIMIT, giving the fact that, when you add the files from the instance upload limits are checked at that time (a bug or bad design? maybe file limits only should be checked when using the \"upload a file\" repository?) Both absences make files management a lot more cumbersome for admins and teachers, and the second one make almost impossible to really put some resources inside Moodle. My comments are: Is this the behaviour intended, or \"Legacy course files\" should really work 100% as \"course files\" in 1.9.x (so the present behavior is a bug) If this is the intended behavior, \"legacy\" is quite misleading. When I see the word \"legacy\" I think in \"trying to support the old system as far as possible\" not \"trying to superficially resemble the old system\". I think also that this behavior should be made very clear in the docs (what part of \"legacy course files\" works as \"course files\" in 1.9.x and what part doesn't) What is the new suggested procedure to getting big files inside Moodle?

This is to prevent injection of characters that might allow someone to hack into the system. There is, however, a plan to use UTF-8 in future versions and I believe that this will solve the problem. A good place to start for reference is here: http://moodle.org/mod/wiki/view.php?id=2935&page=MigrationToUFT8 and here: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1779 I believe that this migration has started for inclusion in version 1.6.

You can kind of try to browse inside your courses with the help of Server Files and find files that way. I think you just put your image directly into the course description area. Yes, 2.0 is tricky this way. You can now put files directly into Labels, or Descriptions. And this is where they will be stored. To change  the picture, go back to course description, eraze your old picture, and upload another. Note this bug though: MDL-26388 ( and Discussion ) - You will not be able to upload a picture with the same name. So, you need to name it differently. - Your old picture will be removed from the view, but it will not be deleted. So it be sitting in your installation, consuming space. So before this is fixed, be extremely careful with adding files via the WYSIWYG Text Editor interface. They will just pile up there.",

One such point of interest is: Does the maturity of a plug-in reflect its popularity in the community? By a survey of posts within this forum, Alfresco appears the most frequently discussed repository, with Google Drive a close second. Testing of these plug-ins, however, has revealed several shortcomings of each, including lack of robust linking (Alfresco tickets no longer disk-cacheable in latest version) and complete integration in a Moodle context (two separate interfaces for uploading documents to repository and inserting into courses).

I do have the Office 365 repository enabled, but one limit seems to be that it cannot create \"Access Controlled Links\" like is possible in the built-in OneDrive repository . If a student selects a file from their Office 365 repository to turn in to an assignment, a copy of the file is uploaded to Moodle, instead of a cloud link to the file being submitted. This would be great functionality to have to allow students to turn in large files for assignments. My current max upload size for assignments is 10MB and I am not keen on raising it and using more local storage. My current plan is to set-up the OneDrive repository separately and name it something like \"Turn In OneDrive Files.\" I'm just curious if anyone knows of a way to use this feature in the Office 365 version of the repository, which is supposed to be better and more fully featured.",

I really thought that 2.0 would be a user's dream, instead it has for me become a nightmare.  I will stick with 1.9 so as to able to manage my files without problems.  A quick look at the feedback on repositories should give all an indication of how poorly this has been implemented.  I spent a couple of hours trying to figure out the repositories and I think I finally figured out how to do it.  But I found the process very, very tedious.  What makes this even harder is the instruction sets are not clear.  This really needs to be fixed so that the whole repository thing is easier to use.  Take a cue from Apple and think of your users.

          "Text": "I'm about to ask a rather involved question ,so... sorry. I've recently started with a large online school, and we are planning to move about 200 courses from Moodle 1.9 to 2.2 or 2.3 for the coming school year. All of our courses are based around html pages with linked css ,scripts,images and often links between the different subparts of a lesson . Each of our courses have their own html templates for the lessons seperate from the moodle site template. I can see that the moodle css files are still loaded, but we're overriding them with our css. I'm trying to figure out how to make this work using the new repositories feature (or somehow bypassing it). linking to my pages using a \"file\" resource type only displays the html text inside and object tag embaded in the moodle site template, and using the URL resource type I am unable to link to a filesystem repository. The Legacy Course File repository is incompatible with html, and from what I've experienced we (too) often have changes being made to our courses on the fly. I think If we had to zip up a whole course, reupload, and relink everything to make a change it would cripple our productivity. The only feature from moodle we are using in our courses are links to resources in the moodle course. A former employee wrote some custom plugins such that for example %QUIZLINK:Name of quiz% would open the quiz named \"Name of quiz\". obviously we will need to rewrite all of that, but I'd like to be able to access the page not purely as an external URL so that we can touch it with some plugins to implement that functionality. I am open to the idea that we should write moodle templates for our courses eventualy, and implement them in a more moodle specific way, but my deadline for this move is September so I don't think that will fly just yet. What have others done? Has anyone successfully completed a move while maintaining html outside of moodle? What sacrifices did you have to make? Ideas? Thanks",

As I understand for each week of my course I need to create a file resource, upload my HTML files for the week, select the first as main, then using the add button go in and add all of my CSS and image files (henceforth \"template files\") one at a time. I probably have 20 - 30 files I would need to add for each week, and the speed of the file manager is just brutal on that scale. If I'm doing something wrong someone please tell me. Please. At this point it looks like my best option short term would be to place all my template files in a separate directory on my server, and use absolute links in my HTML. I'm hoping in the future to start using Moodle templates for my pages, but really all I'd want it to do is display my pages as I designed them, and stay out of the way.

For example, \n```text\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD \nXHTML\n 1.1//EN\" \"\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd\n\">\n\n\n\n<html xmlns=\"\nhttp://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\n\" \nxml\n:lang=\"en\">\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n</html>\n```\n - create a directory in a course and upload the HTML file into the directory - In a label link some text to that file through the file picker. The link looks like <a href=\"http://moodle.example.com/draftfile.php/5/user/draft/157218275/the_file.html\"> Now in the course, if one clicks the link it works as expected, the HTML is rendered full page. But if one navigate to the directory and click on the file, I get completely different results in different browsers. In Firefox (V. 17) it says, \"You have chosen to open filename.html which s a Zip-archive(!)\" and gives me the choice of opening in the browser (!!) or save it. If I select \"Open with: Iceweasel (default)\" only I get the html rendered. In Chromium (V 25) it downloads the file. Clicking on the downloaded file in the bottom bar opens the HTML in Firefox! OK, Firefox is the default browser, but why this difference? Moodle version 2.4.4+",

But then the trouble starts: when i upload a object to door, then it workes, but download doesnt due to dir-rights for the generated directories ims packs can get downloaded, but the upload to door with the same file failed also including the ims pack in moodle as a ims-recource failed activity door doesnt work: This module cannot be added to this course yet!

Door Block: export single recource (Error during the creation of the IMS. Cannot add uploaded data to the archive .) I wonder if someone has this door together with moodle up and running. I really would like to use this repository but also with all information on the web in in the readmy files I am not able to get it done.

For instance: Why would you use aliasing with Dropbox/Box, etc. rather than aliasing a file stored directly into server files? Would you use external (Dropbox/Box) if you are only going to also be using files outside of your Moodle install? Would you create a seperate course for all shared resources or just create a repository folder in moodledata? Why? Do you use automatically use aliasing if you expect to share a resourse over X number of times throughout your system? Would you use a certain setup if the people selecting files needed to do more searching instead of already knowing what they needed to link to? I guess I'm having a hard time understanding the pros and cons to different setups/workflows and am specically looking for \"pitfalls\" going forward. A year from now I'd prefer not to say \"I wish I would have used this file setup\". I realize the aliasing is pretty new, but if anyone has any thoughts on how you plan on implententing file management given the new possibilities I'd appreciate the comments. Todd",

I looked up the settings, which are detailed here: https://koofr.eu/help/koofr_with_webdav/how-do-i-connect-a-service-to-koofr-through-webdav/ I activated the WebDAV repository option in moodle (5.0) and added a new connection, with the settings as suggested by the link above. So far so good. I don't know if I can check whether this works. I have set developer options to show all errors, and did not get an error. I tried to add a video, stored in koofr, to a course, by adding a text & media field, adding multimeda, and clicking on the WebDAV option. This is where things went wrong. There was a long loading time, and in some cases after a while, the message that where are no files here.

          "Text": "Hi, We're running Moodle 2.5.1 on an IIS server . Some of our course teachers are having issues downloading word files from their courses. When they click on the file name, the browser responds with \" Download failed: server error\" I had been able to recreate the issue, but turning on Failed Requests Tracing seemed to make it disappear, at least for most users. I now have only one user who is unable to download their files. This obviously leads me to believe that the issue is computer specific, however the teacher is only having this issue when they use Moodle - they are able to download files from other websites just fine. I've checked if its role related, temporarily disabled their anti-virus and even forced Chrome to ask for a save location when downloading files. A right click + save as also seems to alleviate the issue - which is fine for a workaround but staff here would prefer that everything work as it should. Anyone got any ideas what path I could go down to fix this?",

If you are wanting to store all the assignments on a different server, then you are probably going to have to clone the 'assignsubmission_file' submission type (assuming you are talking about the Moodle 2.3+ assignment type). Once that is done, you are free to devise your own storage mechanism, but you will not be able to make use of the Moodle files API and so will miss out on all the benefits that gives (space reduction by not storing duplicate files multiple times, security checks on file access, integration with Moodle forms, built-in Antivirus support, integration with backup/restore, etc.). You are likely to have much more success by taking course backups and then using the 'course reset' feature to clear out old submissions, at the end of the year.",

In fact, we went to a lot of effort to implement a repository to manage content more effectively, only for it to be replaced with assignment submissions! Files are already on a separate server.

We would not like to use the Folder / File resource as that copies the files into Moodle and bloats the Moodle size, while the original file also remains where it is and occupies space.   Our questions are: 1. Can we use the URL resource for the course in the Add Activity, to provide a URL for a file on the NAS using URL resource in Add Activity? 2. Can a URL be provided in a course to a file on the same device as the Moodle server (localhost/Moodle) using URL resource in Add Activity? Basic intention is have the document in one place only, i.e in the filing structure outside Moodle and not copied into Moodle. However, the students should have access to the document via a link.

I can understand want to restricting the size of the files to be uploaded by other users.  As an administrator, I know how to upload these files into the repository with an FTP program. In the later versions of Moodle 1.x, I was able to upload a big file through an FTP program and use it in my courses.  Currently, the only way in Moodle 2.0 I can display a large file is to place it elsewhere on the public_html side of the website and use a URL link to it.  This leaves that file very unsecure and anyone can see it on the Internet. I hope there is a way that a large file in the repository can be displayed without getting an error message.  I think the repository offers a secured way to storage files for course use.  I understand that a large file takes a longer time to display and affect server load but as the administrator that is my decision to make especially when I put them there.  I do appreciate limiting the non-administrators to a certain file size. I hope discussed my problem clearly enough.  I think Moodle 2.0 is great now that I am getting familiar with it. MJ",

Go to p age path of Site administration ► Security ► Site policies There you will find the value Maximum uploaded file size which should be set to Server Maximum. From there, go to Site administration ► Server ► PHP inf and look for the values of post_max_size and upload_max_filesize. Both should read the same, say 64MB. These limits set the upload and post values for the Moodle. If you have access to the php.ini file then you can change those values to whatever you want, but nothing too large, say 16MB to get around your current issue. That should be OK. If you do not have access to the php.ini file then you can set an override using a .htaccess file (assuming you are using an Apache Server, if you are using a IIS , then you need to set the corresponding values in the iis.ini as well. Go look at the Dark Side's knowledge base for more information on how to override settings for iis.) For .htaccess file write the terms: \n```text\nphp_value upload_max_filesize 16000000\n\n\nphp_value post_max_size 16000000\n```\n This is 16mb, but if you want it bigger then 128000000 = 128MB.

Not sure there is any moodle tool that searches 'repos' like that that also generates a link to the most recent addition so you might be looking a developing something for /local/ and of your own making. If repo is seachable via command line, a cron script that runs a scan and also dumps to an HTML file that contains only the link to the most recent.   In Moodle, that HTML file is linked to in an HTML block.    Something like that.

While waiting for this, it is easy to embed a Vimeo video using the generated embed code, into any text field in Moodle. In the chosen Moodle text field editor (for a new Page, or in a Label, in a quiz question field, a forum post text field, &c.), toggle to HTML Source mode, and paste in the embed code provided by Vimeo.  If embedding of the video is restricted, be sure to enable your embedding domain in the Vimeo privacy settings. You may wish to edit the embed code, to adjust display size &c. When toggling back to wysiwyg mode in the editor, don't despair that you see a \"Sorry, the creator of this video has not given you permission ...\" message.  Everything will be fine in the end, so it if is not fine, it is not the end.  Just Save and return to course, try the link, and all should work fine.",

Enable file system plugin and set up your local repository, say: /home/dongsheng/smaba_dir 2. mount samba host mount -t cifs -o username=xxx,password=xxx //samba_host/samba_dir /home/dongsheng/samba_dir Do number 2 before trying number 1 above. cifs is a file system ... do you have that installed on your linux server? https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-cifs-windows-share-on-linux/ So you've turned on file system repository in Moodle. In #2 above, the mount point is called \"/home/dongsheng/samba_dir\"  That's how the mount point will show in Linux.   On your system that could be just about anywhere!! and called just about whatever you like ... small case letters ... whatever makes sense to you. /home probably because /home is typically the largest partition on a server that was setup for multiple users. The 'dongsheng' was posters first name ... but see the mount command ... username= Am guessing the /samba_dir named thusly as to help admin person, ie, you, to recognize it's purpose ... 'samba'. Now in Moodle, from command line: cd /path/to/moodledata/ mkdir repository chown apache:apache repository -R (if on ubuntu/debian: www-data:www-data) chmod ugo+rwx repository -R Now for the symlink to the mount called /home/dongsheng/samba_dir cd repository ln -fs /home/dongsheng/samba_dir samba When you ls -l the repository directory now, one should see something like : lrwxrwxrwx. 1 www-data www-data ## Mon Day  2021 samba -> /home/dongsheng/samba_dir 'samba' above typically in a color Now the test from command line: cd samba nano testtextfile.txt In testtextfile.txt, just one line ... 'hope this works!'. Save the testtextfile.txt and exit nano. Since you created that file as root, chown apache:apache *.txt and chmod ugo+rwx *.txt Now do number 1 above ... in moodle. Once you have done that, go into a course and check to see if you can see that file system repo. Probably the most useful command one can learn in linux is: man (if you have the online manual installed); As root user, type: man mount [ENTER] Also: man ln (that's a lower case 'L' followed by an 'n' ... ln - make links between files/folders That should show you everything you didn't want to know about the both commands. And a reminder:   I don't know that will work for ya.  If you can see files in the repo, tinker and play a lot to see what works and what doesn't! 'SoS', Ken",

          "Text": "I apologize if this has been brought up before, I've browsed a bit and haven't found something that answers my questions clearly. My situation: I've created a Moodle that will be used by multiple teachers all teaching the same subject (sign language). Due to student privacy laws, teachers cannot have access to each other's courses, so I've created a \"top level\" course called \"Teachers Only Course\" (TOC). Teachers have access to their own individual course (live course that students are enrolled in) and they have access to the TOC (accessible only by teachers). The purpose of the TOC is for teachers to \"import\" activities that they think other teachers might benefit from. Teachers can browse through the TOC and \"import\" any activities that they want to include in their own individual courses. I've been testing it out by creating some sample activities in TOC, but right away I'm noticing a few things - 1 - The ability to add images/videos in QUIZZES is missing from 2.0 (used to be in 1.9). How can I do this in 2.0 without having to manually embed it with the HTML editor? (Teachers aren't going to be familiar with how to manually add a URL link.) 2 - When I upload a video in LESSONS it doesn't \"pop up.\" If I click on the link, it will pop up, but then (I'm guessing) it tries to load the entire file (it was an mp4 file). So I tried a flv file to see if it would stream that. Unfortunately it loads the player, but gives me an error  - can't find the file. 3 - I can't find any way to manage the files I've uploaded. I want to delete, rename, or move files around that were uploaded using LESSONS. 4 - I uploaded an flv using RESOURCES and that file plays just fine as a RESOURCE on the TOPICS screen. However, I need to put that file into a LESSON or into a QUIZ but I'm unable to do so. First, I have to rename it, then it won't play (see #2). Help? Thanks!",

If they're required to use an HTML editor to add videos/images they'll screw it up and/or freak out. 3 - Yes, I need to. I've uploaded several test videos to one lesson and want to delete the unneeded videos. In addition, I have no idea where they are stored. That's just something I'd like to know. And finally, there's a bug in Moodle (version 2.0) where if you have more than one image/video attached to a lesson, it won't play the one I selected. Example: If I have VIDEO.FLV and VIDEO.MP4 uploaded and I select VIDEO.FLV it will load VIDEO.MP4. When it does try to load ANY of the videos, they won't play. FLV returns an error, MP4 acts like it's trying to load the file (but no player pops up). I'm hoping this is all fixed in 2.03.  I've tried upgrading to 2.03, but my PHP is 5.2.15. I've contacted the admin and asked him to upgrade it to the latest version of PHP. 4 - The point is to make the files available to all of the teachers. Putting it in \"my private files\" area won't work. So I'm hoping the problem with the videos not playing in LESSONS is a bug fixed in 2.03 and the feature is added in QUIZZES (like it was before in 1.9). Also, I'm not sure if anyone is aware, but all 2.0+ versions of Moodle are now requiring PHP 5.3.3 to install, even though 2.02 and below say they'll install with 5.2.8. (Not true.)",

You're right, it IS quite simple. I was basing my previous comments on the older, much clunkier version which would have had most of the teachers using it to scream in fear. Now that I've had a chance to see the current process for embedding videos, I see that it's much improved. On another note, the videos are now loading and playing properly (at least the FLV videos, I haven't tried the MP4 yet). So I'm guessing it was a bug in 2.0. I'm off to play with 2.1... to see if I can come up with some more questions. Ha. Thanks for the help.",

Now that I am testing this I feel like I am missing something regarding permissions. The webdav documentation states that \" This repository is accessible by default to administrators, course creators, teachers, editing teachers and managers, but not to guests or students. This capability can be changed to control access to users with specific roles.\" Our workflow is such that we would upload all the files outside of moodle and link to those files within the moodle resources. We can do that, but then when logged in as a student the student cannot view it without being prompted to enter the credentials for the WebDav repository. I assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that any user with permission to upload to the webdav repository would be allowed to do so, but any user (ie students) would be able to view the image that was being called from the webdav. So for example, a teacher creates a page resource, links to an image file in the repository, saves the page. The student would access the course, click on the page resource and would see the image the teacher had placed there. Again, now the student is being asked to enter the webdav credentials when they click the page resource. Second, it seems strange that each time a user (who has permission to access the webdav) upload to that repository, they are asked for the credentials again, each time they try to contribute to the repository. I assumed by setting up the repository in the admin the credentials were exchanged and moodle handled the permission question. Hope this all makes sense--happy to answer any questions where I may not have been clear.",

That is what I wanted in those days, so as to permit the teachers to simply connect to their Moodle-Course-Directories to upload their files directly with windows-explorer or the mac-finder (bypassing the Moodle file-upload GUI) b) you can use another server as WebDav-Repository inside Moodle In both cases the servers you want to access must treat and control the users' permissions. As if you would log into dropBox, GoogleDocs, etc. someone has to set up groups and users to allow them accessing the files. In case b) Moodle has no chance of controlling the access-permissions on a third party server. And vice-versa. I wanted my teachers to be able to access their Windows-Server-Shares from Moodle or the other way round, but it is not so trivial because Active-Directory and Moodle have their own access-permissions and separate accounts. For lack of time I did not make further attempts to realize it. Moodle 2 now offers multiple-file-upload which mitigates the issue faced in Moodle 1.9 - But Moodle 2 now checks in each file into the database so that you can not simply think of accessing or uploading a file for later reference. You could set up another Moodle server to be integrated via Mnet. Mnet Moodle servers share the same user and password database.",

While it is a bummer to know that is not possible, it is nice to know so I dont continue to try to track down an impossibility. We were hoping that WebDav would help us to mimic the file handling that we had in 1.9 now that we are in 2.6, but it doesn't look to be so. Thanks again for your help though!",

I am so surprised at how hard it is to create a single mini-site (non- SCORM Captivate) so we just have one place to update and one set of files for multiple course files. I have tried Files Repository but when I point to the Multiscreen file that starts the Captivate lesson as an alias it tells me it cannot find the file. Only if I make a copy, unzip, and tell it to make the multiscreen file the main file can I get it to run. That would be oaky if I could update the zip file for any updated version of the Captivate lesson. When I try that, I get invalid JSON string error on unzipping the newly uploaded zip file. I even tried using the url of the successful copy version and doing a url resource instead of a file. I can make that work, but then I would have to have that working file someplace where all students were enrolled so they could play it in addition to the one of many courses they are officially enrolled in. Am I totally misunderstanding something about how to get a one stop to update mini site to work across multiple course copies?",

          "Text": "Hi, We've encountered an issue and would be delighted if anyone can shed some light on it. We've been using the dropbox repository for a few years now and its a real staff favorite. However some have complained in recent times about students submitting files from dropbox in the file picker. In general, most files submitted by a student will not open and contain the following text string {\"error\": \"Expected 'root' to be 'dropbox', 'sandbox', or 'auto', got u'dropbox\\\\\\\\'\"} I've experimented with this and I can reproduce this when a student uploads a file from dropbox BUT THE FILE WAS NOT IN THE PUBLIC FOLDER OR SHARED! To the student, no indication is given that they are uploading an alias and no error presents as they have access to their own dropbox folder. However the lecturer who do not have access is given the file with the text message (error). Thus assignment uploads are often invalid! I've played with this a few times and the error does not occur if the student uploads from a public directory or shared folder etc. Couple of questions 1. Can I disable the dropbox repository from students filepickers (seems like the easiest solution) 2. Is there a workaround so submissions are always stored on the server and do not point back at dropbox 3. Any other suggestions? Thanks Daniel",

But just to make sure I understand: You removed the \"filesystem\" folder from the repository folder in the moodle code directory and that is what allowed you to be able to get to \"Manage repositories\", right? But this was not the first one you removed - you went through a process of removing a repository's folder (drop box, youtube, coursefiles, etc) and then checking to see if you could get to the Manage Repositories page, right? And it wasn't until you removed the filesystem directory that you could reach that page without an error, true? The newer version of the filesystem repository - is that from the 2.4+ update? We havn't applied that update yet. We are at 2.4. Do you think updating to 2.4+ would also take care of things? Sorry to be so thick! I just don't want to misinterpret. I appreciate all help!

The instructions on this tracker item took care of my problem: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-38314 : 1) SELECT contextid FROM mdl_repository_instances WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'x' FROM mdl_context WHERE id = contextid); 2) That's the list of orphaned repositories in the site 3) DELETE FROM mdl_repository_instances WHERE contextid = xxxxx note that the 1037 should appear in the list produced by 1). My problem, by the way, was receiving a \"Can not find data record in database table context.\" error when selecting \"Manage Repositories. I could do as above and delete the filesystem repository from the server whenever I needed to access \"manage repositories\". Using WebMin, I did the following: Servers > MySQL Database Server Selected moodle_csm database (Edit Database page loads) From the \"Edit Table\" drop-down menu, selected \"mdl_repository_instances\" On the resulting \"Edit Table\" page, tick the box beside \"contextid\" Click \"view data\" button Scan the \"contextid\" column and locate the number referenced as \"xxxxx\" in the above instructions (\" WHERE contextid = 90797 \" in my case) Tick the box at the far left of that line Click \"Delete selected rows\" My understanding is that this deleted an orphaned file repository instance, which is what was causing the error. My entire debugging/ stack trace info was: Manage repositories Can not find data record in database table context. More information about this error Debug info: SELECT * FROM {context} WHERE id = ?

Since using moodle 2.2.3+ on a CentOS 1and1 Server , we are hitting problems with getting stable uploads using the FilePicker. Small uploads seem to work ok <2mb We got to a stage where <4mb files worked after applying a patch (20110317-Fix_AJAX_WWWROOT.patch) but still anything near our requirements(at least 10mb) seems to stall the upload , thus never ending). After some investigation using WireShark, it seems using a fast upload connection it gets to about 7-6mb before stalling, or showing a 500 server error(thou this error isnt shown to the moodle user using the site). Via reading other pages we have changed all our upload limits to 16mb and timeouts to more than usual. Our mod_fcgid.conf is as follows: ================================================= # This is the Apache server configuration file for providing FastCGI support # via mod_fcgid # # Documentation is available at http://fastcgi.coremail.cn/doc.htm LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so <IfModule mod_fcgid.c> <IfModule !mod_fastcgi.c> AddHandler fcgid-script fcg fcgi fpl =========================================== Also is there a way to upload without using ajax or another way using a repository.",

I'm playing around with an IOS app that lets the user (after logging in of course) select a photo or audio from their phone and upload to their private files area. Works well, except the files go into a draft files area and I can't seem to get them out (i.e., they don't show up anywhere in the normal file picker). I can find them if I turn JS off and deliberately go into the draft files area, but selecting the 'move' link does not let you move the files... 2. With JS turned off and just using a moodle 2 install normally, I can still manage and upload files to my private files. However, after uploading a file to my private files (with JS turned off), the file seems to just disappear. I can see it was uploaded, I can download it as it shows up (initially) in the list of files, but as soon as I navigate back to my private files area, it is gone and I can't find it anywhere. Bug or am I missing something? Anyone have any thoughts? Thanks for your help.",

          "Text": "This year we migrated servers and setup a new Moodle 2.3 install using a Bitnami image and after creating the new courses I've noticed that teachers cannot drag and drop into the Files box.  They get an error that they don't have permission to access the repository. Note that the box does show \"drag and drop available\" and if they manuall just do the \"Add\" and \"Browse\" for a file it works fine.  So for some reason a teacher just can't do the drag and drop method (permission error).  My administrator account does not have this problem, not even if I switch roles. Does anyone know what permission I have to check to make the drag and drop work?  Everything that seems to be related already says YES, so I'm stumped as to where the error is coming from. Now, it may be possible that there is a different over-arching permission issue as I have noticed that the Bitnami image had some weird settings (like teachers not being allowed to view a URL resource).  I fixed those issues by enabling them on the Teacher role, but for the life of me I can't find where this Drag and Drop filebox permission is set. Thanks for your time.",

It seems that now I need to indicate each single file and repeat it 50 or 100 times (or more in some cases).

This implies that 2.4.7 (we're running 2.4.6 now) needs to be installed (and the conversion script run) by 12/14/13, and if it isn't, then your Box repository integration will stop working altogether on 12/14/13. My institution is in a bit of a quandary. Our campus has an enterprise Box license, and we had to do some custom programming to enable the Moodle Box repository to seamless work with our campus Shibboleth . With the changes to the integration, we need to redo much of that code. Our campus will be starting finals in the next week (and we also have the Thanksgiving break to deal with, along with the unavailability of key staff), so we really don't want to perform an upgrade like this right now. We don't have any real time to do this upgrade until after December 14. So I just need it confirmed that the December 14 date for installing 2.4.7 and getting our Box integration is a hard deadline... that our current Box integration in 2.4.6 (using, apparently, the Box v1 API) will NOT work after 12/14/13. Could someone clarify this for me? Many thanks.... Brian",

          "Text": "Hi Brian, I answered to you on the Tracker ( MDL-42666 ), here is my answer: -- The deadline of the 14th of December has been set by Box.net, unfortunately we have no control over it. The purpose of the migration tool is to convert the file references (alias/shortcut) to true copies as the references would become unavailable after the 14th of December. If I understand correctly, not only this will be difficult for you to update before that date, but I also assume that you are not keen on converting those references to real files. The problems that we faced while creating the migration tool is that it was nearly impossible to find out what the original file was from the link we had stored for references, and thus impossible to convert them to references in the API v2. The other issue which lead us not to look into it further is that in order to have references in the API v2 you need to have a business account. We have internally decided not to support this any more. I would suggest you to look at the migration script itself (repository/boxnet/locallib.php), it should not make use of the new repository API and could become handy for you to convert the references to files before the 14th. Along with that, before the 14th you could disable the ability for the repository to import references by altering the method supported_returntypes. If so, then all your files will be available even after the 14th, but it will not be possible to import any file after the 14th. As you have a Business account, I would also suggest you to contact Box.net directly to see if they would be willing to extend a little bit their APIv1.",

If the solution is that simple, I thought of taking a shot myself. ;) The $file->delete() took me to the File API . Looking at the examples there, I imagine this naive idea could lead to a solution. A. Through SQL I dump the data of the files to be deleted to a file 'filedump.txt' in the following format: \n```text\nid,contenthash,pathnamehash,contextid,component,filearea,itemid,filepath,filename\n\n\n12345,40charconthash,40charpathhash,23456,course,legacy,0,/praktikum/,FlipFlop_Loesung.pdf\n```\n B. Iterate though the list and dissect the (comma-separated) fields: $fs = get_file_storage(); foreach(file(\"filedump.txt\") as $fileline) { $fieldlist = explode(',', $fileline); // Block \"delete file\" } C. Block \"delete file\" \n```text\n// Prepare file record object\n\n\n$fileinfo = array(\n\n\n    'component' => ???,\n\n\n    'filearea' => ???',\n\n\n    'itemid' => ???,\n\n\n    'contextid' => ???,\n\n\n    'filepath' => ???, \n\n\n    'filename' => ???);\n\n\n\n\n// Get file\n\n\n$file = $fs->get_file($fileinfo['contextid'],\n\n\n                      $fileinfo['component'],\n\n\n                      $fileinfo['filearea'],\n\n\n                      $fileinfo['itemid'],\n\n\n                      $fileinfo['filepath'],\n\n\n                      $fileinfo['filename']);\n\n\n\n\n// Delete it if it exists\n\n\nif ($file) {\n\n\n    $file->delete();\n\n\n}\n```\n Yet to figure out what those ??? are; something $fileline[i], I guess. Another question is, do I need all that $fileinfo in the fs->getfile?",

          "Text": "Hi Simon, We have been testing the OneDrive Repo recently and have found the exact same issue (and confirmed with Microsoft) when using \"Access Controlled Links\". Our host provided this explanation, we may be going back to them soon to see if any development work is possible to solve, as Microsoft themselves don't appear too interested in supporting any of their own plugins for Moodle: ______________________________________________________ SNIP________ The error you have noticed is directly caused by uploading a sizeable file and the curl (data transfer protocol) process exceeds the php execution timeout default of 30 seconds. The particular logic of this is detailed here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-1.0 , but the relevant detail states: Upload bytes to the upload session To upload the file, or a portion of the file, your app makes a PUT request to the uploadUrl value received in the createUploadSession response. You can upload the entire file, or split the file into multiple byte ranges, as long as the maximum bytes in any given request is less than 60 MiB. The fragments of the file must be uploaded sequentially in order. Uploading fragments out of order will result in an error. Note: If your app splits a file into multiple byte ranges, the size of each byte range MUST be a multiple of 320 KiB (327,680 bytes). Using a fragment size that does not divide evenly by 320 KiB will result in errors committing some files. Large files are liable to not meet these requirements. Previous efforts with another client to bump the default time window up also did not work because you cannot increase the php timeout on various location/functions and have it take any effect that matters with this kind of problem. The support tech that worked that case also mentioned this: The Curl call request is made from the lib/filelib.php script (\"function request\") and the script encounters the php execution timeout before the Curl request can send a response back... The response is then interpreted as empty hence the exception error In other words,  the large amount of data being sent is timing out before the destination can send back receipt confirmation of said data. This appears to be a somewhat unavoidable issue when uploading large data files via this method to OneDrive. ____________________________________END SNIP____________________ Hope that helps. Cheers, Rob.",

If you know how to do that, or are happy to try, then this page tells you what to do. https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/php/using-php.ini-directives/php-maximum-execution-time If you are not interested in doing that personally, and your site is hosted, I think you could just ask your hosting company support to do that for you. (EDIT: I see you are running xamp on windows. So you will need to do it yourself.) If you need to check your PHP settings, Moodle provides a handy page that displays the phpinfo() That is at site admin -> server ->php info",

My understanding is that it hasn't been implemented - i.e. there's *no way* to refresh the file in Moodle after it changes in the repository. This was always intended to be a feature of the Repository system for 2.0, I just don't think it was built/finished. Myles",

I'm currently on 2.6 I see that \"When an uploaded file - or a file from the Private files, Dropbox, File system or EQUELLA repositories - is re-used elsewhere on Moodle, the teacher has the option to make a copy (a new, unconnected version) or to create a shortcut or alias .\" But where in that process can you mark that as alias? So for example: (all done while logged in a system admin) I create a template course. Text files linked within page resources are created in the template. I then create a identical derivative course via backup/restore. Then in the template course, update a file (text file in a page resource for example) and that file is not changed in the derivative  course. Based on my \"old moodle\" way of understanding files this seems to work exactly as I would anticipate--the copies are not connected so a change in one is not a change in the other. But--It seems like somewhere along the way I should have been able to mark the files as shortcuts or aliases so they remain connected. I never saw that option... I think I am just missing a key piece to understanding how this feature is used and how to roll out changes to connected courses... Thanks!",

It seems to me (and I'd love to hear from others if I am misinterpreting) that most institutions are either using file storage external to Moodle, like you are with Google Apps for Ed, or are still relying on legacy files/\"1.9 way\" of file handling.

          "Text": "Hi all, I have scoured the forums/documentation and found some similar issues but nothing that quite matches this. I'm really hoping there's an expert kicking around that knows what might be going on here... We recently upgraded to 2.6 in August. We have one very large site that uses the Book module that was initially created years ago using 1.9. Within this Book module are pages that contain various links to external HTML pages that contain more embedded html files and images.  The instructor had most of the content already prepared before he started using Moodle so this is why he chose to simply upload the existing HTML files and related embedded files/images.  It all worked fine in 1.9 with the course file structure. Since our most recent upgrade the links to all the external HTML pages in legacy files broke.  In the place of the file that was supposed to appear was the code from a php file which appeared to be a script to fetch legacy course files... I manually re-linked the files  by editing the book module page and used the file picker and navigated to Legacy Files which is enabled in the course.  The re-linking worked fine but none of the embedded images/files are displaying in the pages. I'm not sure what I'm missing here - what could have changed/broken this and how can I go about fixing all the missing embedded images and pages?  If there is a way... Thanks in advance for any help.",

          "Text": "Thanks Derek - I'll check out that issue ... Yes, I've tried various things to troubleshoot this including re-linking the files not using legacy files - the problem is - I have linked to HTML files in the pages of the book module and these HTML files contain embedded images and other HTML files.  It's these embedded images and files that are now broken. I believe the process of trying to re-link the initial HTML page broke the internal embedded links however that page had to be re-linked somehow as it was generating an error - or not so much an error but it displayed the actual PHP code for calling legacy files rather than the actual file itself.  I figured re-linking would just fix this up but I was wrong.  I think I need to go back a step so the original linked HTML file uses the old technology looking at legacy files and do not re-link using file picker, but I'm not sure how to do this. OR, I need to re-create all the link references in the HTML files but I don't know how to.... meaning I don't know what path to put in the file since there is no longer a direct path to the embedded files.  I thought using legacy files provided the ability to do this? Maybe this is a flaw with the Book module?  Or maybe I'm just missing something really simple.... I hope for the latter and that someone recognizes this and enlightens me!  If I haven't already confused the heck out of those who are reading this...",

Is there any way we can make sure Moodle is not making a copy of this file and storing it in the filedir directory? Is this how Dropbox works in Moodle as a repository? Thanks in advance.",

As a summary of what I have done - which may help any other lost souls reading these posts My goal is to create an upload / download area for students who transfer work between school and home. I specifically do not want it to be a file sharing area. I added the link for DMS to the courses list, and I specifically didn't want any guests to see the link. In moodle/blocks/course_list/block_course_list.php after the line $this->content->footer = ''; I added the following #Hack for dms if (!isguest()) { $this->content->items[] = '<a href=\"'.$CFG-> wwwroot .'/dms/index.php?from=course&amp;id='.$this->course->id.'&amp;target=personal\">'.get_string('DMS').'</a>'; $this->content->icons[] = '<img src=\"'.$CFG->wwwroot.'/dms/images/icon_newfolder.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" alt=\"\" />'; } I also added $string['DMS'] = 'DMS' ; to moodle/lang/en/moodle.php I modified both dms/folder.php and dms/document.php by adding the test isadmin() around the line that displays the administration link. if(isadmin()){ $options[] = $document->create_link(NULL, 'op=admin', '<img src=\"'.$settings->_httpRoot.'images/icon_admin.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"menu\" />'.Lang::get('administration')); } In dms/folder.php I have also hidden the search tab from all but the admin by if(isadmin()) { $tabs['search'] = '<a href=\"search.php?folder='.$folder->getid().'\">'.Lang::get('search').'</a>'; } the above could be isteacher() for admin and teacher access I note that a guest user can still find the dms by adding dms/index.php? to the url once they have guest access to the site. However as Admin I changed the access rights for the guest account. I didn't actually delete the guest account because it would be created again when/if I need to run /dms/setup.php to add more users. These are the changes I have made so far, more to come especially with regard to the file types that can be uploaded. Bill",

Once the new windows opens and the \"File Download - Security Warning\" dialog box appears, select the Open button; the dialog box will dissappear and nothing else will happen. 3. Click on the Address bar of the IE. 4. And Press Enter. Voilà! The video will now fully display on the Window. Cheers!",

          "Title": "Moving course images to S3",
          "Text": "Some background - I started out with the goal of moving my moodle hosting to AWS, but came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical until Moodle can natively store files like the course backups to S3. Instead I decided to speed up my site by moving as many of the static files as I could to S3 - primarily the course images, but also the site logo, some static js and so on. The files are readable by the world on S3 (if they know the URL ), so I only moved content which I don't mind anyone accessing. Also, I have been using moodle for 10 years (since v1.5), with courses which have been cloned as new courses year after year, resulting in lots of old obsolete legacy files that I just don't need clogging up the course backups, and making my moodledata directory unnecessarily large. So, I wrote some code that looks through all of the lessons in a course, reads both legacy and new style images, pushes them to S3, and updates the course to point to the new location. It allows you to delete the old files after that is done - either fully deleting them if they are only in use by that course, or just unlinking then from the course if they are in use elsewhere. The net result for me is that page load time for the entire course (I have a bespoke printable page that shows me the entire course) is down from a typical full load time of 30s to 6s. 5s of the 6s is pulling together all of the lessons and assessment in to one page, so the image load time is down from 25s to 1s. The size of the backup of each course is down from about 10MB to about 100kB. And the daily cost of the S3 storage and serving up the files is a few cents. In short, it's a massive win for us. I have attached my code in case anyone else finds this useful. To use it, you need to enter your account details against the S3 repository plugin. You'll also need to edit the code to enter your bucket name at line 78. Upload the aws library to your site from http://pear.amazonwebservices.com/get/aws.phar . I put both in a local plugin directory. Then you just call the file passing the parameter id=course number, e.g. http://www.mysite.com/local/myplugin/course_images_s3.php?id=123 . Once the images have been moved, you can press the Delete button at the bottom of the screen. You'll need course update privileges to do all of the this. The actual screen is messy - no navigation and so on. It's just something I wrote to get the job done for the way I use my site. However, it's robust, and anyone is free to use it as it, or make it better if they want. I'm sharing it in case anyone wants to do somthing similar - it might just save you a few days work. If you find it useful, let me know. Thanks Martin",

          "Text": "Hi Thom, Yes, I only serve static files from S3. I host moodle itself on a regular LAMP server elsewhere. S3 is not a php engine - it's only designed for serving static content. If you want to run php, you need to use EC2 instances. However I didn't do that for some of the reasons that it looks like you are also concerned about. I believe that to take true advantage of AWS, you would want to run moodle on an elastic beanstalk cluster. But that prevents you from mounting any permanent drive storage to more than one instance at a time, but EBS will expand to run on multiple instances - a big problem meaning that your regular upload data has no home. Until someone re-writes the code that maintains moodledata to allow it to write to something other than the file system, I don't think that elastic beanstalk is suitable for moodle hosting. I didn't do anything with student uploads because my courses don't allow student uploads, so I had no need for it. I'm not even familiar enough with the nuances of student uploads to try and go near that I'm afraid! Martin",

          "Text": "You are right, the moment you edit an activity, you get the course context and not the module context. I struggled with the same problem when creating the repository_s3bucket plugin. First I thought it had something to do with copying all files to the user context when you start editing, but the reason is more simple: there are no repository instances in a module context. You can create them globally, in a category or in a course, but not inside a module. You could add an extra module context parameter to your constructor, but this will be tricky when you create a new module (I doubt when the module context is created, when creating a new module or when saving the new module).",
