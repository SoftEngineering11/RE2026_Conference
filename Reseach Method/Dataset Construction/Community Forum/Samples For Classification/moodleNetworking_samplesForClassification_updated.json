          "Title": "Important changes in the upcoming Moodle 5.0",
          "Text": "To all As we are rapidly approaching the release of Moodle 5.0 we wanted to ensure that you, our community, are well informed about the major changes outside new functionality that may impact the work you need to do prior to upgrading. As you will be aware with the change to the version numbering that was announced approximately 12 months ago ( https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=457946 ) the start of each new series (the X.0 version) will be when final deprecations will be occurring, and when we will be making other big changes to Moodle.  The rationale and benefits for this change are detailed in the linked announcement, so please take the time to review it. All of the changes listed here have previously been announced. We are collecting them into one communication summary ahead of the release to help increase awareness and aid you in planning your upgrades. Plugins A number of plugins have been removed in Moodle 5.0.  These plugins will be available either in the Moodle HQ github for those who wish to continue to use them, or if they are adopted by a maintainer, in the Plugins directory .  Specific details can be found in the listed tracker issues. Please note that if these plugins are not reinstalled before completing the upgrade process the data tables will be removed as part of the upgrade process.  These plugins are: MDL-82457 - Chat (mod_chat) MDL-82457 - Survey (mod_survey) MDL-78778 - CAS Authentication (auth_cas) MDL-77005 - Atto editor and its sub-plugins (editor_atto) MDL-84652 - MNET plugins (auth_mnet, block_mnet_hosts, enrol_mnet, mnetservice_enrol, portfolio_mahara) Oracle Database support  ( MDL-80166 ) Oracle Database support has been removed from Moodle 5.0 and community members who are currently using Oracle will need to migrate their database to a supported system before upgrading.  This decision was made due to the lack of ongoing support for Oracle in PHP and the very low usage of the platform within the Moodle community, Oracle has not been a recommended platform since prior to Moodle 3.0. Course formats ( MDL-83527 ) With the work being done to modernise the Moodle course look and feel, support for some legacy course formats libraries will be deprecated in Moodle 5.0.  All course formats that still depend on libraries from Moodle 3.11 and prior will be deprecated, this is primarily to remove the use of YUI from Moodle but also to allow the code to be cleaned up and made more maintainable for the future. From Moodle 6.0 the deprecated libraries will be completely removed.  Details from migrating a course format from the 3.11 libraries can be found in the dev docs . Bootstrap 5 ( MDL-71979 ) Moodle 5.0 will be the first version of Moodle to use Bootstrap 5.  This is a big change but a lot of work has been put into making this as seamless as possible.  The team has invested in creating a compatibility later between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 to ease the transition, however the complexity of this change will mean for many with custom themes and other customisations that it is recommended that these are checked prior to upgrading.  The dev docs provide guidance on the major changes between Bootstrap 4 and 5 and how to migrate between them. Quiz and Question Bank ( MDL-68806 and MDL-71378 ) There has been considerable work in improving the functionality of Quiz question banks to simplify management and sharing of questions within Moodle.  This is a major change in functionality and as a result if question bank sharing is commonly used at a Category or System level please ensure that you fully understand the impact to your processes before upgrading.  Documentation is currently in the process of being created and will be available close to the time of release. Additionally a new option has been created that allows institutions to pre-create quiz attempts before the student commences the quiz.  This has been designed to help mitigate database loads when Moodle is used for large scale synchronous exams.  Use of this is optional and needs to be enabled in the administration settings, however if it is enabled this will affect events appearing in the logs and potentially other reporting that utilises data from the quiz attempt tables. MimeTex removal MimeTex is being removed as an option for TeX filters.  The underlying 3rd party library that is used was added as a fall back option if other TeX filter options were not available, the library has not been maintained for an extremely long time and as a result is becoming a security and stability concern.  If your installation uses TeX filters please ensure that an alternative such as MathJax, LaTeX, or another is installed to ensure the proper functionality is maintained. Final deprecation policy update Finally a reminder that there will been a small update to the deprecation policy ( https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation#step-2-final-deprecation ) in the coming weeks clarifying the retention of the method signature.  This will be important to be aware of moving forward.  As always please check the release notes when they are available to see a full list of final deprecations in this release. Thank you in advance for your continued support and happy Moodling! The Moodle Products Team",

I followed Mnet documentation at https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/MNet . At some point 2.2.1 it says: \"1. On both, go to Site administration > Plugins > Enrolments > Manage enrol plugins and enable the Mnet remote enrolments plugin (click Save). Click on 'Edit' and enable 'allow_allcourses' or select some courses or categories to be remotely enrolled.\" First of all, when enabling the plugin it is automatically save. The second thing, which is more important \"Click on 'Edit' and enable 'allow_allcourses', this does not appear to be anywhere, I looked at different places including permissions, but could not find it. On the other hand, after adding the enrollment method to a course, I could not see anything under \"Remote enrolments client\".",

But, if you wish to purse ... on Moodle A, turn on debugging.  Also check your web services error logs. MNet had two issues that constantly had to be monitored and corrected if they went south ... 1. the certificates generated by each Moodle had to be exchanged with the other Moodles in the  MNet.  Had to regen them and copy and paste the certs from the two MNet servers not talking. 2. MNet was very sensitive about operating system time clocks ... so MNet servers had to be set to use NTP servers so MNet servers clocks would be sync'd.   Could not be more than 5 minutes difference, if I re-call correctly.    This part not so bad once set. Also, if I re-call correctly, an MNet course had trouble exchanging user data ... Moodle A linked to Moodle B course and Moodle B had a quiz ... data from the Moodle B quiz had issues getting back to Moodle A data.   Never resolved. 'SoS', Ken",

I'd like to know, is it possible to unenrol students from the second VLE through the second VLE's CMS? It doesn't seem possible to unenrol students, or edit their profiles. Can this be done, or will it all need controlling from the Master VLE? 2) When using remote enrolments, I'd like to enrol using different permission /role types. At the moment, the settings only seem to let me have one MNet enrolment method, setup to assign all users that are enrolled with a preselected role (e.g. student). I would like to enrol most users as students, but sometimes set them as teachers. Can this be done? Thanks",

If anyone is willing to help me, I would be prepared to re-write the documentation on MHub to make it easier for others to do this too. The effect of other options and situations on MNet functionality are, for me at least, unclear. Take the following situation for example: I have an MNet hub set up and \"Moodle-A\" as a peer. If I have \"Email-based self-registration\" enabled and \"MNet authentication\" I would expect that registering a new user on Moodle-A would actually put their registration data on the MNet Hub. But it doesn't - the user only exists on the Moodle-A server . Another situation: I have an MNet Hub and Moodle-A and Moodle-B set up as peers. Mary is allowed to access Moodle-A and Moodle-B. John is only allowed to access Moodle-A. I don't see how MNet Hub allows me to authorise access in this manner. Some of the documentation I found seems to imply that perhaps a course needs to be available on the peer Moodles before peer-specific access can be applied. It is also unclear what, if any, other choices (such as location of the moodledata directory, MySQL database , etc.) might effect successful operation on MNet. Drop me a line here if you are willing to help me tackle this - I am sure there will be plenty of users who would be happy to have a clearer explanation of MNet too. Thanks!",

This means that a record will appear in your hosts list for any MNet site that connects to you and requests your public key.\". This when promiscuous mode is turn on. This is comfirmed in the MoodelDocs page https://docs.moodle.org/22/en/MNet doc . I follow this doc for my tests. In fact, in my test this is not OK, I observe that folowing. After turn on the promiscuous mode on the Moodle \"hub\", I add the Moodle \"hub\" in the \"Manage peers\" page of the Moodle \"client\". This connecting is OK, but the Moodle \"client\" don't appears automatically in the hosts list of the Moodle \"hub\". To the Moodle \"client\" appears in the hosts list of the Moodle \"hub\",  the Moodle \"client\" must be added manually in the Moodle \"hub\". After this manual adding, all is OK : the services selected in All Hosts on the Moodle \"hub\" are actived for the Moodle \"client\". I've a big doubt about this because my tests don't go in the direction that I undersand in the MoodleDocs and the text in the \"Manage Peers\" page of administration in Moodle. I'm tacker of some informations about this. Best regards, Jacques.",

All existing users will be transferred to the main-site and we will have several remote-sites, with single-sign on. the goal of this project is to provide one login for multiple moodle-sites we offer. Is there a best practice method how to convert local users to remote users, so that the new remote account is mapped to the local account, that means, that the remote account should replace the local account on the site, but keep all course subscriptions, etc. available. Or would it be possible to write a script? Perhaps a hint how to start for such a script would be nice. Is it possible to replace just all the user ids associated with courses, etc? Could there be any problems doing such a mysql query? Any help is greatly appreciated. Best regards, David",

          "Text": "Definitely avoid changing user ids in your databases. It is used as a foreign key almost everywhere and you would face serious issues probably. What should work is the following procedure: Let us assume you have Moodle A and Moodle B sites right now with their current users, courses and such. Make sure you have backups so if anything goes wrong, you would not blame me too much. The first thing to do is to set up the Moodle C that is to become the home server of all your users and the entry portal into your MNet network. Create an empy course at Moodle A and enroll all users into it. Backup it and restore it at Moodle C. This should re-create all user profiles at Moodle C. Repeat the same for Moodle B. Now all your users from both A and B should have their account at C, too. Set up MNet between A and C (Moodle C to become SSO Identity Provider, Moodle A to become SSO Service Provider) and between B and C, respectively. In the database of Moodle A, a new MNet host record should be now created in the table \"mnet_host\" for the remote site C. You need to get know its ID. For all users at server A that should become remote users, update their records in the table \"user\" and set \"mnethostid\" column to the ID from the previous step. Also set their \"auth\" column to \"mnet\". Repeat 4. and 5. at Moodle B, respectively. I must admit I never did it personally but as far as I know, this should be enough to do. In MNet environment, users are identified by the combination of \"username\" and \"mnethostid\". Users' username should retain unchanged during the restore so you just need to set their mnethostid correctly. Let us know how it goes. And best luck.",

Server C - Main server, Server A and B: future MNET hosts. Some thoughts before testing ist: Instead of restoring courses with all users from A and B on C, we could use a csv-file. Then there would be more possibilities of controling how users are created / updated on C. Some persons already created accounts on C and B and A, so there could be overlapping accounts. And there is also a possibility that existing usernames on C are identical to A and/or B. The usernames could belong to the same real person, but could also belong to two different persons. That could be a risk to acquire a wrong identity. (We still have to evaluate if this risk is OK for us and how to proceed with identical usernames. A possibility is to only match users with identical username AND email) For step 5: I think this could be done with a csv file too. According to http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Upload_users the csv fields can contain an auth column, but mnethostid column is not mentioned, so updating mnethostid via csv has to be tested and is not guaranteed to work according to the moodle docs . In case it does not work, a my sql query should do it. I will let you know how the tests worked out. Best regards, David",

In fact, if you have a no identical users on the two platforms to merge, the workflof described by David works perfectly. We did tests and replacing the mnetuserid with the host changes the user to a remote user. I thought this could be done with csv files. But uploading a csv file with mnethostid is not supported. So you have to do this step with a SQL-query that looks similar to this one UPDATE mdl_user SET auth='mnet', mnethostid=mnethostidgoeshere WHERE msn='changetomnet' (You have to be careful in this step: Do not change admins mnethostid!!) We marked all users that are to be changed to remote users in the msn field with \"changetomnet\". None of our users used the msn profile field, so for reasons of simplicity we decided to use the msn profile field (we downloaded all users as csv, then uploaded a csv file with the msn field set to \"changetomnet\" for users that should be mnet users), if your users use msn profile field, then do not do this, you could setup a custom user profile field, but the SQL query would be more complicated. We have a more complexe situation because, the platforms we are merging have also identical users (some users are identical on A and B and C). So we find out first who are identical,... For any further questions just contact me again. Best regards, David",

Right now, there are one moodle instance per academic program -actually, 29-, so I think there's a lot of work and the administration becomes tedious and I think it's impractical, because one user -admin, student or teacher- have to log in with different -even being the same username and password- credentials to different moodle instances. So, I've read about MNet and I've came up with a idea which I describe next: I think that implementing a central moodle -moodle A- that act as the main moodle where the main information is displayed and where all the users of the university will have their credentials stored. The idea is that this moodle A won't have any academic courses. A moodle B, moodle C and moodle D will correspond to one faculty respectively -for example, Health, Science and Engineering-. This ones are the moodles that will have the active academic courses and where the users will be enrolled in via MNet and SSO. The enrolment method to be used is the External Database to keep our students synchronized with their courses. Would be any difficulty with this approach? I'd appreciate any help, suggestions or best practices recomendations. Thanks very much in advance!",

          "Text": "We are using a moodle XAMPP installation on Windows 2008 for our credentials forwarding server for Moodle A. This is within our DMZ. We're Moodle version 2.5.2 for Moodle A. We have our learning content on Moodle B which is in the cloud on a Linux server. We have firewall ports open on 80 and 443 in both directions for communication between Moodle A and Moodle B. LDAP authentification is working just fine on Moodle A. We've had single signon working ok with users logging onto Moodle A then getting to courses on Moodle B. Then it stopped working with users getting an MNET timeout error:- \"Ooops! Your MNET communication has failed! Here's that error message to pass on to your administrator: connect() timed out!ERROR 28: 28:connect() timed out!\" Some users get the 'page can't be displayed' instead of the MNET timeout error. Then it started working again - it wasn't clear why. Then it stopped working again. And it started working and stopped.... alternating over a period of three weeks. Our supplier for Moodle B in the cloud has a number of customers using a similar credentials-forwarding configuration without problems, but they are all using LAMPP (Linux) for their Moodle A. We're the only customer with these problems. We find that on Moodle B we have to paste in the public key for the Moodle A peer, it doesn't pick it up automatically. We get a message on the peer page that the public key doesn't match the one on moodle A and the public key for Moodle A is reported as being blank: \"The public key you are holding for this host is different from the public key it is currently publishing. The current public key is: <BLANK>\" However in spite of the above error message we find users can still logon to Moodle A and get to content on Moodle B SOME OF THE TIME. Is anyone aware of similar MNET issues for the windows platform? If so is there a resolution to these problems? Any ideas at all out there? If you were me would you throw away Windows Moodle A and start over again with a Linux/LAMPP Moodle A? Thanks for your attention so far.",

The Moodle ‘in the cloud’ (i.e., remotely hosted) is it in the same time zone?  Is your Mooble B operating system time clock on an NTP service? Have you turned on debugging to see if there is anything more reported? Begin opinion ... This might start an OS war … but … so be it … MS has extended the life of server 2008 (just last year) so you will be looking at moving upwards soon (and shelling out some more $). Moving to a long term supported version of Linux (Ubuntu Server LTS or CentOS 6.5) means $0 … no more cals, licenses, extra ‘taxes’.  Will provider of service also provide remote support for your Moodle? Then again, it might mean a learning curve for system admin … I understand that … but, if one looks at the tech world globally … there’s more *nix’s (or at least based on *nix) out there than ever before … iOS, MacOSX, Android, Chromebooks, etc..  Don’t know how one can ‘avoid’ them!!!  Administering a Linux server, BTW , isn't all that difficult and there is tons of free support forums/blogs etc. to help.  Just have to be willing to learn and work a little. ... end opinion. Again, what does the provider say/recommend? And a question for the future of whatever remote resources using ... is provider looking at LTI ? 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

To get them to talk to each other, we deleted the public key on B. A new one was created and shortly afterwards it attempted a keyswap with server A. When that happens, our server (A) will respond with the following message: \n```text\n<?\nxml\n version=\"1.0\"?>\n```\n \n```text\n<methodResponse>\n```\n \n```text\n   <fault>\n```\n \n```text\n      <value>\n```\n \n```text\n         <struct>\n```\n \n```text\n            <member>\n```\n \n```text\n               <name>faultCode</name>\n```\n \n```text\n               <value><int>0</int></value>\n```\n \n```text\n            </member>\n```\n \n```text\n            <member>\n```\n \n```text\n               <name>faultString</name>\n```\n \n```text\n               <value><string>Sorry, but that hostname (0) could not be resolved!</string></value>\n```\n \n```text\n            </member>\n```\n \n```text\n         </struct>\n```\n \n```text\n      </value>\n```\n \n```text\n   </fault>\n```\n \n```text\n</methodResponse>\n```\n Based on some of the suggestions at https://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=4584 I added some debug statements to the bootstrap function in moodle\\mnet\\peer.php. I print the value of the $ wwwroot argument on entry into that function and again after the set_wwwroot function call. In both cases the output value is 0. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the result of the call to mnet_get_hostname_from_uri is also 0. We believe that this is the reason that the UI on server B (under Site Administration >Networking > Peers) says that the currently published public key for server A is <empty string>. I’m going to follow the chain of function calls backwards but whilst I do that, does anyone have any idea what the problem might be? Kevin Note: It’s worth reiterating that after a period of not talking to each other, the two servers will establish a trust relationship and the system will function normally (exchanging encrypted messages) for a while but will eventually fall out of sync again.",

Our Moodle server (the Windows server which is handling the auth) can resolve the names of the other Moodle server as well as itself. I've verified this by flushing the DNS records and doing nslookups on both FQDNs. FYI , our server is using Google public DNS. I have no idea about the remote server but it's our server that's reporting the resolution problem. It can certainly resolve our FQDN as it sends requests to us. I think the problem might be deeper than DNS resolution as peer.php (which is throwing the exception) is trying to parse and resolve a $wwwroot value of 0.

It's been the bane that we over multi Moodle/Mahara sites  need to preserve and transfer the student intact. So to speak. On the mahara side I replaced 2 files the register.php and lostpass.php with custom files that redirect to the Moodle login or register. Because I am lazy I left the Mahara Login box, need to fiddle with the themes to do that. To make the whole thing a little more rounded I use a WP machine as a launch pad.  Sorta MOOCS in a slightly structured way.",

I could guess that the load balancer is a SW one ( Apache , HA Proxy, Pound, Nginx, <whatever>) and the nodes behind the balancer are on a private subnet while the public IPs of both the farms, Moodle and Mahara, are VIP owned by the load balancer being clustered for HA i.e. the two Application Clusters (farms) are sharing the same load balancing infrastructure. Under this context , it could be possible that, when the two farms talk each other, - being their traffic managed through the same balancer - the request is sent to the VIP as expected but the balancer replies on the public network and the backend nodes could not receive it because of e.g. you're NATting the traffic of the single nodes in both farms. To test it try to make a wget call from an external network as well as to create an MNET connection between a Moodle instance on a server having a public IP address and your clustered Moodle or Mahara: if it will work, add a static route on the farm nodes to correct the issue.

          "Title": "Syncing user profiles and bulk remote enrolment via MNET",
          "Text": "Hi, we are using MNET as single sign on solution for 5 moodle sites. We have got one MNET master site with local users (let's call it #1) and 5 (#2 to #6) remote moodle sites, that all are SSO with #1. We have to subscribe users regularly to courses from #1 to the other remote instances. The problem: Even if we create cohorts, or profile fields with keywords, so that these users can be selected via a search for bulk enrolment, the actual enrolments do not support cohorts and searching for special profile attributes. We did a workaround: Give the users a \"second\" first name (csv upload -> change user profiles), then search for that firstname, enrol all the users with that second firstname, change the user profiles back to their normal firstname. Disadvantage: On the remote sites, the profile stays with the fictional second firstname (ex: David Remoteuser Bogner) until the specific users logs on to the remote site. So we want to have either (what would be easier to create as local plugin) search for cohorts and/or custom user profile fields for bulk enrolment user syncing with the remote moodle sites. Has anyone an advice how to proceed? Best regards, David",

I am talking to two other companies, both seem to be looking for moodle customers and seem to be a bit more \"value added\" in their approach.  Both see willing to work with clients.  Interestingly, both will offer you a Moodle support as a separate package.  With that scenario, you can host one place and buy moodle support from them. One company is eClass4Learning and the other company is Paradiso Solutions.  I don't have any direct experience with either but as I said, both seem willing to accommodate your needs.",

          "Title": "Transmitting custom fields through a MNET jump",
          "Text": "Hi All, Here is a small solution that allows transmitting custom profile fields of a roaming user. We focus here a uniform MNET implementation in which nodes are belonging to the same operator and replicate all or part of the custom fields added to the user profile. This can also be of some use for networks in which administrators agree on some field semantics. Basically we consider that the shortname of the field mostly defines a rough semantic group that makes possibility of transfer consistant in a majoprity of cases. The following solution DOES NOT provides optionality switching, wich might be a better choice in the general case. The solution is quite simple and needs only reconsidering two segments of the auth/mnet/auth.php library. The principle is that we add provision to the user_authorise XML -RPC call for collecting user custom values, and aggregated them to the transmitted user profile as profile_field_<fieldname> addtional params. At the other end (confirm_mnet_session()), we capture those fields and try to detect a matching semantic in the landing platform (based on matching shortname, though ignoring category concerns). If a field is know with that name, that most probably induces semantic should match, we transfer the value to the localuser profile and update (or insert) a field data adequately. In user_authorize(...) (auth/mnet/auth.php) if (!empty($user->picture)) { $imagefile = make_user_directory($user->id, true) . \"/f1.jpg\"; if (file_exists($imagefile)) { $userdata['imagehash'] = sha1(file_get_contents($imagefile)); } } /// get user's custom fields and aggregate them to the user profile $ sql = \" SELECT f.shortname, d.data FROM $userdata['myhosts'] = array(); if($courses = get_my_courses($user->id, 'id', 'id, visible')) { $userdata['myhosts'][] = array('name'=> $SITE->shortname, 'url' => $CFG-> wwwroot , 'count' => count($courses)); } In confirm_mnet_session(...)

Within Moodle 2.1 there will be a link which will SSO them to Mahara 1.4 (e-portfolio, PDP system). But! There is a problem with this linear style setup, there is a limitation on remote users bouncing from one system to another then to another. Ive read through this post: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=108982 but can't find the code to overcome the bounce limitation. Has anyone else worked around this as we need this linear style as certain elements in Moodle 2.1 will be used as part of their PDPs, which will be exported to Mahara using the new export feature?

The extranet has also an MNET link to Mahara and works quite well but not what I would have liked. We have started our plans for the 2012-2013 academic year and will keep an eye on Martyn's annoucement of removing MNET for Moodle 2.3 next June ( http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=175158 ). Also, with the new feature of Multi-tenancy ( MDL-28946 ) for Moodle 2.3, which would possibly assist us with our 8 Moodle installs and maybe our VLE/extranet setup next year. Also, we stll do not have some form of authentication for the students logging in, which is out of my hands at the moment, but hopefully we will for next year.

When we try to set up the link to the other school, my server retrieves the public key from them fine, but they can not get my key. If I email my key over and they paste it in, then Networking runs fine... Anyone have any clue as to what might be stopping the key getting through? We can both retrieve files from each others server using wget without any issues?

However, in Moodle, when I walk through the mahoodle setup steps I get to the point where I setup the peer under networking.  I put in the proper www root for the mahara instance (with a trailing / like this: http://mydomain.org/mahara/ ).  I tried it the other way without the / and got the same results. It seems to pull up the proper key for the mahara instance but below it gives me this message: \" The public key you are holding for this host is different from the public key it is currently publishing. The currently published key is:\" Then there is no key at all listed.  Any ideas.  I don't see anything like this in the forums.  I know this is probably unusual to network two instances on the same server (same IP address and everything) but it seems to make sense in this setting, as the server has enough resources to run them both.",

Not sure if it is moodle's fault for having a block point to the wrong place or if it is mahara's for not having the directory there that moodle's networked server block points to or mine for not knowing where to fix where it points.  At any rate it works for now.

Let's say the local system is Moodle A The internet-accessible system is Moodle B Both are in two completely seperate domains (physically and otherwise). On Moodle A, we have URLs which are pointing to content on Moodle B. I want some sort of authentication method/communication method such that if a user on Moodle A logs in using his Moodle A credentials, and he clicks on any such URL which is pointing to content on Moodle B, he should not have to login to Moodle B. And the content should be accessible to him. This could be a behind-the-scenes login, or (the closest that I have seen to work in theory) is MNet. However, with MNet, the major issue is that I am not able to get Moodle B to communicate back with Moodle A, because Moodle A is only accessible locally. I hope that makes sense. Any help in this regard would be really appreciated. Thanks. Regards, Ali",

We required this feature, so our only recourse was to expand the LDAP context to allow the user to natively log in to the various Moodle instances.  This causes all sorts of duplicate user issues where we get username1(native user), username2(Mnet user), etc. where the users are actually the same. If, for example, you use a central Mahara instance, those various users are treated as separate despite being one and the same.",

          "Text": "Hi all, We are planning to use Moodle Network on our University... but after making some tests I came up with some, let' say, design problems. I would really appreciate if you could give me some  advices. We wanted to enable users to roam to different moodles from different faculties and we also wanted that they wouldn't have to know in which moodle reside their courses to access them...let's say, some student has a biology course in moodle A, a maths course in moodle B and a geography course in moodle C. That student logs into moodle A and he should see the 3 courses in mycourses block (and be able to access them, of course). Users, courses and course enrollments are made automatically in moodle A, B and C. (we have information system records integration)...so, no need to create new users records... I wonder if someone is using MNET with a similar scenario, and if yes do you have any design advice? --- I made some experiments (only with 2 moodles) and I noticed that when student enters moodle A for the first time, moodle B courses do not appear in mycourses block, but only after the student enters site B using the link available on Network Servers block. Is it possible to have the course list automatically updated? (simulating the user entrance on siteB?) Thank you in advance, susana",

But several aspects has to be taken into account. in MNet environment, every student has one server as their \"home base\". That is the only server that asks the user for user name and password. Such a server is called as identity provider (IdP). Once they are logged to their home server, users can then roam to other MNet peers. at every other server, user record has to be created, too. MNet does this automatically during the first successful roam to that server. since the remote user account is created at a host , Moodle works with that account as if it was ordinary user. So enrolments, role assignments etc all work. If you want to display the information about the enrolled courses at the remote MNet peer before the user ever roamed to it, you will have to push their accounts into remote servers manually, setting their mnethostid field to the correct value.",

So once the information about the enrolments of our users at a remote MNet host are fetched via XML -RPC, they are stored for a short time in these local tables. Instead of populating the tables manually, I would suggest to call the XML -RPC to update the remote enrolments cache when needed. See for the code in /admin/mnet/enr_course_enrol.php In Moodle 2.0, this part was rewritten a bit, you may find the new code in /mnet/service/enrol/. HTH",

Thanks] I've got an xml -rpc module that can that can be used by an external client to make a course announcement. (Side note: Any interest in making this a built-in service in Moodle?) In Moodle 1.9.5, set up was: Copy my rpclilb.php to .../htdocs/moodle/mod/forum Add name and description entries to .../htdocs/moodle/lang/en_utf8/forum.php Enable networking and add the client's IP address to the XML -RPC trusted hosts. I recently tried my module with 1.9.9 and initially it did not work. After tracing error codes to the source and backtracking, I found that mnet/lib.php:mnet_permit_rpc_call() needs some entries in tables mnet_host2service, mnet_service, mnet_service2rpc, and mnet_rpc. I put these in and my module works. With 1.9.9, is there a UI or automated way of making these table entries? I also tried 2.0 RC1 and have had no success getting my module working. I followed the above steps and also tried to follow this thinking the various mnet_ table entries would be created automatically. I end up with Fault 7021: 'The transport method you are trying to use is not permitted.' The snag seems to be with mnet/remote_client.php:plaintext_is_ok() which does not recognize my box as a trusted host . If I hack plaintext_is_ok() to return true, I get Fault 711: 'The signature verification failed.' Do all XML -RPC client calls need to be signed now, and if so, how? Are there any XML-RCP server and client samples for 2.0? Thanks in advance for any help! -Bill",

Also, I recently made ported my extension  to work with Moodle 2.0, and faced the same issues at you at first. It turns out you cannot use the old mnet method anymore, but you need to move to the new web services architecture.

Other users will have to be assigned a role that has the \"Roam to a remote Moodle\" permission (moodle/site:mnetlogintoremote). The easiest way to assign this, is to give it to the \"Logged in user role\", but of course your requirements may be more granular than this. So - if it's a roles/permissions issue, this should fix it. The error message you're reporting can only eventuate if: The user doesn't have permission to roam The user is a remote user who has already roamed to your Moodle The user's username is the literal string 'guest' The user's ID is not set (which can't be the case here) Of these issues, \"inadequate permissions\" is the one most likely to be causing your problem.

Until Monday, our trusted relationships worked perfectly. Since Monday, however, schools trying to connect to the collaborative Moodle are being met with a time gap error, such as: RPC auth/mnet/user_authorise:Time gap with moodlename (16.5 seconds) is greater than the permitted maximum of 15 seconds ERROR 6:6:Time gap with moodlename (16.5 seconds) is greater than the permitted maximum of 15 seconds. After some troubleshooting, I can confirm: (a) multiple Moodle installations on the hosted server allow roaming between each other, without issue (b) the Moodle installations on the hosted server allow roaming out to other, external Moodle installations (c) when external Moodle installations try to roam to the hosted/collaborative Moodle, they get this error about the Time Gap. I've read the few threads on this site that pertain to this, and have tried manually overriding the threshold limit to take it from 15 seconds to 60. No dice! The last time it worked was late Sunday evening, and since then I have made no changes on the admin side --- which suggests, of course, that the problem lies with the hosted server.",

This became more important when we trialled a virtual Mahara server (connected via MNet) where Windoes Server Something Or Other was the host . The time was slipping on it terribly, so much that we had to modify CRON to run once per hour on the virtual server. A pain, and shouldn't be necessary, but the end result is working a working Mahoodle. TV stations can show several minutes' difference in time, so I suggest that it's not impossible for different Moodle installs, on different servers, to exist outside of 15 seconds syncronisation. If yo have shell access to your servers, try: ntpdate -d uk.pool.ntp.org ...or another time server to see how far off (or not) you are, and if possible, try the same thing from the 'incoming' servers too.

Everyone is still getting a time gap error of anywhere between 16.5 and 18 seconds.   Moodle installations hosted on the same server as the collaborative one can connect to it just fine, however.  The collaborative Moodle can connect \"out\" to other peer modules without issue, too.

From there I went back to moodle and under networking / peers i added the peer using the correct wwwroot. set the services, saved, and deleted the old one. whew.

I am running Moodle on a windows 2000 server, and using Uniserver V5 Nano to run the Moodle website I made the following changes, which solved the problem. 1. I added the Listen command in httpd file from ....\\ server \\apache\\conf as per reply from Cal Handy. 2. I also editedthe \"conf.php file in my www folder to read the following ($CFG-> wwwroot = ' http://10.1.72.9 ';). Where \"10.1.72.9\" is the IP of the Server on my local network. 3. I also added a line to the windows \"hosts\" file to read (Dizzy-web 10.1.72.9) where Dizzy-web is the name of my web server, and 10.1.72.9 is the IP address. I now call up the website, from anywhere on the network, using either the server's IP address (10.1.72.9) or the name (Dizzy-web) I hope this helps you and closes your problem Regards DizzyG",

The only differences being: portal has \"Auto add remote users\" set to no whereas elearning has it set to yes. portal has LDAP authentication enabled as well and appears above Moodle Networking I have also got ticks in every box under services on both hosts. Still no joy! Doing a bit of digging: Clicking the link in Network Servers takes me to [HIDDEN]/elearning/auth/mnet/land.php?token=cdf0ff5ce156e05093e74abed3c7314fe25f3db8&idp=[HIDDEN]/portal&wantsurl= Looking at the code in land.php I see confirm_mnet_session and track the error message down as coming from line 276. So the test (($mnetrequest->send($remotepeer) === true) has failed. Looking further this is a result of SELECT * FROM {$CFG->prefix}mnet_rpc r, {$CFG->prefix}mnet_service2rpc s2r, {$CFG->prefix}mnet_host2service h2s WHERE r.xmlrpc_path = '{$this->method}' AND s2r.rpcid = r.id AND s2r.serviceid = h2s.serviceid AND h2s.subscribe = '1' AND h2s.hostid in ({$id_list})\"; returning no records. Echoing the SQL gives me $id_list of 1,2. But in my database for elearning the id of the remote host is 3. I did a print_r of the $mnet_peer object which is used to get the id and looking at it, it appears to be from the database which supports portal and not elearning. Have I got confused and this is right? Or is it getting the records from the wring database (possibly caused by our config hacks to use the same code files?) Thanks again for your time, Ian",

However - this isn't quite the error message I would expect you to receive. Can I ask you to inspect the key for each server, which you can view at: /admin/mnet/index.php and compare it to the key the other server thinks its peer has, which you can view by clicking on that server's link in : /admin/mnet/peers.php If these don't match, you can manually re-key by copying/pasting each server's actual public key into the appropriate record on the other server. I'd be much more confident that this will help if you're running code from CVS.",

We currently do not use CVS to upgrade our Moodle but will look to do this very soon. The virtual server (server B) has all the courses from Server A. What we are looking to do is network a total of 4 Moodles, which one of these 4 Moodles is a central hub for the remaining 3 Moodles. These 3 remaining Moodles are separate Colleges which are involved within a blended project. My question is if we have a Moodle behind a masquerading firewall and we insert the URL for that site within the networking setup will it work internally (Intranet) and externally (extranet)?

          "Text": "Hello, I have a big problem. We had a server running Moodle 1.7+ with database . It was accessed through the local university network and through the Internet by distant users, everything worked quite suitable for us. Recently, we downloaded version 1.7.2+ and copied it to the server. It upgraded the database to 1.7.2+ successfully. However, a huge problem arised. Everything is accessed through local network successfully. However, then some of our users try to open large html pages (in size, with pictures) through the internet, they cannot do that on slow connections (phone modems). More precisely - the page is starting to load, but after some time, before it loads completely, it simply restarts and the load goes again and again. The problem is not with accessing server through global network, since on speedy connections everything works fine. I tried to downgrade to previous version and moved 1.7+ code back again, however, the problem did not disappear. Also warnings arised for some modules (forum, for example) - that they cannot downgrade. What could be causing such problem? We have set up large execution time in php.ini, so what else? Currently our environment is this: Windows 2003 server, Apache 2.2.4, PHP 5.1.4 (came with standard Moodle package 1.7+), MySQL 5.0.24. Everything works just great in local network. What's wrong with the global?",

Our experience showed that effectively plesiochronous clock setting in a networked system was not stable enough to guarantee avoidance of divergence. As our XML -RPC goes through a load balancer, and could be routed to hosts with an unkown immediate load, there is a risk that a XML -RPC query would consume more than 15 secs. to be handled at the receiver location. In this case we break the service. As in our situation, we use a 40 mnetworked Moodle array within a coherent nationwide system, so there are \"intimous\" XML-RPC exchanges between platforms to federate contents. So we need XML-RPC calls to be performed, including with some delay. The resolution of the call is more important than the delay it takes, as long as it can logically be concluded. Cheers.",

While I'd hope that wouldn't be the case for SSO calls (because you'd cause an intolerable delay for users), I can see how background jobs could cause issues. Looking in the code, it seems you can set the MNET configuration parameter \"drift_threshold\" to change the 15 second limit to something longer. I'm not sure that option is exposed in the UI, but you could have a look around for it, or just set it in the database . The relevant file is mnet/xmlrpc/client.php - search for \"hysteresis\"",

          "Text": "Dear, I have little experience with Moodle. I tried to establish a network between two moodle installations, but just in one of them the public key is \"visible/available\". In the other Moodle, it is missing and the date is crazy(something like december 1962) . When I click to \"create\" a new public key, it fails, I see for just one second a message or error and it disappears as if the site did not exist. Curiously, the installations(1.9.2) made through Fantasticos Script do not \"have\" the public key.  The installation(1.9.3) manually done has it.  They are on the same hosting service. So the extensions are the same and the servers have the same characteristics( I believe). Do you have some advice? I know that most people do not like Fantastico , but I can say that this is the first problem I have with Moodle. I have been using Moodle (installed through Fantastico) for about 7 or 8 months. A second question: is it possible to connect more than 2 moodle by using the simple network procedure, adding more than one host (url)? I thank you in advance for your help! Márcio",

I will say this again, to make sure people reading this thread see it- this is an incredibly insecure way to do key rotation.

The first part get's the information you have in your database regarding a peer: $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $mnet_peer->set_id($hostid); No problem here, right(?) since you are reading data from your own database. The next part get's the current public key of the wwwroot, which you just got from your database, and if they don't match it updates. $currentkey = mnet_get_public_key($mnet_peer->wwwroot); Doesn't the mnet_get_public_key function check the host? I am not familiar with curl so am not clear on what exactly the function is doing, but I see these two lines within that function: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0); So that looks to me like it is verifing. Again, I am not a curl persion so which part of the above am I mistaken on? Thanks in advance! M=",

You're asking curl to make a HTTP request to a host at hostname 'X' - an unencrypted, unsigned request. You have no proof whatsoever that the host at that hostname is the same as the host you used to communicate with, and anyone who is listening in on your connection can send you back a bogus reply claiming to be from that hostname, thus causing you to store the attacker's chosen public key. The curl options are largely irrelevant. It is not an HTTPS connection that is being made between the hosts - it is a HTTP request that is signed and encrypted using openssl, which is slightly different. Currently Moodle ensures security by sending a signed, encrypted messages back and forth using the older keys to make sure that the new key is retrieved securely. If you're having problems with the key rotation, it's likely that you need to upgrade your Moodle installations. What version of Moodle are you running on each end?",

          "Text": "Hi Peter, Nigel... we encountered also the same problem than Michael in our TAO/Pairformance implementation for Intel. The fact is that the key rotation did not run properly in our case on 1.9.3 codebase. There is moreover another case where the \"just when necessary\" key upgrading does not comply the need : when using, as we do, massive use of XML -RPC data transfers between platform, for data exchange servicing. When adding such services, you barely not use the auth hook that could renew those keys. Keys should be renewed essentially throiugh an explicit remote auth action of a remote user. We cannot wait for that event in our case. So we made such an automated renewal solution : We implemented it in a local/mnetcron.php hook to not denature standard code (although we rely on an unevitable patch in mnet/lib.php) : <?php /// check keys and reniew with peers. /// requires : patching /mnet/xmlrpc/ server .php for mnet_keyswap() /// requires : patching /mnet/lib.php for mnet_keyswap() global $MNET; mtrace(\" Cron automatic rotation for MNET keys...\\n\"); if (!isset($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_gap)) set_config('mnet_key_autorenew_gap', 24 * 3); // three days // if autorenewal is enabled and we are mnetworking if (!empty($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew) && $CFG->mnet_dispatcher_mode != 'none'){ include_once $CFG->dirroot.\"/mnet/peer.php\"; include_once $CFG->dirroot.\"/mnet/lib.php\"; // check if key is getting obsolete $havetorenew = 0; // key is getting old : check if it is time to operate if ($MNET->public_key_expires - time() < $CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_gap * HOURSECS){ // this one is needed as temporary global toggle between distinct cron invocations, // but should not be changed through the GUI if (empty($CFG->mnet_autorenew_haveto)){ set_config('mnet_autorenew_haveto', 1); mtrace('Local key is expiring. Need renewing MNET keys...'); } else { if (!empty($CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_time)){ $now = getdate(time()); if ($now['hours'] > $CFG->mnet_key_autorenew_time){ $havetorenew = 1; } } else { $havetorenew = 1; } } } // renew if needed $force = optional_param('forcerenew', 0, PARAM_INT); if ($havetorenew || $force){ mtrace(\"Local key will expire very soon. Renew MNET keys now !!...\\n\"); // make a key and exchange it with all known and active peers $mnet_peers = get_records('mnet_host', 'deleted', 0); // reniew local key $MNET->replace_keys(); // send new key using key exchange transportation if ($mnet_peers){ foreach($mnet_peers as $peer){ if (($peer->id == $CFG->mnet_all_hosts_id) || ($peer->id == $CFG->mnet_localhost_id)) continue; $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $mnet_peer->set_wwwroot($peer->wwwroot); // get the sessions for each vmoodle that have same ID Number // we use a force parameter to force fetching the key remotely anyway $currentkey = mnet_get_public_key($mnet_peer->wwwroot, $mnet_peer->application, 1); if ($currentkey){ $mnet_peer->public_key = clean_param($currentkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key = clean_param($currentkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($currentkey); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($currentkey); $mnet_peer->commit(); mtrace('Key renewed for '.$peer->wwwroot.' till '.userdate($mnet_peer->public_key_expires)); } else { mtrace('Failed renewing key with '.$peer->wwwroot); } } } set_config('mnet_autorenew_haveto', 0); } } ?> This relies on a little change in get_public_key() and on the remote system/keyswap call that it implies  : we added a force mode, that allows ofrcing renewal on certain conditions : /** * Accepts a public key from a new remote host and returns the public key for * this host. If 'register all hosts' is turned on, it will bootstrap a record * for the remote host in the mnet_host table (if it's not already there) * * @param  string  $function XML -RPC requires this but we don't... discard! * @param  array   $params        Array of parameters *                                $params[0] is the remote wwwroot *                                $params[1] is the remote public key * @return string                 The XML-RPC response */ function mnet_keyswap($function, $params) { global $CFG, $MNET; $return = array(); $wwwroot        = $params[0]; $pubkey         = $params[1]; $application    = $params[2]; $forcerenew     = $params[3]; if ($forcerenew == 0){ // standard keyswap for first key recording if (!empty($CFG->mnet_register_allhosts)) { $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); $keyok = $mnet_peer->bootstrap($wwwroot, $pubkey, $application); if ($keyok) { $mnet_peer->commit(); } } } else { $mnet_peer = new mnet_peer(); // we can only renew hosts that we know something about. if ($mnet_peer->set_wwwroot($wwwroot)){ $mnet_peer->public_key = clean_param($pubkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($pubkey); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key = clean_param($pubkey, PARAM_PEM); $mnet_peer->updateparams->public_key_expires = $mnet_peer->check_common_name($pubkey); $mnet_peer->commit(); } return false; // avoid giving our key to unkown hosts. } return $MNET->public_key; } The precaution was not to let anyone ask for a key renewal, spoofing a registered host. I don't know if this precaution is sufficiant as it is. But it works in an internally secured subnetwork anyway. The above change in renew process needs just passing an extra param in get_public_key (mnet/lib.php) : /** * Get the remote machine's SSL Cert * * @param  string  $uri     The URI of a file on the remote computer, including *                          its http:// or https:// prefix * @return string           A PEM formatted SSL Certificate. */ // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal : adding force function mnet_get_public_key($uri, $application=null, $force=0) { // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal global $CFG, $MNET; // The key may be cached in the mnet_set_public_key function... // check this first // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal // cache location of key must be bypassed when we need an automated renew. if (!$force){ $key = mnet_set_public_key($uri); if ($key != false) { return $key; } } // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal if (empty($application)) { $application = get_record('mnet_application', 'name', 'moodle'); } // PATCH Mnet automated key renewal $rq = xmlrpc_encode_request('system/keyswap', array($CFG->wwwroot, $MNET->public_key, $application->name, $force), array(\"encoding\" => \"utf-8\")); // \\PATCH Mnet automated key renewal $ch = curl_init($uri . $application->xmlrpc_server_url); ... This resolved all our issues of failure in standard key renewal, including those we would have expected to be working before the change. Cheers.",

I see that 1.8 has an XML -RPC mechanism (which seems more geared toward hooking up moodles), but I'm not sure how to hook it up to a client-side app like contribute. I mostly want to write forum posts in Contribute, and for that, it seems as if Moodle social forums are best thought of (from the standpoint of Contribute) as a kind of blog . What is needed is something like an \"xmlrpc.php\" access point. I know that Contribute is popular with school systems, since it allows them to control access at a higher level and please those who are more used to apps like Word. Neither of these situations really apply to me (I'm a programmer). I want to use it mainly to keep myself organized. Has anyone tried to do this? Steve",

          "Title": "Moodle Networking – some ideas for bulk enrolments on networked courses",
          "Text": "A number of us involved in networking projects meet up at the recent MoodleMootNZ and tossed around some ideas for further improvement of mnet. While there are still a few quirks, the basic networking functionality is now at the point where it just works. But the manual enrolment interface is too basic to scale up, so we discussed some ideas to improve this based on the following points: Need to be able to bulk enrol students on networked courses Need to be able to assign users to more than just the student role within a networked course (e.g. a teacher) Need to be able to automatically assign users to a group within a networked course Need to keep Moodle as the data channel - don’t want local student account creation/course enrolment interfaces to have to talk to multiple moodles Need to allow for increasing amount of data in networked courses to be available in local Moodle (e.g. grades, course activity info in myMoodle listing etc). Taking these into account this is myrecollection of what the group came up. I post it here for others in the NZgroup to add their comments along with anyone in the wider community. Add an option for a user with a new role capability to tag a local course as a “networked course” and link it with a networked course located on a peered Moodle. Initially this would be a manual process, but it could develop into an automated process based on peerID and courseID mapping, plus identifying which course is the “destination” course. Once tagged in this way, any user associated with the local course is automatically associated with the network course, along with their role and group membership as defined in the local course. After tagging, local admin/process would still need to be able to add new users to the local course and have their role+group membership associated with networked course. Unenrolment would also need to be supported. Standard user would login on local Moodle, click on linked course name and go directly to networked course on remote Moodle. Course name would be defined by the name of the remote course. Local user with required role capability (e.g. admin) would be able to view 2 links to a networked course: local version + remote version, but only able to visit remote course if they have an appropriate course- context role. Obviously there will be issues with transferability of roles between Moodles. There would need to either be some agreement between peered Moodles on what roles can be transferred and perhaps some capability for an admin on the remote Moodle to authorise certain roles to be assigned by another site. Or more simply, just have the core Moodle course-context roles supported – i.e. guest, student, non-editing teacher, editing teacher. Would be great to be able to get grade info back to local moodle for local students (as a subset of all students on remote course) so local academic admin can access for official recording. But we ran out of time to discuss this and there may be better ways to do this outside the course framework. OK – is this how the rest of the NZ group remember the meeting and for the wider community, what are the limitations, technical difficulties, security issues or better ideas? David",

The suggested solution seems sensible to us, though we are keen to allow the developers (Catalyst) work out a solution that they consider best - given their knowledge of the infrastructure of Moodle and possible performance considerations. Below I have re-ordered the list in order of priority for development as we see it: Ability to bulk enrol students in networked courses (e.g. through enrolment plugin or csv file upload ). Ability to assign users to different roles in networked courses. Standard roles should be fine - so guest, student, non-editing teacher and editing teacher. Any additional assignment to roles can be managed at the remote course end. Account creation and enrolment of students into networked courses managed by the local Moodle instance (identity provider) without requiring additional processes to manage accounts / enrolment on the remote Moodle (content provider). Ability to turn off the auto greetings email notification for students who are directly enrolled in networked course. Exposure of remote course related data within the local Moodle instance - in particular: user activity, grades, calendar events and possibly MyMoodle listings. Automatic group assignment within networked courses How does this sound to everyone?",

As I do not wish users to access courses in which they have not been enrolled internally (i.e. by using an external database) I would prefer to keep the course enrollable setting (in the course) toggled to \"no\". When testing the options in Courses>enrolments>Moodle networking>edit> the options to \"allow all courses\" or \"edit allowed courses and categories\" makes no difference and still only shows courses which have been set to course enrollable.

          "Text": "Hi Eddie - we've found the same thing. What's more, if you switch the networked course to being \"unenrollable\" after you have added students, these courses disappear from the students My Courses block in their home Moodle (item 8 below). We have identified the following issues we believe need to be addressed and are working with Catalyst (NZ Moodle Partner) on resolving and passing the fixes upstream. We are working on this as part of our \"myLearn\" project - more detail in a separate thread - and are using our local bug/work request system to log problems - I haven't checked the Moodle bug tracker lately to see if they are replicated there. Because we have uncovered such a number of significant issues with mnet we have shifted the 2nd phase of our project away from exploring the fully distributed network model to a more detailed testing of hub-based model, but with distributed teaching, support and enrolment. Initial user roaming issues that were patched and went upstream to Moodle 1.8 & 1.9 stable in Feb 2008. My Moodle updated to show networked courses. NMIT/myLearn patched on 1.8.4, WR#52033 resolved but not passed upstream and 1.9 version of TANZ Support site required additional patch. Networked courses don’t show in home Moodle “My Courses” block if student is only enrolled on networked courses. Instead the My Courses block shows local Moodle categories. Work around is to enrol all students on at least 1 local course (e.g. generic programme home or help course). Unresolved WR#52033. Links in networked Moodle emails require redirection to local Moodle for login. Partial patch applied to myLearn 1.8, then lost during upgrade to 1.9. Further work has been identified to fix more email links once partial patch has been re-established. Unresolved WR#52032. Mnet students can’t view their Gradebook entries on networked courses. Unresolved WR#54287. Students enrolled via local Moodle Networking -> Enrolments interface are automatically sent a confirmation email. Have requested this is either turned off or made optional. Unresolved WR#54683. Admin user unable to “login as” a networked user. Unresolved WR#54512. Changing the status of a networked course from “Enrollable” to “Not enrollable” results in networked student who are enrolled on it lose it from their home Moodle “my Courses” and myMoodle listings. Raised as issue in myLearn upgrade to 1.9 WR#53391, but not resolved. Work around is to keep all networked courses as enrollable. Issue not yet raised as a WR – we are testing flat file enrolment process as a simple way of allowing networked sites to do bulk enrolments. We have established a \"Networked admin\" role on the myLearn site and assigned other Moodle admins to this role. The role includes the ability to upload csv files into the myLearn site files area so the myLearn flat file enrolment plug-in can pick up bulk enrolment details there. We may request additional functionality is added to the flat file enrolments process to facilitate students being added to groups within courses. Still exploring the pluses and minus of this approach. Cheers David",

The system is working well bar for one problem and that is all user profiles are set up with the auto-subscribe to forums set to not automatically subscribe every time a user posts a message. However this does not appear to be working on the course site as the option default at the base of all messages is set to subscribe once the message is posted. The students are now getting fed up with having to unsubscribe each time they forget to change the subscription option. Other than each student turning their email off, swapping to digest or putting an incorrect email address into the system to stop all the emails is there something else that can be done or is this a bug that needs reporting?

          "Text": "Problems can occur when trying to set up MNet with some IP address configurations. As an example, let's imagine that http://testmoodle.fake is trying to network with http://moodle.org . If the server at moodle.org resolves the IP address of testmoodle.fake to be 213.16.16.7, but testmoodle.fake is trying to connect to moodle.org from the IP address 20.20.20.20, the attempt will fail. The server at moodle.org will note that the server that claims to be testmoodle.fake is connecting from a different IP address, and will reject the incoming call with a 7017 error. Usually, this is ok, and it worked fine in testing, but it's causing problems for lots of users in the field. In particular, it can be a problem for some clustered Moodle setups, and may cause problems for Moodles running in virtual servers, etc. A fix is planned, which will probably be a configuration option allowing admins to disable strict IP checks in Moodle. In the meantime, you can comment out two lines of code which should (untested) disable the IP check for you. The lines are in: /mnet/xmlrpc/server.php and they're in the function mnet_server_strip_wrappers. In my checkout, lines 135 and 136 need to be commented out. } elseif (isset($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) && $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] != $MNET_REMOTE_CLIENT->ip_address) { exit(mnet_server_fault(7017, 'wrong-ip')); I'd be interested to learn if this resolves networking problems for any users.",

          "Text": "Hi Heather - the first thing I noticed is that you're using the network identifier (10.0.0.0) as a host address. This isn't impossible (I think) but it's pretty unusual. If you have the option, you might want to try 10.0.0.1 or higher as the address for the host. Having said that... Each Moodle instance will have its own keypair. The public keys for your Moodles can be viewed on these pages: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/index.php http://10.0.0.0/moodleB/admin/mnet/index.php You'll note that they're different. Each of these Moodles must fetch and store the public key of the other one. If you visit this page: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/peers.php?step=update&hostid=3 You should be able to view the public key for some remote host. If you only have one remote host configured (MoodleB) you'll probably see the details for that host. If you don't, please go to this page: http://10.0.0.0/moodleA/admin/mnet/peers.php ..and click on the link for MoodleB. If MoodleA has been able to retrieve and store a public key for MoodleB, it will appear here in the text panel. The expiry date of the key will appear below it. If it has failed even to retrieve this key, you're really in trouble. The text panel will be blank and the expiry date will be noted as sometime in 1969/1970. Keys expire every month or so, and normally when they expire (if you connect to the remote host within a few months after the expiry date) the servers should re-exchange their current up-to-date keys. However, you may see the following message: The public key you are holding for this host is different from the public key it is currently publishing. Underneath, the current up-to-date key that MoodleB is currently publishing will appear. You can copy this text (including the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- parts) and paste it into the text panel. Then click on 'save changes'. If your keys get out of sync for some reason - perhaps you've torn down and re-installed one of your Moodles - this is a good way to re-establish communication between the Moodle instances.",

It also prevents other users from loggin into the improper site. Maybe next year we'll be able to set up enrollment via LDAP, but that's another topic. Thanks for your help!",

There's an element of your system that I'm not clear on. You have a number of 'remote' Moodle sites... is it possible for one person to have an account on more than one remote Moodle? If this is so, it is not yet possible to give that user a single account on the Portal Moodle that can be accessed (via SSO) from more than one Remote Moodle. The user will have a new record created on the Portal moodle for each Remote Moodle that acts as a starting point for an SSO session. I'm struggling to make myself clear here, so I hope that makes sense. Best wishes Donal",

EDIT: I think the root cause is backup not checking if networking is enabled or not.... http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-11144",

Questions.... * Where do I really need to enable it? * If I am roaming from Moodle A to Moodle B but not back, must I still set it one way or both ways for it to work? * Do you effectively need to apply it to *all* roles? Example - when I log in I'm just an authenticated user, so I need to set it there to get to the other moodle at all. Once I go into a course I become a teacher or a student so they need roam set too? Not sure! Any further info appreciated.",

Site A and Site B are linked. User logs into Site A and roams to Site B. User is removed from Site A as he no longer needs access to the moodle system but still shows up in the Browse list of Users on Site B. I have not been able to figure out how to remove the user from the list on Site B. While this does not pose a huge problem beacuse the user cannot login to Site A and get to Site B it does pose a problem of excess accounts being shown in the list that really don't exist anymore.",

For example, Site A mistakenly goes in and makes a student inactive and incapable of logging in. They really should not remove him from the database but they could mark him as a deleted user. If Site B automatically were to delete the user then it would automatically have to re-enroll him when Site A corrects their mistake. However since the user cannot access Site B without access to Site A nothing needs to be done when the student returns. So ultimately I think it gets tricky and I start to wonder if it is worth doing or better to just leave it the way that it is. Peace - Anthony",

Version 1.8 running php ver 4.1 will connect most of the time (80%) to a version 1.8 running php 4.1. 2. Version 1.8 running php version 4.1 will get an XML -RPC error when trying to connect to a version 1.8.2 running php 5 (You do not have permission to begin a remote session.) and the version 1.8.2 with php 5 will get a packet post error when trying to connect to a version 1.8 with php 4.1 (RPC auth/mnet/user_authorise:Payload not encryptedERROR 1:1:Payload not encrypted ). 3. Version 1.8 with php 5 will connect most of the time to another version 1.8 with php 5. 4. Version 1.8.2 with php 5 will connect fine to another version 1.8.2 with php 5. At first we thought the errors were becuase of differences between Moodle versions 1.8 and 1.8.2. This may be true in some cases. We are more inclined to say that the problem may be in the way php 4 and php5 send and create packets with XML -RPC and other access controls. Information within the packages maybe packed and read in diffent ways by the two php versions. With the many problems people are having under different enviroments it may be safe to say these grownig pains will be here for a while and or discriptions of our problem will help solve the network connectin issues. This function is not ready yet for a mixed moodle base. Let's kill these bugs!",
