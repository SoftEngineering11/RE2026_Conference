          "Text": "Hope this is the right forum for this - it is a performance issue. I think this has been a recurring theme over the years, so I wondered what the current thinking was. How do you manage your mdl_log table? We've passed 22 million rows, which is proving problematic. Our current policy is to retain the mdl_log entries for 365 days, with the CRON deleting them periodically. This used to be ok but I doubt this is sustainable as our Moodle use increases. To try and keep the size down, we remove entries from anything referring to course 1 by running something like this : delete from mdl_log where course=1 and (time < unix_timestamp(20110301)) and then optimize table mdl_log This used to take around 15 to 20 mins. However now the optimize is taking nearer 90 mins and I guess it will only get worse. So - what do we do? change the policy(!) make copies of the mdl_log tables and truncate them? We're using MyISAM - not sure if InnoDB would help particularly. All suggestions welcome!",

          "Text": "Hi, The main use of mdl_log, correct me if I'm wrong, is the reports function and activity log. In our case the growth of mdl_log (44 million currently exceeding 120 million by end of semester) has caused significant issues. We address this in a few ways. 1) we limit the access to the reports function professors have on the production system. If complex reports are needed they are run on a replicated database. 2) Every year we rotate the database ensuring that mdl_log doesn't become completly unmanagable. (there are other reasons for the rotating but this contributes) Because of this setup almost all activity on the production database are inserts into mdl_log. The lack of selects, deletes, or other querries makes its large size less of an issue. We also run INNODB on it. And while I reccomend INNODB in all cases for Moodle, I'm not sure there is value here. One possible value is that if you are running selects you can avoid table locking by using INNODB over MYISAM. Finally, I'll say that since we don't get a lot of utility out of mdl_log on the main site, I've actually explored setting it up as a blackhole. ( http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/blackhole-storage-engine.html ) This would allow Moodle to function, but save significant storage. In our case we wouldn't lose data either as with replication the data would exist on our slave servers.",

          "Text": "We use innodb table per file.  our log grew to 45 million records, and what I did recently was just delete all records where the id was less than 22 million.  That took about 10 minutes,  then i did an optimize table which took about 12 minutes. What I had to worry about, was - is the free disk space enough to create the new table.  THe original mdl_log table file was 10 gigs.  After a successful optimize table, it dropped to about 5 gigs.  So it was critical that I have adequate space for that 5 gig table.  Once the optimize was done,  i had an extra 5 gigs of space on that file system. I do this manually once a year or every 9 months or so.   I create and save a backup of the entire moodle database first, just to keep of copy of the logs in case I need them in the future. What i might do, is get the timestampe of the record in the middle and do a conversion @ http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm Or i might just do a delete from ... where timestamp <  a specific date I ALWAYS do this  on a test system before the production system so I know how long its going to take; and that I just then have to copy/paste the commands so I don't make a typo. I also ensure I have DOWNTIME for moodle during this process, I don't want anything writing to the logs. I don't have automated pruning of that table done. The other file you have to worry about is the grade_grades_history table. it is the 2nd largest growing table in moodle. My suggestions would be - 1. manually do these actions every certain 6 months or year. 2. do these steps on a test server first 3. depending upon how much free disk space you have on your db server, will dictate how large you can let it grow. 4. if you have a good mysql dba, I would highly recommend using innodb  file per table config.",

Make sure to install and enable an opcode cache like APC or eAccelerator with plenty of available RAM for its cache. It will do wonders for your concurrency. Definitely up the RAM - especially on the database server. The more of the database tables the server can keep cached in RAM, the better. Also, go with InnoDB tables instead of MyISAM. You'll get fewer locks and greater concurrency on the database. As to your question about using a crossover - I don't know that you'll see much of a benefit. It certainly won't hurt, but it's probably not worth the effort. If you do decide to go the crossover route, if you set up your config.php to point to the IP address of the database server's NIC that is connected to the crossover (as opposed to the IP/ domain of the NIC on the network) it will use just the crossover. -Greg",

Did you consult the docs http://docs.moodle.org/en/Performance_FAQ#How_do_you_define_.22concurrent_users.22.3F ? > I wondered whether one NIC on each to the network (gigabit) and the other a crossover cable between the two for a faster connection (lower latency etc) The separate server causes the latency, irrespective whether it goes through the LAN or a crossover. The crossover would definitely help if your LAN is conjested, network interface saturated, etc. The question is, whether your webserver can deliver so fast to saturate a 1 Gbit/s link. > If this is the way forward then how do I get the servers to talk to each other via the crossover link only. As explained above the crossover may or may not help. It won't hurt in anycase. I don't know how to do that on Windows. On Linux it is pretty easy. - assign both private interfaces two IP addresses from the same net - add a new line to each routing table so that the internal traffic is delivered to the private interface You can get windows-specific answers in the forum \"Windows-based servers\" http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=6799",

But - I'm also not sure what you mean by a \"certified\" plugin? - plugins in our moodle.org plugins database have been through an initial review process and some of the popular ones are regularly reviewed by Moodle partners and other developers, but each organisation should have their own process to assess the safety of a specific plugin before it is installed on their site.

Basically there will be around 500 - 550 users and from those we imagine around 30 - 60 concurrent users (2 classrooms). For servers we was going to go for Linux CentOS 7 however we've got the choice between the following: Linux DS-4000 (DL120 G7), Quad Core Xeon 3.1GHz, 8GB RAM, 2 x 500GB SATA HDDs or Linux 4 Core Intel Processor, 12GB RAM, 2 x 500gb sata. Each system will have plesk installed. Would this suffice or do you recommend another type of dedicated server? Also is 12gb ram really needed for this amount of users? Appreciate any advice thanks!",

It's very hard to give you good advice, but you can't be too wealthy, too slim or have too much RAM. If in doubt, buy more.

If this server will be running the database AND the web server, add another 1 to 2 GB of RAM for the database. That would give you about 6 GB use average, double that to account for spikes and give room for growth and you end up at 12 GB RAM as a safe number. Also seconding SSD disks.

Contact me for direct advice, and I will try to reserve time to write additions to the performance documents. 15-20k users on quizzes is definitely possible with optimization and if necessary loadbalancing among multiple servers. the slowest part in Moodle is the database abstraction, which in my opinion, is faily poorly designed. For instance manipulation of database data often takes two roundtrips: fetching data from mysql an array, transforming the array in PHP, preparing the statement for insert/update into the database and then writing information to the database, and then retrieving it again to show on your screen (with array processing)",

The video runs in the Scorm package through a .swf file. The same Video and Scorm file is running in another VLE (digitalbrain) on a third party server. When running the video in Moodle it takes 3 minutes of download before the video will begin to play, at this point it still has another 3 minutes of downloading to do before the whole file is down. When running the same video on the other VLE these times are half of what I'm experiencing on the Moodle site. In both cases I've tested using a 1Mb and 4Mb broadband connection. My host says that checking the firewall that this Modle application is behind, he is seeing a peak of 10Mbps total (inbound and outbound). Is there some server and or Moodle optimisation I should be looking at that can speed up my video download? Many thanks....",

Sure, that should not be a problem, especially if your students are not all trying to load pages at the same time. Even if they are, it might be a little slow at that moment, but it should still work. You should check Moodle documentation on how to tweak it, however, for better performance. On the other hand, on the type of machine that you describe, if loaded with something like Ubuntu's free Linux server, you can run a whole school with dozens of classes and hundreds of students and perhaps several dozen students loading pages or taking a quiz at the same time. So, in other words, a desktop Windows machine, while it will let you do things on a small scales, is not the best system if you get any larger than I described. You should think of it as a temporary solution to try things out. The term \"concurrent users\" means different things to different people. One workable definition is the number of machines trying to load a page that requires basic database access within a 5 second period. By that definition, many courses may peak at only a few concurrent users, and even a desktop PC can handle that for somebody starting out, although few people would recommend that as a long term solution for using Moodle for classes. --Gary",

On the other hand, cloud based hosting (e.g. Amazon AWS) seems more affordable and is also flexible in terms of scalability. Does anyone have experience hosting Moodle on cloud? Which are some of the good providers, and are there any benefits/isues of hosting on cloud vs hosting on VPS/dedicated servers? I'd appreciate any pointers to start with.

I contacted a Moodle Partner in US with my project details (30mins narrated audio made from ppt slides of 2/3 mins each, with no quiz/database access) last week, and they said I'll need a premium account to handle 1000 concurrent users. Since this was a bit outside the budget, I requested information on this forum about concurrency requirements and alternate hosting options like cloud. I inquired for cloud as it allows better flexibilty to scale up/down with unknown amount of load (as in my use case) and will charge appropriately. Once we understand the load/requirements better, we can think about any other (better?) options. Another question: In your other thread you were talking of 1000 users in total. This one is about 1000 concurrent users. Are these two different projects? >> No, it's the same project. It all started from my inquiry to a Moodle Partner based in US. Thanks, Shail",

No need to use some 'geek' approaches like ngninx/lighttpd, PHP FastCGI, memcached, eAccelerators, etc. In case of 1000+ concurrent users we've implemented a scheme where several VPS are used.

With query_cache_size set to 1024M, the RAM allocation would have to be more than 1GB otherwise you may get disk threshing occurring. Try also lowering the eaccelarator settings to about 48MB, the rule of thumb is to set it to the size of the moodle/ directory as that's the maximum amount of code eaccelerator should compile. The mysql settings will depend on your activity and how long the server has been running, so you need to adjust and fine-tune daily, then weekly, then monthly until things have settled-down. Remember that you'll also need to optimise the host operating system when running ESX server. If you've done done so already, see this document ( http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vi_performance_tuning.pdf ) for more info. Hope this is useful! Ken",

If users play such a video using recent version of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge,  a large number of file transmission requests (range requests) are sent from web browser to web server. Sending file transfer requests continues as long as the video is playing. This trouble occurs not only with the Moodle, but also with other web sites. Even if the video file contains unusual frames, it can be played normally on the video player of the PCs. Therefore, it is difficult to detect the unusual frames before uploading the video. Even if the Web server prohibits rage requests, transfer requests will overflow after the user's playback position reaches the unusual frame. A similar bug occurred in the Google Chrome around 20165 or 2016. Recent versions of the Chrome and the Edge use range requests as standard when downloading media files. So, I guess that the similar bug has occurred.",

You will note that some cache stores have properies like \"data guarantee, key awareness\" which memcache cannot offer, and sometimes these are required. At the OU we set Under Known cache definitions: Language string cache, Database meta information, Question definitions & HTML Purifier - cleaned content - change to use memcache. Event invalidation - leave that as the default. Under Stores used when no mapping is present: Session - change to memcache Application & Request - leave on the default. 3) memcache works best when it can use as much memory as possible, adn when the load is spread over many servers, so install it on all 5 web servers, and let it use all the spare memory.",

And i need to modify the configuration file directly in order to set up memcache for session cache.  Is it normal? 2) Will Moodle performance deteriorate significantly if one of the memcache servers is crashed? 3) What is the best way to purge Moodle caches? By performing \"Development/Purge all caches\"? 4) It seems there is improvement in the table locking issue (pls refer to https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=221444 ) of mdl_cache_text in v2.4.4+ when there are many concurrent updates. Would you still recommend to set Text cache lifetime to No for large site with many concurrent updates as i want to achieve even more concurrent updates? 5) If i perform \"Purge all caches\" before performing the load test, the total number of hits would become smaller, say by 12% than the test without purging all caches.

We've been running Moodle for over a year and this is the first time we've had the problem.  It's only happening for quizzes with randomization.  Additionally, if we return 5 questions per page, the errors aren't as prevalent.  Returning 1 question per page causes massive failures.

Also, the more often the student clicks \"Submit\", the more write operations occur on the database. For all I'm aware, the randomization is done in the moment where the student clicks \"Attempt quiz now\", not later in the process. So most of the write operations are unrelated to randomization.",

          "Text": "There are various ways in which randomisation adds to server load. First, when the attempt is started, Moodle has to pick actual questions for each random question. That is done by code in question/type/random/questiontype.php in the create_session_and_responses method. Note that it hurts performance if you have the 'Display questions from sub-categories too' option turned on - and that is on be default. Second, on every page of the quiz, there is more slow-down becuase the question system has to load two question definitions. The definition of the random question, and then the definition of the question that was actually picked. It would be hard to optimise that. ( Development:Question_Engine_2 , due for inclusion in Moodle 2.1, fixes that. I don't think there is any way to make the same saving in the current 1.9 or 2.0 code.) Third, the save_session_and_responses function in the random quetsion type has to do two database queries per question processed because of the way this work. That is bloody horrible (and also fixed in Question Engine 2) but again I can't think of an easy way to fix that in the 1.9 code. I am suprised that 1 question per page makes things worse. If that is what you are seeing, it is an interesting observation.",

Either way, thank you for the information.  I guess based off the information you provided that our MySQL configuration is not fine tuned enough to be able to handle all of our users.  I will look more into this and see what I can find.  In anyone's experience what does it take to max out a MySQL server?  Our enviornment in particular consist of 2 primary MySQL VM 's with the following specs: 6 Gigs of Ram 4 VCPU's Plenty of SAN storage Between these two serverse, we distribute all of our Moodle sites (currently each on seperate Schemas / DB's). There are a lot of concurrent users, and quite a lot going on (i.e. quizes, and a few custom modules for plagerism checking, etc.)  As stated before we are currently have what appears to be MySQL issues, and my concern is attempting to setup one Giant Moodle site (which would have one giant MySQL DB) would carry over these issues.  I will keep looking into tuning the MySQL servers, and see if this will help.

          "Title": "Repeated crashes at random times",
          "Text": "Hello everyone, The last two months we’ve been facing some problems with our moodle implementation. Our main issue is that we can’t diagnose the problem. The behaviour is as follows: at seemingly random times, one of the cores of the web server's host reaches 100% usage, corresponding to a softirq for the network interface controller and stays that way. That makes it unavailable for the rest of the system, resulting in a complete crash. After a couple of minutes, the usage goes back down and it starts working again. We can accelerate this process by cutting all the connections between the webserver and the load balancer, reducing the timeout to just a few seconds. At and around the time of those CPU usage spikes, there is no other strange behaviour. Memory, disk and network usage are normal, and both the load balancer and the db server are working as always. At the very beginning we thought we were being attacked, so we took the following measures (Some of them were already in place): # Firewall: Only allows connections via TCP and ports 80 and 443. # TCP: tcp-request connection track-sc1 src table per_ip_connections tcp-request connection reject if { sc_conn_cur(1) ge 15 } || { sc_conn_rate(1) ge 20 } # Slowloris: timeout http-request 5s option http-buffer-request # HTTP: http-request deny if HTTP_1.0 http-request track-sc0 src table per_ip_rates http-request deny deny_status 429 if { sc_http_req_rate(0) gt 150 } # Against dubious browsers: http-request deny unless { req.hdr(user-agent) -m found } http-request deny if { req.hdr(user-agent) -i -m sub curl phantomjs slimerjs } backend per_ip_rates stick-table type ip size 1m expire 1m store http_req_rate(5s) backend per_ip_connections stick-table type ip size 1m expire 1m store conn_cur,conn_rate(3s) # Syn Flood protection: net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1 net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 1024 net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1 net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1 net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1 As you may have guessed, it didn’t work. That’s why we also tried: -. Adding resources to the VMs running both the docker container and the database. -. Upgrading Moodle (includes PHP and MariaDB upgrades). -. Moving the container to another virtual machine. -. Installing irq balance At the moment we stand clueless at what the root of the problem may be or what else to try, as everything we tried has failed. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Here are some extra details of our Moodle implementation:",

There are also some Moodle settings that must be re-configured. To be able to test down to the quiz level, automatic randomizations of questions and quizes must be turned off.  Each session script has to be added to provide a unique logon id, and all the logon ids must be pre-enrolled in the course under test.  The course may need to be reset between each load test. The session scripts are simply a keystroke record of a session where you simulate the use you are trying to test. The session sciprts then can be edited for a large number of users and various delays can be inserted or removed to better simulate the mix of users. The start up and loading of the sessions can be timed or programmed to simulate everybody jumping on the machine at once or for a closer to normal system usage. Thanks to the data from our testing we were able to tweek the OS and Apache configs to host about 1900 sessions before we brought our server to it's knees, so to speak. [server info: Dell PowerEdge 2950 32GB memory, 4 64bit cpus, direct attached scsi disk 400GB separate LDAP server, separate mysql server]  We did some runs only for log-in testing strictly to test the authentication server.

I have a working moodle install on Cent on a UK VPS which I incredibly pleased with - so much so that I’m hoping to go live this semester and not next.  One of my few issues surrounds Internet latency.  Whilst most Universities need to service a relatively local population of students and faculty, our course members are literally spread out all across the world. Our tests have shown that connections from Europe are pretty quick, and make the system eminently usable, but from Aus and NZ to UK the latency makes the system a whole lot less attractive. To get round this we would like to run mirror servers in the US, Middle East and Aus.  So, to the crux of my question, and forgive me if it’s naive - WAN networking and replication is really not my thing.  What is the best way of achieving this?  My first idea was to run rsync on both the machines - each instance of rsync updating the files of the other servers overnight.  Have not tried this yet but already I see storm clouds gathering if I do this with more than two servers. Secondly, I read that keeping two or more mySQL servers in sync across a WAN can be a nightmare.  Is this right or are there ways of replicating my SQL data across multiple servers a cross the WAN that live on geographically distanced VPS machines? Although not great from a latency perspective, is it better to have a single mySQL server for all the instances but have the files on each machine?  This means that the big bits of data that the students need to shunt around (assignments, essential readings etc) will be local to them and the other 'light' data will come from the mySQL server in London. In short, it’s not the loading on the servers that will be the problem - I could comfortably manage all the students concurrently on the London server, nor is it the bandwidth out of London - it’s a good size pipe, it’s the Internet latency across the world that worries me. Sorry for such a long post - any guidance or comment would be much appreciated. Kind Regards, Geoff Tothill.",

My question to all of you is there a certain folder within the structure in which I can place this php.ini folder so as to provide it to the entire site without having to place it within every folder of the site. Also on another note I noticed that I could add course categories but I can not remove/delete an empty category. I am wondering if perhaps it has to do with my hosting company php.ini.

My host (Hostgator) allows you to make over-rides with a php.ini file, but it must reside in the same directory as the script being ran. I modified a script to scan each Moodle directory and creates a symbolic link to a single php.ini file. I manually run whenever I upgrade/add a directory. I put mine in /moodle/local, so you may need to change paths if you're running it from somewhere else. \n```text\n<?php\n\nrequire_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../config.php');\n\nfunction getDirectory($path = '.') {\n $ignore = array('cgi-bin','.','..','chat');\n $dh = @opendir($path);\n while(false !== ($file = readdir( $dh ))) {\n if(!in_array($file,$ignore)) {\n if(is_dir(\"$path/$file\")) {\n getDirectory(\"$path/$file\");\n }\n }\n }\n if (glob(\"$path/*.php\")||glob(\"$path/*.\ncss\n\")||glob(\"$path/*.js\")) {\n exec('ln -s /path/to/php.ini '.$path.'/php.ini');\n }\n closedir($dh);\n}\n\ngetDirectory($CFG->\ndirroot\n);\n\necho \"Done!\";\n\n?>\n```\n Make sure to set /path/to/php.ini to your desired \"source\" file. You may also want to change the glob line — ours is set up to create a symlink in directories that contain CSS and JS files as well, since we run them through PHP for compression reasons. And last, but not least, you can \"ignore\" certain directory names with the $ignore array. We had some trouble with Moodle's chat when using GZIP, so we just turned off the ini linking for that entire directory.",

I have a working system that has been working so far with a handful of students, who probably are not all using it at the same time.  Performance is acceptable but sometimes slow and unusable.  The player sometimes complains about a slow internet connection, even when connected via Ethernet to a 300mbit cable modem.  I suspect the VPS is having trouble serving all those SCORM assets quickly.  I don't think the system is being made to run too much PHP code. Unfortunately all the Moodle provider solutions and cloud Moodle services are simply too expensive for me.  I'm a single man operation and I mostly create lessons, so I rely on easy to use IT infrastructure such as VPS hosting. I understand that CDN providers can be used to accelerate/distribute/load balance (whatever the term is).  However, I've only seen them advertise for use with websites (e.g. WordPress).  How could a CDN help speed up SCORM modules in Moodle?  Would it help by decomposing SCORM modules across many servers around the world?  Would the load be split up between different servers?  I really don't know this stuff very well at all but I need to do something because I might be getting 200 students soon. I was looking at https://www.keycdn.com/pricing and their prices seem very fair. Does Moodle work with CDN?  Is there a guide somewhere?  Again, I tried searching here but it returns almost 100 pages of results, most of which are words that contain \"cdn\" in the string and not actually what I'm looking for.  I also can't find any guides.",

First you need to understand the actual problem.. is it the image files that are taking a long time to be sent by the server? or is it the CSS or other things? You can use Google Chrome's developer tools to analyze it and see what the slow down is: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/ It also has a handy tool to simulate what it would feel like on dial-up or a mobile internet 2G/3G connection so you can see the impact it has. It is quite possible your VPS doesn't have much bandwidth for sending large image files out and that's your bottleneck. Only way to get around that honestly is to pay more money for faster/more bandwidth on the server side or maybe looking into something like MoodleCloud? You could also try to host your largest images/videos on another site and embed them. That way people are downloading it from that site (which may or may not have CDNs) rather than your one server. That's why people use YouTube or Vimeo for videos for example.",

There are actually two separate measures that are important: performance - how fast it isexecuting one particular query scalability - how much is slows down as the number of simultaneous users goes up, or the amount of data in the tables gets bigger. Postgres is very good for scalability, which is why we have used it at the OU for the last 8 years. There are other important properties you want from a database, like Store all your data safely, and never, ever corrupt it. Posgres is one of the best databse by that measure, which is good for your peace of mind. MySQL is notorious for data integrity issues.

          "Text": "We have a Moodle staging environment (3.7.1) set up on AWS using ElastiCache Redis. One morning, I was greeted by an\nerror: \"OOM command not allowed\". Here is a comprehensive article from AWS describing this error and the underlying\ncause: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/oom-command-not-allowed-redis/ To summarize, there is a property of the cache called `maxmemory-policy` ,\nwhich determines which keys get deleted when space needs to be freed up. The default value, `volatile-lru` , will only ever delete keys which have a TTL set; however, neither we nor Moodle set TTLs on any of the keys, causing the cache tofill to the brim and eventually run out of space. We've confirmed that one way to fix is to use a different `maxmemory-policy` : `allkeys-lru` . Both `volatile-lru` and `allkeys-lru` delete least recently used keys first, but `volatile` only acts on keys with TTLs. There is a comment in the Moodle Redis driver ( `cache/store/redis/lib.php` ) which reads: \n```text\n/**\n * Redis \nCache\n Store\n *\n * To allow separation of definitions in Moodle and faster purging, each cache\n * is implemented as a Redis hash.  That is a trade-off between having functionality of TTL\n * and being able to manage many caches in a single redis instance.  Given the recommendation\n * not to use TTL if at all possible and the benefits of having many stores in Redis using the\n * hash configuration, the hash implementation has been used.\n *\n * @copyright   2013 Adam Durana\n * @license     \nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\n GNU GPL v3 or later\n */\n```\n Does anyone have any thoughts on the correct way to resolve this OOM error? Is our solution sufficient/does it have downsides? Why is it recommended not to use TTLs? Any thoughts the community can share are greatly appreciated.",

Are you using memcached or just relying on the default disk based caching? Having you run the performance tests in the MUC? You are running on Windows, which isn't the greatest idea but should work. However, what monitoring are you doing? Are you checking what the machine is doing while it is serving Moodle pages? Are you definitely not running out of resource somewhere?

I wanted to ask do we need a load balance to overcome this issue? i.e) we only have one server with database on, shall we separate the database to another server and let the application deal with it? or I dont need that? Actually am not facing a slow system rather than a sudden stop of service when i got 3.68 GB ram out of 6 GB ram reache this limit the website does not open (down), But I am still able to access the server and restart apache then it starts working again. php version 5.4.6-1 MySQL client version: 5.5.32 Apache /2.2.22 . am running  moodle normally not common gateway interface and my error log is fine you quick response is highly appreciated Thank you",

Often density of use increase is not addressed when setting up moodle at first time of exploitation life. Check also if service goes down because Apache goes away or if your My sql server goes down... Often when a system goes out of memory, some processes are discarded to leave system core safe... i had several cases when mysql goes done before other processes, breacking anyway the service. Load will not so much come from amount of users, but from amount of concurrent users playing on the site, and multiplied by density of resources that are downloaded by users. A big moodle log table can also cause some kind of slow queries sometimes, it should be cleaned or even routed to a physical file drop down engine.... Also check what can happen with crowded courses, f.e : a course with all your users inside. Some processes used in cron could have a big work to do in such cases, moreover if people get really active.... What cache strategy are u using ?",

We are running some courses (>150). Registered users >95000. Problem- During peak hours and half-yearly appraisal cycles the perfromance of server degrades. Users get frustrated. Pages and documens load very slowly. We are planning to use load-balancing with TWO webservers. Pls suggest whichever solution is best has worked for you. In future we might not use Solaris but something like Redhat. Also suggest things to do to improve performance e.g use of higher RAM or use SCSI harddrives etc.",

We find that the quiz performance of Moodle 2.6.1 is better than the previous version 2.4.4. The average response time is <= 1.6s with very small number of errors. In general, the action of replying the forum has recorded the maximum response time of about 60s. However, the followings are some interesting observations: 1)      Moodle 2.6.1 uses more cpu resources by about 30% than the previous Moodle 2.4.4 version 2)      Using a single memcached server for MUC is better than using 2 or more memcached servers 3)      Submitting the quizzes is in general faster than replying the forums 4)      A lot of Moodle errors would occur if we change to use memcached session instead of database session in config.php in an attempt to achieve even better performance May i have your valuable comments on these 4 observations? e.g. how to configure the MUC? number of memcached servers that should be used? how to further tune up the Moodle server? Thank you very much. CP",

I run my own VPS (purchased from GoDaddy) for about 12 courses/year, about 500 students/year.  Yep, there is an expense to this method.  Depending upon your budget, there are other ways to run moodle.  You can also consider starting with the free MoodleCloud platform, but for 300 students you will need to pay to upgrade it.  50 students on MoodleCloud is free.  This is a good place to start for learning Moodle.",

I can't remember the full details of all of the changes, but one change would be to disable combo loading. At the moment, for much of our CSS and JS, we combine multiple files into a single file (this is called combo loading). This is great for reducing the number of trips with HTTP1, but means that sometimes content is less easy to cache. This is because different files will be combined in different orders on different pages. The browser is only aware of the entire combination of pages as a single resource. That is to say that when you request files a, b, and c as a combo-loaded set, you get all three, in that order. The browser knows them as abc. If on another page you get them in a different order, or only get a subset of them (e.g. ab), then your browser doesn't match that set to the one it has in it's cache and goes to fetch ab from the server again. By switching off this combo loading for spdy connections, we can better cache the content in the browser. The browser will ask for a, b, and c separately and cache them separately. When you go to a different page where only a, and b are used, they can be found in the cache and are served immediately. With HTTP, combo loading is good because of the cost of round trips, etc. but with the introduction of spdy we can send multiple requests in parallel in a single transaction. Hope that explains things a little, Andrew",

We have seperate LMS and DB servers with quad core processores and 8 GB memory. Mysql optimizations have been done as per the moodle recommendations. Is there anything else we can do resolve this slowness and reduce the server load  in moodle when it is INNODB.Any help would be appreciated Thank you Aswin",

I checked the logs and everything seemed fine (I saw plenty of errorless activity at the same time as the error). I thought then that it must have been a momentary network glitch. I tried to run the Item Analysis myself and then saw what was happening.\n\nIt appears that if moodle is running a large script then it almost \"times out\" without error. The quiz results overview screen/script works without issue. But when I click on \"Item Analysis\" it will sit and choke on it for awhile and then returns with the screen that I've attached below. Its like it loads the header and the Visible Groups option and then nothing beneath it.\n\nI've checked into the performance settings in moodle and uped the Extra PHP Memory limit to its max value of 1024 Mb and still the same error occurs. I run a continous ping check to the sql server and it keeps the connection fine. I've also watched performance stats (cpu and mem) on both the web server and sql server and neither of those go maxed. I set the value max_execution_time to 600 in php.ini. I still get the same resutls.\n\nHas anyone experienced this issue before and found any methods to resolve it?",

For the database, you have to import another whole load of data. Aparantly that database is on a different machine. The question is whether you can \"link\" the two machines. First check whether this simple solution works. You know that a database is a _server_. That means, programs on other machines can talk to the database through the network. So how about - create the Moodle database too on the database machine - install the Moodle PHP-scrips and $moodledata on the first machine - tell the first machine that the database is in the second machine. Could this be the answer? If yes, people can explain in more detail how to achive this.",

We get asked this type of question a LOT, so you may want to have a look through the forum discussions and see what the answer was previouly. I would note that \"3,000 concurrent users\" is a big number. You need to be very clear about what you understand by \"concurrent users\", what they will be doing and that this number is somewhere near correct. If you get this an order of magnitude wrong then it either won't work or cost you a lot of money (or both). My best advice is that if you are asking this sort of question then the best answer is for you to run a much smaller pilot to start with and gain some real-world experience.",

          "Text": "Hi Lourdes, Being in a situation where I both host my own site on a dedicated server and have found it necessary to occasionally use a moodle partner (Bill Burgos, as I am based in Japan) I thought I might offer my opionion. If your site is small scale with a small number of users (I would say less than one hundred) and only likely to be in one language, then you will probably progress reasonably by hosting it yourself. However, with a site of the scale you are suggesting I think you would find that your life would be much more straightforward if you used a moodle partner. You may find that as your site grows in complexity and term of use that the kind of problems (although likely to be very few) may often not always be the kind you can fix in a straightforward manner yourself as they will also tend to grow in complexity as the site grows. The use of unicode and mixing of languages can also throw up some interesting situations that you may need to resolve. The moodle partner, as well as being highly skilled themselves, also has the ear of the developers (including the founder) and this can be extremely helpful. I had a problem recently to do with converting the mix of encodings I had ended up with on my site which has been running since a much earlier version of moodle over to unicode, and I was amazed at the lengths of time that the partner went to to ensure that the problem was dealt with in a timely manner, especially considering that I thought the fee for this task was extremely reasonable. My only regret is that I didn't start using a partner a long time ago, as it would have saved me a large amount of misdirected effort and time that could have been better spent on things I have a bit more of a talent for . . .

Here's what AWS support eventually said: \n```text\nWhile the distributed architecture of Amazon EFS enables high levels of availability, durability, and scalability, it results in a small latency overhead \nfor\n each file operation. Due to \nthis\n per-operation latency, overall throughput generally increases as the average I/O size increases, since the overhead is amortized over a larger amount of data.\n \nIf the workload involves reading/writing lots of small files(or copying these files), the per-operation latencies can result in EFS performance being different from a local file system performance. This is why performance is degraded when dealing with small r/w IOPs - it is a limitation of the EFS architecture.\n```\n Basically, EFS works just fine for many use cases, but some specific architectural decisions Amazon make for EFS cause Moodle to have inconsistent and slow performance when the Moodle dataroot is on an EFS volume. Using Redis caching for sessions and a local RAM disk localcache folder didn't even fix this. No matter what, Moodle will do quite a few small file operations on the moodledata folder, and that increased per-operation latency kills your site performance.",

          "Text": "I am administering a moodle site which has been up and running for about 3 years, running on 2.9.1 (build 20150711). We have approximately 50 courses. The courses use the Quiz activity.  They consist of somewhere between 8 and 20 quizes, each of which has some number of questions (usually about 10 questions) to be answered by the student.  The student submits his quiz attempt which is manually graded by the teacher. The courses run indefinitely and a person can enroll on the course at any time and do the course at his own pace.  (As opposed to the course running for a semester or period and then being reset.) As a result, there are large numbers of students enrolled on some courses.  The largest course has about 1200 students on the course. But the number of students active at any one time is not that high.  Per the server statistics there are approximately 250 logins per day, which is approximately 160 unique students per day. I have various complaints about performance of the site, particularly for the Teacher role.  Getting into the grading pages for the larger courses is very slow and sometimes the page gets an error due to a timeout or something. I am seeking general advice on how to improve performance.  Even with 1200 students on a course it doesn't seem like this should cause a performance issue.  A mysql / mariadb database should be able to deal with that volume of data without any difficulty. I am hoping that there is some obvious incorrect setting or basic maintenance action  that would open the door to markedly increased performance. Any advice as to recommended RAM, CPU, apache settings, my sql settings for optimum performance would be welcomed.  As well as any troubleshooting steps I could take to analyze where the problem lies. Thank you in advance! Chris Biggs",

          "Text": "Hey Everyone, I'm sorry for the long post, but this issue is driving me crazy and hope someone could help me with a solution. I'm administrating our company's Moodle from the Front end side, and we are having and issue with one of our Courses, where the issue in this particular Course, the slowness when anyone attempts to create any activity such as Quizzes. What happens exactly is, when you attempt to create a quiz, the webpage load the Quiz settings forum, and once you finish customizing it, and chose either save or save and return to course, the page hangs and keeps loading, for almost 1 minute \"give or take\" until the activity is saved. this issue also happens when you try and edit the quiz setting for example or editing any questions content and any other activity. Also worth noting that this issue is only present if your attempting to add or editing something, but if your a student who's answering a quiz or attending to a survey, you wouldn't feel any performance issues. This issue is only available in one of our courses, the reset of the courses are not effected. however the effected course is highly populated with content, where it contains over 4 surveys and one of them have almost 15000+ responses alone, not to mentions over 60 to 70 quizzes with a question banks that contains over 1500 questions and a few uploaded videos. I thought this issue might be related to PHP memory limit, since we faced a similar issue last year, where our questionnaire didn't load it's content duo to a limited memory that was allocated to PHP, the allocated memory Was 128MB and we increased it to 256MB, and everything worked fine after that. I thought this time that the page load time is related to a limited memory duo to the available amount of data within the course, So I have contacted our IT team who handles our Moodle back end side , and asked them to increase the PHP allocated memory from from 256MB to 1024MB and reboot the web server. However the issue wasn't resolved sadly. Our current Moodle Version is 3.0.2. so now i'm kinda stuck and i'm not sure how to track this issue and solve it. Yours, Ahmed",

You might find database is in need of tweaking ... just like you've done for PHP. If the Activity involves uploading of a file or linking to a file that wasn't present before the edit/creation, that could mean a bottle neck with moodledata/filedir ... where the files are stored.   If moodledata is on a network file system, checking into the networking between the code server and moodledata on the NFS is in order. Those 2 are guesses as some additional information about the moodle set up has not been shared (devil many times is in the details) like: Operating system, PHP version, MySQL version ... and if load balanced or not, etc.. Can say this ... moodle 3.0.x is old ... in need of an upgrade.  Your PHP version can be a 7.0.x but the version of Moodle you are running I don't think can be run under 7.1 of PHP.

And will people notice a saver performance hit once the course module starts to rebuild it cached data from scratch ? also if i visited the course, once i purged the coursemod info cached data, and if it slow, what the solution will be ? right now we are suspecting that the issue might be related to our DB being less optimized for large data structure which might have cased this performance hit on our populated courses, we are still checking out with our development team, since they have experience with MySQL administration and creation. and hopefully we will be able to see how the DB is looks like once we get our hand on the required username and password to access it.",

This is our moodle site: https://learning.health.org.kw/ Our original grade was 'F', and it changed to 'C', when I adopted Yslow suggestions regarding 'Content Delivery Network (CDN)' Our poorest performance is for: http request, DOM elements, components that are not 'cookie-free', 70 static components without a 70 static components without a far-future expiration date, etc. This is the complete report: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-wvoM6OdO1TeS1YUWFnTEtpQjg/edit?usp=sharing I thought that, perphaps, some of the elements of our customised theme (although we don't use jquery) could be related to this poor rate. I changed to 'Standard', which is the most basic theme for Moodle, but I still got a rate 'F' in the Yslow final score (the standard theme itself has has 47 external Javascript scripts and 7 external stylesheets) Before I install WinCache in our test serve, I would like to ask if I should take the Yslow recommendations serious or  not.

Most of the recommendations are actually a little bogus in this case, for example if you actually look at the page source, you'll see that there are only about three JS files included in the head, and two of those are minified and combo loaded. The rest of the files that YSlow is reporting ( Put JavaScript at bottom) are added by the YUI loader in the footer. I also notice that you are (now?) gzipping content on the fly, so that recommendation should be improved now too. Similarly, a majority of Moodle JS, CSS , and images already do set a far-future expiry date as long as you aren't in theme designer mode, or have any of the other related settings altered (e.g. jsrev, cachejs, etc). From Moodle 2.5, we'll also be combining more of our JS requests, and minifying their code. We've also removed a couple more JS requests, and much of the CSS will be improved too, hopefully reducing the amount of markup and redundant CSS selectors. Andrew",

Code optimizers are a must though if you are concerned about speed.",

A single Dell SC1420 server with 4GB ram, two 2.8 ghz processors, and two 500gb hard disks is more than sufficient for these needs (all are over 3 years old, so you will get this kind of hardware now very cheaply--under US$1500).",

Since it is a school of 500 students, we can assume 30 Students, a whole class going online, as the peak load. At the current recommendation of 40 MB per process, 1.2 GB is required. So any currenct server with a 2 GHz (single) processor, 2 GB RAM should be sufficient. At this low demand the \"speed\" of the operating system is irrelevant. You can take anything: *BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, any other Unix. Diskspace requirement of the system is minimal. Moodle source is 50-100 MB. A (decent) OS might need 1 GB, and another GB for temporary files, logs, etc. You'll have almost the whole thing for user data.",

For scenarios such as yours, I would personally use Postgresql . If replication is required, then I'd use the streaming replication that appeared in Postgres 9.0 Additionally, I'd also use a connection pooler - pgpool II and pgbouncer are the main ones. When it comes to System Architecture, there are many options and it completely depends on your budget, experience, existing kit, etc. My former colleague Dan put together a presentation for a previous Moodle Moot entitled 'Moodle for 1000 schools' which details some of the issues we hit and the ways we addressed them. It's available on slideshare at http://www.slideshare.net/poltawski/moodle-moot-uk-07-presentation . At the time we were using multi-master MySQL replication, but moved away from that as soon as possible. I also gave a presentation at MaharaUK 2011 on this subject but for Mahara . It should still be relevant though - http://www.slideshare.net/andrewnicols/mahara-uk-2011-building-mahara-for-multiple-institutions-8410961 As a side note, it's generally better and more appreciated if you start a new thread rather than start a tangent on a very old thread (3.5 years since the last post).

However, half of our employees are in the Asia Pacific region and when they try to access videos, these videos are terribly slow. In trying to avoid adding another Moodle server to an office in the APAC region, I was wondering if there is a way to just add the videos to a repository on a server in that region and then have links point to the videos there--based on the student's location (which I would presume Moodle would determine based on the student's profile or LDAP settings?",

You need to understand what the server is doing while it is \"slow\". Are these \"on premises\" servers or \"cloud\" hosting. What, by any metric you like, is the \"size\" of your site (how many active users or similar)? Have you run Moodle's Performance Report. It's basic but still worth running. I would be checking what the database is doing and what Redis is doing. For Redis also, if you can, check the network (Redis generates a lot of traffic and can swamp the network). Check very carefully that Caching is correctly configured. Check sessions handling - is this using Redis as well? Do NOT use the database for sessions.

Now coming to your desktop, where your CPU and RAM are more than sufficient, chances are you'll be stuck with 5400 RPM SATA Drive, which though still shouldn't be an issue for the Moodle to load pages in ~5 seconds, have you enabled Zend opcache in PHP? As I have seen much more improvement using that, apart, I couldn't understand the need of Apache if you are on Windows already (now assuming you are on Windows 8 Standard as opposed to Windows 8 PRO that comes with IIS Express). try enabling opcache and see if performance improves, as I have tested on WIndows Server 2012 R2, with IIS, My SQL and have tested RAW, with WinCache (IIS's PHP accelerator) and with enabling zend opcache as well, though WinCache does improves over performance but opcache's performance was really worth a praise, with page loading times of less than a second and I hadn't even allocated full of my resources to server o/s, but was running on a VM with 1 core CPU and 1GB RAM allocated. Just to mention, opcache comes as part of package since PHP 5.5, so make sure you have PHP 5.5 to make use of it, if you aren't using it already.",

On the link below, you'll find PHP 5.3 and 5.4 with opcache DLL's, all you have to do is download the files and add .dll file to your ext directory. in addition tot that, you'll be adding these lines of code in your PHP.INI file, save it and restart your Apache. [ExtensionList] zend_extension=php_opcache.dll You can change the above values as per your requirement (like increasing memory consumption etc), but these values I have written are default recommended when firing up zend opcache, so even keeping these values will bring substantial improvement. for opcache version 7.0.3, you can go to this link http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/opcache/7.0.3/ for opcache version 7.0.4 http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/opcache/7.0.4/ for opcache version 7.0.5 (being latest with Moodle bug fixed) http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/opcache/7.0.5/ (only available for 5.3 and 5.4) Be assured you are downloading NTS (Non-Thread Safe) version, limitation is for 5.3 and 5.4 versions there isnt x64 available. Just to be assured PHP is now working and enabled in your PHP, open your PHP INFO file in your browser, and you'll see Zend Opcache's logo and settings showing up. if you'd been using the WIMP combo (I as in IIS) then I could have assisted you more, but on Linux and Apache, my hands are bound, I am pure windows person.",

A quick test would be to check the storage prior to creating the MyMoodle for a user and after. That will give you what your overhead for storage would be and I would say to add another 10% to that figure just to insure you have a buffer. I know this is not an answer but I hope it help.

The error log you are seeing is when there is another request currently open for that session and it is waiting for that session lock to close before it can get another one. This could be a long running session of starting a quiz, login, report running, course backup etc. Normally it happens if a user is completing a long task in one window/tab then tries to open another tab and keep working. The session is still locked to the first tab until it completes, so the second tab gets the \"cannot obtain session lock\". Another option instead of window/tabs are ajax requests. With debugging enabled, is there any other information showed? In the access/error logs, can you determine which script they were trying to access when this happens. Try searching based on IP address in the logs to find out what the user was doing. Moodle 3.9 has some good improvements in the session locking space as it allows some scripts to use read only sessions which won't hold the session lock. It has to be enabled in the config.php file but it might be worth trying to upgrade. Do you have the MUC and Sessions in the same redis instance? Have the app/db/redis servers been configured/tuned at all? With properly tuned database, redis, php etc, 5-600 concurrent quizzes should be obtainable.",

I have increased the timeout limit : $CFG->session_redis_acquire_lock_timeout = 15000; and it seems to solve the problem.  I will confirm as soon as I have carried out a test. Azure Cache for Redis has a link for Best practices, which recommends the following: Configure your client library to use a connect timeout of at least 15 seconds, giving the system time to connect even under higher CPU conditions. A small connection timeout value doesn't guarantee that the connection is established in that time frame. If something goes wrong (high client CPU, high server CPU, and so on), then a short connection timeout value will cause the connection attempt to fail. This behavior often makes a bad situation worse. Instead of helping, shorter timeouts aggravate the problem by forcing the system to restart the process of trying to reconnect, which can lead to a connect -> fail -> retry loop. We generally recommend that you leave your connection Timeout at 15 seconds or higher. It's better to let your connection attempt succeed after 15 or 20 seconds than to have it fail quickly only to retry. Such a retry loop can cause your outage to last longer than if you let the system just take longer initially. Lien",

When I go into the Participants list, select a couple of people I'd like to send an email to and send, one of the messages gets to a Hotmail address, but which is considered Junk, and the other sends a MAILERDAEMON back from Gmail saying that their system has considered the mail to be possible spam and refuses to deliver it for security reasons. The Hotmail mail can be read by telling the system that the Junk mail is actually safe, but there's nothing that can be done about the Gmail. Also, this is just a test to confirm that there is something fishy going on with a dozen other users who aren't getting Discussion Forum posting email alerts. I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and have the proper cronjob running and have started Postfix. I can also send email using mailx and the same Gmail address that fails when trying to do this via the Moodle platform external email messaging system by going to Participants and checking the box and then telling Moodle I'd like to send a message to the same address. Anyone have any idea what's going on here. Again, the ultimate goal is to figure out why emails aren't going out when people post in a Discussion Forum, but I must crack this nut first.",

Can you explain how you arrived at that figure / what you think it means? I would normally suggest a concurrency figure (I define that as web server processes active in memory at the same time) of around 5-10% as a typical starting point. Other than that, an \"off the shelf\" small server will be fine. You just need to work out how much disk space you need (we can't tell you that). If you can afford SSDs all the better. The only possible issue with materials is video. Video can be a nightmare as there is no reliable 'standard' for video on the web. What will work reliably on some devices won't work on others.

My small moodle has around 150 students in it.  At any one point in time, I might see 5 to 10 students in it while I am in.  That these students are \"concurrently\" hitting buttons is very unlikely. Having said this, I do remember a time when I used Moodle to give an exam in class.  At the beginning of class I told all 40 students to login to Moodle and begin their exam.  I had a small hosted server at the time, and it actually took two to four minutes for all 40 students to get logged in.  But then my Moodle was fine. So if you had a similar situation with 200 students, maybe they would all be \"concurrent.\" My bigger concern is with your videos.  I used to have my videos on the same server as my moodle.  I had to move them to a separate server because my Moodle was slowing down when students were streaming my videos.  There might be some server-side settings to alleviate (or tweak) this problem, but I am not that skilled of a \"server\" admin.  I am just a professor.",

          "Text": "Dear Emmanuel, although I do not know the specific features of an 100webSpace account, I can give you some advice from my point of view: 1. Most of the content in a moodle package is contributed by the language files. If you unpack the package locally (i.e. on your PC), go to the lang directory and eliminate all the languages you think are not relevant for your learners in the first place, you might well end up with around 7 MB file size if you then re-zip the whole package. 2. When installing the package on the remote server, I can definetely recommend to to this by transferring the zip file to the server and unzip it there, because unzipping it locally and then transferring file by file is either not feasible (if done manually) or at least very time-consuming (if done with some software like WSFTP). 3. Another quite tricky thing is one php setting (if php is not available on the remote server, you can forget about running Moodle anyway): if SAFE_MODE is activated (which is the case for my webspace provider) AND there are different user IDs for web administration/ FTP on one hand and running php scripts on the other hand, you constantly run into problems whenever Moodle tries e.g. to create new directories. This is because if SAFE_MODE is on, a specific (Unix-) user might only work with files and directories which belong to him. Hoping that this was not too confusing, I wish you good luck for getting up to speed with Moodle! Greetings from Germany",

I would expect the multi-processor cum multi-threading behaviour of LAMP deep inside the interaction of PHP with the kernel and kernel itself plus its disk drivers. And then there is a similar chapter for MySQL . That SATA drives need CPU does not necessarily mean that they make the server slow, unless it is the bottleneck. I could imagine throwing up a huge memory and making the server to cache frequently requested data making the disk performannce less relevant. IMHO there is no general answer. You have to find out the bottleneck in your setup. For that you have to tweak things and monitor your individual benchmark result.",

From the technical side (and from our readings since posting) - it seems that Ubuntu server is very capable of driving multiple cores already [that was one concern we had, that it wasn't], but the collisions seem to happen at the my sql level...  so our take is: give mysql all the help we can - lots of RAM to cache with, memcached behind it, use APC to keep the PHP cycle demands down (ie, make more cycles available for other tasks), and if we do have thread blocking, hopefully they'll be for as short a period as possible. W/re SATA drives using threads - from our readings: that's not going to be a problem given Ubuntu's abilities already - so, again, one less concern....  so, bottom line: we'll replace the 2 core processor with a 4 and give it a go. again, thanks for the reply - greg ps. quite impressive in the change with going to APC - trivial response time dropped to 50ms +/-5ms down from 360ms +/- 20ms - not having to recompile everytime does make a difference. [these times are measured from another server on the net, and are the time from initiating the request to having the response.]",

At 1500-2000 students reqistered for 20ish classes, I'm betting that single box will be able to handle the load - but that's why I'm asking the question up front, just in case I'm surmising incorrectly, or outside of other's experience. The first split I was looking at was moving the DB onto another machine, but then adding in the latency of going over a gigabit link, my bet was that that delay would be greater than that induced by collisions btwn threads and apache vs mysql. Unfortunately, that configuration is harder to test than swapping processors and seeing what happens. again, thanks - greg",

I wish I could quantitize the collisions, ie, yes I can see collisions occuring if all 8 threads get into mysql..  but this system has other overhead tasks to perform, which might/should occupy some of the threads, especially with 3 SATA drives running in RAID 1, ie, each write is going to require 3 actual write, or 3 threads? W/re more disks - I think instead of going RAID 10, which would cut in half the reliability (vs the current RAID 1), ie, same data now has to come from 2 vs 1 working drives; I'd be more inclined to go with SSD disks and stay with the RAID 1. I can triple my write bandwidth that way; and got something like 8x on the read side...  but doing such would double the cost of the server (currently at $450). We'll see what performance looks like and move from there. Related question to all: I've run the script in an above thread (how many function calls/sec etc), and we come in toward the top of the posted data...  but I don't feel very secure in that, in that I'm not sure the script measures anything useful. My question is: is there public domain a script that one can run from within Moodle to simulate n users (loggin in, browsing content, and taking a test)? Or from another machine on the net, pretending to be n machines? Part of this question has to do with how Moodle \"keeps a user logged in\" - to my eye it's using IPaddr logging - is this correct? Or is such via cookies? (Origianlly I had thought this was done via hidden variables and forms - but looking at the html this is incorrect.) I had originally started writing a windoze program that was going to pretend to be 50ish users, doing the above... until I came to the conclusion that Moodle was doing IP logging to keep track of user, making it impossible for a single machine to pretend to n users. So: 2 question: are there scripts out there already, public domain that can do load testing; and b) is Moodle using IPlogging to keep a user logged in (or is this via cookies, or ???)? many thanks - greg",

Umm ... I think there's a flaw in your reasoning here. RAID 10 is not a reduction in reliability over RAID 1. RAID 10 is a stripe of two or more RAID 1 arrays. While the RAID 0 stripe could theoretically fail if both halves of a component RAID 1 array fails, that's really no different than what you have now with RAID 1. The array as a whole is 100% redundant and will keep running if any drive fails. The \"same data coming from 2vs 1 working drives\" is not an accurate statement. RAID 10 means that the server can pull from *either* of the mirrored drives within the array, not both. That's all the reliability of RAID 1 with twice the speed (broadly speaking). The same data being available from multiple drives is a *benefit* not a liability. In a basic four-drive RAID 10 array, the server can be accessing four drives simultaneously with four different requests compared to a two-drive RAID 1 array where there are only two simultaneous requests possible. Personally, when I have more than two drives I prefer to run RAID 5 (with a hot spare if I have more than three drives). You get redundancy, comparable performance and more usable storage for the same number of drives (n-1 or n-2 instead of n/2). Mirroring uses too much space and doesn't provide much (if any) of an improvement in reliability. Regardless, before you even look at adding drives cram as much RAM as you can into the box - the kernel will use it to cache the disk traffic, MySQL will cache queries - Not only does that free the drives to serve additional traffic, it's an order of magnitude faster to pull from cache than it is to pull from disk. If after adding RAM you still feel you need to add drives, I'm with Martin - don't replace what you have, leave it in place and add to it. The more physical drives you can spread the data over, the better. Add more drives to the existing array or add a second array and split your data between them - for example, but the webroot on one array and the database on the other. SSDs are overkill for anything but the largest sites, and even then I'm not convinced they're going to land on the positive side of a cost/benefit analysis. If you're going to double the cost of the server by going with SSDs, buy a second server instead and run your database on it. Additional RAM for cache and/or separating the database onto a separate server will provide a much greater impact for the money that paying a premium for SSDs. Part of this question has to do with how Moodle \"keeps a user logged in\" - to my eye it's using IPaddr logging - is this correct? Or is such via cookies? Cookies and session files, not IP address. If you want to simulate a bunch of users hitting the server, take a look at using JMeter or Selenium. Those tools are designed to test web applications like this.",

Also try changing your theme to the 'standard' Moodle theme - I had a problem recently with one of our Moodles taking 20-30 seconds to load pages, and I traced it to the theme, which was trying to launch cron jobs when it displayed the page header and was being blocked, causing it to hang for a long time.  When I took out the block of code which ran the cron jobs I immediately started to get <2 second page loads.

          "Text": "Hi Dr. Moodlearner, There are a few bottlenecks that could be causing this slowdown (this post assumes your server is running Linux). Here are just a sample of the big ones that we've encountered: Network congestion: if Jez H's suggestion of using admin/server/debugging shows that your pages are processing quickly, yet displaying slowly in your browser, this indicates some sort of network delay between your machine and the server. CPU contention: run 'top' on your server to get an idea of cpu usage while trying to load pages. If CPU usage is high, check out which process is using the most %CPU (could be httpd, mysqld, etc...). This will indicate which process is consuming CPU, taking you one step closer to resolving the issue. High load: if your CPU usage is low, yet your \"load average\" in top is high (over 1.50), then this indicates your server might be I/O constrained from some device (hard drive, networked file system, etc...). Non-optimal configuration: I would check how your hosting provider configured MySQL, Apache, and PHP (my.cnf, httpd.conf, and php.ini respectively). If you continue to experience delays and the posted suggestions do not identify the source of the delay, you may want to post these three configuration files for other moodlers to analyze & comment on. \"Also I don't understand \" you don't run SCORM content on moodle instance \" is there another way?\" What I meant by my comment is that in my moodle instance, I do not have SCORM content and am not familiar with SCORM. I hope this information is helpful!",

I am not terribly familiar with the topic of content pre-positioning, but as I understand it, from the service provider side (moodle) it would need to generate a manifest of resources which a content engine on the clients server would use to obtain the resources prior to their being requested by an end user.  Since we hide all our moodle resources in a directory above the http root (as suggested and with good reason) it would seem to me that this will foil any attempt to pre-position the content. Does anybody have any experience with this topic?",

          "Text": "Todd, This is a very good topic you have raised, I'll chime in with my 2 cents worth of opinion. I've been testing out various scenario's recently in terms of using video in Moodle and where/how it should be stored. This issue will continue to be more relevant as multimedia resources are definetely on the rise. Examining the issue of where video resources used in a course should be stored is a good starting point (for course creator), IMO . I am of the opinion they should rarely be stored in Moodle itself.  Somewhere slightly north of about 700mb of video stored within a Moodle instance and one may start to experience backup/restore problems.  If you only have say a few short video clips (3-5 minutes each), and you have done a good job compressing these, one should be good with just including them in Moodle. However, if video resources are used extensively consider storing these files externally and simply linking to them. Moodle 2 has some excellent new storage options available, like DropBox. Other options can be added by a developer. If one is not overly concerned about security they can always use services like YouTube or Vimeo. If security is critical and you use a lot of video, consider a separate storage service in the data center and look at the various streaming options out there ( Kaltura is an excellent one and its open source). With Kaltura you also have greater control over the security issue. I'm coming around to this (Kaltura) option actually as services like DropBox are really not geared toward handling video. Servers set up for dumb file storage vs. those provisioned to handle video, are completly different animals. Lastly, how video is best prepared might be another good topic for this discussion.",

          "Text": "In December 2010 I upgraded to the much anticipated Moodle 2.0. After all the dust settled and I realized that I lost all of my prior courses and that Moodle 2.0 has no ability to implement backed up versions I started working on rebuilding. This wouldn't have been too bad because I have only ~100 students and no more than a half-dozen active courses at any one time.... except my installation of Moodle 2.0 was running much slower than 1.9. I limped through the start of classes for the new term and just recently decided to tackle the speed issue. I have a few possible partial solutions but I would also welcome input. I contacted bluehost.com (my webhost ) and was told that now that Moodle 2.0 uses PHP 5 I should consider using \"PHP5 (FastCGI)\" instead of the \"Standard PHP (Default).\" I made the switch and noticed decreased load times. Does anyone have a recommendation on the best way to measure the difference in performance? If you want to try it here is what you do for a bluehost account: login to cpanel scroll down to the \"Software/Services\" section. Open the \"PHPConfig\" tool. Select \"PHP5 (FastCGI)\" I was told to also look at the way Moodle uses cacheing and review the \"my sql _slow_queries\" logs. I don't know how to work on the caching and the logs don't mean much to me. I also decided to download \" Firebug \" for Firefox ( http://getfirebug.com/ ) and the Firebug extension \"Page Speed\" ( http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/ ). I haven't used Firebug much (still don' know what it can do) but PageSpeed analysis of my site makes me wonder if I should customize my theme and optimize the images. It also recommends combining the external JavaScript (which is probably way above my ability) and specify image dimensions. I am using the \"Formal White\" theme that is \"for modern browsers\"  and wonder if there is a theme that is already optimized for performance that would meet my needs. I will be demonstrating my Moodle-based site to my supervisor and know that our college is getting ready to look at new LMS contracts... I would like my site to be fast and easy for me to use (and continue to develop) so that maybe our institution will head towards Moodle. If so I will definately encourage them to go with a Moodle Host provider. Thank you for your attention and Happy Moodling.",

I actually have two servers I am testing. Server 1 - InMotion Hosting VPS-1000 4GB Ram MySQL Database Moodle 2.7.1 APC enabled Server 2 - Cloudways 1GB Ram My SQL Database Moodle 2.7.1 APC enabled Varnish turned off (Varnish results in repeated log outs...) The second server at Cloudways seems to run a bit faster.  This seems counterintuitive, as RAM is supposed to be about the most important thing for getting a server to run fast. Does anyone know if my Hardware on server 2 should be getting the job done.  It can passably serve up the quiz, but the load times for pages are often between 10 and 20 seconds.  I really need it to run faster.    I do know if I move up to the 2GB server level, I get 2 cores instead of 1, but I have absolutely no idea if that makes any difference. Finally, I have noticed that I could be running Memcache instead of or along with APC, I really don't know much about that. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.",

          "Text": "Increasing maxclients is only going to lead to more trouble... You have to figure out much memory per apache \"child\" you need. If ou turn on peformance profiling (see config-dist.php), it'll give you a reasonable hint of how much unshared mem each child uses. \"top\" with the right optiosn also helps. You want to know how much free memory you have (RAM - system usage) how much a \"client\" needs, that is, the apache child memory + my sql child memory. And then you compute \n```text\nfree memory / (apache+mysql child pair usage + 20%)\n```\n Which gives you an initial estimate, with a 20% safety margin. Then you tune set Apache's maxclients and MySQL maxconnections to that value (for Mysql, add 10% so non-apache processes like admin/cron.php can connect). Using MaxClients and maxconnections, what you achieve is prevent those two from using all your memory -- the trick is to avoid using swap at all costs, the moment your webserver touches swap, it is toast. Now, with that \"working set\" optimally trimmed, your performance tuning should be focused around Having a precompiler (turkmmcache recommended) Minimizing disk accesses. I'd recommend you use the perf logging options mentioned before. Note that OSX performs very badly on disk-bound work, specially with high-concurrency -- exactly the type of work Apache/PHP and MySQL put under. Linux on the very same hardware will be several times faster. We've done a lot of tuning on OSX, and tested hfs+ and ufs, but the infamous \"OSX kernel lock\" kills concurrent usage, and the disk and filesystem drivers aren't as fast as the ones in Linux. OTOH, if you keep having malloc errors, blame the PHP build... not Moodle ;) (If you search for maxclients in this forum, I've posted quite a bit. I learned these techniques with mod_perl, which has the same constraints that PHP does. The best guide for this is Stas Bekman's mod_perl guide -- it has a full chapter on how to tune maxclients...)",

          "Text": "Hi JMeter results give some indication of the server load through time delays, etc. But for a better diagnosis, you must monitor key parameters like cpu load and memory usage. As documented in https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/realtime-results.html the solution from Apache is https://grafana.com/docs/ . I usually get all I need from CLI tools. Linux kernel keeps loads of internal information in user readable form. As a result there are uncountable number of tools which extract this information for you. The Sar (sysstat) package is perhaps the most famous. Writing those numbers in to a file and displaying real-time is fun. Of course there are many, many sophisticated tools for that. P.S. Saw your other thread: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=420280 . Has it been resolved now? If so, pl. document the solution and mark as resolved.

The MaxConnectionsPerChild is used to limit memory leakage and the Servers settings are just so that the server jumps up ready for connections. I don't really have evidence to backup up the specific values for any of those but they've been working well for us for 5+ years. Keep in mind settings will vary based on whether you are running one server or multiple ones. We run one apache web server, 10 vCPU, 32 GB Ram and using SSD local storage. MySQL DB on a seperate server but on the same virtual host. This serves about 3000 users annually, with about 10-30 average users on at one time within a 30 minute window, peaking at about 60-70. From my jmeter benchmark tests, this setup can handle about 100-150 concurrent users without significantly slowing down using a simulated mix of forum browsing/posting, quiz taking and scorm module viewing. I'm still on PHP 5.6 but only tweaks I did there other than post_max_size/upload_max_filesize and max_execution_time is the opcache settings, the only changes from defaults that came with it are: opcache.max_accelerated_files =  8000 opcache.revalidate_freq = 60 Based on https://docs.moodle.org/en/OPcache",

The moodle running well on single webapps machine (apache 2 + php 5) and single dbmachine (mysq; 5) for currently 3000 users. Im currently adding 1 more webapps into the system structure which will make 2 webserver and 1 dbserver. The 2 webserver will be load into load balancer machine. The 2nd webserver is still under testing right now and not yet activate under LB. But thereis problem with the 2nd webserver that stuck me for two days now. The problem is with the authentation part. My current working moodle do auth with CAS server for SSO. What I do acctually just copy the source from webserver 1 to webserver to and just modify the apporiate param in config.php in webserver 2. doing that the CAS making an unfinity redirect which make the firefox reply with this warning message 'The page isn't redirecting properly' which make the webserver 2 did not get the CAS login page as webserver 1. I dig deeper into CAS lib tracing the call function and dead end at the CAS/CAS/client.php lib in func checkAuthentication which somehow S_SESSION['phpCas'] have no value. Seems to me my config for CAS at webserver 2 wrong.  But the setting and config for CAS in moodle stored in DB, so for my case webserver 2 also has the same CAS setting as webserver 1 and should work.  Do anyone know why ? any clue ? Fail to auth with CAS I did some bypass to login/index,php to skip load CAS auth module seems I cannot close CAS auth parmanently in mdl_config coz user activities in webserver 1.  By doing that I hope to able log in with manual auth for user admin ( I set auth = 'manual'  for admin record in mdl_user ) But another problem surface, I wont able to log in although the pass n username is correct. Dig in mysql log I discover the query not using my admin password but using 'restored' : -> SELECT * FROM mdl_user WHERE username = 'admin' AND mnethostid = '1' AND password = 'restored' LIMIT 1 why this happen im not sure. anybody have any idea ? any clue ? thanxs in advance.",

Seems the 2nd appserver not yet active as LB node I set the $CFG->wwwroot value to my 2nd appserver IP. Yes Im also suspecting the enviroment of the 2nd appserver might not the same as 1st appserver. Thats why I bypassed the login/index.php to manual only hoping to get log as admin which then I can go to 'Administration -> Server -> Enviroment' page to see any item that need to be corrected. But moodle detected my admin user as RESTORED user ... which I do not understand why ... googling give a clue that it might be relating to MNETHOSTID ... the networking features .... which is I do not want to use ... I just wanna to LB my Moodle. Till yesterday I get no luck, even by make a new db schema for 2nd appserver pointing to. The schema DB was the copy from the Master DB. I set auth parmanently to '' which then moodle will load only manual auth. Still it recognize me as RESTORED user. This is very very stressful. My next step is to install new moodle from scratch in 2nd appserver ... maybe I get a new clue from there. Any Ideas from you guys is higly appreciated. Thanx",

But it quite mysterious as for the initial my CAS page redirection get internal loop. Do no for a solid reason for that but I guest due to cookies of the moodle apps in my desktop. From the walkthrough I can say that for Moodle Apps web server load balancing its very Straight Forward if you do no customization in the core lib.

My tech director is behind me and willing to support me on this project but he doesn't have any time to devote to helping me.  He can support me with tech consultants from the district if needed.  I am hoping that I can do this on my own. Our hope is to run Moodle from a pc located in my classroom and provide access through my website which is on the district server.  Our tech director is concerned about housing Moodle on our district server.  So I guess we need to provide access to my classroom pc.  I know that we have a t1 line for access. Initially, I don't think the volume will be very high.  I had 40 teachers sign up to be a part of the CoP.   As a trial thing I installed Moodle on my home pc using XAMPP install package and it went flawlessly. My challenge is I am having a hard time conceptualizing how we are going to provide access to the pc in my classroom.  I have never really worked on the server side of things.  I do have my own website that I created on the county server so I am familiar with ftp .  I would appreciate any advice or insight that anyone has out there.  Thanks.",

You don't necessarily need FTP (since you can just walk into the classroom and use it directly) - the question is how will people get ordinary HTTP access. Depending on the way your local network is set up your PC will have an IP address (something like 123.45.6.78) which will probably be the way it'll be accessed - i.e. by typing a web address like http://123.45.6.78/moodle/ The tricky part is that if your IP address is a local address (this is very likely) then typing a web address like the one I suggested will only work within the school's network. Participants (or you) wanting to log in from home would not be able to. Your tech person may be able to suggest a way around this (e.g. port forwarding from a globally-available IP address) but it may not be possible - depends on the network and policies. You say \"provide access through my website\" - that sounds a bit odd to me. Moodle will *either* be on your district server *or* on your classroom PC - not sure what you mean when you say you intend to provide access to your classroom PC via your website.",

However, all that aside, it's good to see another K12 district looking to adopt Moodle.  Good luck! Just a few pointers for another K12 district: Some of Moodle's function are fantastic in theory, but when it comes to giving these powerful features to K12 students, they can be used for not-so-education purposes.  We've locked down the Chat, Messaging, Forum, and Wiki modules.  We've found the Messaging feature to be completely valuble for teacher<->student communication, we modified the messaging module to make it to where students can only messages teachers of a course they are enrolled in. --Richie Foreman",

Moodle supports this natively, set it up on your server and then set Moodle to use it in the configuration variables. Moodle's standard passwords are protected by MD5, which is ok (and good enough for a number of commercial apps. such as Blackboard), but not as secure as SSL. A second issue is how easy the passwords are to guess, they should be long alphanumeric strings, ideally with a special character (*) thrown in, Moodle doesn't enforce strong passwords directly at this time (users can put in any password they like), but if you set up LDAP authentication (or other external authentication) you can enforce strong passwords on your LDAP server or external auth. server. You can keep Google out by setting that in the administration variables, also. Even if you let Google in, it can't search a course unless you have turned on guest access without a pass key for that course.",

Failing that just firewall MySql's port (3306). Accessing MySql through a firewall is much *more* risky as it's another hole in the firewall that you don't need. See MySql as just part of the Moodle distribution, not like a separate proper database.",

          "Text": "I work on a project that has implemented Moodle 3.11, and we currently have a course that is very large. Program management refuses to split the course in any way, so unless we can come to them with documentation from Moodle showing a max size for a course, we're stuck in our current situation. I'm currently attempting to make a backup of the course, and the backup fails with the error \"Cannot create local file pool file. Please verify permissions in dataroot and available disk space.\" The attempt to backup did create a folder in the data/temp/backup directory, and the backup.mbz file is around 4.9 GB. This is an increase in size from our previous backup, which was at 2.5 GB last month. We have added a lot to that course since then.  I am no longer able to create a backup successfully via the UI anymore, as I get this error, and the backup file isn't available in the Course Backup Area, though I can find the mbz in the temporary folder, as I mentioned. I get the same error if I attempt to generate the backup via cli at the command line. I also get the same error if I attempt to upload the .mbz on the course's restore page. My question is, is there a documented maximum size allowable for course backups, both in generation and in restoration? If so, what is it, and how can I find it? I need this information to take back to my program management to prove to them that the size of the course is the issue holding us back. Also, how can we find out in Moodle whether a course is becoming \"too big to back up\"?",

We are Mac and XP users here but would like to see how this player delivers in Vista before we roll it out to our customers. It's H.264 delivered via Flash so you would need the latest Flash player . Broadband would be needed too. I've set up a guest accessible course here with a couple of videos in it. One is a single video. Another is a small series of videos. There's also a forum if you'd like to post your feedback there. Thank you for your time and input.",

          "Text": "Master reason of this slowness comes essentially from the site admin construction and from settings.php and version.php check for upgrades and pulling out all settings. I noticed that the more plugins you add into moodle, the slower is this admin construction. My solution was to create a \"admin_light\" block which will replace on home page the site administration part of the menu of the standard \"settings\". Unfortunately, for this working, i had to patch a core library : navigationlib.php to trap this admin menu generation part. This redraws the function \"initialize()\" of the navigation like this : \n```text\npublic function initialise() {\n\n\n   global $DB, $SESSION, $SITE;\n```\n \n```text\n   if (during_initial_install()) {\n\n\n     return false;\n\n\n   } else if ($this->initialised) {\n\n\n      return true;\n\n\n  }\n\n\n  $this->id = 'settingsnav';\n\n\n  $this->\ncontext\n = $this->page->context;\n```\n \n```text\n  $context = $this->context;\n\n\n  if ($context->contextlevel == CONTEXT_BLOCK) {\n\n\n    $this->load_block_settings();\n\n\n    $context = $context->get_parent_context();\n\n\n  }\n```\n \n```text\n switch ($context->contextlevel) {\n\n\n   case CONTEXT_SYSTEM:\n```\n \n```text\n $settings = $this->load_user_settings($this->page->course->id);\n```\n \n```text\n// PATCH : enable admin administration in admin pages only\n\n\n global $PAGE;\n\n\n if (isloggedin() && !isguestuser() && (!property_exists($SESSION, 'load_navigation_admin') || $SESSION->load_navigation_admin) && (preg_match('/admin/', $PAGE->pagetype) || !empty($SESSION->adminlocked))) {\n\n\n $admin = $this->load_administration_settings();\n\n\n $SESSION->load_navigation_admin = ($admin->has_children());\n\n\n } else {\n\n\n $admin = false;\n\n\n }\n\n\n // /PATCH\n```\n \n```text\nif ($context->contextlevel == CONTEXT_SYSTEM && $admin) {\n\n\n $admin->force_open();\n\n\n } else if ($context->contextlevel == CONTEXT_USER && $settings) {\n\n\n $settings->force_open();\n\n\n }\n```\n \n```text\n  // Check if the user is currently logged in as another user\n\n\n  if (session_is_loggedinas()) {\n\n\n  // Get the actual user, we need this so we can display an informative return link\n\n\n  $realuser = session_get_realuser();\n\n\n  // Add the informative return to original user link\n\n\n  $url = new moodle_url('/course/loginas.php',array('id'=>$this->page->course->id, 'return'=>1,'sesskey'=>sesskey()));\n\n\n  $this->add(get_string('returntooriginaluser', 'moodle', fullname($realuser, true)), $url, self::TYPE_SETTING, null, null, new pix_icon('t/left', ''));\n\n\n  }\n```\n \n```text\n // At this point we give any local plugins the ability to extend/tinker with the navigation settings.\n\n\n  $this->load_local_plugin_settings();\n```\n \n```text\n foreach ($this->children as $key=>$node) {\n\n\n    if ($node->nodetype != self::NODETYPE_BRANCH || $node->children->count()===0) {\n\n\n       $node->remove();\n\n\n    }\n\n\n }\n\n\n  $this->initialised = true;\n\n\n}\n```\n The effect of this is : Allows site admin menu to load in all administration pages. Provides choice NOT to load it on common pages, unless you force loading in session for a while. Then the admin_light block gives you a link to go to an admin page to find your site admin menu back. This improves a loooot the loading time of the index and common pages for administrators when you combine a strongly contributed moodle version + a medium size or small size server. Note that this trick suits essentially to 2.4 and 2.5 versions, as 2.6 version have Ajaxed the administration site menu, thus defferring those long searches to an explicit query. Of course, woking with fast hard drives (SSD local drives) will be a \"hard technical\" alternative solution also... Valery.",

Several times thorough the day MySQL consumes the 8 cpus resources and stays stuck at 100% and the website slows to a crawl until my sql is restarted. Sometimes this coincides with peak times (with around 500 concurrent users), sometimes it doesn't. The ram usage doesn't go above 24-30gb even in peak times, only the cpu. Mysqltuner results show a large amount of non-indexed joins and fragmented tables. I ran optimize/repair on all tables, however don't now how to fix non-indexed joins. I checked the DB and saw that the questions table is around 11GB and 1,100,000 records, taking roughly half the space of the database. Is this normal? Could it be the culprit?

          "Text": "Hi Ivan, What are you using for monitoring tools?  If there is something that gives you database connections, that's a problem I was having with a different part of moodle, more or less the same symptom. I still don't know what exactly caused it but what seems to have helped is putting this into my.cnf: max_user_connections=80 I also had to pump the max_connections up quite a bit last year.  But I think the max_user_connections was causing the problem in max_connections.  My database connections have stabilized out at some normal levels( ~25-75 throughout the day). Previous to the max_user_connections update I would have spikes of 700+ database connections (this year on moodle 2.7, over 1000 last year on moodle 2.4), which would slow the server to a crawl. Might or might not help depending on your particular problem, but it's a change that doesn't have a huge down side. Also have you looked at error_log?  Anything in there that might shed some light on the issue?",

I know that it's well established that all you really need is a major web browser to use Moodle, but I was wondering about more specific things, like plugins that students (or faculty) are required (or highly recommended) to have for Moodle. We use a few flash things (nothing fancy) and some MP3 links (which use the filter). The question stems from a request for a way (and I've seen the block for this, but doesn't gather all of what we'd like) to be able to gather the following information about the user's computer system. This could go a ways in documenting the type of system they're accessing the server from and help us in remote troubleshooting and (more importantly perhaps) would allow us to make sure the user will have a smooth experience while using Moodle: Browser Type/Version - Easy Internet Connection Speed - Not so bad Plug-ins supported - (using mentioned block) easy Anti-virus software (Norton, McAfee, AVG, etc) - I'm thinking this would require a plug-in specifically designed to get this information (which I think is unavoidable). Is AV software up-to-date? - I suspect this could be done as well (at least, I know it could via WMI and 99% of our users are Windows users). The first 3 seem very doable... the last 2 however, seems like it would be a significant stumbling block and aren't necessarily going to be cross-platform compatible. I don't have the specific knowledge to write a plug-in that detects that information, but would seem like it would be valuable in helping a user make sure their computer was \"internet ready\" (and perhaps could be deemed relatively safe to use). How do you deal with trying to make sure a user's computer is both adequate, \"safe\" (I use that term loosely) to use on the net, and ready to handle whatever an instructor throws at them? Currently, we have a list of plugins that a user \"may need\" for both IE and Firefox . I'm just quite curious and would really appreciate some feedback on how others handle this.",

          "Text": "Hi everybody, We are currently considering the removal of the MongoDB Cache store. The rationale for this change are as follows: It was created as a proof of concept when all the caching subsystem was first created It is unlikely to be used in real prod environments because it is orders of magnitude slower than other stores like Redis, APCu, and others The php-mongodb extension is required only because of this cache store and it's a pain to build (~50% of time building PHP images is spent with that extension) The mongodb library (that uses the php-mongodb extension) is very hard to maintain, they have refactored it already a couple of times and they are slow providing compatibility with new PHP versions We welcome voting on this issue from the entire community, both positive and negative, as well as relevant discussion. If you use MongoDB, and feel that it should remain a part of the core distribution, we are particularly keen to get your feedback. For more information on this change, see the tracker issue at MDLSITE-7106 . Voting will remain open until Thursday 23rd February 2023 at 11:59pm. Best wishes, Andrew Lyons",

Uploading files of a larger size, say 16 meg takes a similar amount of time (on 100Mbs LAN). This leads me to conclude the issue is with moodle itself rather than the network or server, i.e. there is a delay in handling the data. I am using version 1.8.1 and am wondering if anyone else has observed this or has any suggestions on how I may improve the situation? Thanks, Jeremy",

However, since I'm trying to keep costs down, I've opted for a package which only gives me 128 MB of RAM. Yes, it doesn't work that well. Is there a way to strip down Moodle or somehow simplify MySQL in such a way that it runs better? Should I simply upgrade the server? If so, to what size RAM. I'm paying 14 US dollars a month, and the 250MB RAM package is double that. It's a bit steep on my budget.

          "Text": "Hi A little understanding will explain this seemingly complex issue. For a Moodle installation the code directory and the data directory are what they are, just directories (attached to the same computer). Of course using all kinds of file system technologies a directory (or a storage volume) in a different computer could be \"mounted\" to the Moodle server in such a way that the server sees this as a part of its own file system. This is commonly known as a network drive . So, if the system knows how to attach (mount) DropBox or NAS or whatever to the Moodle server and can handle file system permissions for Moodle web server , it'll work. On theory, unfortunately. Moodle is pretty sensitive about its data directory. So, you might have luck or no luck. (See Howard's reply. For more details visit the Hardware and performance forum.) It is always the trade-off between cheap infrastructure costs and expensive system administration costs. BTW , it carrying somebody else's discussion https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=406058#p1639048 in a different direction, in to one's own topic, is not appreciated. I gave this new topic a new subject line. I sent a note to the moderator to split this.",

Your general options are: a) Get the SQL protocol for this query and try to isolate the slow queries. Ideally at a time where nobody else is on-line. Likely that you have to increase some time-out. You didn't mention the exact version of Moodle you use, neither whether on MySQL or PostgreSQL . May be the developers have optimized those places in the meantime. b) Duplicate the site on a spare server and run such slow administration tasks there. The caveat is that duplicating itself is an intensive operation for the original server. Depending on the dead-lines in the course, a nightly copy might be sufficient.",

You haven't mentioned the CPU nor the disk system. Also not what Linux distribution, which version, amoung many other relevant factors. So I am talking of the \"first look\". Of course the server need to be well configured - or at least you make no blunders. For example, purging the cache before starting a quiz is exactly the wrong advice. A cache becomes useful only when it is populated! I guess your friends are Windows experts! No, if you need advice from this community, first look at https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/Performance_recommendations .",

We have multiple webservers and a shared moodledata area which is NFS served from our SAN so the file based cache is relatively slow. I've installed memcached on a few servers and added them to list of test memcached servers in our moodle test environment. If I run the \"Test Performance\" screen under the plugin cache admin page it usually says Store Not Ready against memcached but sometimes it will return test results. I'm struggling to work out what is wrong with memcached  and why its intermittently not ready.  I've written some test scripts of my own using the php:memcached calls and the set, get and delete calls work reliably. I'm using a recent version of memcached (1.4.15) but had to go back to older versions of libmemcached (0.49) and php: memcached (2.0.1) as I had problems getting the new versions to work with the SLES 11SP1 OS we are using Would I be better off using memcache rather than memcached?",

You ask whether a server of half the size would handle that same load - by \"load balancing\". Balancing with what? Do you mean _two_ servers, each half the size of the current server in a cluster? I would say No. The clustering comes at an overhead. Like the moodledata needs to be served through the network because it has to be the same for both servers, and it becomes slower than a locally connected drive. In addition, you need a third server, because the database also has to be common. Before doing big changes pl. study the many very similar discussions here in the recent past.",

          "Text": "Hi Pablo, Don't know a whole lot about it, but came up against the same problem. I solved it by configuring the machine on my lan with moodle installed as the default server. By doing this, my router directed all net traffic at the machine I specified. Ping the machine with moodle installed on it, in order to find its private ip address. Once you know this, go to your router interface and in configuration, look for some setting that allows you to configure a default server. My router is netopia, but yours will have something similar. Point the router at the ip of your moodle machine. Any incoming requests from the web will now be sent to your moodle machine. NAT Default Server allows you to: Direct your Gateway to forward all externally initiated IP traffic (TCP and UDP protocols only) to a default host on the LAN. Enable it for certain situations: Where you cannot anticipate what port number or packet protocol an in-bound application might use. For example, some network games select arbitrary port numbers when a connection is opened. When you want all unsolicited traffic to go to a specific LAN host. Enter the IP address of the computer that is to receive the unexpected or unknown traffic. NAT IP Passthrough allows you to: Configure a single LAN PC to have the router's public address assigned to it, in addition to providing NAT via the same public IP address for all other hosts on the private LAN subnet. Don't forget, you'll have to modify your config file from what it was when you were operating on the lan. Hope this helps, Matt",

          "Text": "if you have a router between the user and the moodle server, you will need a port that directs them to the moodle server. you should be able to configure your router (a linksys router for a T-1 is probably not the best choice, you may want to spend a little more on a more robust router). anyway, the linksys web management interface will let you assign a port, and then point that port to the ip address of the web server. if the moodle server is your only web server, port 80 would be the right choice. that way, when people type http://yourdomain.com into their web browser, they will first hit your linksys router, and since http traffic is on port 80, the linksys router will forward them to your moodle server. does that make sense?",

          "Title": "Performance issue on dropbox repository's cron",
          "Text": "Hi all! In our University we have enabled the dropbox repository and we were having performance troubles in the MySQL server side regarding to the temporary space (that space used for orderings and so). The affecting query was this one: \n```text\nmy\nsql\n> explain SELECT f.id AS id, f.contenthash, f.pathnamehash, f.contextid, f.component, f.filearea, f.itemid, f.filepath, f.filename, f.userid, f.filesize, f.mimetype, f.status, f.source, f.author, f.license, f.timecreated, f.timemodified, f.sortorder, f.referencefileid, r.repositoryid AS repositoryid, r.reference AS reference, r.lastsync AS referencelastsync, r.lifetime AS referencelifetime                   FROM mdl_files f              LEFT JOIN mdl_files_reference r                        ON f.referencefileid = r.id                  WHERE r.repositoryid = '6' ORDER BY sortorder, itemid, filepath, filename;\n\n\n+----+-------------+-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------------------+---------+----------------+\n\n\n| id | select_type | table | type   | possible_keys                                       | key     | key_len | ref                      | rows    | Extra          |\n\n\n+----+-------------+-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------------------+---------+----------------+\n\n\n|  1 | SIMPLE      | f     | ALL    | mdl_file_ref_ix                                     | NULL    | NULL    | NULL                     | 3376658 | Using filesort | \n\n\n|  1 | SIMPLE      | r     | eq_ref | PRIMARY,mdl_filerefe_repref_uix,mdl_filerefe_rep_ix | PRIMARY | 8       | moodle.f.referencefileid |       1 | Using where    | \n\n\n+----+-------------+-------+--------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+--------------------------+---------+----------------+\n\n\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n That \"Using filesort\" is aweful and makes the cron abort for having insufficient space for the temporary part in the Mysql side. The message shown in the logs is like this: \n```text\nProcessing cron function for repository_dropbox...\nDefault exception handler: S'ha produït un error en llegir a la base de dades Debug: Error writing file '/global/mysqltmp/MYR8ayOe' (Errcode: 49)\nSELECT f.id AS id, f.contenthash, f.pathnamehash, f.contextid, f.component, f.filearea, f.itemid, f.filepath, f.filename, f.userid, f.filesize, f.mimetype, f.status, f.source, f.author, f.license, f.timecr\neated, f.timemodified, f.sortorder, f.referencefileid, r.repositoryid AS repositoryid, r.reference AS reference, r.lastsync AS referencelastsync, r.lifetime AS referencelifetime\n                  FROM mdl_files f\n             LEFT JOIN mdl_files_reference r\n                       ON f.referencefileid = r.id\n                 WHERE r.repositoryid = ?

Anyhow, hoping this helps. This, by now, seems having solved our performance issues. Jordi",

I'll do my best to describe the setup, but for more specific detail, tell me the kind of thing it is helpful to know and I'll get the info from our dedicated IT server admins. Our moodle service has been setup purely to provide a platform for running mathematical STACK question based quizzes. We use LTI to connect our main VLE platform (Blackboard) to moodle to allow students to take STACK based quizzes. Once students are trasferred from Blackboard to moodle via LTI , they are effectively the same as any other moodle user.  That detail isn't that important, but as a result of this we have a 3 server setup. All servers are running CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 and are more-or-less vanilla out of the box installs with no special configuration (yet). Our servers are all running on Virtual Machines: Moodle - running on apache with fast-cgi enabled. Maria DB - no DB tuning (yet). Maxima - a dedicated server running the maxima tool for evaluating and processing STACK question input. Our memory/processor config is: Moodle : CPU cores: 8 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.60GHz; Physical Memory: 16GB Maria DB : CPU cores: 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.60GHz; Physical Memory: 10GB Maxima : CPU cores: 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.60GHz; Physical Memory: 16GB The only other point to mention is that as far as we know, these errors have only recently started appearing.  There were no relevant recent changes made to the server immediately beforehand.

Its config file, reqtimeout.conf, has this: <IfModule reqtimeout_module> # mod_reqtimeout limits the time waiting on the client to prevent an # attacker from causing a denial of service by opening many connections # but not sending requests. This file tries to give a sensible default # configuration, but it may be necessary to tune the timeout values to # the actual situation. Note that it is also possible to configure # mod_reqtimeout per virtual host. # Wait max 20 seconds for the first byte of the request line+headers # From then, require a minimum data rate of 500 bytes/s, but don't # wait longer than 40 seconds in total. # Note: Lower timeouts may make sense on non-ssl virtual hosts but can # cause problem with ssl enabled virtual hosts: This timeout includes # the time a browser may need to fetch the CRL for the certificate. If # the CRL server is not reachable, it may take more than 10 seconds # until the browser gives up. RequestReadTimeout header=20-40,minrate=500 # Wait max 10 seconds for the first byte of the request body (if any) # From then, require a minimum data rate of 500 bytes/s RequestReadTimeout body=10,minrate=500 </IfModule> The solutions vary from completely disabling the module to changing the configuration, for example to: RequestReadTimeout header=10-40,MinRate=500 body=40,MinRate=500 Source: proxy_fcgi:error (70008)Partial results are valid but processing is incomplete.

We had opcache installed, but only with defaults. The correct opcache settings are detailed here: https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/OPcache When relying on opcache defaults, seg fault erros bubble up and present as proxy_fcgi errors else where when errors in cacheing start to occur. This was a major problem during our moodle upgrade in our test environment where changes to the code base were out of step with that was cached and a right mess ensued. Hope this hopes another.",

First Moodle 2.0 does more stuff (for example more navigation on each page) so you would expect it to be a bit slower. Second, a lot of that new stuff is new code that has to been extensively profiled and tweaked yet. Martin Dougiamas has said that working on improving perfomace is a high priority for his developers. Third, Moodle 2.0 made a number of strategic changes to things like how JavaScript and CSS are served, which means many fewer HTTP connections per main page load, so percieved performance for users may be better than the raw numbers from JMeter suggest.",

We are developing virtual learning systems for the whole Aalto University, which is the largest technical university in Finland. We have potentially 30 000 users who may be in some contact with this system. So we have to consider carefully if this system is suitable for our needs. We would like to have some recommendations from you about the best Moodle version at the moment for large amounts of users. Creating a performance test with Apache JMeter for Moodle 1.9 is quite ok. It can handle at least 400-500 users (threads) simultaneously but Moodle 2.0 begins to fail only with 10-20 threards. I've tried to do the test with exact same settings for both versions and they are running on the same server but just in different directories. Is there a better way to test large amounts of users than Apace JMeter? Is there some information (some specific log etc.) that we could deliver to you for better analysis? with best regards, Max Österman / Aalto University IT",

Questions: Is my VM (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) too underpowered for Moodle 5.0.2+? What are the recommended PHP/My SQL tuning parameters for this size VM? Should each Moodle site use its own Redis database/index instead of sharing one instance? Is NFS the right approach for dataroot performance, or should I rethink storage architecture?

But those details will help people knowledgeable in Windows to understand the problem. Also it is important to know whether the machine hits some limit at 5 am. For that you need to run a monitoring program which records critical parameters like CPU load, memory usage, I/O wait times, ... for you to analyze later. This is what Howard is talking about.

In addition the database (in my experience anyway) is rarely the bottleneck, it's the Apache processes. It's important not to overestimate concurrent users. 50 in a school is a lot. We are talking about people actively using the system - the maximum number of user actions in a rolling 5 second window is often talked about. Nevertheless, you are saying 75 x 50 = 3,750 concurrent users. If we take the received wisdom of 1GB per 50 concurrent users, then that's 75GB of web server memory or 5 16GB servers plus a load balancer plus probably 2 (for failover at least) replicating database servers and somewhere to store the files. 7 big machines, a load balancer and a big network connected RAID array (which *has* to be fast).",

          "Text": "How big are the schools? I'm measuring concurrent users to be \"clicked something within the last two seconds\", as our httpd processes live for two seconds. On our largest Moodle install we have about 11,000 user accounts, out of which maybe 8,000 have been somewhat active. Out of those around 4,500 log in on a given week and 2,500 on a given day. During busy hours we might have around 1,000 users logged in, but still we rarely see spikes over 100 concurrent users. The web server is configured to allow only max 175 processes, and it has been enough for us. You can put this amount of users in just one server, if it's big enough (like 4 quad core processors + 16 gigs of memory with a fast IO system and lots of bandwith). The point of these numbers was, as Howard pointed also, that the number of concurrent users is probably significantly less than the number of \"active\" users. For us, the database is the bottleneck and we have to buy a bigger box for it. This is due to the large number of courses (3,000+) that we have and the course enrolments with them (~70,000). These generate a lot of db queries for each login, role assignment and so on. Another thing is the size of the log table. Optimized they might be, most database operations still have a point were they get slower fast, even though with smaller tables you never noticed a performance hit.",

Upgrading  to 1 Gb ram gave some relief, but it slowed down again at around 30 users.  This time the CPU seemed the bottleneck. I temporarily moved the installation to a 3GHZ Xeon Compaq, 2Gb ram today, in order to keep our users from leaving our Moodle Project. Seems to run smoothly now. Did I miss some tuning?",

You can get a much better CPU performance using a PHP Cache (PHP Cache itself, Turck MM Cache, etc.). You can get even better results using latest MySQL 4.0.x, since it provides a database query cache wich is very good. Do not use My SQL 4.1 or 5.0, since they are still experimental. On the other hand, you can outsource your Moodle services to http://moodle.com/hosting , and get a good service optimized just for Moodle and customized by the very main developer: Martin Dougiamas. It would cost you 100$/moth, but you would have all your hardware and admin problems solved. Hope this helps.",

As I am not sure exactly what you are monitoring for memory usage, here are a few things to check: Check your MySQL settings. There are several settings depending on the type of your database. Check your Apache configuration. There are several ways of reducing its memory usage. Check to see what the memory_limit is set to in your PHP.INI file. A simple, straight forward utility I found for Linux is Htop. You can view all processes running and their resource usage. If you are new to tuning Apache and My SQL , this article may help you. Optimizing MySQL and Apache for Low Memory Usage, Part 1 . I consider 1GB of memory to be low for a server, so optimizing all your settings are critical to maximize the use of memory.",

This provides a little more information but I'm afraid I still don't know what the root of your problem is. I can say that I have Moodle 1.9.5+ installed on a backup server (old Macintosh Powerbook Pismo (900Mhz upgraded processor) with 1Gig of RAM running Ubuntu 8.04) and had to use the backup server to serve our Moodle site a little over a month ago when the motherboard in our main machine (XServe G5, 2.3Gh DP machine with 4.5 Gigs of RAM) got fried. Our site has about 4000 registered users and gets approximately 225 logins per day so it's not really a heavy site in terms of activity but there are times when 50 to 75 students are logging in all at the same time. I was very surprised to see the laptop serve the site with very little issue for the few days that we were forced to use it. It wasn't as fast as the XServe but wasn't overly sluggish. So, I'm not sure that I understand why your machine (even though it only has 1 gig of RAM) would be running out of memory. I haven't tweaked the Apache settings from the base LAMP ubuntu install so I had MaxClients set to the default. The only things I've modified are a few of the php settings to allow for larger file uploads and a few addons that are required by Moodle. Sorry I can't be of more help. Jason P.S. I just tried to access your site but it must be down as I wasn't able to get a response. P.P.S. The site just connected. Looks really cool! Any chance that you have theme related issues? Is that one of the Newbury themes?",

You must be familiar with the Performance FAQ, you'll see that there is no formula for 'N concurrent users': https://docs.moodle.org/en/Performance_FAQ#What_are_the_requirements_for_N_users.3F . Still your number, 400, is manageable as opposed to numbers starting from upper thousands we see here now and then. As a very rough estimation in your range https://docs.moodle.org/en/Performance_FAQ#What_hardware_should_I_buy_for_.27n.27_concurrent_users.3F says, \"your Moodle site may only handle as few as 10-20 concurrent users per GB of memory\", so 160 to 320 for 16 GB. I would say, you can give it a try. The success will depend on many factors. Will those 400 (try to) open the quiz during a couple of seconds or a couple of minutes? How heavy is the exam? Does it contain just the standard question types in the quiz module? Will the questions contain heavy images, or even videos? How big is the first quiz page? One question? Ten questions? Fifty questions? The success will also depend on how well you set up the server. As Ken wrote earlier, having both the web server and the database server in a single machine is a balancing act. You need a good system administrator. Even then, no system admin can set up the server in one go. You have to put it to use, monitor the load during not so critical loads, come back and change settings. May be to add RAM, may be add a caching mechanism like Memcache/Memcached or Redis, etc.",

          "Text": "_Just_ added on 1.5/1.6/1.7/1.8/HEAD, a new config option, settable from config.php (I'll add it later in /admin on HEAD), that allows you to set a memory threshold over which Apache children will be reaped after they complete serving the request. This means that you can now be a lot more confident on the memory usage you estimate when you set maxclients. (On Linux/Apache, MaxClients is one of the main tunables, if you haven't heard of it before, search this forum for earlier discussions covering maxclients and memory usage). Normally, you look at top, and estimate that your apache/php processes are going to use ~12MB at the most, and then you set your maxclients to roughly $memforapache / 12MB. But if a given page is a memory hog and eats 25 meg, then your apache processes will start overrunning the memory you planned to give apache. And if there's a traffic spike, apache's memory footprint grows, eventually the working set doesn't fit in RAM, you hit swap, and your're toast. So... with this setting, after moodle is done serving the page, and just as the PHP engine begins its cleanup, Moodle gets a chance to check if we used too much memory, and tag the child process for reaping. Which means that the memory will be freed up, at a small cost in cpu cycles. I've given it a default of 10MiB. Should initially help people triggering cron via apache (ouch) and very memory-intensive pages, like grades reports generation.",

Additionally, the KeepAliveTimeout was set too high, so when someone did connect, it held on to them for a long time and no-one else could connect. Part of the cause for this was the instruction we followed on the wiki's Performance page regarding the KeepAliveTimeout requirement of at least 60 seconds if using SSL in combination with IE (the page mentions that having the setting below this may cause the entire Windows TCP/IP stack to crash). For the record, We're using IE 8 and Windows XP, with the regular KeepAliveTimeout now set to 5 and the SSL KeepAliveTimeout now set to 15, and have not experienced this bug (we use SSL only for logins, and profile pages).

          "Text": "Hi Michael, you can't, whatever back-end you are using for the unshared MUC store. What is the missing point? The ability to invalidate a cache entry to allow each front-end node to see the updated situation and avoid strange/unpredictable issues. If you've a cache definition and you now how it is used and the impact of not being invalidated you can try to un-share it. An example could be the localization strings that could be managed at local level being created from the PHP files but if you update your Moodle code in each node you must take care of manually purging the store where the strings definition has been mapped into: when Moodle will be able to notify about the changes someway in a unshared cache setup everything will magically happen. In case of adopting memcached as the back-end you could look at repcached to try to add the missing unshared cache nodes collaboration by using its own replication mechanisms which unfortunately are asynchronous, again leading potentially to unpredictable results in Moodle. BTW there is some interesting ongoing work in this area that could open, in Moodle 2.6 and above, to a scenario different from the one described above: http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Server_clustering_improvements_proposal .

Instead, we shoud document all the semantics of each cache (as much as possible) in the cache.php file where it is defined. If it is documented there, integrators can insist on docs before changes are integrated. We can also display the information on the cache admin screen. I guess a good way to caputre the semantics is to use event-based cache invalidation (rather than manual cache invalidation code) whereve possible. I also think the best solution would be for us to find a way for Moodle to reliably do purging of local caches in a load-balanced scenario.

          "Text": "Hi, I am fairly certain this topic has been discussed over and over again. Forgive me for sounding repetitive. I have been, you could say, thrown into the deep end in getting our University LMS to accommodate online exams. We are currently hosting on Google Cloud and this is pretty much our architecture (they are all in the same region): - 1 Load Balancer to distribute traffic to Compute Engine - Compute Engine launches the VMs hosting Moodle code (16GB vcpu and 64GB RAM) scaled between 1 and 3 instances - Filestore (1 TB) for Moodledata automounted on the auto-scaled VMs - Cloud SQL for our PostgreSQL Instance (8GB vcpu and 32GB RAM) At first, the platform was used to allow students to access assignments which they would download and submit at a later time. This worked out well. Problems began when we introduced real time quizes. We started with 500 people which the system managed well. When we scaled out to 2000 users, the numbers of requests overwhelmed the database which eventually crashed. We were introduced to the dreaded error: \n```text\ndb=moodledb,user=\npostgres\n FATAL:  remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections\"\n```\n After reading on a number of forums, I decided to place a pgBouncer instance between the VMs and PostreSQL. I did not perform any customizations other than adding the database connection details. Now, instead of the message above, I get multiple messages like this: \n```text\nERROR accept() failed: Too many open files\n\n\nclosing because: client close request (age=160s)\n\n\nclosing because: client close request (age=90s)\n\n\nWARNING C-0x55c61cc57780: (nodb)/(nouser)...pooler error: no more connections allowed (max_client_conn)\n\n\nclosing because: no more connections allowed (max_client_conn) (age=0s)\n```\n I am stuck and we have been off all day. I doubt we can afford to go be off another day. I will be grateful for any advice on what I can do. If I need to provision more resources. More RAM or something else. If there are any configurations I can look out for? For a bit more context , I happen to have the exam timetable and the largest real-time quiz has 2300 people. Although this does not account for other students who will be browsing at that time. Thanks everyone. Looking forward to your responses.",

Each instance has the following (dynamic) configuration options set for the fpm pool: \n```text\npm.max_children = 880\n\n\npm.start_servers = 32\n\n\npm.min_spare_servers = 16\n\n\npm.max_spare_servers = 32\n```\n 2. I am running Moodle 3.11.3+ 3. Yes, we are using Redis as the Application and Session Caches. We also have a memcached instance but for some reason we get an error saying \"this store does not requirements for all store definitions\". So we stuck to redis and it's performing well. 4. I managed to fix the Database Connection error by \"properly\" configuring PostgreSQL and pgBouncer. There are a couple of settings that I had to tweak on PostgreSQL itself, most notably shared_buffers & e ffective_cache_size. pgBouncer also required specific configurations especially max_client_conn and default_pool_size. After playing with different settings I managed to get something I could work with. 5. Yes, I do have a good amount of logging done with the Google Cloud console. I am able to see everything that's going on. Resources used and so on. Helps me to plan ahead. You raised something that I would love if you explained it more. You said, \"updating the Apache/NGINX/PHP workers to use all your RAM?\". Is there a benefit to this? Would this improve performance?

It looks like you have already set those up, but the value of PHP max children looks to be quite large. Do you know how large your PHP processes are on average? If so, times that by 880 and it would be the max RAM PHP can use and that would be over what the server is capable of. As long as only your Moodle data directory is on a shared file system and your MUC/Sessions are on Redis and you have the local cache configured as well, the performance should be good. There are also some performance issues in having calendar type blocks on the home page when you have a lot of events in the database but there are trackers open for that at the moment. The performance issues get exacerbated with quizzes as you have a lot of users all logging in at the same time to get ready for the quiz, so not only is there users for the quiz, but logins, home page loads etc all impact the DB and performance.",

The performance is quite good now. Very fast page loads even with the Standard Persistent Storage and not the SSD. Yes, there are some issues and I am following various trackers. I have disabled the calendar block for now, at least until exams are done. Today we attempted a quiz of 1500 users for one hour and it went very well. I forgot to mention that we are also using the Delayed Quiz plugin to spread out the start times for students to access the quiz. This has helped to reduce the impact of initial login. However, we have a quiz of 2000 coming up soon (largest class) and we are wondering whether to increase database from 64GB RAM to 96GB to improve the work_mem, shared_buffers and effective_cache_size of our PostgreSQL instance.

Is there really such a version and is there any know performance issues with regard to the Moodle 1.9.5+ PHP5.2.5 combination using MySQL . Our client complains a lot about performance though we know that the SANDF network is very congested and sometimes grind to an almost complete halt (upgrades are being done). The network to me is the main suspect but what raised the above question was that our Mainframe contact was at the Server Farm the other day where Moodle (or the server) was slow even there even though all of the other VMs on that specific machine performed pleasingly well.

I am looking at their dedicated server with the following specs: 2 core, 4 GB RAM, 500GB SATA hard drive, Debian Lenny (5.0 – Stable), One dedicated IP address, Managed backup, Unlimited bandwidth, 4-hour SLA (4 hour hardware replacement guarantee, Waived set up $99, $129 /month I am building a moodle site with 30 or so courses with the first course free, which means I hope to attract 1,000 or more users per month and hope to convert some percent of them to pay for more courses. We need to sell 1,000 courses a month within a year for it to make sense and will likely up the number of free trials to accommodate such a number of paid as we determine what percent of the free trials end up buying and how many courses the take on average. There will be forums, limited chat, and tests, but not that extensive in terms of quiz and test needs. I was planning originally to ramp up over time, but then dreamhost raised the price of dedicated from $99 to $129 and I wanted to lock in the price before they raise it again. It is a new service for them to add to their existing and they priced it way below everyone else. If the specs will serve me long term it is worth the investment. Does anyone know if I am choosing a system that will serve my needs for at least the first year?",

Web Services will transform the web from a collection of information into a distributed computational device. Web Services are uncomplicated, self contained applications which achieve functions, from easy requests to difficult business process. The invocation of WSs normally purely happens through a machine-to-machine communication, without a user interface on the computer to call the WS. WS model uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) and Simple Object Application Protocol (SOAP). A WSDL description is retrieved from the UDDI directory and allows the software systems of one business to extend to use those of the other directly [1, 2, 3]. Web services are a new breed of Web application. They are self-contained, self describing, modular applications that can be published, located, and invoked across the Web. Web services perform functions, which can be anything from simple requests to complicated business processes. ... Once a Web service is deployed, other applications (and other Web services) can discover and invoke the deployed service [1] The WWW Consortium [4] has defined WS as a software application identified by URI, whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by XML artefacts and supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via internet-based protocols W3C Working Group Note, Web Services Architecture Requirements , 11 February 2004 , http://www.w3.org/TR/wsa-reqs/#id2604787 [ 5 ] - The Stencil Group, 2001, Defining Web Services , http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~stan/csi5389/readings/wsdefined.pdf all my best wishes Ajlan",

          "Text": "As mentioned in this post , I have been using a Dell Poweredge server for the last 2 years. The server has CentOS on it. Everything has been going very very well but I'm beginning to run out of hard disk space and want to increase it. At the moment I have an SAS hard drive. I need to add more space for userdata. The type of user data will be: uploaded (to forums) video in mpg, wmv and other formats. My questions are these: As SAS are more expensive, is it possible to mix and add different types of hard drive? Would different hard drives be very different in the way they handle userdata (I'm very happy with the speed of the setup now!) Once I add the space, will moodle automatically point to it or will I have to change something in config? (or something else?) Sorry for double posting, but any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Kind regards, Eric",

Our server configuration is also very high  like we have 128 GB RAM, 24 cores CPU etc. However we still suffer performance issues and not mainly due to concurrent users, Our server is not able to handle downloading of builtin Moodle reports that have alot of data in them , (Example bulk downloading users from a particular country etc), Also we face performance issues on other moodle pages. I have been trying to read about performance recommendations of Moodle from https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Performance_recommendations however since I am not much of a server guy , I am not sure I understand them completely, Our apache is configured to use php handler suphp . My reading suggested that this will not let us use opcache , is that true? What is the preffered php handler for running a large moodle instance , we are on cent os 6.7 . Also do we need memcache or is opcache sufficient. I do understand the questions are too generic but I just want to understand few basics. Any help will be much appreciated",

One of 'catch22's' for folks who are on shared systems is suPHP.   After reading the above blog post, me thinks for your implementation, suPHP will just get in the way. Think someone mentoned in a another posting some where in these forums, about Linux distro's not having PHP 7 (reportedly better than previous versions) it doesn't mean one can use other repos that are reputable 3rd party providers of packages not yet offered by the distro.    CentOS is of the RedHat 'family' and mimics RedHat Enterprise (without the RH eye candy and RH repos).   RedHat has been traditionally 'conservative' and slow to provide upgrades to 'latest and greatest'.   This is because, I think, they put stability over 'latest and greatest'.   CentOS will require reputable 3 rd party repos for some things ... like PHP.   Until RH and thus CentOS and the rest of the RH family 'moves upwards'. Too bad there aren't more K12 people in here ... 6000 a month is close to what some K12 implementation of a Moodle would do in a day.   K12 with 'bring your own device' + 1:1 (students issued laptops/tablets to use just like textbooks) and that has a Moodle, that Moodle will get used ... period.   Most courses in  such a Moodle are either blended or 'flipped' and those approaches do make a difference on usage of Moodle and when thus a k12 Moodle will get more hits in a day than implementations for a corp or even some higher eds - those are asynchronous ... not synchronous. So some of the decision about what and how much needs to be base on projected use.   Better understanding of how it will be used leads to better decision making. My 2 cents ... of course!

Definitely worth having and I find using a monitor helps to understand what's happening, see http://www.stevejenkins.com/blog/2014/07/my-favorite-zend-opcache-status-scripts/ for some examples. memcached is used for storing variables and other data outputs into memory, rather than reading from the db or a file cache. Also worth having, though the default file cache is often just fine. We're looking at using PHP7, and from my own tests we noticed a significant improvement in performance - don't have the numbers to hand, but it was about twice as fast. That's the web side of things, then there's the database. As someone noted, it's worth having the db on a separate server. You're going to have to play with the settings for the DB to get the best config for your server and expected usage. It's a bit of trial and error. With regards to reports, I think the OU operate a separate webserver especially for reports, something I'm considering doing at some point. This allows you to have slightly separate configurations like longer timeouts and more memory allocation to cope with the harder work, but without messing up everyone else.",

In a local LAN situation all computers should show with their own and individual IP. These are not Moodle restrictions.  They are IP network protocol restrictions.  If everything else (network wise) is working then I suspect that the computers do not have the same IP and that the problem is somewhere else. I don't know about on a Linux workstation, but on a Windows machine I can not have two different logins to Moodle at the same time.  As soon as I open a new browser and point to Moodle.org it identifies the cookie from the first session and shows me as logged in.  Logging out in either one also causes all sessions on that computer to log out (may need a refresh to show). I think Ben has it right.  AV software or an overstrict settings on the browser is the most likely cause.  Some AV programs will stop the loading of cookies which will stop access to Moodle.

Is there not ways to turn that off? But for a demanding site giving the customer full control by moving to a VPS/VDS or a dedicated server should be possible. That's what I've had for years. I don't know why it's a concern now and not before. We've never given grief. Talking of availability, there is nothing called \"ALL the time\". People agree on down time percentage.

If the scripts in question are already PHP scripts, then it should not be too hard to convert them into some sort of Local plugin that can be installed into Moodle and so all the work can be done on the server. If you were using Moodle 2.x I would suggest making a local plugin, but they did not exist in Moodle 1.9.x, so I would suggest making a block plugin, just because that is easy, and blocks can have cron scripts. An alternative would be to keep most of the code running on your Mac mini, and have it finish by uploading the nicely formatted content to the SFTP account on the server. Then have the minimal amount of code necessary in Moodle to retrieve the files from the SFTP area and copy them to wherever they finally need to end up. Without knowing more about what your scripts do, it is hard to offer more advice than this about how to do it. Also, I have no idea what Remote Learner's (or other Moodle partners') Terms of Service say about running custom plugins on the server.",

This is difficult for me because we've never had a fully loaded server.

Obviously there is no such thing as _the_ Moodle user so you have to make a big assumption and that will remain the weak link of the argument. Totally agree, but thought with input from other sites it might be possible to make an approximate relationship between the http_load figures & the number of concurrent users. >Anyway hier is an attempt which is in use. You can see the conversion in the source: >http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=57028 Thanks for the link, it's an interesting read. What I did notice was that they're measuring the performance of various internal subsystems, and extrapolating that out to concurrent users. This requires not only the fudge factor you describe above for how much resource an active user requires, but also a fudge factor for how efficiently these internal subsystems are used. Measuring http requests/second measures the performance of the system at a much closer point to the user, and would seem to me to be capable of giving a more accurate result. For example, when I measured http requests/seconds I noticed a x3 speed improvement when I introduced eAccelerator, but perspective only measures the number of function calls that php can make in a second which won't be affected much by eAccelerator. Perspective won't see any improvement from 1.8 to 1.9 because it doesn't measure the efficiency of the code, again I saw a significant improvement. Finally while things have improved with 1.9, performance has a nasty habit of degrading as the number of courses increases. Again perspective won't see this, but measuring http requests/second will. The two big problems I have with the http requests/second approach is whether the urls I'm requesting are sensible ones to use to benchmark a server (maybe I should use more urls to benchmark different parts of the system), and what the fudge factor is for going from requests/second to number of concurrent users. Trying to determine this fudge factor is where I could really benefit from other people's input by measuring the performance of a number of servers where the admins know how many users it will support, hence this post. All I need is the server's URL, number of concurrent users it supports & a quiet time when it would be ok to do the tests (it takes 2-3 minutes). I'll post the results back here. thanks, Anthony Wright.",

Possilbly the db is in the cache? >> How do you solve the problem of logins? > Not sure I understand the question, but all these urls can be reached without logging in if that was the question. My point is, the Moodle users work after logging in. It affects the performance because now you have a whole lot of new SQL querries. Any Moodle-specific benchmarking should take that into account. On the comparison perspective vs. your approach (http-requests): 1. yes, perspective is not coupled to Moodle code. As you say, it measures various \"general\" functions of the machine Which makes http-requests method Moodle-specific, therefore you have to mention the version. 2. perspective runs in the same machine, http-requests should come from outside (not a must) Network performance goes in to your measurement. So have to specify the link. 3. To convert the measurement into so many users, both approaches need a conversion factor. My question is, is it something as simple as, n http-requests per user? Secondly you want to get that factor from different admins. Isn't too much guess work and extrapolations involved in that process? May be a whole set of information per installation might be more useful. For example: - hardware - software stack (OS, Webserver, db, php, Moodle) - a _set_ of hard benchmark figures - estimated max. users and the formula",

It's relatively easy to install moodle  on Windows, now, but it's definitely not as easy to maintain. Also, your migration from one box to another is going to be about the same level of difficulty on both. If you're going to windows, for sure, then be prepared to add about 30-40% more resources.

Cron job didnt run fully, in addition to a 500 error after  purging cache (which I can expect for being 2 days old version of PHP) If someone else managed to test, let me know if you have experienced the same improvement as I did.",

Also, I ran test on WIMP environment setup on a VM , and was keeping eye on just the performance infos, where php 5.6 was showing 9MB used, PHP 7 showed less than 6MB used, and that to me is good improvement.

Once you have your machine assembled you can have a functional Moodle site in less than 2 hours including the installation of the Edubuntu OS (with the above hardware my machine was functional in less than an hour that includes adding the Automatix, Webmin and eAccelerator). The first server described services <200 current end users and growing, with approximately <60 simultaneous connections, hosting 6 course with multiple sections in each. The first machine mentioned cost a whopping $25 in hardware cost (purchased from my previous employer prior to outsourcing of my job). The machine has been purposely restarted 2-3 times in the past year for system (OS) updates, and restarted on its own due to power failures (rectified now with the addition of a UPS). With the software described (all open source) the original $25 is the total cost for a small functional Moodle system. It has served me well. With gratitude I gladly pay homage to both the Edubuntu and Moodle developers. The second cost less than $500 in hardware and again $0 in software. Open source is the only way to go for ease of use, configuration, management and cost. I’ve managed Windows networks with IIS and Apache as well as Linux networks with Apache. I highly recommend a Linux installation to minimize frustration and expense. This advice comes from an admin turned educator. As a science instructor the value of the first machine has been priceless. I expect nothing less from the second server as well. I hope to have it online between semesters. It will be interesting to see all the responses this thread generates. Ralph.",

Rather, this is the state that the socket stays in after the connection has been closed, and all resources have been freed; usually for 2 minutes. (This timeout can be decreased on some operating systems, but there's hardly ever need for this.) Any reasonably configured server can deal with thousands of connections in TIME_WAIT state without any problems. In short, TIME_WAIT is harmless, except in really extreme conditions. (CLOSE_WAIT states would be a bad sign.) Your problem must be related to something else. Maybe it would help if you post the output of \"netstat -tn\" here (taken when the problem occurs), perhaps there's a hint to the actual problem.",

I had three sites which were connected via one provider (in a ring), and each had access to the internet via local providers. Our tech sections had our internet accesses set up to fail over through another site if our local provider failed. The problem was, the fail over occurred too fast, and requests would then go through our private ring from A to B to C to A to B to A to C to.... and none of the sites would actually send it out through their local provider. So, since the problem started when you created two load sharing virtual servers for the database, are they talking properly? Test it by turning one of them off, then if the problem goes away, you know that it is the set up between the 2 servers and how they interact. (OOps first test justserver a, then just server b, to see if it is just one of them introducing the error.) Hope this helps solve it.",

There is no safe way to delete user records and associated data because there may be places that refer to these records. I heard that the OU db some time ago had stabilized at over 450,000 users and as the Moodle db is indexed is coping OK. Does anyone have any tips on coping with large ammounts of user data? I guess one safe way of getting rid of old unwanted data is to have seperate courses for each year and then Moodle will be able to backup old courses and you can delete all course data when necessary. For a site with a lot of users the user db will get very large over the years but perhaps is manageable, at least until this problem is hopefully further addressed in future versions of Moodle.

Although MNet does use an SSL certificate, it's a certificate created by moodle itself and stored within the Moodle database specifically for the purposes of MNet. As long as both of your servers are sharing the same database, they will get the same certificate. The same can be said for Mahara. As a side note, why will both machines have different SSL certificates? Andrew",

I conclude that I can setup the Mahara machine with MNet as if there was only one Moodle machine and treating the load balancer as a single machine. You say that Mahara handles MNet the same so that a load balancer could be implemented the same way as it was done with Moodle? Is session management for Mahara stored into the database as well?

          "Text": "Hi Nathan, Much as I love to preach about how wonderful php accelerators are, the lack of one shouldn't cause an issue like this. That said, I'd highly recommend installing apc and tuning it. I've made a few responses in this forum recently with notes on how to tune it. With the CPU sky-rocketting to 100% before it stops responding it could be a range of things. It would be helpful to find out what's causing the increase. What kind of CPU load is it - i.e. are you in IO Wait, or system, or user, or ... A tool such as top would be able to tell you. I find that running in colour, showing all cores, full arguments listing, and only showing non-idle processes most helpful. On debian that's (open top), press z, 1, c, i. CentOS may differ in it's implementation of top, or at least it's default configuration of it. You could also have a play with iostat -v 1 to find out where your resources are going. You say that you're virtualised using vSphere, one of our customers is using a similar setup and we've seen no issues, but the issue you'll find with virtualisation technologies such as vSphere is that resource sharing can have an indirect affect on other virtual servers. You say that there are no cron jobs running on the virtual servers, but have you checked the virtualisation layer? I suspect that you're in disk IO, and this is why your CPU jumps to 100%. This could be caused by a range of things... As an example, I would assume that your disk architecture for these machines is probably backed off via vSphere to a SAN of some kind. It might be worth having a look at the latency graphs in vSphere for the disks.\nIs something happening at the time it freezes - e.g. backup? Is a virtual server snapshotting at the time that you run everything, or even the SAN? If you could have a look at those areas you may find some useful pointers... Hope that this helps, Andrew LUNS Limited",

The place to start is probably to try and get an average idea of the size of a single page - a page may be material typed into Moodle, a PowerPoint presentation, a Word document - whatever but try and get an idea. You can then divide this into 10GB and then divide it by the number of students. This will then give you an idea if 10GB sounds reasonable. Many browsers give you information about this if you dig about. Next you need to try and assess if 450MB is enough space to store all your material. This will be the total of all your files (Word, Powerpoint, pictures etc etc), or at least a good guess at it. Is there any limit of the database size? A lot of stuff gets stored there too?

So, we decided to restore the backup and migrate to 1.9.6+ as well. The upgrade was actually two-step: first we went to 1.8.10+ and then to 1.9.6+. It was all flawless - no error messages or even warnings. Unfortunately we're suffering a lot of performance problems - several php scripts are suddenly eating up CPU like crazy. So much that we start getting Internal Server Errors or simply some pages just dont load anymore (such as listing forum posts for a particular user). After investigating in the forums, the hint was to check out the mysql -slow.log file. It is attached here, but I still cant believe that our 1.3 GB database is causing all that slowdown. The biggest table is mdl_log, which is now ~560MB (after shrinking it frorm 1.2GB). The rest is about some KBs ou MBs. I have been through the following checklist: - Cache use: we set to internal by now. Cant see much difference, to be honest. Still getting those pesky Internal Server Errors.",

I run OPTMIZE on all the tables of the database. In a matter of an hour, I again get fragmented tables. Why the heck is that happening?? That is certainly not normal. Is it because I'm doing OPTMIZE while users are accessing the DB? 2) Excessive JOINs without INDEXes. 1609 JOINs without Indexes! Why is that possibility happening? Is that a 1.9.6+ issue? The DB is fully indexed, when running XML DB Editor for checking it, I get all indexes are fine. The output is attached for reference. I have increased join_buffer_size to 16M in order to optimize such time consuming JOINs. So, if the DB is indexed and JOINs are not using indexes, who's the fault here? Do I have to dig into the SQL code and change the queries? Is anyone experiencing this as well?? If anyone can help here, I'd really appreciate it. best regards, - Breno",

I contacted the site adminsitrator for said technical  help and he says that everything is ok on his end, it must be the client. Bottom lines: 1.  Is the client me or the University and if its me, can I do anything about this?   I'm spending a lot of my own precious time, phone time, and ISP time. 2. Is it possible for me to downloard (or would this be upload ?) the class onto my computer, go offline, post my classes, quizzes, projects, etc, and then send it back to the site?

If the company is just supporting the Moodle installation on the university server, you might want to see if any changes have been made to the server (additional loads, other programs, etc.) You also might try using another computer to elimiate the possibility of it being a problem with the one computer you are using.

          "Text": "Dear moodlers, I used to be an Ubuntu-happy educational technologist who is now in charge of a Windows Server 2008-IIS7 Moodle site, so I would like to ask for your advice about the following: We have a small size site, but we are experiencing unnecesarilly delays of 2s or so everytime that Moodle a page/resource or course is loaded in a browser. From the different possibilities that I am pondering on, I would like to limit the number of request in 'MaxKeepAliveRequests', but my understanding is that , in Windows, the equivalent concept to the former is ' allowKeepAlive ', which should be set to false in order to disable the persisten conections. Is this correct or is there any other way to set the maximum number of opened requests . I am not also sure about what is the best way of disable allowKeepAlive for my Moodle site: Would it be OK to just add the following lines to my web.config file?: \n```text\n<system\n.\nwebServer\n>\n\n\n      \n<httpProtocol\nallowKeepAlive\n=\n\"false\"\n/>\n\n\n   \n</system\n.\nwebServer\n>\n```\n Or is it better to use the command appcmd.exe for that. I understand that appcmd.exe is not added by default to the PATH variable, so what will the right way of calling the command and from which folder of the Windows OS shell ? Thank you very much for your advice.",

The open connection improves performance when a client makes multiple requests for Web page content, because the server can return the content for each request more quickly. Otherwise, the server has to open a new connection for every request. By default, the HTTP keep-alive response header is enabled in IIS 7.\" Try it, but I'm not certain it will solve your 2s delay problem.

This is an (incomplete) list of things I would look at: - To serve each user at say 500 kbit/s (a common bandwidth people are used to in Europe) the total will come upto 750 Mbit/s! OK, nobody uses 500 kbit/s continuously during interactive work, still this rather theoritical calculation gives an idea of the size of the work. Have a carefull look at your network topology. Can it distribute the required bandwidth? - Consider that a \"good\" network card is designed for 1000 Mbit/s. That is also \"theoritical\", I don't know of a single server in the PC range which could saturate a GBit network card. What about the harddisk subsystem, even if the webserver can process the PHP scripts at that rate? I would also consider multiple servers as Pieterjan suggested. - Definitely a separate database server, even a cluster. - May be multiple webservers have to share the work, say in round-robin fashion.

They are offering v2.1 and have been excellent at tech support for us.

The problem is that your users are resolving to your server via DNS apparently ( http://moodleserver.com ) User keys in the address, and through the miracle of the internet, the request is sent to a DNS server and the traffic is routed accordingly. There are a number of fixes but running a local DNS server would probably be the easiest to implement.  You may be able to make an entry into the router tables as well that direct all traffic to http://moodleserver.com to the local IP of the server.  It is sort of a pain but a host file modification would work as well. Another method would be to have them use the server IP http://xx.xx.xx.xx You need to speak to whom ever setup the network and have them take care of the routing issue (they know the equipment) Explaining the process is moot without specific information on the network hardware.",

The biggest issues I've had with performance tuning a site running MS SQL as the back-end database has been around the PHP drivers for MS SQL - they just don't scale in the same way as Postgres/Mysql - this is a limitation of the PHP drivers built for MS SQL rather than Moodle or whatever server power you poke at it.",

Switch everything on to APCu cache? I'm wondering because the data stored in the APCu disappears pretty quickly, which can cause delays. For this reason, with low traffic, it is better to stay with standard file caching? Unfortunately, the documentation does not address these issues very much. Thank you for your reply",

Moodle can be really heavy on a server but it depends on the type of course you run, not so much on the number of students. If you just want to put up some content, assignments and low forum use you don't ask much; if you do a lot of interactive stuff with Quizzes, Hot Potatoes, hundreds of forum messages a day, etc. it'll be much heavier.

We are looking at setting up a SAN system with virtualised servers. I don't know much about them, hence my questions. We currently have 17 Moodles spread over three servers. One of which has reached pensionable age and would not want to be replicated as is. The virtual servers will have much more RAM available so I need to know if Moodle can take advantage of the improved architecture, hence is it capable of working with 64 bit architecture, or is that more of a php / apache question? (Still working on looking those up.) If we are moving all of our Moodles would we be better moving like for like where each Moodle and database and data folder are all on the same server or would we better putting all the databases together on a virtual server and all the data files together on a virtual server and all the moodles together somewhere. I've seen the thread about 'cloud' computing http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=101531 but I don't think it really answers what I'm asking other than to say you can put them on virtual servers - but is it sensible?

          "Text": "Hi Heather, To answer your first question, \"Is Moodle 64 bit...\", Moodle takes advantage of the underlying OS, Web server & PHP, so you are correct that it is a php/apache question, but also the operating system. As to where to put each of your current Moodle sites, that is a much more complicated question which is impacted by a number of different conditions. Ignoring for now the SAN and virtual servers, as Mark wrote, and from what I have read about Moodle, and my background with other LMS applications, placing your database on a seperate dedicated server from your moodle site(s) will give you the biggest performance boost and next is memory. After that it comes down to a lot of fine tuning. Placing the data files on the same server as the Moodle site, would be best so that the files are accessed as quick as possible. Now as to SAN devices, they can have an impact on performance depending on how they are connected to the servers. If you are putting the database and the Moodle data files on the same SAN, then you can see slower performance compared to placing them on separate SAN devices. That is because you will have the database server and the Moodle servers all competing to retrieve data from the same device. As to whether virtual servers make sense, the real question is what is the reason behind using virtual servers? That probably goes along with why you have so many separate Moodle sites. Running a virtual server does take up extra resources on the server thus decreasing it's overall ability of serving your Moodle sites. Have you considered just running separate instances of Moodle on one server? If your goal is to get the best performance out of your Moodle sites, I would highly recommend considering consulting a Moodle Partner. They are listed at http://moodle.com/ Once you do figure out your configuration it would be great to hear back as to how you ended up configuring your different Moodle sites and how it is working.",

In any case maintaining 16 \"moodles\" on three servers doesn't sound very promising ;-( I anycase consolidating your setup makes sense. I would consider the following alternatives: 1. One moodle instance in place of 16 Since this is a heavy site, you have to follow up the usual high-performance techniques. The SAN thing will be usefull if you go for a load-balencing architecture. 2. Run those 16 moodles as virtual instances on one single physical server I haven't tried this, but hear contradictory statements about database performance on VM. Then you always have the option of seperating database and putting up a dedicated (physical) server.",

Each Moodle represents a department, e.g. Computer Science, Hair and Beauty, Higher Education, Foundation Studies and so forth. Each one of those would then have individual Sections with multiple courses in each - Take a look http://moodle.westnotts.ac.uk I think it might become unwieldy from a learner perspective (we have learners across the whole range of abilities) if we tried to amalgamate that into one moodle, but I'm open to ideas and thoughts on how we might go about it.

The other point about 64-bit OSes and specifically PHP is to remember that while it can address more memory it also requires more memory to do the addressing and work. This means you'll need to give it more memory and also up settings like the PHP memory limit and other system directives to get ideal performance out of a 64-bit OS. Our application servers were 64-bit for a time and we hit memory limits in PHP and other system utilities due to the addressing requirments. For our deployment servicing 30,000+ our independent database server is 64-bit with enough memory to keep everything in RAM and then some extra. Our application servers and load balancer are all virtualized and 32-bit. This allows for on the fly deployment of extra application and test servers if neccessary, which is the primary benifit of virtualization for us. The 32-bit OSes means we can deploy many of them, just with smaller memory footprints.",

Even if you limit the discussion to LAMP (that's what you use I hope), the short answer is: Don't expect huge gains even if you get everything going, specially check your PHP accelerator which is a must for performance. BUT you need 64 bit Linux if you have more the 4 GB RAM! The uncomfortable truth is, performance gains tuning the lower layers (OS, DB, PHP, network, ...) is marginal compared to what the programmer does at the application level.

My org. is looking to startup a moodle with 50 users and 3 courses. The 50 users would not be using the moodle concurrently but they would all be remote users. It's possible that we would be looking at as many as 20 \"concurrent\" users due to webinars. That is where my first question lies: If we use something like bigbluebutton for online conferencing will that affect our over moodle environment or will the traffic be on the bigbluebutton server? Secondly, the thought of having a dedicated server sounds great but for only 50 users it seems like overkill. There are thoughts of expansion to 100-500 users in 2 years. I am thinking that for starters shared hosting may be a viable option if not a virtual dedicated server. Any suggestions?",

However, if run a test for less than 25k request, the page stays loading for a few seconds and finally returns a page with the test result. Curiously, this problem only occurs on the physical server , I have recreated all the steps in a VM with the same components and all the tests work correctly even with 100k requests. I have reviewed all possible logs in PHP-FPM, Apache and there are no error messages when this problem occurs. Any idea what might be happening here or where I could look more closely? I do not attach logs because I have not found any error log related to this problem. Any ideas are appreciated and thanks in advance for your time!!",

          "Text": "Hello Howard, Thanks for taking your time trying to help me. I have enabled the Debugging options in Moodle and I got the following error when I run a cache performance test (50k requests) Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in /var/www/html/moodle/cache/stores/memcached/lib.php on line 422 I solved it by modifying the PHP directive max_execution_time (in the file /etc/php.ini) and changing it to 300 seconds. Then I ran the test for 100k again and got a completely different error and this time the error comes from Apache: Gateway Timeout The solution for that  error is changing the Timeout directive in Apache to 300, that can be done globally (changing the httpd.conf ) or inside the Virtual Host definition. Finally the answer to all is that my workstation Ryzen 7+32 GB of RAM (where I did the test on the VM) shows a better performance than a server with 2x Xeons E5-2630 + 96 GB of RAM) Thank you for your time Howard and have a great Weekend!",

Our environment is: - 3 nodes for Moodle ( VM 's) apache 2.2 and php-fpm - Mongo DB for caching - MySQL (We have db caching for sessions) - glusters for Moodledata Some observations during Load and Performance Testing: 1. The processor utilization towards the end of the test on all 3 Moodles and the My SQL server was around 85% . This is the highest processor utilization that we've seen so far on the MySQL server. 2. The load average on MySQL was around 12 - in previous tests this has been around 6 3. The response time associated with the mdl_cache_flags select query grew to over 100 ms as the test progressed. This value was much below 50 ms (between 10 - 25 ms) in previous tests. I am going through the code to understand what is the function of the mdl_cache_flags table: - What kind of information is stored there? - How does the information change with content/time or something else? - Is this table schema/structure somehow different? The really odd thing is we have not seen this behavior in production - and we don't want to hence the research. Any questions/comments would be welcome. Best regards, Charu Khamitkar",

Instructor add forum 2. Student add discussion to forum 3. Add files to forum 4.

This link suggests 'show one section' will have a significant positive impact on page load times. in addition this page suggests keeping Blocks to an absolute minimum will also have a significant positive impact. Can other Moodlers confirm this? It makes sense to me that showing less content will load faster but I was wondering if anyone else tried measuring the impact? I'm trying to make a case for the 'show one section' setting, performance will be my main argument. Can other course designers chime in, is this course layout considered better design as well? With very long pages with lots of Topics and activities /resources it would be easier to scan the page (less clutter), how about shorter pages, with say 10 Topics and 3-4 activities/resources per topic, do designers still recommend it under those circumstances? ===== Moodle 2.7.8 environment, theme essential, windows server",

I had to postpose and find problems. We have given 64 GB ram with 8 virtual cpus in Vspere, Hence I think resources are good enough. But default php memory limit was not changed. it was 128M then I changed it to -1 (hope assigned to get maximum that can get per script). Other than that  php-fpm error log has error \"you may need to increase pm.start_servers\" I have used all the default values that comes with php 7.2. I'm using mpm_event_module. Could you please correct me about php memory limit and how set values for the mpm_event_module. Thanks in Advance.",

          "Text": "There are many good articles online about how to properly configure/tune your PHP/ Apache Settings. Apache MPM event is configured through /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_event.conf on Ubuntu, CentOS would be different but similar. The default settings for you would probably be ok, but maybe raise \"MaxRequestWorkers\" from the default 150 to 400 or something. I think over 400 requires a higher serverlimit configuration but I'm not sure as we run load balanced servers and don't need a higher value. PHP FPM settings would be in /etc/php//fpm/pool.d/www.conf on Ubuntu, as before it would similar on CentOS. The default www.conf settings only give you about 5 php processes I think, not enough to run 300 students on a quiz. There is no exact rule here to set the pm.* values but it does depend on the basic formula of \"RAM free / PHP process size\". An average PHP process size (depending on what you're doing) could be 300M (round up to give some padding). Say 64 GB is only running the web server, take off 2GB for the OS, maybe 1GB for Opcache, xGB for something else and you have 60GB left.",

We have problems with getting timeout messages on our moodle site when we know the server is not timing out and when we know our internet connection is solid. It seems to happen more on a Mac than on a PC, but it we have had it on a PC. All the problems seem not to be browser dependent-we can replicate the problem on Firefox, safari and IE. We have tried on Macs OSX, Windows running through Parallels, Windows on PCs, and yesterday I was able to try on Linux mint via Parallels. I dont know that the larger community *should* try to replicate, but I wanted to take a quick poll to see if others have expierenced similar events. Exploring the idea of local firewalls is a helpful idea to look into and would tie in with other theories I have been exploring with our network team. Thanks!",

Are you using a load balancer at all? Specifically Linux Virtual Server? If so there are some problems with some of the load balancing options that are poorly documented that could be causing that. One other thing are the apache error logs on your moodle servers showing anything around this corresponding time?",

A good way to test for a firewall issue is to turn on performance debugging which will display the time it takes the server to build the page. If its only taking .5 seconds to build a page, but the user is reporting it taking 20 seconds to display that is normally a network layer issue such as a problem with a firewall configuration. I also recommend that you do comprehensive server and network monitoring. We use SNMP via a program called Cacti (which is also open source).",

If you are seeing serious slowdowns ask for the running processes log snap shot when the slowdown is occurring. Normally this log sorts by time running or system resources used (can't remember which) but 3 or more logs like that and look for what is at the top of the heap.

          "Title": "dbpersist on Postgres with PGPool?",
          "Text": "Hi, We moved over to Postgres from MySQL at the beginning of this academic year and have been mostly quite happy with performance. However, we've recently experienced a few occasions when some of the application servers have been having issues getting hold of the database. We run Postgres with PGpool with 100 connections, which generally seems to work well, except yesterday when we got the following error: \n```text\n[Thu Nov 23 14:28:48.595788 2017] [:error] [pid 35247] [client \n10.91.0.224:24593\n] PHP Warning:  pg_connect(): Unable to connect to \nPostgreSQL\n server: FATAL:  remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections in \n/moodle/lib/dml/pgsql_native_moodle_database.php\n on line 170, referer: \nhttp://moodle.port.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=191648&chapterid=42145\n```\n Moodle was not particularly busy in terms of users (about 350, where we normally support 5-600 without any issues). After a little googling, I realised that perhaps php is not using the correct pg connection function for our set up (pg_connect, rather than pg_pconnect). Our config contains the following value: \n```text\n'dbpersist' => 0\n```\n Presumably this should be 1 or true in order to make the most of our PG pooling? We're also looking at moving to PG Bouncer in order to increase efficiency, but presumably the same config would be necessary? Any advice much appreciated!",

Backups for this course don't need to be stored for such a long time. Is there any way I can tell Moodle in future to delete backups that are older than say, three days? Is there any way I can tell it to delete the existing backups that are older than three days as well? I have checked the backup admin settings at <settings -> courses -> backups -> automated backup setup>, and \"Keep\" is set to 2, which to my mind should mean only two days worth of backups get kept (as backups are taken daily). Is something going wrong here? Thanks, David",

Still not \"too high\" that the remaining software stack comes into play introducing too many variables. There is a price for its simplicity: one can't even think of converting the result into a max. no. of concurrent users, because the amount of RAM is not part of the formula. The other question about a machine database: I'm not keen on reentering the data into a mask. In fact, I haven't done any formatting for these posts. UnixBench creates a HTML file which I've copied one-to-one into the text box (changing the format into 'HTML format?). About actual servers: The two servers above are still in production use. The dates I've given are the dates they were commissioned.",

Who wants to pay a ton of money for a system with weak system bench (cpu, file system, os, kernel) yes no ram, but still. With all the VPS systems on the market I have a feeling it will be easy to spot differences between two systems. For instance two VPS with 512mb ram yet very different final system benchmarks.

Example: AWS EC2 small instance $65/month minimum with 200 - 220 system benchmark. Also, I'm not asking for anyone, including yourself to post information about every single hosting provider. Simply posting one of your better VPS or Dedicated systems with provider / cost / and configuration. Typically administrators don't jump around between hosting / datacenters. At least I know I don't. So your countless hosting solutions turn out to be only handful which is easily doable. More importantly very helpful people trying to make a decision where to host Moodle. Posting benchmarks without (Hosting Provider, Cost, configurations like raid setup) become useless. Unless your just having fun! Everyone knows that and i7 CPU 920 based system is going to provide a higher system benchmark then an i5 or i3 based system.",

          "Text": "The question sounds so simple ... but it really isn't.  Am sure others might disagree with what is written below, but ... First, the hosting 'quick install' apps/buttons ... what version of Moodle does it install?   Does hosting provider actually support their installs?   And once you have a version installed, will the hosting provider also provide 'one click' upgrades?   Upgrading is important ... see http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases and note that under each version listed there is a date for when support ends.   For 2.5, as an example: Bug fixes for general core bugs in 2.5.x will end May 2014 (12 months). Bug fixes for serious security issues in 2.5.x will end November 2014 (18 months). So let's say your course is still running in Nov. of 2014.   Now the task is how to upgrade it.  Not impossible, but will require some work and knowledge one didn't gain when using the 'quick install' button.  Yes, there are alternative routes ... backup courses, restore courses to a fresh new version, but how reliable are those?   Never been tested by user to know.  (might add that a for the most part restoring has few issues, but there are some courses that do have issues). Second: how flexible is the hosting plan?   What are the caps for storage, bandwidth, and DB?  If your course stays viable until Nov. 2014, by then DB has grown and you've added more content (hopefully very interesting approaches to instruction/learning).  If one is keeping an eye on users and their tech (highly recommended) you might be providing audio/video for multiple platforms ... iPads/Android tablets as well as traditional computers.  So you started with the 'cheapo' and now you need to expand/increase your plan.  Actually, hosting providers have been known to tell customers they need to do so because they have surpassed the caps of their original plan.   In some cases, they actually might block access to your site until the issue is resolved.  If on shared hosting, you are entitled to your 'fair share' of resources ... those you pay for ... and no more. Bottom line ... It is wise of you to ask the question.  However, not everyone's experience with hosting company Y or X is the same.   Ask some futuristic questions of the hosting provider. IMHO , better to have more than you need than find yourself short (if at all possible).   Yes, that might cost more. 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

What happens if you drop web server 1 from the cluster, do things work normally? What happens when you drop web server 2 out from the cluster? Your description of the problem is kinda like walking into a doctors office and telling the doctor you dont feel good and expecting the doctor to know what is wrong without knowing  the specifics. If both of your web servers work fine independently of the LB then we have a pretty good idea that the LB is the source of the problem. good luck.",

Did you clear your cache ? 3. did you try to change your theme temporary and tested ? 4. you have 2 web servers, for testing you just add a unique hidden names inside login page in both servers, like web 1 and web 2. then try in two three computers ans check for that name. if its comes with same server. there is an issue in LB configurations Basically, Im suspecting this may be another issue,. not the LB",

I recommend Katalon Recorder browser extension to record your browser actions then export them to jmeter. If you can figure out how to make multiple sessions with chromedriver please share as I have only able to get 1 user per desktop.

I am using a VPS and asked the hosting company to look at the memory settings and anything else on their end and they say it looks fine. What they did say is as follows: Currently, your memory_limit for PHP processes is at 256M, which is close to the maximum you would want for PHP: root@tor [/home.......]# php -i | grep memory_limit memory_limit => 256M => 256M In terms of the site running slow, I checked it through a 3rd party speed tester, and it's about about 3.5 seconds: http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/#!/dGwOSP/torahskills.org/main (This last part is my front page on Moodle - nothing special on it.) The primary issue slowing that down is javascript is being called very\nearly. if your developer can address that, it will increase your load\nspeed dramatically: http://gtmetrix.com/reports/torahskills.org/3gC78Lu6 Beyond that, here are general optimization guidelines for moodle. if\nyou need help with any of the server-side configuration on these, let us\nknow: https://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Performance_recommendations .

          "Text": "Hi Tzvi, I'm afraid that this is largely a mis-reading and can be ignored. Moodle loads a few pieces of JavaScript in the header - specifically things which must be present so that they can be used early. That's a big of configuration directly in the page header, our core JS library (which I'd like to eventually deprecate but this is slow work); and the core part of our YUI library. Everything else is then done in the footer. Additionally we have put a lot of work to encourage browser-side caching of content. All of these files, and all of our CSS is set to cache for about a year, so once a browser has loaded the page for the first time, it should not need to retrieve those files from the server again. The only times that we re-fetch are when things change - which we determine by changing the filename. This is controlled by a field which is incremented whenever you purge your caches, or complete an upgrade. The only other exception to this is when you have actively disabled caching within Moodle. In addition to this, we serve minified content to make the content delivered to your browser even smaller. Looking at the report you have from gmetrix.com, you have disabled the minification of those files. This is typically controlled by your debug setting (search for debug in the admin settings). So before going any further, I'd recommend disabling developer mode. We're already doing as much as possible to reduce the amount of JS loaded early but there are still improvements to be made. Sadly these are not easy to implement because there is a lot of legacy code, and code in third-party plugins which may be using this code. Hopefully we'll see further improvements in that in upcoming versions too, Andrew",

I'm unsure why my DB is getting hit so hard if I am using memcached? Most of the time the DB server is running at about 20% capacity, but when it's having this session lock renewal situation, it maxes out both Disk I/O and Network I/O. Anyone got any ideas? Jerrett",

Performance seems fine when being accessed in standalone Desktop PCs (WIndows 10) but when being accessed in thin client PCs connected in a host server(WIndows server 2012) there are times that loading takes a life time. Like during an exam, when a student clicks the next page button, it won't load unless you hit the button again. This only happens when moodle is being accessed in a thin client and when two or more users are accessing moodle on thin clients under the same Host PC/Host Server.

The community here seems incredible as well. I've noticed that a lot of the universities using the system right now are a lot smaller than we are. We have about 30k students, and about 2k instructors. Our current BB system is averaging about 100k hits per day right now. I was wondering if anyone else was running a very large university with moodle. We can throw a lot of hardware at this if we decide to migrate (I'm looking at multiple front end machines, load balanced all pointing to a ridiculously large database machine behind them). We'll also develop a BB migration tool (it's just XML after all) to share. But if I can find someone who has taken this big, it will be a much easier sell. Thanks in advance. Jason",

We have had a very good experience at the Department of Mathematics where Moodle is running on a PC and hits at a rate of 2000 page requests/hour at busy times do not slow it down perceptibly. But this is with only 500 students. There are of course two possible routes for going university-wide: One server per department One cluster for the whole university I think the first option is actually much better because then each department is still free to modify their copy of Moodle on their server to suit their requirements. Here in the maths department for example we have extended our Moodle to automatically generate randomized problem sheets for our students and to mark them automatically. This system would not be useful for a literature department for example.",

A windows setup using client/server has extra taxes like client access licenses, etc..   TCP/IP stack apps (like a Moodle) are limited by the hardware    Moodle isn't a client/server type app. It does make sense to have one Moodle server for all but I would venture to guess that one server specs would have to be increased to handle 210 X 6 connections - IF all 210 users on a segment of the local LAN attempted to access the Moodle at one time.

Given the same specs, one could possibly break apart what's required to run a Moodle into 2 ... have one server dedicated to nothing but DB and the other the single web server that interfaces to the DB server.   The DB server dedicated to nothing but being a DB server for Moodle.  And the Web server being dediated to nothing but a Web server for Moodle.  But, I suspect that even that ... configured and tweaked to be maximum ... wouldn't result in acceptable performance and goal of the number of students that would/could access the Moodle at one time. One might have to 'rob from Peter, to pay Paul' ... so to speak ....  which would be dependent on the hardware of the chosen 'Paul' machine.   Moodle needs more memory.   So if server Paul had two memory slots available to accept compat memory chips, one might be able to take the memory chips from 'Peter' and insert them into server \"Paul' thus increasing memory from 4gb RAM to 8gb.   And the 'Paul' server will need more HD space as well.   One could take the HD's from 'Peter' and install them in server 'Paul' as attached drives.  The attached drives wiped clean of anything operating system and basically a data drive. Bascially, you loose the ability to use 'Peter' ... you are using it for parts for the 'Paul' server. I speak from first hand experience in working with very small school districts in rural South Texas whose total technology budget for each annual/academic year was around $2500.00.  Was the reason they were introduced to open source and Linux ... 0 cost upfront, no on-going licensing fees of any kind, but did require some imagination and remote support (if not remote, but self maintained, a learning curve).

          "Text": "The first thing that comes to mind: This is a disaster in the making. The second it this could be an awesome experiment for the right person. 210 clients 6 servers 6 labs 35 clients per lab / server * note * I assume all 1800 students will have access on all servers I assume you have 1Gbit internal network. I did not take into consideration total students as this does not really play into performance Primary Questions: Are the servers independent? Option 1 (independent labs) lab1.moodle.com with learning material about biology lab2.moodle.com with learning material about chemistry etc Option 2 (shared labs) All of the content on all of the servers, in all of the labs. Each has its own benefits Observation I created a 3rd party admin panel some time ago for a language institute that had 10 servers all running Moodle in various geographical locations. Essentially it allowed the school to manage all ten servers through one administrative panel. Essentially you could select Lab1 and deploy a user to that server and assign a course. We even went as far as pulling grades into the 3rd party admin panel to centralize everything versus logging into multiple servers for grades, etc. Obviously this is just an observation and not in the scope of this discussion. If you actually decide to include some more details regarding your intended operations it would be a lot easier for everyone to provide valuable advice. Warnings If your doing this in Windows or using these servers for anything other than Moodle your already done. Whoever takes on this challenge will have to push your limited hardware to the maximum to make this work. Keep everything on one server (do not separate the DB to one server as Paul suggested). You have six labs and six servers, this may be something you do if you acquire additional servers in the future. The idea of using one server as mentioned by Usman is pretty risky. That adds additional variables that are beyond the scope of the information provided so far. If you have 200+ users start an exam at the same time, which is common in a local environment, odds are pretty high one of many unpleasant things may happen. Also this type of configuration will certainly add more complexity and additional variables to consider. Otherwise try keep the setup as simple as you possibly can and good luck!",

This configuration implemented in several school that i maintained.  Hope it help to choose the right configuration regarding your needs. YaniSidi",

I don't know about Windows VPS. Delivering videos (and other files) needs bandwidth, not CPU nor RAM. If you conduct synchronous on-line exams (using quizzes) only, depending on the number, size of the exam paper and how exactly synchronous - all in the same minute or distributed over 10 min. - you'll experience the limits of your machine. By then, you should have found out how to do site backups, which you can easily migrate to a more powerful machine. The costs of maintaining a server application is not in the hardware, it is about user management, backup, availabilty, security, privacy, ... Q2. Which Moodle version should I use for the first install?",

Q1, 'VPC or dedicated', fits perfectly here and you are welcome to continue on that. From the intro, \"This forum is for discussing issues related to computer hardware for Moodle, as well as comparing notes on Moodle's performance under load. Advice on finding an internet hosting service also belongs here.\" > Do you think a dedicated server running Linux with this specification will do the job well ? What is the job exactly, I mean do you have any relevent technical data? The kind of data I'm talking about is explained the performance documentation linked from the introduction to this this forum. The only information we have: a) 120 students and b) some courses with long videos. The point is, nobody can tell to a reasonable accuracy what exactly the \"load\" is going to be. The common solution is to buy the biggest server one can afford. At the present level of hardware prices this means that the servers are often way over powered, in the West at least. Comparing the servers: A. dedicated Intel i3 2100 3.1Ghz | 3M SmartCache ; 4GB DDR3 B. VPS with 8 GB RAM When you say, 'which one is better', perhaps you meant their computing power. You need to run a benmark on both to find that out. See the discussions: - Performance perspectives - a little script http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=57028 - \"Unixbench\" http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=200362 The next problem is, once you have the numbers how do you interpret them. May be one server is better in CPU operations but slower in disk I/O. One has more RAM but slower network latency, etc. I doubt that there will be a clear winner, in general. In your case too, server A could be better in CPU and disk I/O but has half the RAM. This comparison is of no use, if both servers are over powered any way. I would choose the VPS because it wastes less energy. If the need arises, and it will ultimately according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth#Wirth.27s_law , you can always migrate to a more poweful machine. Some VPS hosters provide upgrades without you having to reinstall. Even if you had to, it is not a big deal. See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_migration .",

          "Text": "Hello: I'm running a small Moodle 2.2.2 installation on a Linux CentOS MySQL 5.5 VPS account to support my own courses and students (5-7 sections for 25 students per section approximately). I have My SQL binary logging switched on. My understanding is that binary logging is used by InnoDB for (a) replication to a slave database and (b) enabling InnoDB to recover and restore a database backup to a particular point in time using transaction rollback/forward. In my circumstances, I am not replicating anything to a slave database nor plan to, and for my purposes a once-a-day mysqldump backup of the database is sufficient. To restore a database I've just been using the ordinary mysql cli command to load the dump into the database. Works fine for me and my needs. So I'm wondering given my circumstances and needs do I really need mysql to be using binary logging at all? (1) Is binary logging a hit on VPS performance? (2) Would there be any negative effects or risks if I simply turned off binary logging altogether? Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",

          "Text": "This post is to help out people trying to get nginx+php-fpm working with moodle. I have ran into a few problems, so I thought I would share what I did that worked. I had to scrounge this information off the net from various places. Note: this is still a work in process, so thorough client testing is not done yet. I will update if we run into any problems. Setup is Ubuntu 11.04 server with nginx 1.08 from the stable ppa. Using Moodle 2.1 latest from git . (Ask if I'm missing anything) Here is the config I'm using: (at /etc/nginx/sites-available/default) http://pastie.org/2732674 To kind of go over it, we're using forced ssl (hence the rewrite rule on port 80.) The lines: fastcgi_split_path_info ^ (. + \\.php)( / .+)$; fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info; Were taken from: http://kbeezie.com/view/php-self-path-nginx/ This forces nginx to send the right PATH_INFO so that normal file uploads/downloads work with moodle. Before you would get a 404. Note: I saw many places where you had to edit moodle code to get this to work. Either that was fixed, or they didn't know you could do it this way. I didn't edit any moodle code (other than the change mentioned at the bottom.) The line: fastcgi_read_timeout 600; Makes nginx wait for moodle to finish long tasks (like restoring courses, etc.) Before it would just end at a blank screen. The line: client_max_body_size 10000M; Allows for large uploads. This is in addition to the stuff you have to change in php.ini. Finally for fastcgi to work correctly, you have to add this to your moodle's config.php: $CFG->sslproxy=true; That's really all I had to do to get it working. I'll post more as our situation changes.

          "Text": "I can argue that the AMP (particularly XAMPP/LAMPP: apachefriends.org) could be *better* in a production environment, at least in some cases.  For what it's worth, I'm pretty particular about my systems, and I'm running them on XAMPP.  Clean, duplicatable, easy, powerful.  Don't overlook duplicatable: systems that are easy to replicated are usually much more stable...per my experience. I occasionally have to build stuff from scratch, namely modules for apache add-in.  I end up building from apache source, even making my own apache executable set.  But I run from XAMPP/LAMPP, nonetheless. On linux/redhat9, I try to funnel all my system customizations in /opt.  LAMPP installs by default in /opt/lampp.  I usually build everything else in /opt/local.  Therefore, when I want to duplicate my system, I tar up /opt, then untar it on my new system.  DISCLAIMER:  I have yet to test this yet with *all* of my /opt, but I have done it with /opt/lampp (which is really just reinstalling LAMPP), and I find it works well. Furthermore, the LAMPP upgrade process is all nicely bundled.  It appears to work well.  I have yet to experience it much, although I have progress from XAMPP 1.4.5 (on windows) to LAMPP 1.4.9a with the same/similar server apps and data.  No problems that I recall. Oh yeah...this little fact that I migrated across heterogenous operations systems is a BIG deal in my book. I suspect someday I might get heavy with apache or my sql customization and might want to diverge.  Until then, I love my XAMPP/LAMPP. My $.02.",

Set MaxSpareServers, ServerLimit and MaxClients to the same, according to your server memory ... 100. You'll see a big difference. - Monitor your server performace permanently.

There are about 6 ISP’s here in Tanzania each connected via Satellite to the rest of the Internet. We have our own Satellite link.So if a home user wants to reach a server in School traffic will travel a Satellite hop twice. Hosting the Moodle server on the school network would make access from outside very slow. Hosting it outside school would make access from the school network very slow. My question is now: Could we setup a Moodle on two mirrored servers? Ideally we would have a Master server in school and a Slave server hosted somewhere overseas. Updates in the Master server should be replicated after school hours (or overnight) to the slave server. Updates on the slave server should be replicated directly to the master server. In that way we would use our Internet bandwidth most efficiently. (See graph attached to get an idea of our Internet bandwith usage) Any thoughts?",

If so, you could bond two or three connections and have a quick, though bandwidth-limited, connection. You could also provide dial-up access yourself to the moodle site... if the infastructure exists. Have you considered wireless? If you have a cell phone that works where you are, you may be able to do some sort of mobile wireless connection. Have you considered praying for WiMAX?

For general activity tables this is not a problem, but when these IDs are used for referencial integrity, then you have a problem. You can logically replicate activities , logs, grades etc. from remote sites to a central site, but only one site can be allowed for admin to courses and users, because of the referencial integrity. This is an opinion we have open under another database forum, just search for replication. We have developed a utility that does replication of this nature between 68 remote sites and one mother moodle. Like I say in the other forum, a moodle expert would have to give us a good opinion and then we can make this available to everyone. It is quite risky and you can really mess things up.

          "Text": "Hi Tim, Interesting question. It's one I've just spent quite a bit of time recently trying to answer for myself. My environment: IBM Bladecenter model 8677 IBM Bladeserver LS20 dual CPU dual core 2 GHz Opteron (4 cores) 8GB RAM 200 MB/s fiber channel SAN Nexsan array, 512MB cache, 8x500GB 7200RPM SATA drives in a RAID5 pack VMware ESX 3.0 Enterprise We have two of these blades and run about 14 VMs across the two, with a massive amount of CPU cycles to spare. We rarely run more than 10-15% CPU utilization across both the blades. Memory usage runs about 4-5GB per blade. We've been running an ESX VM of SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, Moodle 1.7, mysql 5.x, Apache2, and php5. I had been using the uniprocessor 2.6.27.x kernel and only 1 CPU core. One of our faculty had his class using the chat server on Friday. Unfortunately I wasn't involved at the time, but I'm told the system hit the wall prompting a less experienced member of our IT staff to reboot the VM (tisk tisk) in hopes of solving the problem. The CPU usage was apparently pegged at 100% and the system became unresponsive. This can't be a disk issue due the the horsepower of our SAN. This leaves CPU and memory, possibly Apache and my sql tuning, or incompatibilities between/amongst the various verions of our LAMP components. The VM had 512MB at the time and as I said a single CPU. Just today I increased the CPU count to 4, replaced the kernel with the SMP kernel (do NOT use the BIGSMP kernel), and bumped the memory to 1GB. I locked this VM to ESX blade 1 to keep DRS from vmotioning it. I increased the number of pre-fork httpd processes in the Apache2 config from 10 to 20 and max idle to 40. I should know this coming week if it helped. I'm researching the chat performance here on the forum. My gut instinct is that I'm probably far better off running a dedicated chat server on another VM. I'm no Apache or mysql guru so there's probably still much performance for me to gain by tweaking these daemons. Oh, and btw , ESX simply rocks, especially in a blade server and SAN environment. We run most of our back end servers on the two blades mentioned above, with the exception of our Exchange server, MS sql server, and 4 Citrix servers. We have both our W2K3 AD DCs and about 5 other windows servers running as VMs as well as all of our Linux servers--Novell iFolder and ZLM servers, Moodle, as well as a Debian Request Tracker (helpdesk) server. All of our VMFS volumes, VMDKs, and their mapped LUNs (RDMs) reside on the SAN arrays, one IBM FasTt 600 and one Nexsan Satablade. The performance and reliability we've experienced with ESX is phenominal. Stan Hoeppner Sysadmin Whitfield School",

After sorting out the chat issue, our moodle server I previously described is running pretty well. Under ESX, be sure to run each VM(guest) as a uniprocessor machine, in other words, no virtual smp. If you run into performance problems, you can always build more VMs to separate the load, i.e. build a dedicated mysql or postgre server, a dedicated apache server for moodle, a dedicated chat server for running chatd.php. You can make the servers painfully small so they don't each much ram in the esx environment, and you'll get fantastic CPU utilization from your hardware. The possibilities for flexibility are endless if you use SAN storage in your ESX environment.",

Perhaps a problem with sessions or with a corrupted table. We run ESX and any problem we've had has looked like software/hardware until we dig deep and determine the problem with the underlining configuration. A couple examples: A corrupted quiz table causes mysql load to spike as it reads rows without indexes thus causing apache to backup. Sessions stored on a NFS server suffer from flocking due to poor NFS implementation. This also causes apache to backup and not respond to various requests. We've had session problems in mysql database based on adodb library problems, see this thread, http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=106108 My point here is that I'd look every other place before I'd look at ESX for the problem. Check your mysql slow querry log. Do some strace of your apache threads to see if there are any locks or disk read issues. Other system settings you changed when migrating boxes to ESX? I'd bet there is some underlining cause of the problem that is not hardware or esx releated.",

Because the pdf file is too big to upload it here, I am sharing the document through Dropbox: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37798183/Multi-tenancy-in-Moodle.pdf We are going to start a new MSc and there are discussions at the moment about if we should create a new Moodle site for the MSc or we should offer it through the existing Moodle platform (medium size). The increase in number of users per year would be less than a 100. Both MSc share the same branding, the same LDAP authentication server and SMTP mail server, so that was for me an argument for keeping the same site and using different global categories for the different MScs (for instance). However, some staff members consider that having the same Moodle site would make very difficult to use features such as News forums, as I cannot use different global news forums. Looking into the Multi-tenancy solutions, I would to know if there are any updates since the document was written in 2012 and if the distributed tenancy will work in a Windows server.

I had a look to the demo site and my impression was that ELD is more focused to companies that use several Moodle site but that they don't have the indoor resources to manage so many Moodle sites. What I am basically looking is some sort of application/software that allows you to MANAGE several Moodle sites easily. For instance: 1) If you instal a new plug-in, the plug-in is installed all the Moodle sites. 2) If you make a change in the core code, the change is valid for all the Moodle sites. I know that for technicians who know how to program in Linux, that would be very easy to achieve using VS software and bash commands (I think Carnegie College had a technical solution based on that). However, I am wondering how I can achieve the same in Windows. Regards, Mari Cruz",

That you only need to change the 'wwwroot', 'dataroot' and 'prefix' per installation. That the 'domain' in a switch statement could perform the separation and each case set the correct values. The 'config.php' file is one of the few files that is not touched when you pull new updates and so maintenance is less. Ok, this is not full UI multi-tenancy and is a bit complicated to set-up, but I think it would work. Cheers, Gareth",

Visvanath is clearly capable of doing this, but I would not recomment that someone who is not familiar with the underlying PHP should be administrating virtual hosts in this way.  LDAP and CLI should be expected to work correctly as long as the code uniquely associates sets of wwwroot,dataroot,dbhost, and dbhost variables.

Also - apache processes for Moodle are always going to be greater than 10MB. - that's more likely if you're just serving out static pages with practically no apache modules loaded (incl. php). There's another active thread at the moment referring to the documented \"rule of thumb\" of 1GB per 50 concurrent users... and I think that ratio is rather ambitious (even with a highly tuned system), but looking at your process log you have got a LOT of other junk running (Gnome applets etc) - your top 10 processes are almost all unrelated to Moodle. Are your Linux skills up to running your server without a GUI? It looks like you're installing a package and receiving an alert from an SELinux diagnostic tool also - might not be a good idea while you're trying to analyse your system. Good luck with solving your problem. Myles C.",

There is a performance data gathering routine which runs once per minute, but this spike only happens at 16:14. I don't think the slowdown is related to memory, as there were only a few users online, and there's 4GB in the server. I'm a little puzzled as to why there are mor Apache processes than users loggen in. Do old processes take a while to 'die'? You're probably right about not running a GUI, as i do 99% of the admin via webmin, but I'm not that confident just yet. We've just had a new server with a quad core Xeon and 8GB delivered which I'm in the process of setting up. I'd like to get this problem sorted before I migrate things across, though. Regards RW",

          "Text": "If you are talking about a 2 server setup, 1 of each. Then the best place is on the Web Server, setup RSYNC for backups to the DB server if you do not use a 3rd party solution, use APC for opcode cache and configure the MUC using the plugin, https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=cachestore_apc to add all other cache's into APC. Now if you have 2 web servers and 1 DB Server, For best performance put /moodledata on a shared LUN using OCFS2 for concurrent read/write. My best opinion if you cannot have a shared LUN is to use GlusterFS for the raw data storage like the contents in /moodledata/filedir and put as much of the cache's in memcache. To make it easy for a novice, install Couchbase on all nodes and configure the MUC accordingly and since Couchbase is a drop-in replacement for memcache it will be automatically distributed and highly available.

          "Text": "What do you mean by 'browsing users'? On our system we have information on the number of distinct users seen in the last 5 minute period. For example the current number is 1103. (I don't think the total number of users makes any significant difference to load; it's the number of requests per second or whatever that really does.) To handle our load we have four webservers, and our database server has a lot more RAM than yours (64GB I think). Our database is postgres (as per this silly video with lots of swearing ). That 1103 is a typical number for us whereas your 500 was 'max'. If you were expecting 250 to be typical, then one webserver seems to be a similar level compared to our system. Using only a single webserver has the advantage that it makes session storage a whole lot simpler. A more specific metric that takes into account browsing habits (ie 'one user' who just looks at course webpage is no problem, 'one user' who browses many forum pages is a significant load) is the number of Moodle log entries per 10 minute period. We are seeing around 15,000 at present. Note that our live system is still 1.9 - reports seem to suggest that 2.0 is at least twice as slow, so if you're using 2.0, you might want to consider increased capacity. In general I would advise that you try to ramp usage into your system so that you have time to monitor performance and increase capacity if required (i.e. rather than everybody starts using it on the same day). --sam",

Having said that, it shouldn't be that slow, even for single user stuff (a standard XAMPP setup is faster than that on XP). Monitor the performance and try and identify what the bottleneck is (look at RAM + CPU usage overall and per-process). which suggesions from the docs did you try? You might find more joy chatting to the good folks in the Windows-based servers forum, as they're likely to be able to give you some more specific advice. Good luck getting started with Moodle. MC",

You could possibly do a 'hot spare' configuration where periodically you copy things from production to a standby backup server. Then when the first one dies, you just switch things over to the second one with a bit of manual work. Automated cluster solutions do get fairly complex and tricky and you also lose a lot of the responsiveness of Moodle since you have to use network based or clustered file systems. Also: See https://docs.moodle.org/32/en/Server_cluster# But I concur with Howard, it's a lot of effort and money spent and you will still have a failure point. Most of our outages for example are from networking issues. If you buy good server class hardware, that's very unlikely to be the failure point.",

          "Text": "Does Your code solve the evictions problem associated with reboot of the memcached server as You pointed out referring to a blog post here http://dormando.livejournal.com/495593.html . The replies to this blog post, mentioned the possibility of having redundant memcached servers. However, the Moodle documentation implies only using nonredundant configuration. As a sysadmin for a small university, I am concerned that the students that are kicked out of sessions, would not get a fair chance to complete their tests. Since the file system is a bottleneck in my setup, I will not put the sessions in the file system. Any chance of eviction, however small is unacceptable, so this leaves me with sessions in the database with a memcached offload, preferably redundant. Does Your code support this type of setup? And if so, are there any examples of configuration?",

If you are able to utilize a form program that will provide the responses in a text file you can just upload the responses into a program like Exce l or the spreadsheet in OpenOffice and review them. Consider installing your own Moodle and using the questionnaire mod to obtain these responses. What do other Moodle rs think?? Looks like it will be an interesting thesis. WP1",

          "Text": "Hi Martin, I picked up on this thread when I experienced the same problem. The advise to drop backups via cron and use DB/moodledata backups instead is very useful as are points about user-driving course backup/restore still being available and the use of a secondary install of moodle if a cron backup was required. These options are available to me so I guess I will use them. In the interest of curiosity however... Why are large reams of white space (an <br /> ) chars output? Would this not be classed as a bug? What does the cron backup do that makes it so time consuming (I notice my CPU utilisation yo-yos between ~100% and ~1% every 50 seconds or so With a moodle environment of 3151 users and 260 courses (5Gb of moodledata) - is this deamed large?

          "Text": "1) No idea. 2) Course backup execution time depends on many factors. The size of any particular course is a big one. Also the performance capabilities of your server do play a part. Our experience has been that \"automatic course backups\" are not super reliable, for a variety of reasons, and we usually do not recommend them. Doing a full database backup at the server level is actually a much more effective, consistent, and complete way to backup a Moodle site. Look into using my sql dump for this process. For example: mysqldump -Q -c -q -udbuser -pdbuserpassword -hmysqlhostname moodledb > moodle_database_backup.sql 3) Your site sounds \"medium sized\" based on my experience so far. 5GB moodledata is getting up there, though. Certainly on the large end of the spectrum, but I have seen much larger. seeya",

Right now we have a 2 TB, 4 core, 32 GB RAM LAMP stack and Moodle 2.9. Moodle is the only thing on it.

The RAM is very customizable. Is there usually a sweet spot and then after that you get less and less performance for the dollar or does it scale well and every dollar you spend you just keep on getting a big increase?

The problem with that is that it's not fixed - you need to either build in some spare for the future, or make sure you can add more when your database gets bigger.",

Number of users that have accounts doesn't necessarily equate to the number of users actually logged on *and* doing something.  So what other data does one have that indicates splitting out the DB onto another server will increase performance/solve issues? While there are things one can choose/do to make sure the speed of a dedicated DB server is optimal, that setup still involves networking ... before the application.  That becomes a piece of the puzzle when things go south (if they do go south) and could involve other things not considered.   In the past, as an example,  it was thought by some that a fiber channel connection was needed (web -> DB server) to get max speed ... but Cat 6 wire now-a-days thought good enough to handle it ...

I had requested some server optimizations with our dedicated server extended support plan and in the request was to get OPcache enabled (already installed, just needed the lines it added to php.ini to be uncommented and switch to fcgi so it would have a handler it could work with). I got the reply all was done and when the site was still so slow at peak, I felt there was no more that could be done. We did figure out that the OPcache was not yet on. We got it enabled properly last Friday. I had heard that it would speed things up Moodle by 2x to 3x times, but at peak it really feels more like it was a 10x gain. That is one useful tool to get on a busy site! So, we are keeping up with demand now and will not need to resort to splitting the database out to get a performance boost just yet. Now to figure out why we are starting to get Internal server error pages here and there for the last few days - One course will not load and a few less important pages are turning up with it. I am beginning to wonder if the server side troubleshooting will ever end. It is a bit like digging in sand. You shovel out one thing and it is replaced by something else. I have really learned a lot since moving to Moodle 2.9 and it has actually generated an interest in learning more about the server side of running a Moodle site - IF I can eek out more time than I have had so that I can learn it right and not just piecemeal here and there at least to get solid foundations under me.   :0)",

When ever a student tries to submit an assignment it take at least 15-20 mins for the page to load, once the student presses the \"save\" button. The upload it self is quite fast. So I don't think it's a file size issue or an upload limit issue. So it's that after pressing the save button it just hangs there for like 20 mins. Any idea what would cause this?

Here are our first experiences I would like to share with Moodlers. 1/ No particular optimization (but all unnecessary modules and filters are deactivated). ~70 students, 5 tests of 20 minutes each during 2 hours. Students could choose in wich order they did the 5 tests. Two of the tests were mathematic tests with lots of formulas filtered with LaTeX (=> lots of small pictures). All students start at the same time. It was painfully slow during the first 10 minutes. Some students had to wait more than 3 minutes to get their first test page. 3 minutes is a very long time... Some other students got database access errors (we needed to refresh the page). After the first 10 minutes all seemed ok. We monitored the server usage during the whole session : even during very calm periods (student are working on their test), CPU was quite loaded by PHP processes... 2/ With PHP accelerator.",

CGI can be configured more restrictively than mod_php anyway (where you have to make things like suexec to get it save the same way). If you you use \"normal\" cgi you should consider to move to fastCGI. We use lighttpd (instead of \"RAM-eater\" apache) in combination with a PHP-cache (xcache) and a reverse proxy and performance is great. TeX-statements are driven to gifs through mimetex binary.

And it's one of the major \"selling\" points for apache: use the modules you need, and even if a given module is buggy, a crash only affects the specific request that is being served when that subprocess dies. And, to be frank, I haven't seen mod_php crash in any decent modern Linux distro in about 4 years now.) Edit: I see you are using Debian etch. mod_php4 or mod_php5 are rock solid on etch. Our moodle cluster runs all on Sarge, and we are movingto Etch soon.

And uploading a file into the new folder I created works fine. So at least there is nothing wrong with the server. Or it seems there isn't. The problem is: I need the uploaded file to be played directly via Flowplayer within Moodle, so I can't use creation of a folder as a workaround. Again, up till now I have been able to upload dozens of videos (yes, the course is very very large in terms of disk space used owing to all the videos). And then suddenly it's as though the tank were full and won't accept any more files directly as a File resource. Any tips and tricks to get around this would be appreciated. I suppose I could suggest users download a free .flv player and download from the Folder onto their local computers and open the .flv and play with the free .flv player.

Though I have not used auto-scaling for Moodle, the approach I would take is: Change the configuration of auto-scaling to 1 EC2 Put Moodle into Maintenance mode Make a backup of Moodle install and data.  Exactly how depends on your configuration.  You just want to be able to restore everything back to the way it was should something break.  Snapshots are usually a simple solution. Perform the Moodle upgrade and test thoroughly. Create a new AMI to be used for auto-scaling Modify your auto-scaling config to use the new AMI Start up a new EC2 instance with that AMI Place the new EC2 in the auto-scaling group and remove the old one Adjust your auto-scaling group back to the number of EC2 instances you need Again, the above is a general guideline and you will want to verify all the steps are correct for your particular install. Just an FYI - The configuration I use has a  single medium EC2, RDS to offload the database functions, and a Load Balancer to offload SSL.  This easily handles between 25-50 users being signed on at once.  I have not really monitored to determine exactly home many concurrent connections this handles or if I really need the RDS or Load Balancer. Hope this helps. Ron",

I wanted\nto use the latest releases of PHP which Turck did thorough testing on.\nUnfortunately, the author of Turck (Dimitri Stogov) was recently hired\nby Zend and\nleft the project in a lurch (as he was the sole contributor). Several\nadventurous souls are trying to pick up development of Turck on\nSourceForge, but it remains to be seen if they can manage such complex\ncode. More\ninteresting is the fact that the author of PHPA (Nick Linridge) is now\non\nthe developer list for Turck MM Cache on Sourceforge although it doesn't appear that he is doing any coding on Turck. In some of the forums, it has been suggested that PHPA may be abandoned in favor of Turck. It is also possible that he\nmay simply use Turck and release it under the PHPA\nbanner since Turck has support of PHP5. So,\nanyway, what all this has left me is with the conclusion that at this point in time, APC is\nthe only free accelerator that is _currently maintained and developed_\nwhich is why I running APC now. Does anyone else have any insight as to the future of PHPA? Also, is anyone running this successfully with PHP 4.3.6? Thanks and sorry for the long post! John",

This won't truly be the case, but you'll end up with a more robust\nrequirement which will serve you in the long run. I can't speak from experience\nwith this kind of Moodle installation, but I can speak from vast experience\nmoving multi-hundred MB MPEG2 files around simultaneously in a WAN environment. Bandwidth: 250 users x 10 MB (you did mean 10 mega-BYTE as in a downloaded/uploaded\nfile scenario?) = 2500 MB of data moving up/down stream simultaneously. That's\nA LOT of data...even at Fast-Ethernet bandwidth (100Mbps), 2500 MB of data is\nroughly 20000 Mb of data, so it would take 200 seconds (3+ minutes!) to move it\nall (longer really, since you'll never see 100 Mbps even on a well tuned LAN\nsegment). If this is what you're talking about, you better be running Gigabit-Ethernet\non your LAN to accommodate that kind of load. In reality, not all 250 users\nwould be doing something at the same time (some would be idle), and not all of\nwhat they are doing simultaneously would involve moving 10 MB files up/down\nto/from the server (reading, typing, etc.). This is your gray area...what will\nthe REAL maximum bandwidth load be and how do I plan for it? Server: the user activity load may not be that huge in terms of actual served\npages, others here with clustering experience can speak to that specifically,\nbut if the scenario is as bandwidth intensive as I outlined above, you're going\nto be looking at probably several servers just to accommodate the data\nthroughput. It goes without saying that they'll need to be fairly hefty boxes.\nHow hefty? Can't say, again the clustering folks around her might be able to\nhelp.

Perhaps I'm a bit old school, but I think database replication is best left to the database products, and with a hardware load balancer for a pool of apache servers, you have a perfectly scaleable and standard system.  When you start doing things like this , I start to wonder how much impact a distributed file system would have on database performance. Also, the 'linuxDirector' server and backup director server in their HA config are functionally equivalent to a hardware load balancer (used Foundry ServerIron XL and Cisco Local Director can be had on ebay for under $1,000) which is dedicated to that single task with no moving parts.  Given that you already have Oracle , you likely have lots of expensive hardware, and you may find that your University already has load-balancing hardware that you can use. I've always had a keen interest in finding solid, simple HA solutions for web applications and would really appreciate you sharing your experience in the endeavor. Regards, John",

          "Title": "Reduce bandwidth by 80-85%!!!",
          "Text": "Last night I completed a bandwidth trifecta that reduced the overall bandwidth uses on three different types of pages to an average of 17% of what they'd been! The first, and most obvious step is GZIP-ing pages, and this is where you'll see your biggest gain. There are a few ways to do this, but the only one that works for me with my shared host is to enable ZLIB compression in the php.ini file. First, add this line to enable ZLIB compression: \n```text\nzlib.output_compression = On\n```\n Then add this line to determine the amount of compression: \n```text\nzlib.output_compression_level = 6\n```\n The value needs to be between one and ten. I chose six because it seemed to be a popular choice around the web. Choosing one still yields great results and would put less strain on your server. It's worth noting that in my situation you must have a php.ini file in EACH DIRECTORY you wish to use compression in, so I used another script to create symbolic links back to the php.ini file in my root directory. Next, you need to tell your server to not only compress PHP output, but to compress CSS and and Javascript , as well. I'm running Apache , so I did this by adding the following line to my .htaccess file: \n```text\nAddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php .css .js\n```\n I had done this before and while it resulted in smaller files it also resulted in a longer load time. The culprit was /lib/javascript-mod.php . The problem was that the file tries to specify the content length header manually, so when compression is used the browser doesn't think it's reached the end of the file and it hangs, and hangs, and hangs... until it eventually times out. I fixed this by simply removing the content-length header directive from the file altogether. So you might want to keep your eyes peeled for other scripts that try to force content length. Anyway, we've now got compression up and running on all PHP, CSS, and Javascript files. But now the CSS and Javascript are now being returned as an incorrect content-type, which may cause some weird behavior. Plus, our CSS and JS files are STILL more bloated than they need to be. Once again, PHP comes to the rescue. We're going to add a small piece that will run immediately prior to the processing of a PHP page to determine what kind of file we're dealing with and how to handle it. To do this we will add a file I created called prepend-moodle-1.0.php . In my case I put it in an includes folder at my web root (I'm applying these compressions to all pages I server, inside and outside of Moodle). If you only use Moodle, the /local directory would be a good place. Once you decide on the location, add to your php.ini file: \n```text\nauto_prepend_file = /full/path/to/prepend-moodle.php\n```\n For .js, .css, and styles.php (Moodle's composite stylesheets) files we: Send the correct Content-type header Set cache controls and expiration dates and Minify the output (remove excess whitespace, comments, and other unnecessary characters) * Rewrite the minified page with new headers * The methods used for minifying require PHP5 Version 1.0 of my prepend-moodle.php file is attached. Remove the version (-1.0) from the file name before uploading. jsmin can be obtained at http://code.google.com/p/jsmin-php/ cssmin can be obtained at http://code.google.com/p/cssmin/",

          "Text": "Dakota: This seems very promising. One thing to make sure that you do is to test this under the load of many users. It seems like you have considered this, but it is something that many neglect when the do active compression (including attempts at this site, etc.) When things get busy, you don't want the server CPUs to be spending too much time on compression (especially when it is on redundant files) which is why some of these strategies work for single users but don't always work in production. Another area to optimize is that the default style sheets also expire after 10 minutes, which seems fine for development but means a reload much too frequently in production use. I think setting this for more than 24 hours would be better. There also seems to be some caching issues on browsers when ending style sheets files in .php rather than .css, although there are benefits if switching between style sheets. Mostly this affects whether you need to do a command refresh or a normal refresh. Firebug helps to see this issue on reloads. In any case, thanks for your contribution on this. I am sure that many of us will want to check out the ideas to see how they work in practice, and your approach seems original. --Gary",

However ... for additional info in your quest to find out: PHP's zlib output_compression will only work files passed through the PHP handler (i.e. .php files), but Apache's mod_deflate can work on any files (eg static CSS or JS). Besides that, Moodle is using cache + recommend using Zend OpCache or APC for PHP code. If Moodle site using a lot of locally served audio/video then think mod_deflate would help more than PHP's zlib. http://www.whatsmyip.org/http-compression-test/ Run CentOS servers myself and by default, they have deflate turned on.   The PHP required to run 2.7+ of Moodle has to have support for PHP opcache of some sort ... APC or ZendOpcache. Experimented with an extension for Apache called pagespeed for a while.   Using their test page the site passed with flying colors ... hmmmm, why is that not surprising. ;) https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

Bottle necks could be present in MySQL , PHP,  or Apache (assuming typical install).  And bottle neck could be in Virtualized environment (if running under a Virt) or even in networking (behind firewall). Done any tweaks to My SQL (assuming local host - ie, DB server and DB for Moodle on same server as the web server + Moodle code/app)?   If running Linux, for example, one could also acquire and run mysqltuner (or other such script) to check the DB server settings.   How about Apache server itself?  One could do some simple 'apache benchmark' (on linux man ab) test to see if tweaking apache settings wouldn't improve jmeter responses. When running jmeter test did you check 'top' to see if swap space was being used (that has to do with memory management)?   If so, did you also investigate what was using swap space (top with FP)? Did you check apache error logs to see if there any clues there? Probably should have asked first ... what does 'not reponding' look like?   That sounds like a dumb question but not really - browser might not get page rendered as quickly as before and it actually might time out ... but services on the server (apache/mysqld) are still up and running.   PHP settings/tweaks for how much memory a script can consume + how long a script is given to run (30 seconds is default).

          "Text": "I have a solid recommendation for anyone using Moodle on an underpowered server. In fact anyone can use this to increase overall performance! Everything listed below is free and working with my Moodle 2.2+ installations http://cloudflare.com I currently use their free service on four Moodle websites and I noticed a dramatic increase in performance. Performance Globally-distributed network Secure, redundant DNS Anycast routing technology Automatic static content caching Always Online All of the above will help any Moodle installation. Even just the static content caching alone is huge! Basic security Email harvesting protection Reputation-based threat protection Server side exclude ability Hotlinking protection Browser integrity checks Threat control dashboard Block traffic by country or IP range Alert infected human visitors Identify new threats for community All of the above is nice. I love the Block traffic by country or IP range. Our installations reject all incoming requests outside our set country. No more attempts from Japan, Russia, etc. This helps free up system resources and saves bandwidth! Control Easy DNS management Threat challenge page Offline browsing page Setup took about five to ten minutes. However, you have to update your DNS which takes time! Analytics Stats for all the traffic to your site (threats, search engine crawlers and visitors) Outbound link tracking Visitor IP geolocation lookup It never hurts to have extra analytics to review from time to time. I know performance is always an issue with Moodle and I hope the above helps!",

My guess as to the cause might have been wrong. It is just that what you said reminded me of that particular issue. In the profiling you have shown, you ahve chopped off the table after one page full, and I am not sure it is showing what is really using the time in that. Try finding where most of the 'Excl CPU' is going. It certainly is the case that after something has been edited, a critical cache is cleared, and it takes a significant time to rebuild on a big course. But, that should only affect the single next request (and other requests at about the same time will wait for that first one - there is a lock.)",

Though Breeze has a simple LMS component (Breeze Training), Macromedia makes a big deal of their AICC and SCORM compliance.  We haven't used it (yet), but it looks like AICC or SCORM would allow Breeze and a compatible LMS to share information on which students view Breeze content, how they do on embedded quizzes, how often and how long that students interact with Breeze content, etc. Our educators (I'm just an engineer) will probably ask me - can Moodle interact (or with Breeze's XML APIs, be made to interact) with Breeze using AICC or SCORM?

          "Text": "Hi I am planning for clustering our current moodle platform currently. The targeted performance is for around 3000 concurrent users. Our current moodle version is 3.5.8. Here are the SW/HW specs of our current moodle. 1. Main moodle server with: - CentOS 7 - Apache server 2.4.6 - Memcached server 1.4.15 2. Database server with: - MySQL Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.44 (using default engine InnoDB) 3. Storage server on NAS with: - $CFG-> dataroot mounted on this NAS Both application server (1.) and database server (2.) are on VM hosted on the workstation inside our school computing center. Storage server (3.) is a pure NAS machine, like Synology product. It simply offers only a storage function. My plan is to add another application server with the snapshot of the current one (1.), this will give us two application servers for redundancy. Also, put a load balance before these two application servers. I would like to keep the database server and the storage server the same as the structure we have right now. Here is my plan for the new structure. 1. Setup a redis server for application cache and session cache in MUC setting. (moodle dashboard -> Plugins -> caching -> Configuration ) 2. mount dataroot/temp directory ($CFG -> tempdir) on a ramdisk to improve the r/w speed. (Base on the moodle benchmark plugin result and advise) 3. set $CFG-> wwwroot to the load balance server, instead of the main moodle apache server now. I have been figuring out these stuff for a couple of weeks on my own, and I think I got ~90% of all I need to bring our moodle to clustering structure. But I still have several questions. 1. Is there any security or performance risk to put $CFG -> tempdir on a ramdisk? And what is the exact purpose of this temp directory? I have googled with some answers like, backup processes of moodle itself, restoring course data (I have no idea what this means), etc. If this temp directory will not impact the user performance, then I will consider staying with the setting now. 2. Do I need to prepare a new VM instance for the cache server (redis) only, like what I did for the database server? If yes, then what is the recommended memory size of that cache server VM? 3. What is the exact usage of $CFG -> dirroot ? I have checked the GitHub page for the definition of those $CFG, but the comments of $CFG -> dirroot and $CFG -> libroot are the same. This is the GitHub page I mentioned ( https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.5.8/lib/setup.php ). 4. Besides $CFG -> cachedir, $CFG -> tempdir, is there any directory that should be shared in the clustering structure? I have read some performance tuning advice said that I should put the $CFG -> dirroot on the local storage of each application server. 5. The document says do not put session and MUC on the same memcached server, but it didn't mention about redis server. I am wondering is it proper to put session and MUC on the same redis server? Or if I handle session with memcached server and MUC with redis server, is it okay to run the memcached server and redis server on the same host? Many many thanks to you for reading my questions. Hope I have stated my situation and problem clear enough. If there is any further information I can provide, please kindly let me know. Thanks in advance.",

It's not a huge factor in performance. 2. You can just switch to Redis for everything. I have had good experiences with Redis. You can put it on its own VM if you want or run it on an existing machine - you don't need a huge instance. Obviously, you need a good network connection. 3. You don't need to set or worry about that - it's calculated automatically. It's actually the location of the *root* of your Moodle code. 4. You're overthinking this. Point $CFG->dataroot the the shared directory. You could try setting $CFG->localcachedir to a local directory on each machine.  Forget about the others - you'll be fine. 5. The advantage of Redis is that you can do this. Give them different prefixes. It works fine.",

We have 15 GB of video that we need to make easier to load for our APAC employees (given that the server is located in the US). Rather than having to add a separate server and separate version of Moodle at one of our APAC offices, I was wondering if something like Coral ( http://www.coralcdn.org/ ) would work. If you do use Coral , could you please clarify how it works? Is it like this: You upload your video content to a Coral server Then at your LMS server, in the specific Moodle course you add a URL for each video (e.g., that you want available to the Asia office_, where the URL indicates something like: mywebsite.com.nyud.net/video1.mp4 Or is it much more complicated? We were looking at CloudFlare ; however, their first three payment options (free, $20/mo, and $200/mo) will allow only 100-200 MB uploads, and unfortunately, this won't work for us because many of our mp4s are between 250-300 MB.",

With that said, I am as well sure Coral CDN doesnt offers video content to be delivered, just static. and even its not as easy as you mentioned, you have to setup mod_rewrite configuration for servers and as well plug-ins required for clients accessing it. For Videos however you can check metacdn.com and cachefly.com as they are into Video CDN and as well I must mention that Video CDN is flawed so some of the operators who at some  point offered Video CDN jumped out of that business.

This is the first time we have had such a huge requirement. We could launch Application and Database on the same server or on different servers. We will launch servers on the AWS cloud as EC2 instances. My question is what would be the CPU and RAM parameters that could handle such 4000 concurrent loads that we go for?

Please be clear about the term concurrent, 4000 logged in users are not considered concurrent, for example you clicked to view some resource on moodle, until that request is finised loading from database and moodledata you are considered as concurrent user, so if you're saying there will be 4000 logged in users at one time, then consider 1000 of those to be treated as concurrent. for RAM, its general consideration of 20 users per GB of RAM, so 64GB should suffice, but this RAM amount should be properly coupled with appropriate CPU and Drive technology with software properly optimized.",

I have tried resetting the course, re-importing the course, and deleting the calendar to no avail.  Is there any way to get more detailed logs as to what exactly is being updated in the calendars?  A new assignment created in the course is not affected, but assignments that were brought over in an affected class are. Thanks, Mike",

If you set a due date on an assignment, an event on the calendar was created - including the assignment description, even if \"Always show description\" was set to disabled. MDL-37509 was created and addressed to take care of this; the update was set to use the assign cron, with the following logic: If \"Always show description\" is set to disabled, AND Submissions for the assignment are allowed (\"Allow submissions from\" is a past date/time), AND Submissions for the assignment are being allowed since the last time the assign cron ran, AND The assignment has a due date set (and therefore an associated calendar event) THEN update the calendar event to include the description. Hence, thanks to the fix, the description for the assignment wouldn't show in the calendar until after submissions were open. The problem was that a bug prevented checking the time of the last assign cron run. This meant that the cron was getting a list of all of the assignments with \"Always show description\" set to disabled, since the beginning of time up until now, and updating the events for their due dates. For every update, a log entry was recorded - which is why people saw this, especially in old courses that were imported. I posted a simple fix on MDL-46539 - we deployed that today and it's working correctly. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next moodle.org release. Hope this makes sense for anybody who's still looking for an explanation of what's going on...",

The direct drag n drop upload of the files took too long (a 10 byte file took 10 seconds to upload), we do not encounter any problems if we add the same file with add an activity. 2. When we move around resources in a course, the first move is really quick (100ms), but the following attempts take 3-4-5 seconds (the bigger the course, the longer) Also tried this from different browsers, and it works fine at the Moolde demo site. Our \"old\" 2.5 non-clustered server does this in 500ms, every time. Could you please suggest what we should check, what can cause this behaviour?

Does it mean 150 people logging into Moodle and clicking the SCORM start button all at the same synchronized time? Or does it mean, on average in a 30 minute window, you will have about 150 people taking it, but they aren't starting all at the same time. Once you have that defined, you can create simulations of it with JMeter, or some other tool ( http://gatling.io/docs/current/ seems to be a newer one, but I haven't used it). Also could try something like https://loader.io/ (though it looks to more be aimed at testing thousands of users on a single URL as opposed to hundreds of users going through multiple pages) or look at the other options listed here: https://geteasyqa.com/blog/best-tools-load-testing/",

          "Text": "I've never tried to run Moodle without an internet connection, but I found a thread from 2004 where this was discussed. In summary, moodle needs to be able to write temporary files which is difficult to do on a read-only media such as a CD. However, users were able to successfully run moodle on a USB thumb drive. Below, I have quoted Bob Boufford's instructions from 2004 for setting up a thumb drive with Moodle (prices have gone down on thumb drives since then and Windows 2000 is no longer a concern today): Here's what you need: Minixampp-Windows from http://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-windows-en.html . Moodle for Windows USB key drive - 192mb to 256mb Insert the USB key drive in your Windows system Install minixampp on the key drive Start Apache and mySQL with the minixampp batch files Follow the Moodle-Windows instructions for using phpMyAdmin to create the Moodle database. Install Moodle in <drive:>\\minixampp\\htdocs\\ Modify the config.php file from the instructions using the USB key's drive letter. Run Moodle admin to finish installation. Unlike EasyPHP and regular installations of Apache-Windows, Minixampp (and the full XAMPP) runs totally inside the installation folder and does not require the Windows Registry or Windows Services. The USB key drive is a SanDisk Cuzer Mini USB Flash Drive I picked up for $65CAD but any USB key drive should work if it has space for the approximate 100 mb Minixampp/Moodle install and adequate space for demonstration courses. As mentioned in another message, there is an issue with the hardcoded drive letter in both Minixampp and Moodle when moving between systems. On my office Windows 2000 system where I did the installation, the drive letter was \"H:\" but on my home Windows XP system, the drive letter initially was \"F:\". The best option is to just change the drive letter of the USB key through Windows. Here's the reference to changing the drive letter in XP, http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=307844 . It may actually be best to change the drive letter on the USB key to a higher letter before installation to limit the chance of conflicting with an existing drive with a lower letter such as multiple CD drives or network drives. I just installed everything late this afternoon so it hasn't gone through a full test, but it appears everything is working fine. If the laptop has a registered host. domain name, it might be possible to enter that name in config.php and access Moodle from another system.

If you have more than one Moodle on the same box then the resources available is split between them. Therefore, the number of simultaneous users is \"shared\" between them. For example, if you think your machine can handle 50 simultaneous users and you have 2 moodle sites on the box then that's 25 each. If you run other stuff on the box then that reduces the amount of memory available to Moodle. If you use a different web server it may mean there is more memory available. Etc. etc. etc. One important note. I don't want to get bogged down in this. The number of simultaneous users is intended as a *guide* to the amount of hardware you need. It is not very scientific. It depends on how (well!) your server is configured, what the OS is, what the users are actually doing, what the phase of the moon is etc... At the end of the day, you need to be measuring what is happening on your server...",

Knowing that mdl_log used to cause some issues for other users when it would hit 7-9 million lines I wanted to investigate pruning it, but by setting a log limit.  I set it to 35 days but then I discovered that the earliest entry is September 19 (when we did the upgrade)- only 31 days ago. Is the new log format really logging that much more info (mdl_log has 56,000 entries for 35 days)- and what are the performance implications?",

(Obviously we'll turn standard logging off.) If you're having problems with the new log table, you could also consider switching to legacy logging for the time being? Most likely we won't change to use the new log system until we have selected or implemented a log output plugin that doesn't use the database. There's actually a great opportunity for performance gain compared to 2.6 and previous versions, if you log somewhere that's quick to write to and doesn't limit scalability in the way database writes do, e.g. the local filesystem. I'm not sure if there are any high-performance log plugins available out-of-the-box though. --sam",

I would start with _one_ server. Then carefully monitor the load. Find out the bottleneck(s) under heavy load and take action as neccessary. Note that the addition of a second server also introduces an overhead. (see http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=162597&parent=712528 ). Virtualization too introduces an overhead.",

In some instances the loop is compromised of several resource requests looping over and over again and in other cases it is a single looping request. The loop usually consists of redirects from a request like pluginfile.php/xxxxxx/mod_resource/content then back to the login.php page until the browser is stopped or the user is suspended. I'm curious if other installations have seen this problem and what solutions they have come up with.  I've been looking into mod_evasive as an option, but I've seen comments about the effectiveness in a load-balanced environment. I've also seen various issues related to CAS Looping in the tracker: MDL-21303 MDL-28026 MDL-34533 But nothing about prevention, a fix, or issues related to 2.X. * Note: right now I'm investigating potentially improper use of CAS's gateway feature in the php code and disabled cookies as possibilities.

You are talking about CAS SSO? - Yes, Yale's CAS for Single Sign-on We have been using CAS for logins for about a year now and haven't had any type of looping. - Interesting, we didn't notice it until we saw slowness and dove into the apache logs. - Occasionally we'll see very high usage from a single IP if I run: - cat /path/to/your/httpd/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n - grepping the access log on the IP with the most hits (or in the top 5) will sometimes show a series of requests to the pluginfile url mentioned above.  You have to get lucky in terms of day you pick, since the problem only persists until the user closes his or her browser. I'm currently unable to replicate the problem, so I'm guessing here. - Could you try looking for these loops if you have a live server? - Since posting this issue, we've removed other bottlenecks in our system which have decreased the signficance of this problem. Whats your config like? - A few moodle app servers behind a hardware load-balancer. Note 1: We are running a trimmed down version of the CAS plugin, it has not caused problems in the past. Note 2: I can create very small loop if I disable cookies in my browser, but in this case the browser detects the loop and fails gracefully. Thanks again for the questions.  I'll keep looking.",

I do however see that most of the pluginfile.php GET requests are coming from the theme files. We do not use HTTPs for everything, only logins since CAS requires it. Have you tried just using HTTPs from logins only? We have just started using CAS behind a load balancer and have already started seeing some session issues with a valid session not being found thus making the user login again. Im not sure if its moodle or CAS but we are looking into it, our other applications do not have any session issues. Which version of CAS? Is it the Jasig built release or a custom version from the original Yale CAS? We use 3.4.11 from the Jasig releases.",

Now-a-days you probably setup one vm (virtualized machine) in your own private Ubuntu OPENSTACK cloud. However you'll probably take a small hit on performance because it's not running on bare-metal. On the other hand, with the ease of just adding another node if you need more processing power, might make it easier to expand with less downtime. Just my 2cents. Those are probably a few ways I would attack the problem. There is probably going to be a fair amount of trial and error.",

These students will acess the database  locally during day time whereas at night  i want these 3 databases to synchronize with each other. so that the next day when student uses the moodle it is updated with synchronized database, will  it b possoble to achieve this with your solution? thanks in advance for your valueable advice.",

          "Text": "Hello Luis, for our clustered environments yes, we use memcached server for both sessions and MUC. sessions and MUC are not stored on the same memcached instance to avoid sessions cleanup when MUC is purged. We usually use two memcached instances running on the same server but listening on different ports, however you may want to add some more memcached servers for redundancy. Please note Moodle 2.8 introduced a \"clustered\" setting for memcached and memcache MUC stores, so you can now use memcached instances for MUC running directly on the front ends rather than on external servers. local file system is usually much faster than networked file system, so if your moodledata sits on a networked file system you can get some performance gain using tempdirs and local cachedirs stored in each front end node. More info: https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Server_cluster#.24CFG-.3Etempdir . Please note currently tempdirs stored on each front end are plagued by a bug that may require disabling them, for example when uploading users or restoring courses: MDL-44874 About memcached and memcache PHP extensions, according to the tests we performed on our clustered setups we noticed a slightly better performance using memcached PHP extension, thus for clusters we decided to use memcached PHP  extension for both MUC stores and sessions. However for single server setup running local memcached instances we are also using memcache PHP extension. Your mileage may vary, as usual it is always recommended to make as many tests as you can.",

You can also go the NFS route for moodledata, but the same goes for the MUC as above. If you disregard the MUC settings then your site will be slow. If you are using multimaster in a active/active scenario I would move away from it, use Galera http://galeracluster.com/ . Version 3 of Galera added some really nice features and supports MySQL 5.6 GTID's, this is especially good for a situation like ours, using WAN replication. On a side note, we use GlusterFS+Galera+Memcache/d for cross datacenter DR/Failover. No issues or complaints from our end-users so far. JASON",

I really don't think it will cause any issues but even if you wanted to you could install Moodle into a standard MySQL database then dump it then restore it to the cluster, id for admin would be correct. We have been running the same moodle core database since 1.6 so it has been moved around allot!

With normal assignments\nthe loading times for the view all submissions is few seconds, with group assignments this pumps up to 20 to seconds. We\nlooked into this and it seems that the view uses a query that takes 682ms to plan and 0.351ms to execute in PostgreSql , but it\nruns the query 30 times to create the view -> 30 X 0.6seconds = 18seconds. This seems little excessive. We do realize that part of the problem is the amount of groups & group members in our system (we generate them automatically for all\ncourses that have groupings in SMS) : avle=# select count(*) from mdl_groups;\ncount\n-------\n30662\n(1 row) avle=# select count(*) from mdl_groups_members;\ncount\n--------\n302825\n(1 row) but this behavior is making the view all - view unusable. I am attaching the Explain Analyze Query into this message. Our environment is load-balanced 6 nodes ( VM ) with hardware DB (Postgre Sql 9.4), yes it's a large installation... Any ideas how to proceed?",

I'd be hesitant to do what you've suggested (a PHP-based solution built with \"little coding knowledge\"), particularly if it is going to be storing config data and remotely hooking into the backend of your sites and using shell tools. A number of people on this forum use their SCM tools ( Git et al.) with deployment scripts to achieve something similar. I personally do this - with Git taking the feed from Catalyst then merging it with some select bits of Contrib code and some local tweaks common to all my installations, then I merge it with any local customisations. Once you get familiar with it, a tool like Git can do most of this. I'd be interested to hear where you end up with this. I've recently been toying with the idea of rolling my own Debian/Ubuntu packages (in conjunction with the Git repo) to deploy my code. Hope this helps you on the path... MC",

Crucially the Moodles we host are all based on the same shared codebase (with the samethird-party modules either in for everyone or not). This is the only viable way we can manage upgrades for so many sites with a small team. So we do have custom site management tools (basically php frontend scripts which drive a database backend which drives the perl scripts on the servers to do the real work), but I doubt it'd be useful outside of our specific environment (and I'm afraid I doubt we'll ever release them). The basic stuff which makes it tick is use of apache's mod_vhost_alias & then just individual management of each vhosts config.php. Initially we used unionfs as a way of allowing customisations on top of the shared codebase, it was quite a neat solution, but back then we encountered some bugs which caused kernel panics (so I was quickly put off that ;)).",

          "Text": "Hello anyone, if anyone can help with this.  We launch our school in July 2005.  Since then, we had over 300 people who registered and signed up for classes.  But, a lot of then were erased because of the 30 days setting of inactivity.  So right now, we have over 250 students in our school now. We have a dedicated server on http://www.ymp.net/ , in fact, the name of the nameserver is NS1.YMP.NET.  Most of the sites are using either Mambo, XOOPS, or OSCommerce, then some of them are simply plain HTML.  I need someones help with Moodle.  All of the sites that uses HTML, NO PROBLEMS what so ever.  All sites not running Moodle, using MySQL and PHP, running a little slow, but tolerable. Two sites on the server, http://www.wise-path.org/ (XOOPS) and http://www.dragonsdvd.com/ (Mambo) are the heaviest loads on the server with over 1GB transfers per month. http://www.wise-learning.org/ is theeeee heaviest load on the server at 1.5GB per month.  For some reason, wise-learning.org is running very slow. Our server stats: CPU GenuineIntel, Intel(R) Celeron(TM) CPU 1400MHz 1003.62 MB RAM (1GB) / 60GB Hard Disk Version psa v7.5.4_build75050824.12 os_FedoraCore 2 OS Linux 2.6.10-1.771_FC2 Key number PLSK.********.**** CPU usage Last 1 minute 2.80 Last 5 minutes 2.20 Last 15 minutes 2.28 Memory Usage Total Used Free Shared Buffer Cached Usage 1003.62 MB 560.99 MB 442.63 MB 0 B 40.15 MB 172.15 MB 55.9% Used / 44.1% available Since our site is running so slowing, we have tried everything from increasing the RAM from 512MB to 1GB, we tried selecting the amount of session login time to 30 minutes, and 30 days for inactivity.  Still the site is running slower.  Our server host says that there is a lot of non-activity requests to our My SQL server on the site, specifically to this site.  Can someone who is server knowlegdable can help me with this issue? Here is one thing though.  Since we switch the dbsession (where instead of using flatfiles to store sessions, it uses the database), our site has been going a lot faster.  But we just tried it tonight.  We are going to try this setting for a few days to see how it performs.  But, if someone can tell us who is experienced if this was the problem and that using the dbsessions=enable is the best way, then we will keep it. We are considering upgrading our server from 1.4GB Celeron to 2.4GB Pentium 4 with 120GB of hard disk.  Our host is asking us to do this and I am seriously considering it.  Do you guys think it is the server that is being overloaded (keeping in mind that the other HTML, PHP/MySQL and PHP only sites has no problems with so ever) or do you think it is something else. We do think though that maybe there is a setting in the school somewhere, like a purge old data function that can clean the database of old files after \"say\" three months or so.  Please any advice will be appreciated.

Secondly, about my name:  Allah is the last name of my father who converted to Muslim before I was born.  The family name before that was Edward-Lowry.  For many years, even when I toured in Iraq with the Army at Baghdad International Airport in 2003-2004, I was critized about my last name.  I am sorry you have a problem with it.  With the nametag ALLAH on my right chest of my Army uniform, it has not been easy.  Even a Muslim chaplain confronted me about my last name.  I had to set him straight saying that if he had a problem, to call my father and ask him why he changed his name.  I was named that and it is on my birth certificate.  I do have one year and a half to go on my enlistment.  Afterwards, I will change my name back to the family name, Edward, because I am sick and tired of having this name.  I just wish everyone understood that I had nothing to do with calling myself \"GOD\". Last but not least, I did not come on here to get critique about my site, I did not come on here to get slammed for my name.  I came on this site to get ligitamate answers about how to make my wife's school run better.  You sir/ma'am had no right to come on this forum and blast me on my name and web site like that.  If you had a problem, you could have E-mailed me anytime and asked me about my name and told me about the certificate problem.  I am not a spammer , I am legit and have been doing web design since 1995 (the day the Internet went public, released by D.O.D.) UPDATE about my wife's Moodle site:  Under configuration, variables, we switched dbsessions from disabled to enabled and it works fine.  No problems what so ever on the server.  That was the problem all along.  I still, though, will appreciate any comments about my wife's site http://www.wise-learning.org/ to help it run faster and better based on my specifications of the server I posted above.  Thank you.",

From time to time there's a glitch like \"Can't write to DB - maybe your disk is full\" (sounds familiar?), but generally the server holds, which is sort surprising - but... it does. However, we expect the number of courses to grow next school year from 30 to 80, and the number of active users will increase from 300 to over a thousand. Consequently, I am trying to realistically determine our hardware requirements. Unlike this year, we will get a budget to pay for the hosting we need - provided I explain what we need and why. Your collective wisdom is requested. Please share: - is there a way to determine the number of CONCURRENT users accessing the site, by looking at the logs? E.g., download a one-day log as an excel file and try to play with it (how?!) I realize there are 3rd party SW applications that allow for real-time benchmarking - but would like to avoid the hassle for the time being. - any anecdotal evidence of adequate/insufficient HW power for similar projects - like \"we had a thousand users and the server crashed every hour...\" or \"in our school Moodle is hosted on a X type of server and all runs well\" - anyone? - any empirical data that allows to build a prediction of CONCURRENT users based on the TOTAL NUMBER of users in the system? Like, \"you can expect XX% of users to be online in peak load time.\" I realize it's a long shot. Thanx in advance - Lev",

For example, at the OU we have seen the number of different users logging in each day increase only very slowly, while the number of page views has gone up a lot. In other words concurrent users is going up faster than total users. Basically, as our teacher get more familiar with Moodle, they create more engaging activities there, and so students spend more of their time on the site. The best thing to do is to find ways to monitor the current load on your server. Basically, if your Moodle is successful, the load will constantly increase, and you need an easy way to see how the current load compares to 100% load on the server, so you can plan an upgrade before current load gets to 100%. Also, whatever your current hardware, you need to be in a position where, at least in principle, there is some way to upgrade to more hardware. As for the \"what hardware do I need now (or next year)?\" question. I am going to duck that. If you can afford about double what you have now, that might be the right sort of ball-park. (Based on your estimated increase in users.) Total number of rows written to the log table per unit time is a reasonable measure for concurrent users.",

If those settings can be configured on the MySql that comes on the openSUSE CD, then where can these settings be configured? I currently run many MySql databases, but they all run on a Windows server, so I was able to tune the settings for these using the configuratin wizard during the database installation, but I have not seen this on MySql in Linux.

Definitely you can install, uninstall, reconfigure MySQL an any time! Since you are familier with databases, I don't have to tell the obvious: During a reinstallation you have to think about data migration! Provided that SuSE packages are relatively new. Moodle 1-7+ for example need MySQL > 4.1.16 (haven't checked). > If those settings can be configured on the MySql that comes on the openSUSE CD, then where can these settings be configured? That is a SuSE-specific question. I'll do a search for my.cnf in the system. (Hope somebody else can give a more helpfull answer ;-()",

I will be running it in \"run level 3\", but with the option to \"startx\" if I need it for anything that I dont know how to do in console.  I am also considering using Webmin for an extra admin tool for certain tasks. So far, the default software in openSUSE has given me very nicely running Moodle systems, and with the GUI not loaded, the OS is using very little RAM.  <150 MB using the \"free\" command after initial bootup. I am currently starting an \"open source users group\" in my area and I plan to promote Moodle use in my area, but my install will be providing most of the teacher class pages for more than 12 high schools and about 15 middle schools.  I am starting out with one server, but when the demand goes up, I will have plans to add more servers in the future when needed. My server will be a Dell PowerEdge 2950 with 2 - Dual core Zeon's, 4 GB RAM, and 6 - 146 GB SCSI drives in a RAID 5 array.  This should be enough server for at least the first year or two while people start to learn how to use it. Thanks for all of your advice, you have been a great help while learning how to setup a large production server.",

I would focus on saving disk IO as it's most limited resource you have. Also good network card would help. Cheap ones flood system with interrupts limiting throughput. So, first of all, cache as much as you can, and second, use as much RAM as you can, to store most frequently used content. Use php with opcode cache (APC, xcache) and fast-cgi with lighttpd or niginx rather than apache.",

          "Text": "We have a large Moodle installation with eight app servers.  We are now getting our Moodle 2.6 instance ready to handle Fall semester loads.  Does anybody have any positive or negative experiences using MongoDB for the MUC application cache that they can share? I expect other large installation are facing a similar situation to this:  We learned with 2.4 that an NFS file store is not usable as an application cache.  Consequently, we moved to memcache.  The problem with memcache now is that many parts of Moodle 2.6 are using the MUC application cache.  I just counted 17.  If any one of those 17 decides to purge its cache that purge causes the entire memcached instance to purge.  This is resulting in a purge frequency that will likely be very bad for performance in the Fall.  (This memcache purge problem is the subject of MDL-45375 , but think that ticket understates the impact.) Continuing to rely on memcache for the application cache would involve setting up separate memcached instances (that is, separate server-ports) for every one of those 17 application caches.  Conceivably, we could analyze them all and determine which could coexist because they are never purged on their own, but that would require a significant analysis effort for an unknown payback. To avoid this problem, we are now going down the MongoDB path for the application cache and would appreciate learning about any pitfalls or suggestions from others who have gone down this path.",

Our setup HAProxy load balancer -> Four moodle web servers -> One SQL server This setup with Moodle 1.9.9+ seems to be working fine. The problem is that every night around midnight (sometimes 1am, sometimes 12:30am, sometimes 1:30am, etc) the Moodle servers (all four of them) will start to spawn httpd workers. All servers are running Apache 2.2.3 under CentOS 5.5. What is odd is that due to this we started logging all kinds of info to see what the problem is. We are logging connections on the HAProxy, on the moodle servers, etc. At the time the spike happens (which lasts typically 10-15mins) there are no connections being made to the HAProxy (e.g. it goes up during the day, down in the afternoon, up again in the evening, starts to fall about 11pm-4am then goes back up), but there are no excessive connections. For example, haproxy is showing a few, but the moodle servers are spawning hundreds of httpd workers (to the limit set in httpd.conf).",

We are happy with our moodle setup for several years but now have the opportunity to revisit and redesign the platform to be more \"enterprise-like\".  We would be looking at things like load balancing, failover (if one application or database server fails, the other node, will become the master, etc.). We don't need clustering as we're not that big. We will have the application server on a vm machine and another for the db server. We will be on VMWare platform. Using RedHat 7 Enterprise, the PHP that comes with it and now a paid subscription to use MySQL Enterprise. It will probably be a software based load balancer. Without much experience in this field, this is an exciting opportunity to build something new. Any recommendations as to how this platform should be built? Can you share your set up with us?",

          "Text": "What is your current setup? I looked at doing this a while back and if you are moving from a single machine with moodle and files and database on it, there are some performance penalties in going to a load balancing setup because the files now have to be stored on the network as opposed to directly with the machine and you incur network access time penalties in database access also. There's a lot of additional complexity that you take on, so make sure your IT team is ready for it and the ongoing maintenance that would be required. We ended up going with the below setup also using VMWare and CentOS 7 with MariaDB , so essentially the same just non-paid versions of DB and OS: Moodle on a dedicated web vm - 10 vCPU - 32 GB ram, 200 GB Disk thin provisioned (backing storage on the ESXi hosts is a raid 5 of SSDs) - this hardware configuration is a bit overkill for our purposes but since we have been scaling up fast it's been a boon for us. Moodledata is directly on a partition in this VM , so it's locally accessed. MariaDB Master server on another vm - 10 vCPU - 64 GB ram - 200 GB disk thin provisioned also. We configured buffer pool size to be 16 GB so that it can hold our entire DB in memory. This server also holds SQL databases for a number of other applications (Wordpress and other misc.) Replication is configured on the master server to replicate to a second replication MariaDB server located on another ESXi Host. Moodledata is backed up daily to tape and another machine via http://rsnapshot.org/ . If something goes wrong with the master database, we manually edit the moodle configuration file and point it to the replication database. If something goes wrong with the web server, we have a documented procedure on how to rebuild it and copy in the data (in my experience, this can be done in under 2-3 hours). My biggest recommendation would be to really look carefully at what solution you will use for sharing moodledata between your load balanced web servers and test it's speed. If it's not fast enough, you'll want to do a lot of caching to minimize the need to go to file storage access.",

During that period I executed \"top\" and I found that MySQL was taking around 29.3% of CPU. I confirmed that there are no other users using the site by checking the live logs. Once the page finished loading, the CPU usage drops down to 0.3%. Is this because all 5 question categories are linked to a quiz that fetches 6 questions randomly from each question category? Last time when 2 users were editing the questions at the same time the CPU resource for My SQL was around 60%. Is this normal usage? or do I have to update anything on the server side to get a smooth performance?",

A default install of APC allocates only 32 MB of RAM for the cache. By trial and error, I have learned that starting from an empty cache, that just loading the front page of my Moodle 2.3.2+ will cache about 1100 files and use about 68.5 MB of memory. In other words, the default install really doesn't help as it is instantly filled up with only part of the files needed for the first page load. The time to live setting keeps them there too. On my server, listing performance at the bottom of a Moodle page shows NO SIGNIFICANT difference in time with cache turned off and with it on when set to the default 32 MB cache size because not enough of the needed files make it into the cache. When I allocate enough memory to keep from instantly filling it, the first load will not show any improvement either, but once the files are cached, each succeeding page load sees about a 33% improvement of the time listed as nearly every file is now coming from the cache. My students usually see much faster times than I do as the admin. They typically see .1 to .4 seconds for almost any page while I usually get .4 to .8 seconds. Compared to the 2.o to 8.0 seconds I was getting in June, I am now very happy with my current server setup. I am still trying to figure out how large I need to ultimately make my cache. I have just recently decided 256 MB is too small for my Moodle 2.3.2+ install. Next week, I am going to try upping it to 512 MB and see how that works.

But I am going to reinstall the Fedora operating system on it again from the very begging and to prepare it as a moodle server. it has 3.2 ghz intel xeon processor, two 169 gb hard disks, two c4 sata raid. 1)Now we are highly concern about the security issue. So when partitioning the hard. Should I have to partition giving /var in to different partition? (What is the benifit of this shall I able to introduce security to that partition too)?? 2)I previouly installed moodle on /usr/moodle1, /usr/moodle2, and /usr/moodle3 (in /etc/httpd.conf file alias to these moodle sites)as in moodle red hat installation guide and I would like to follow the same procedure here again. Now if /var in different partition give security sense in this cenario.  Should I have to  place /usr in a different partition then? 3)I prefer to use se linux security system later. Will this make conflict when I partition like. /usr in a different partition(where moodle resides).? Can anybody help me on how to partition a web server(concerning moodle) to acheive security while having resonable performance??",

It is very possible that you have a large image and have the image display configured to resize the image each time it is displayed. This takes a lot of browser processing time - even if the image is cached.  So, it may not be a cache problem; it is likely an on-the-fly resizing problem. My advice to anyone using images for display in a browser is: before uploading the image a) Use a program like Photoshop to resize the image to the size you want in the browser. b) Compress the image (jpg) to a value that still gives a sharp display (usually 65-75%) Give that a try and see if it solves your problem.",

          "Text": "Hello, i just setup a moodle cluster and it is working, but i need some advice for best practice. The setup is as follows: 2 Kemp Loadmaster, which loadbalance to 3 mariadb galera cluster and 3 moodle webserver. The moodledata-directory is mounted as glusterfs with 3 bricks. There is also a redis server with 3 nodes and sentinel in work with the kemps for failover. 1. Now there is an issue with mounting the glusterfs mounts for moodledata. The storage for glusterfs is mounted on another drive (as adviced). In fstab there are the following mounts /dev/sdb1 /storage  ext4     defaults  0 0 localhost:/rep-volume /var/moodledata glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0 The bricks are at /storage/brick. It seems that glusterfs is being mounted before the storage is mounted and it fails on reboot. I need to type mount -a. How can this be resolved so that it is mounted everytime on reboot? 2. The moodle docs describe: \" $CFG-> dirroot It is strongly recommended that $CFG->dirroot (which is automatically set via realpath(config.php)) contains the same path on all nodes. It does not need to point to the same shared directory though. The reason is that some some low level code may use the dirroot value for cache invalidation. The simplest solution is to have the same directory structure on each cluster node and synchronise these during each upgrade. The dirroot should be always read only for apache process because otherwise built in plugin installation and uninstallation would get the nodes out of sync.\" What exactly does it mean? What do i need to do? For readonly do i need to do chmod -r 744? Then i can't install plugins? For installation i need to make it writable again and sync the directories and make it again readonly? Is there any better way? 3. Is there anything else i can do for best practice? My config.php <?php  // Moodle configuration file unset($CFG); global $CFG; $CFG = new stdClass(); $CFG->dbtype    = 'mariadb'; $CFG->dblibrary = 'native'; $CFG->dbhost    = 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'; $CFG->dbname    = 'xx'; $CFG->dbuser    = 'xx'; $CFG->dbpass    = 'xx'; $CFG->prefix    = 'mdl_'; $CFG->dboptions = array ( 'dbpersist' => 0, 'dbport' => '', 'dbsocket' => '', 'dbcollation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci', ); $CFG->tempdir   = '/var/moodletemp'; $CFG-> wwwroot = 'https://xxx'; $CFG-> dataroot = '/var/moodledata'; $CFG->admin     = 'admin'; $CFG->localcachedir = '/var/moodlecache'; $CFG->directorypermissions = 0777; require_once(__DIR__ .

          "Text": "Hello, I have a client with an existing single server (AWS EC2 m5xlarge) setup where the client has addressed growth by just increasing the EC2 instance size.  Yet there are still occasions where the server slows down.  Reviewing their setup and logs, I have found the following: Database has close to 60,000 users.  Most of those no longer access the system, but they still need to retain them for reporting purposes for an extended period of time.  Cleanup of this is being discussed There are a number of schedule reports that are run and some manually which do impact the performance of the server for users.  Some reports are taking several minutes to run. When the nightly backup runs that creates a backup of the current database and the moodledata folder, there is also a significant slow down though not as impactful to users. Basic review of usage show that in a 1 hour timeframe, there is a range of 100-200 users active. 95% of courses are SCORM either locally installed or connected with an LTI connector. Moodle 3.9, php 7.2, My sql 5.7 (PHP will be upgrade to 7.4 and MySQL 8 very soon, Moodle is being discussed) Monitoring of the CPU usage shows that during the scheduled reports and the manual reports, the CPU is hitting 90-100% for several minutes, sometimes as long as 15 minutes. The cache hits seem to be fine for PHP files.  I have not yet looked at any database caching. To address the high usage by the reporting, is the following configuration possible and could it help minimize impacts on the \"students\" that currently occur? Separate DB server \"Student\" facing web server with local moodledata folder \"Admin\" facing web server with it's own moodledata folder If the Admin server is running scheduled tasks and is only accessed by admin staff for reporting, does the moodledata folder need to be in sync with the \"Student\" version?",

It will be upgraded to version 22 and at the same time PHP 7.4 and MySQL 8. 4. The client has a custom plugin that is currently creating the backups and placing in S3 (Block storage). The entire server drive is also backed each night using the AWS Snapshot. Backup policy is also on the agenda to be reviewed. 5. The Moodledata folder is 220GB in size, about 90% of that is in the filedir. 6. The code is in a git repository, currently is also being backed up 7. The database is 8.3 GB in size and yes it is MySQL and is being backed up via mysqldump from their custom backup plugin. I have not done any benchmarking or used any database tuning tools yet or checked the health of the DB. For testing purposes I have created a clone of their existing server and do have SSH access to install MySQLTuner. I will add that to my list for this week. I am currently just in the fact finding phase and starting to explore potential solutions. Because their reporting, both manual and scheduled, seems to be the main source of slow response for the students, I am wondering if a potential solution is setting up a multi-server system, might work and control costs better. So a separate MySQL server (AWS terms: RDS or Aurora). One web server that is only accessed by students to access their courses and progress. One web server that is only accessed by admins to run reports and possibly handle the task scheduler. Normally you see 2 web servers using a load balancer to manage load on the web server. This requires a shared or synced Moodledata folder, session cache, and I believe some other items. In this case, a user would always be directed to the same server based on their role. The exact way this will be handled I still need to work out. Before I spend a lot of time exploring this, I wanted to see if this is even possible without a shared Moodledata folder. It seems plausible, since the reports are pulling from the database and not the moodledata folder. It looks like the scheduled tasks, or at least the majority, also only interact with the database. Of course, benchmarking will need to be done to determine if there is any improvement and what the cost impact will be. Ron",

Depending on how you are running your reporting it should also be possible to run it against this db instance.

I would not be running your MySQLDumps to the moodledata directory, thats is always going to compound the performance issue and can be a security issues, esp if server file respositary is enable or your web server is misconfigured. Use a separate, secure volume For reference it is also possible to move the object storage to S3 which then makes sharing the storage between moodle instances much easier. there is a plugin written by Catalyst you might be interested in looking at. https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_objectfs",

          "Text": "Hi First of all, no qualifications directly related to AWS, never been to the Amazonas nor speak their language. I'm just guessing from first principles. Q1 about adding a separate server for the database. Generally, throwing resources show any improvement only if the piece it supports has been the weak point, the bottleneck, of the chain. From what you describe, the database is probably the current bottleneck. So it will help, provided that the new database is faster! Q2 and 3, adding a web server, is a more involved. You are not replacing the old web server, instead add it to the old in tandem. With that you enter web clusters, which come with quite an overhead, for example you need a load balancer. Moodle imposes more restrictions around its moodledata/. Some directories _have_ to be shared. See details under https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Server_clustering_improvements_proposal . Not only clusters have a steep learning curve, there is a considerable overhead too. So, don't be disappointed if the duo does only 150% of a single. Except fro that a cluster does what you want, separate the back end from the front end. Aren't there cheaper solutions? How dynamic need those back end be? Are 24 h too long? If not, the back end processes may run during the night and only presents the results during the day.",

          "Text": "While that is a very natural conclusion to reach, in fact it is more complex than that. The reason for having separate admin servers is to do with how web servers like Apache work, with a fixed number of worker threads that are avaiable for process requests. Most requests, hopefully, come in and get processesd in a fraciton of a second, so you want your Apache setup optimised to churn through those. When you get a long-running request like a slow report, even though the webserver is waiting for the DB and not consuming CPU, this request is tying up a slot for a long period of time, and that is bad. It only takes a few long-running requests to gum up the server, and block the flow of normal requests. Having a separate 'admin' server to handle known slow requests is one way to avoid this. However, to do this effectively, you must first have got Moodle running in a clustered setup with multiple web servers. Then, the other thing you need is an easy way to filter out slow requests from the normal ones, so your load-balancer can send the right traffic to the right servers. In the past, when the Open University ran our own servers, we did have separate 'normal' and 'admin' servers, and we could do that based on IP address of the user, becuase we are a distance learning university, and so all our students have off-campus IPs, and staff who did slow operations were all on our campus network. But then, Covid happened breaking that assumption about where different users were based (IP-address-wise) and also we moved our setup to AWS, so we don't do this any more. The other thing to try to do is to move really slow operations away from the web UI, and use scheduled or ad-hoc tasks instead (like was done for Moodle backups).",

Yes there are several long running operations, both in scheduled tasks and admin running reports. with both the web server and the db server on the same machine, I am seeing long spikes in processer usages above 95% for several minutes. So instead of just bumping up the AWS server size I have been exploring various other ways to address the problem. It is the reports that are taxing the server. I asked for a two day period of no reports and though memory and cpu utilization is high, the server is still responsive. When testing just the reports being run on a cloned test server configured the same, the server is less responsive. So moving the reports to scheduled tasks makes a lot of sense. I just need to get buy-in from those users doing the reporting and getting them to change from adhoc reporting to a scheduled approach. Has anyone looked at dynamically changing the innodb buffer size for individual reports to see how it impacts the server? Does Moodle support that?",

Of course, that is a lot of AWS stuff to wrap your head around (All in the scope of the 3-day 'Architecting with AWS' training course, but I am not sure I would recommend paying for that - we got some free places on it.) Certainly with a cluster in AWS, it is worth looking at their hosted Aurora Database and Redis hosting for the Moodle database and cache, rather than maintaining your own storage. However, I can see why you might want a quick fix for now - I am just afraid I can't suggest one.",

This will mean it will effectively halt everything for a short period during that operation. it will generally only be short but not ideal. Unless you are super memory constrained on your database its better to have it set to an appropriate size in the first place. This is also another advantage of using a read replica database as this can be configured differently. @Tim, web workers are very rarely an issue in this type of case. database pool connections frequently are. Data base connection pool sizes tend to be in the 100s of connections (Mysql default connection_pool size is 100), Web servers on the other hand tend to be in the 1000s. /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf default max connections per child process is 4000 and defaulot max_clients is 256 from memory. Contention is almost always at the database layer, not the web server, its only through use of decent caching that you can scale web servers faster than database servers.",

When tuning a Moodle site, it is important to get everything consistent: e.g. Apache max_clients needs to be right given the memory use of one Moodle request and the RAM available on your server - the default is probably not best; and DB max_connections probably needs to be number of web servers x max_clients per server. And so on. However, it was the case that for many years, the Open University ran our server with admin traffic separated from student traffic, because that made a significant difference for us. It seemed worth sharing that in the context of this thread. (At the point this made a difference we had 11 web servers, and ~60,000 users logging in each day, making 2 million+ page-views.)",

I have found that running separate web and db servers allows fine tuning the server for a specific purpose and you can get much better performance with lower cost servers than having one big one.  This may be the answer for this Moodle installation as well, but wanted to see what other options there may be that others have done. @Tim, as I plan for the future need of moving into using multiple web servers, are there any pointers on AWS configuration for the EC2's and disk I/O with ESF?",

A few other tips: If your Moodle site has a lot of files, then Catalyst's objectfs plugin , which lets most of the uploaded files be stored in S3, rather than EFS, will probably save you money. However, we setup our site without that first, and got everything working, and then added objectfs later. With Aurora Redis, it turns out that the resoruce constraints are tricky and not clearnly documented. In particular, network traffic is quoted as a 'burst' bandwidth. What this means if that you can only just that much bandwith for a small amout of time. If you exceed that, you get throttled! SO, if with high traffic, your site works for about 20 minutes, then grinds to a halt, this might be the cause (and you need to bigger Redis instance). Anyway, as you say, just separating the web server and the DB is a good first step in moving away from everything-on-one-server. And Aurora DB-as-a-service is probably a good way to go down that route.",

Forums FAQs etc wont be used (at least not for 12 months) We expect concurrent usage to be low I would think around 20. The students will have to complete 4-5 of the lessons, and will select the appropriate ones. Each lesson will take 2-5 mins and the quiz will be 10 multiple choice questions. Ive been advised to take hosting from as cheap as £5 per month to £500 per month, and the moodle partners costings Ive contacted are all light years different.

Based on what we were able to find in the forums and from our own testing you will probably need more RAM on the computer, assuming MySQL and Apache are on the same box. After all our evaluation, we decided to go to a Moodle hosting partner. The reason, we are an Instructional Design company, not a technology company. We decided to focus on our core strengths and let someone else worry about: Proper sizing of the servers Proper bandwidth Nightly backups Security updates for the OS, Web Server, My SQL server, and Moodle Software upgrades Hardware failures Internet Connection availability You can go to just about any reputable hosting company and get all of the above except for the Moodle support. When evaluating pricing of a generic host versus a Moodle Partner, the Moodle Partner we decided to use in the U.S. was just slightly more but had the added benefit of specializing in Moodle. One of the best ways to evaluate them is by talking to them and ask how they handle the above items, if they are part of the price or extra. Ask for their SLA so that you can determine how quickly they are saying they will respond to problems. Once you narrow down your choices ask for references and if they can set you up with an evaluation site. I have suggested, and still feel it would be beneficial to all, a rating system for Moodle Partners. The really good ones would welcome this, but the ones that are questionable, would obviously not want this.",

No Moodle partner is allowed to deal with a client who is not from his country. Even if a client is highly interested in his services he will have to divert back his client to other Moodle Partner of the client's country. Only if he gets permission from the Moodle Partner of client's country he can accept the deal. Economy calls it Monopoly which has lot of disadvantages for end user. I called it Monopoly because for e.g. if we compete two Moodle Partners, a partner X and a partner Y and they are from different countries then a school or anyone cannot choose them on the basis of price, support, expertise or ratings but they are forced to either choose a Moodle Partner from their own country or just move to other abc host who is not a Moodle expert. Out of 27 countries only 5 have 2 partners and 2 have more than 2 partners. All others have only 1 partner. Moodle Partners actually are not competing with each other. The question I ask to myself is why to create this Monopoly and why not to let a school or an individual himself decide which Moodle Partner is better for his requirements. If this happens I am sure overall quality of services will increase and price will drop for services offered by Moodle Partners.",

If there is no Moodle partner within the region, or the regional Moodle partner either does not provide the service needed or is not responsive, another Moodle partner is free to contract with the inquiring person or organization. In all cases an organization or individual in any part of the world can select any Moodle partner they wish (you are the customer). It is important to keep in mind time zones and regional language and custom differences when selecting a Moodle partner. The growing Moodle partner network of companies now includes most areas in the world. If your experience with a Moodle partner was less than satisfactory I suggest you contact Moodle HQ and report this.

We decided to focus on our core strengths\" I think I will end up migrating to a moodle partner, for exactly those reasons. The people I spoke to were undoubtedly very professional. But there advise conflicted and there prices were over £1000 different. I went with a VPS as it is scalable, and I can increase the ram. I'm experienced at implementing Moodle and setting up VPS servers, but never the two combined. I'm guessing I will soon get up to speed. I see I have inadvertently opened a big can of worms about the moodle partners. I would like to say that the partners I spoke to offered a quality product along with some great advice and I have no issue with using them. Infact the reason I didn't commit initially was my chosen Moodle partner wanted money upfront for the year, rather than a monthly/quarterly payment, for a job I have not yet recived payment for. Also the scalability of the service I now have would seem to be a bonus, due to the slow increase of usage. Thanks for all your comments Jon",

I have this on a home brewed OpenFiler iSCSI and for the longest time, this configuration worked without major flaws. Over the Summer we upgraded our Moodle from 1.9 to 2.1 and now we have an issue with Apache and the memory usage. It seems like when we get a group of students on the server, it will spawn many apache2 instances, the memory usage goes up and then they don't seem to die off and release the memory. I have tried editing the apache2 config to try to tweak it to what I found on the moodle.org site, but nothing seems to be helping. It's odd that it didn't do this with the 1.9 version of Moodle with virtually the same setup. Matt",

Appears SiteGround is trying to keep up with other hosting providers in the area of Virtual Private Systems ... ie, dedicated servers to one customer ... they are famous, for their $4.95 a month plans ... or they were at one point in time many years ago. According to this: https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm The GrowBig is $5.95 a month .... hmmmmm ... devil might be in the details ... which many times isn't shown on public web pages. \" If you need more resources and premium features in addition to the\nessential features then we recommend the GrowBig Plan. This plan is\ndesigned to accommodate either a single more heavily-trafficked website\nor multiple average-size websites. \" Can't translate that for ya ... think you're gonna have to contact SiteGround folks and pose the very same question to them ... just to see what they say. See their 'GoGeek' plan?   That's more expensive and here's what they say about  it ... \" If you have a really heavily-visited or resource-intensive website then\nthe GoGeek plan is your best option. The GoGeek customers are hosted on\ninstances, where fewer users share the server resources. \" Uhhh ... hosted on instances where  fewer users share the server resources is key there. Typical VPS's are dedicated machines .... with options for memory/space/throughput, etc. ... *not shared*. Does SiteGround of any tool for you, the customer, to get an idea of how your instance is performing? In there 'Uptime' tool there is a graph they brag upon that shows 'response time' .... but, as you've said, you've never had all 40 participants on your site at one time.    Hey, here's an idea ... do something with the moodle where you are inviting 1/2 of your participants to do something .... something memory intensive? or process intensive?   Then check the 'response time' chart.   Hmmmm how about a little session with BBB?  The  heavy processing would be done on the BBB box/service but you are using via Moodle. Might check into BBB itself ..... beginning here: http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#what-are-the-minimum-bandwidth-requirements-for-a-user One thing you cannot control is students connections to your site - and thus BBB. Wait a day or two then do something on your moodle and invite 3/4's of your users to participate ... then check the 'response time' chart. Now if you had access to command line one could run top ... if you had access to that ... and see realtime how things were looking.    May not have command line access or if you do, may not have access to CLI tools like 'top'. :\\ So bottom line .... for me, I'd say 'maybe'. Anyone else in these forums host with SiteGround? 'spirit of sharing', Ken",

Moodle pages take between 1 minute and 5 minutes to load.  To open moodle/index.php takes well over one minute to open.  I hope someone can provide insight to improving this performance. My configuration is: Intel Core2 T7200 2.00ghz 2gb RAM Microsoft Vista Business edition Processor performance readings: 1gb RAM utilization with CPU utilization never more than 56% Installation information: I first tried to install Apache , MySql and PHP using the windows installation documentation found on the Moodle website. While I was able to install each of the components successfully and could test each separately, I was never able to get My Sql data to appear on my php page with IE7.  So I uninstalled all of the applications and used the XAMPP 1.6.3a installation found at http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#521 The installation went onto my laptop with no issues. I copied the Moodle folder from the Moodle Windows installation into the root of my Apache web directory. I opened http://localhost/moodle and went through the installation steps with no errors (This took approximately 2 hours to complete. After successfully completing the install, I have been able to open http://localhost/moodle and login as administrator.  The process takes between 2 and 5 minutes to complete.  I was finally able to add a new course and users after about an hour or more waiting for the pages to open. I do not experience these delays when accessing moodle pages across the Internet.  I hope that someone can help with the slow loading issues as I would like to learn more about developing moodle courses and demonstrating the capabilities at department meetings where I do not have Internet access.

Several instructors have complained that when uploading mp4 files (average size 25MB-40MB but never over 1GB) the upload is locking up or taking hours when it should be less than 10 minutes. We verified that the upload speed is 1mbps or above. These instructors have tried from various locations, using both ethernet and wifi at different times. Typically a wired connection is used. We have been unable to recreate. Since the instructors are rapidly uploading several videos in succession to provide feedback, there is a chance they're being throttled or flagged for \"misuse\" - We are looking into this. I wanted to reach out to this community to see if anyone else has seen this issue or knows of a way to fix it. It can be very frustrating to our instructors.

A little further explanation: Not every upload the instructor is making takes so long or times out. Usually it happens during a session where the instructor needs to upload multiple files at once, and normally after one or two uploads have completed quickly--as expected. We have exhausted every basic troubleshooting route and can see the PHP requests being made from our server and then simply not completing. Starting the upload back over again usually resolves the problem, but for large classes this can be a time consuming process for the instructors. Is it possible that it is just an issue with Moodle's file handling process? Is there anything we can change in our environment to hopefully improve the issues we are encountering? Thank you, Colin",

The session data is not written to the database, it's only written to the memcache/d server itself. The performance gain is seen because the session data is not written every page view for every user, and thus the table rows are not continually being locked and unlocked. But, to check, this is how we do it. Add the following to config.php: \n```text\n$CFG->dbsessions = false;\n\n\n$CFG->session_handler_class = '\\core\\session\\memcache';\n$CFG->session_memcache_save_path = '192.168.1.2:11211, 192.168.1.3:11211';\n$CFG->session_memcache_prefix = 'mdl.sess.key';\n$CFG->session_memcache_acquire_lock_timeout = 120;\n$CFG->session_memcache_lock_expire = 7200;\n```\n We're using the 'memcache' PHP module: \n```text\n$ php -m | grep mem\n\n\nmemcache\n```\n If you're using the php 'memcached' module, and consequently \\core\\session\\memcached Moodle class, the variables to set above are likely different.",

We noticed recently that each instance running was generating a very large amount of CPU load on the database - even when the given instance was removed from the load balancer. I used wireshark to compare the queries sent to the database from that instance to the queries sent from an instance without this issue. I noticed a disproportionately large (500 in 2 minutes) amount of queries of the structure: \n```text\nSELECT id FROM mdl_user WHERE deleted = '0' AND mnethostid = '1' AND username = '~md5 hash~' LIMIT 0, 1\n```\n Mostly with MD5 hashes, some with usernames. Most of the queries return nothing, and our usernames aren't stored as md5 hashes in the db. 1. Is it likely that this is the cause for the excess CPU load? 2. Where are these queries coming from and why? Searching the codebase, a few possible sources of these queries are: user/externallib.php function update_users($users) Line 556 cohort/externallib.php",

          "Text": "Hi Niick, That's the cause of your issue, but it also suggests a potentially dangerous mis-configuration. That particular sync is designed to run as a single thread, and not concurrently in any way - e.g. simultaneously across multiple nodes in a cluster. You mention that you're seeing a high load on all nodes in your cluster, even when removed from the pool and I'd guess that you're therefore calling this particular cron script from all nodes. We actually replaced this script with a locking scheduled task in Moodle 3.3 ( MDL-57913 ) and I'd highly recommend using this in preference to the old script which will be going away in Moodle 3.6. To switch to the new task you need to enable the job in Admin -> Server -> Scheduled Tasks. This will ensure that the job is only run periodically, and is not run concurrently. I'd also recommend removing the call to the old sync script from your crontab. Generally I would  recommend that you consider running a dedicated cron node rather than running cron on all of your web nodes. Doing this means that system resources are not 'stolen' by the cron jobs in this manner - which would theoretically lead to a better experience for users. You can also choose how you scale your cron processing nodes independently of how you scale your web nodes which could well lead to cheaper hosting costs as you should no longer be scaling as much with the underlying cron load. Hope this helps, Andrew",

The my sql tuner reports everything fine with a InnoDB buffer size slightly bigger than needed which was done deliberatly. However the moodle script in \"/admin/dbperformance.php\" shows \"InnoDB cache hit rate 0\" and everything is working well apparently. What can be wrong? 2.Is it really worth it to change to InnoDB? our moodle has about 250 courses and 1500 users with a lot of entries: from 1000 to 2000 every day. If not, is it better to switch back to MyISAM? Thanks in advance, Rui Ruas",

MyISAM is much more likely to corrupt tables and require you to run repair tables. 3. Looking to the future, InnoDB tables support transactions, which we may start to use in Moodle 2.0 and beyond.",

Some things to think about... - How much memory are you allocating to MySQL and how much to Apache if they are on the same box/ VM ? - Run Munin or something like it. You need to be able to see what's happening to resources when the system is 'slow'. Make sure you install all the plugins for Apache and MySQL (e.g. you need to know how many connections are being used) - 350 child processes for Apache may not be enough for a large quiz class. Have you checked running processes when the quiz class starts? Don't just increase it though - Moodle is a big application and the other issue is that setting this too high tries to use more memory than you have. - Have you run one of the MySQL tuning scripts?",

The server company is Siteground.com - in case anyone has had personal experience with them.  I previously used Serverfly.com and had fewer problems (although the server did go down in the middle of use by a class in the lab three or four times).",

A hoster can  minimize all these problem, but a moodle user like you will obtain too much resources from a shared server. If you want to have it cheap, so try to setup your own local server at your school network. If you want to find a reliable webhost checkout for the following:",

The virtual private server will work but with that level of usage, it may slow down unless the above \"Round Robin\" approach is used. A leased,self managed server with an Internet backbone connection can be had for as low as $69 per month. (add $35-50 for management if needed) Building your own server is a viable alternative provided a couple criteria are met. 1. Run on a LAN... (see next) or 2. At least a 1.5mps (T1) up line for Internet access, otherwise users are going to be stifled by slow response. Even at 1.5Mps, there will be bottlenecks. Most Internet connections simply are not adequate for a server to operate very well. The biggest issue with a LAN setup is security. The equipment needs to be physically secured (a typical computer lab or classroom is not adequate). If the school can house your server with the schools servers, then you are getting there.",

The reason I speculated it might be something wrong with PHP is when one person logs on, the delay is between 5-10 seconds before the page loads. But once there is a group logging on (and by group, I mean between 5-25 students simultaneously), a couple of kids get on but all the others get 60 second timeout errors. I have looked at the resource usage on the server and it is never at maximum when the students are trying to logon. So that is why I am considering php accerlerators. If I had control of the budget, I would consider switching OS's, but since the Windows server is in place, that is what I have to work with.",

          "Text": "We are running the Moodle-plateform for about 3 months now. We are very happy with it, but we recently had two major problems: 1. Last week, our Moodle-server \"lost\" all the journal entries from the students. Through phpMyAdmin , I found out, that the Journal-table in Mysql was corrupted. Repairing the my sql -table did bring the student-works up again. 2. Yesterday, our Moodle system needed nearly 3 minutes to show the main-page of several courses. Same thing for the journal-entries. Some days ago, it took less than 2 seconds to parse the same page! The Moodle Homepage, login, course-listing was quite quick (a bit slower than usually, but one could live with it), but entering a course was sooooo damn long. I monitored the server and saw that the mysql-daemon took 30-40% of the processing power for the 3 Minutes it took to parse for example the journals. The solution to the second problem was emptying the moodle-cache-files in the mysql-database. The system is now running fine again. Is there any way to prevent these database-problems? Or do I have to repair tables regularly and empty the cache manually once a week? Server data: Xserve G5 (2 * 2 GHz) 2 GB RAM Moodle is the only app running on it.",

          "Text": "Dear All, We encounter very slow performance from our moodle server during Mid Term survey. We are using Questionnaire plugin for the survey. The survey has 15 questions combination of MCQ single answer and free text for comment. The survey is conducted at the end of the Lecture with 120 students all together.  I was standby in the room, to monitor. During the survey, the system response are very slow although I only see around 75 students login during it at the same time. It took about 1 - 2 mins for me to refresh the page, and check. Our Moodle version is: 2.3, running on Red Hat 6.4, 64 GB memory, and 32 cores.  The database is running MYSQL server 5, and running on physical server and on its own box.  The application server has the same specs with the database server. We only have 1 application and 1 database server currently. At the application server, there are quite number of messages in httpd error_log file: Can not obtain session lock, referer: http://ourserver/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=20698 The amount of CPU, Memory and bandwitdh in the application server are normal. But, at the Database server, there are very high cpu load happening, The memory is ok, only 15%, and network bandwidth are low as well.  There is nothing in the My SQL server log file. I didn't turn on the access log file for MySQL server for performance reason. I am not sure where is the bottleneck. I suspect that is MySQL server performance. But maybe I am wrong. How to fine tune my MySql server to have fast responses. And, How to do the load testing using Apache JMeter for Questionnaire activities ? I know how to do the Load test for quiz but not questionnaire. Appreciate for the great help and response. Thanks and best Regards, Yulstar",

I have also tried the mysqlturner, and modified some of the setting in my.cnf, but the performance is still the same. So, while checking in the internet I found out this article: http://dom.as/2006/09/12/mysql-tcp-network-tuning/ This article is suggested to open the max_syn_backlog in the sysctl.conf file from the TCP network. I have tried it in my dev. server and it speed up the processing almost three times.  Does you have any experience with max_syn_Backlog? Is there any side impact to moodle?  I plan to implement it on my database server which located internally. Thanks a lot for your response. Yulstar",
