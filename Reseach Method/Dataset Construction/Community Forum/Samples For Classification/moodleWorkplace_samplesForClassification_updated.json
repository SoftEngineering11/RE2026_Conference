Our other option was to create a new dynamic rule based on a user being added to a program that enrols the students into the course manually.   The annoying part of this was trying to undo course enrolments though, because if it's assigned via dynamic rule, it needs a reversing dynamic rule to action any unenrolments.  This is part of the reason why we didn't end up using Programs.   We ended up using the course recompletion plugin instead, as that suited our recertification needs better at an individual course level. Hope you find a solution that works for you. Deb",

          "Title": "Organisation structure vs Team overview show different “reports to” results for Department lead (Workplace 4.5)",
          "Text": "Hi everyone, I’m seeing a discrepancy in Moodle Workplace where the Organisation structure page shows empty \"report to\" list for a senior manager user, while the Team overview block for the same user correctly shows all managed staff across sub-departments including all lower-level managers and workers. Context : The hierarchy is CEO → Head Supervisor (Manager) → Supervisor (Manager) → Worker. In Site administration → Users → Organisation → Organisation structure , the user Head Supervisor displays an empty “People reporting to” list. However, when logging in as that same user, the Team overview renders as expected and includes managers from sub-departments plus their workers. The Workplace documentation states: “Department lead: This is the manager of anyone in a lower department or sub-department(s), regardless of their position.” See: https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Organisation_structure#Positions Our analysis points to two different query paths. The Organisation structure view appears to use a helper that returns users in the same department and excludes manager roles, which results in an empty list when the lead sits in a different department node than the staff they manage. Reference (code path): `admin/tool/organisation/classes/helper.php` > \n```text\nget_all_direct_managed_users_\nsql\n()\n```\n in Workplace 4.5. The Team overview uses a reporting helper that returns all managed users regardless of department membership, which aligns with the documentation and produces the correct list. Reference (code path): `admin/tool/organisation/classes/local/helpers/reporting.php` > `get_managed_users_select()` in Workplace 4.5. Given the Workplace doc’s definition of “Department lead,” my working assumption is that Organisation structure should reflect the same cross-department management resolution as Team overview. As it stands, Organisation structure appears to be applying a same-department constraint that contradicts the documented behaviour and the Team overview output. So , what’s the recommended way to address this? I’d appreciate your advice. Regards, Dustin",

          "Text": "Hi, I would like to be able to sort a program progress report based on a program's progress percentage , but that is currently not available. My use case is that we are encouraging involvement by holding a contest that gives rewards based on the amount of courses completed in a program. So we would like our managers to be able to view a report sorted by progress percentage easily. Since there is no way to do so, I am manually downloading the report and sorting that column in Excel. My second wish, based on this use case, is for a dynamic rule condition for progress percentage. For our contest, a gold certificate is rewarded for 100% completion of a program (which is easy to automate). And the silver certificate is rewarded for at least 3 courses completed in the program (no built in way to automate). My work around for silver is to change the settings of the program so that it is marked as completed when at least 3 courses are completed. For gold, I created a dynamic rule that issues the certificate when all of the courses contained in that program are completed. Though it is clunky, at least it is automated. I am surprised more people don't want to sort by percentage complete! And it would be great if there was a dynamic rule condition for progress percentage or by completion of course sets! 😀",

          "Text": "Hi everyone, We have recently updated to Moodle Workplace 4.5.4+ (Build: 20250519) and noticed that the interface for searching and filtering users under Site administration > Users > Accounts > Browse list of users has changed compared to earlier versions. While the new advanced filters are powerful, I’m wondering: Is there any way to revert to the simpler user search interface we had before this change? Are there any settings, plugins, or workarounds that allow us to only use the basic filters, similar to the old layout? We would like to make it easier for less-experienced administrators who might find the new filter system a bit too complex. Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions! Best regards,",

A yearly recertification for the Certification. They must complete the Program again to be re-certified. Once they earn the Certification, I'd like award a badge for that. There is an option to assign a badge under the Certification's Dynamic rules. However, under Dynamic rules the Badge option is grayed out with an \"i\" icon next to it. Hovering over the \"i\" icon gives the message \"No available badges\". I have tried to make a badge available but the Badge option under Certification remains stubbornly unavailable. Details about the Badge and other required settings to make Badges work: The badge exists. Enable course badges is selected. Completion tracking is enabled. Default Completion tracking is set to \"Use activity default\". Completion tracking for all activities in all course in the Program are enabled. Currently, the badge I want to use does not have criteria assigned to it as there doesn't seem to be any option that works with Programs. I could use individual courses but because two different programs use the same two courses in conjunction with others, tying the badge to those two courses will trigger it for both Programs. To say nothing of the fact that the badge should be awarded for earning Certification, not completing the Program. I did create a test badge with criteria to see if this would somehow enable the Dynamic rule for the Certification. It does not. Badges do work on the site. One is assigned on completion of two separate courses. Both of these courses are in two of the Programs. So I'm at a bit of a loss. It would be helpful to have a badge for learners earning a Certification. It does look like it's possible but nothing I try makes that option available. Any help would be great.",

Links to these Custom Pages automatically appear on the navigation menu when set to be visible. This is very powerful as you have the ability to define who can see these custom pages. For example, you can have a page that only Guests can see, another page that only Authenticated Users can see, and you can even make a \" Dashboard \" that only a specific \"Roles\" or specific \"Users\" can see (I made a reporting Dashboard for my one supervisor that only they can see). One tip I wanted to share is how to prevent a Custom page from automatically appearing on the custom menu. (For example, I created a \"Learning Center\" Custom Page that contains links to two other Custom Pages, but I don't want these two other  Custom Pages to appear on the main Navigation menu.) Use the id# located in the Custom Page's URL and insert that number  at the end of the code below: /* Hide a specific Custom Page from the Primary Navigation Menu */ .primary-navigation li[data-key=\"tool_custompage- 21 \"] {display: none;}",

So if you want to reuse a CSV, any 1s should remain 1s in future runs of the CSV (and even though it's already deleted, it will simply just look to delete again the next run and if there's nothing to delete then it's just ignored and not added back).",

Is it a one time deal? Does Moodle software check at periodic intervals and send out notification(s) at such interval? Does the notification only populate within MW, or does it also generate an email? Is there an option or ability to set a notification for those who are coming up (nearing their overdue date)? Is there an option or ability to set a notification for those who have not logged in and completed any work in the last week or two? We are currently running Version 4.2 that was installed by and is hosted by MoodleUS. Thank you in advance! Zain",

And from the current moodle workplace version (4.3.3) it looks like we don't have the ability to set condition (in dynamic rules) to send notification based on a relative date (coming up, nearing overdue, set date prior to overdue, etc). It would be good to have this included in the condition so that we can customize when to send out notification. Hope to hear any resolution to this soon. Cheers",

          "Text": "The Dynamic Rules look at courses as a whole so it can automate actions based on various course completion statuses, so it won't include options at the individual activity completion level. Consider these options: Overdue activities : T he Pulse plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_pulse ) -- it's capable to send reminders for after specific dates if an activity remains overdue. Since Relative Dates is considered an experimental feature at this time, I do not know if it knows to utilize the student's relative due date or not, but if you create a test course with relative dates enabled and pick an activity with an upcoming due date, then set up this plugin in the course to send an overdue message, you can then enroll a a test user after that due date has passed to see if they will get the message on their respective due date. The Reengagement plugin ( https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_reengagement ) also can send reminders for overdue content. Upcoming activities: Both the plugins mentioned above state they have capabilities to send notifications about upcoming activities. Then, there's the built-in Moodle's Analytics system's model for Upcoming activities due (if it's not there by default, you just click add a New model). This will send emails or Web alerts (depending on how the site admin sets up default Messaging - Notification Preferences for \"Insights generated by prediction models\") at one of three defined intervals: Upcoming week, upcoming 3 days, or upcoming fortnight. With that said, it wont provide a list of the activities, instead it directs users to the dashboard 's timeline where they can see/access the upcoming activities. To give it a try with a test user, it's rather simple to set up and get going - while you are testing this out you can turn off these notifications at the site level, then edit the preferences of your test users and enable it just for them so only get that email/web alert. Another option to see the data it will generate for the test users is to go the Analytics Models admin settings page, find the upcoming activities due model and select the test users from the dropdown in the Insights column (they will only appear here once the analytic model has finished running for the interval) to see if they have any upcoming items due data generated, or next to that dropdown select \"Actions - Insight Report\" and then the particular user to see a report of the data. These are the approaches that I have used in my institution so just wanted to share in case you see any value in these options.",

          "Text": "I am unsure the best approach for providing specific development feedback to the dev team. Help me route if there's a better path. I am running into a limitation with the dynamic rules notification placeholders. Dynamic rules are helpful and the notification feature is a great option for pushing notification to the learners and managers/leaders. There is, however, not currently any consideration for enrolment start or end date. Examples Scenario Learner is enrolled to course X with a start date of 2023-05-01 :00. Notification is triggered to learner when enrolled with start date and basic details. (ex. \"Welcome!\") = [enrolment created=now()] Notification message body may include the respective enrollment starts and enrollment ends dates. An email is triggered a week prior to course access. (ex. \"Get ready!\") = enrolment start-7 Notification is triggered a day prior to enrolment start. (ex. \"Tomorrow's the BIG day!\") = [enrolment start-1] Notification is triggered week after enrolment start. (ex. \"Tips for Week 2\") = [enrolment start+7] Notification is triggered 10 days before the end of the enrollment period. (ex. \"Course Concluding!\") = [enrolment end-10] These are necessary to ensure enrolments are properly engaged without adding manual practices. \n```text\n\n```\n The limitation seems to be that the dynamic rules available placeholders are rather limited both in context and scope of logic. It's a good start, but I'm left with a lot of gaps. Any better solutions? Creative ideas? How to escalate to the dev team? Most of our enrolments are batch uploads so we need rules that trigger. Unless I am missing something, I'd like to advocate for this to be on the development track.",
