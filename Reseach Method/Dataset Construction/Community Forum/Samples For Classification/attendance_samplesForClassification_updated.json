          "Text": "Hello, We have several of our training programmes using the attendance plugin for their training days. One of the biggest selling points for attendance was the QR code option that becomes available on sessions once 'student self-record' has been enabled. However, one of our administrators noticed that some trainees who weren't in attendance had somehow marked themselves present even though they weren't there to scan the QR code. I realised that the QR code wasn't a key as such (which is what I had assumed), but rather just a hyper link to the self-record page, and any trainee was able to login and self-record during the hours of the session, even if they haven't scanned the QR code. I thought I'd fixed this by setting the attendance activity settings to \"Available but not shown on course page\", but some clever trainees had still found their way to self-record their session, likely through the gradebook or from attendance notifications. Is there a way we can keep using QR codes, which our training schemes absolutely love, but have these QR codes be the only way for trainees to self-record attendance? We really don't want there to be any way for absent trainees to mark themselves present. Is the only way to do it to also use the passcode along with the QR code? Please let me know if you can advise.",

Obviously point 3 will force the QR code to rotate, making it harder for users to take a photo of the QR (or just grabbing the url from the QR code) and sending it to their friends but you need to make sure your webserver and the machine using to show the QR code have their time synced correctly otherwise errors may occur. hope that helps!",

After adding a session for the whole course, this new session appears and suddenly the group session also appears. Furthermore, the plugin also makes course and group sessions a Course activity in the calendar. i want to be able to make sessions for only some group(s) in stead of making a session for the whole course every time. How can i make sure that the group session also appears without having to make a session for the whole course? I would like to make it a group activity in the calendar as well, but that's not really needed. Thanks in advance. Jethro",

We have 1 student (as a test) enrolled. \n\n\n\n\nWhen we attempt to use the plugin we get the message of \"\nA file permissions error has occurred. Please check the permissions on the script and the directory it is in and try again\n.\"\n\n\n\n\nWe tried changing the folder permissions in the /Mod and /Block from 711 to 755 and the files from 666 to 644 to match all the other plugins which made no difference. \n\n\nWe get the same message regardless of how we try to access it (block or resource link). It also makes no difference whether weare logged in as Admin or Teacher. The teacher role has permissions to access the plugin but when we looked at the individual user, the permissions said not allowed (but show allowed for admin, even though we get the same messge)\n\n\n\n\nAny help would be appreciated, we're pretty new to admin'ing a Moodle setup :)\n\n\n\n\nRegards\n```",

Our attendence records are available from our MIS system via a browser. I know what the search string is but i need to be able to insert the student's ID in to the string. I am not a programmer but i do understand the concept. the link needs to be private to the student and the tutor (I am thinking in a WiKi) and work in such away that when the Link/button is clicked their ID is inserted in to the search string. Also the search string needs to be hidden from view. Is there any one who can help me here? Cheers Stephen Catton. Sparsholt Collage",

What I am trying to do is reward students who stay current with the course - most do, but I need some type of carrot for those who don't (our institution is squaking about the high attrition rates in our online courses so we were told to do \"something\").  I can grade the students by looking at the logs, but it would be sooooo nice if the attendance module could somehow handle this situation. Any ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks!",

I noticed that the module's main documentation page for Moodle v2.3 hadn't been update since 2010, and still talked about an earlier version of the module meant to run with Moodle v1.9.  I updated the installation instructions based on other documentation on this site and on my own installation experience. A couple of points that need attention from someone: 1. The documentation page should be fully updated to conform with v2.4.0 of the module. I'll probably do that as I continue testing the module. 2. If v2.4.0 does work with Moodle v2.3, something I'm not yet completely certain of, its documentation should be updated to reflect this fact -- or rather, it should be versioned to v2.4.1, since at least one file would need to be changed. 3. It would be really nice if this module would be published in the standard way, on the Plugins page . 4. The old documentation mentioned in passing something called the Attendance block, inadequately documented at page Attendance block .  What is it?  How is it installed?  The documentation page says very little.  (I'm fairly new to Moodle, so I might be missing something that's obvious to more experienced users.)",

(Since there were four different pages for documenting the same code, those for Moodle v2.0, v2.1, v2.2, and v2.3, I replaced the three first pages with a short explanation and a link to the v2.3 page. I did the same for the Attendance block instruction page, after updating v2.3 of that page, too.)

Is there any such option right now? or is there any idea around it? or can i try and create one such feature? To provide some more clarity we would like to be able to view all the students list in a group and then be able to edit in place and add some attendance status like present and absent... This means that this will have to be like another additional module which can be created for every new training and based on the group the trainer can mark their status.

I also see a grade of 100% being given if attendance is not recorded at all for the first 2 sessions for a given student, but they are marked as Present for the last 4 sessions. If the above is correct, does anyone know of a straightforward workaround to achieve a passing grade when 5 or more workshops out of 6 are attended (short of creating 6 separate Attendance activities , putting them in a Gradebook category, etc.), and having the grade appear correctly throughout the course (i.e. before attendance for all sessions has been taken)?

They sent me some comments or improvement ideas for the \"Report\" tab I would like to share here: - It would be good to highlight the attendances that had a remark. Now you only can see them when you're taking/changing attendance or exporting the report. - The last row shows the summary, but it's accumulative. It's interesting to show the summary only for the session column, each column with its separate summary. - When you are using group sessions and there are many groups with many different sessions, it would be very useful a group filter above the report table to show only the sessions for a group. Now, we have temporal filters (weeks, months,...) but no group filter, to hide sessions for other groups and get a more narrow table. Thank You!",

Any attendance roll that has this option checked will be edited by the cron library function to reflect whether a student has performed ANY activity at ANY TIME on the day of the attendance roll. I've left this feature pretty simple for the time being. If the roll contains multiple hours, all hours will be marked as present or absent based on whether the student performed any logged activities between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM on that day. I'm willing to enhance this feature to allow for more options, but I'd like to know what users really want in terms of behavior. It's not entirely clear how the details of attendance as it's implemented would map to automation. Should there be time ranges to limit the attendance? How should multiple hours be mapped to that kind of time range? I've cleaned up and enhanced the page navigation bars for the multi-page views in this update as well. Have fun! Russ",

Then, I entered an attendance roll for yesterday after doing this test and it marked her as present on that day--even though she was not logged in at any point yesterday.

SO I download this using the command: $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@us2.cvs.moodle.org:/cvsroot/moodle co contrib/plugins/mod/attforblock I want to make sure that I have the latest version so I look in version.php and find \"2008061901\".

I've tried adjusting setting in both the gradebook and the attendance settings, including: Changing the grading to scale and back to points Changing group mode to \"no groups\" and back to \"separate groups\" Checking the multiplicator and the saving changes to the grade settings Does anybody have any ideas about why this is happening or what else I can try? Thank you, Rebecca",

The Assignment module, the Gradebook Module and pretty much all of Moodle works this way, ID number ordering by tweaking the source code of the Attendance module is completely doable and I am the site Admin. I'm just a little shocked that such an integral module would not \"behave\" the same as the rest. I hope the maintainers are reading this.

We're using Moodle 1.8.4+ currently and will be upgrading to 1.9 when the stable build is released. For each of the subjects (courses) taught, there are a number of classes (groups). We have a tutor (non-editing teacher) in each of the classes (groups). What we want is to have the tutor add new sessions and take attendance for them with students in their class (group). These sessions are not to be viewable by tutors (non-editing teachers) of other classes (groups). This is possible if we create an instance of an Attendance activity for each class and assign them individually to each of the classes (groups) in Moodle 1.9, however, this not the most efficient method and generation of reports will be a problem as the subject head (editing teacher) will have to run the report multiple times for multiple instances of Attendance individually when he/she wants the results of all attendances. Is it thus possible to have the Attendance activity more group-oriented?",

As a temporary work around, we have faculty create a category, set that category total to zero and move the attendance grade there. Other ideas?  Thanks for any leads. Mary Beth",

We've found that going into the Attendance Activity, clicking the \"Update the Attendance\" button and changing the grade to something other than \"No Grade\", saving changes, then immediately changing it back to \"No Grade\" will pull the item out of the grade book. In your experience - when the activity adds an item in the grade book, does it enter in 0's for all of the students, like it is for us? Does anyone know why this is happening in the first place? Is it a bug? It's becoming a big support issue for us. Thanks, Laurie",

What I'm seeing is as I start the upgrade (via the Plugins overview page, clicking \"install this update\" with the Activity Module and the Block) is that the upgrade starts up--the browser shows it is installing (with the activity indicator in the browser tab) and I can see attendance update activity happening in the process list on my database server . Within 5-10 minutes, the activity indicator in the browser stops, the database activity seems to stop, and Moodle shows \"site is being upgraded, try back later\" though no upgrade activity seems to be happening on the database server. I was able to back it off and stick with my current 3.1.0.3 version, but this isn't optimal. Has anyone been through this and could give me an idea of where I'm going wrong or where to start looking for answers in a log?",

All other upgrades have gone just fine--I've updated to 3.3.4, updated all plugins we use except attendance, updated the theme (Moove), etc. with no issues. In addition, attendance did update in my non-production environments, but they have much fewer courses and almost no attendance data in them. I have tried module then block, block then module, and both together, and I get the same seeming failure each time. This wouldn't be such a problem for me, except when I upgraded to 3.3.4, we seem to have lost the ability to hit a single radio button to mark everyone present, absent, etc. in the plugin. This is going to be an issue for us when fall courses start up.",

If I change the grade from scale to 100 everything is o.k I start debugging it and I found that my problem is that mingrade = 1 maxgrade=6 but my rawgrade is -2 (because this->grade =-4, get_user_grade=3, get_user_max_grade=6. so: 3/6*-4 = -2) so finalgrade always get 1...because mingrade is bigger then rawgrade. How can I fix it?? Thanks!",

          "Text": "Hello, I am new to Moodle, and thank you very much for the Attendance module! I have a question regarding the functionality on Mobile. After submitting the teacher attendance form, the app takes the teacher to the activity page with the stats. Then, if the teacher presses the back button in the header, they are taken back to the attendance form which they have just submitted. That is somewhat counterintuitive, because they have just submitted the form and they probably want to go back to the course page (if they want to resubmit the attendance they can click the update attendance button again). My question: after submitting attendance, is it possible to make the back button in the header take the teacher back to the course page and not the form page? Another option: in the form submit action, instead of \"method=\"mobile_view_activity\"\" what would be the right thing to write to take the teacher straight to the course page? Thank you very much!",

This solution converts the HTML table of the Report into a javascript Data Grid widget. This allows you to click in the grey area of any header to allow for column sorting without page refreshes. Another feature of this widget is having the ability to resize the columns (like in Excel) by hover, click, drag action. So with a bit of dragging you can hide sessions you don't want to see. To try it out unzip the attached file, replace your report.php with the one attached and paste the 'codebase' folder into your attforblock folder. Unfortunately this solution will not work on the attendances.php page because the values of the radio buttons contain student ids etc. This solution uses the dhtmlxgrid. Enjoy! Barry",

          "Text": "Hi Deborah, It works pretty much the same as the attendances.php page. I see the table isn't rendered properly with the javascript widget because the 'userpic' column's header is empty. A quick fix for that is to change $table->head[] = ''; to $table->head[] = 'Pic'; Now the % column will appear but it still doesn't sort properly. It sorts by string rather than by integer. So % between 1 and 9 (& 100 %) will appear in strange places... To get it to sort properly with the dhtml grid is possible but might be bit complicated: See http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/kb/index.shtml?cat=search&page=1&q=11236&ssr=yes&s=grid%20sort%20html To do the sort the way you are thinking is probably not going to work unless you change the whole way the code works for this report: You might need to use the flexible_table class from tablelib.php instead of the print_table (from weblib.php). It has built in table sorting capabilities. There are probably other ways of doing it as well: Replacing the foreach php loops with sql as far as possible and building your sort string in the sql with extra sort paramaters for the % column. Lastly, the dhtmlxGrid can also be initialised from a database call rather than by transforming the already rendered html. have a look at the documentation, examples and knowledgebase at dthmlx.com if you want. It's quite straightforward and they have loads of examples. Cheers, Barry",

I think my issue may be related to this fix.The problem is, when one of my instructors tries to take attendance it gives an error:  You can't take attendance for group \"Friday 12:30 Section\" \"Friday 12:30 section\" is the group mentioned regardless of which instructor is trying to access.  The module should be allowing them to acces their own group. Any idea what is going on? Thanks, Jet",

I teach chemistry in a high school (not an online class) and I want all students to type labs and submit reports electronically though Moodle's assignment module.  If a student is not present for a lab or sits out during the lab time, I want that student to make up the lab after school.  I currently keep track on paper who does not perform a lab.  So what would be nice is if on lab days I could record attendance and mark anyone who has not performed the lab absent.   Then since they are absent, Moodle will not let the student access the submission feature of that particular lab assignment (I would want them to be able to go into the activity to download any files or read any instructions.)  Once a student makes up a lab after school, I would then go back into the attendance for that day and mark that student \"present\", allowing them to submit the assignment. Does anyone know if this is possible?",

Then find this code in the attendances.php file: $table->data[$student->id][] = profile_display_fields($student->id); And change it to: $profilefields = get_records_select('user_info_data', 'userid='.$student->id, '', 'data'); foreach($profilefields as $field) { $table->data[$student->id][] = $field->data;} This solution will add a data in a column for each custom profile field you have. If you have more than the 2 custom fields and you only want to use two specific ones you'll need to go about it a bit differently: Something like: // this is for the first profile field. Change '1' to whatever datafield id corresponds to the field you want to use $profilefield1 = get_records_select('user_info_data', 'userid='.$student->id.\" AND fieldid='1'\", '', 'data'); foreach($profilefield1 as $field) { $table->data[$student->id][] = $field->data;} // this is for the first profile field. Change '2' to whatever fieldid corresponds to the field you want to use $profilefield2 = get_records_select('user_info_data', 'userid='.$student->id.\" AND fieldid='2'\", '', 'data'); foreach($profilefield2 as $field) { $table->data[$student->id][] = $field->data;} I haven't tested the second solution so if you need to use it just let me know if it gives you any problems.",

Let me know what you think about these suggestions and if you have any others that might be useful. Also, if you agree that these would be an improvement, go vote for them. Color code the report that teachers see so that various attendance states are highlighted (such as green for present, red for absent). We would probably have to  also modify the settings page so that users could set the colors for the different attendance choices For the sessions tab, default to all. Currently it defaults to sessions in the current week which can be confusing to users who have just created a bunch of attendance sessions. After adding sessions, the user should go back to the sessions page so they know that the sessions have been created. Right now, there is no indication that the sessions were created. An alternative would be the display of some message that the sessions were successfully created.",

Moodle also shows me that there must still be something there, because when I go to “delete past lessons”, it asks me if I really want to delete the 4 lessons. I have set up the appointments so that they are recurring. Could this be the problem? Are there problems with recurring lessons?",

I would be very grateful for any advice on how to proceed.  Also, please do tell me if this module is not suitable, or if I should be posting elsewhere. Richard",

I did configure the plugin's settings for the mail (I think I did it the right way), and the STMP from my moodle website works correctly. Is there something I must know? Does the mail send automatically after a few hours or at a set time? Thank you!",

If you click the Help button in the \"Sessions\" tab (bottom corner), this is what appears: \"Session hides if course's start date older than its date. Change start date of course and hidden sessions will be shown. You can use this feature to hide older sessions instead delete. Remember than only visible sessions using in Gradebook.\" If you read it aloud you'll be able to spot the mistakes. I know its a minor thing, but just wanted to pass it along for a future update.

          "Text": "Current version of Moodle (1.4+) is really lacking a tool for retrieving students' activity in a downloable Excel format. I am thinking of something along the lines of WebCT's Track Students tool, which neatly displays the following info for students enrolled in one given course: Personal Information     Access Information         Articles Full Name User ID First Access Last Access Hits Items Read Posted (where Articles = Forum discussions in Moodle) All we have available at the moment is the \"people\" block, which gives a list of the particpants with their login status ( Never or time elapsed since last login ). This is not very helpful, and if more details are needed, then the only way is to click on a students' name, which gives too many details and we lose the \"class\" overview. What is needed is something in between the \"minimal\" participants list with login dates and the detailed \"individual\" data. In the present block: people -> participants -> the list looks like this: First name  / Surname    City/town    Country    Last access John Smith    Rennes    France    25 days 23 hours John Doe    Rennes    France    5 days 3 hours a) I personally do not find it very useful to have Last access displayed as time elapsed and would find it clearer to have this as a date & time instead (but this is a matter of taste) b) I really need not one column where first name & last name are put together, but 2 separate columns , sortable, of course. In the present system it is possible to sort the \"First name/Surname\" column on either First Name or Surname, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, when you do a sort on e.g. Surname, then Surnames are displayed in alphabetical order but, unfortunately First Names are not, which means we can have the following: Peter Smith    Rennes    France    25 days 23 hours John Smith    Rennes    France    5 days 3 hours What is needed here is that when a primary sort is wanted on First Name a secondary sort be done on Surname, and vice versa. I'd be grateful if someone could suggest ways of overcoming these problems. Joseph_R PS Regarding the display of data about students' visits & activity in Moodle in general, I do not care much about graphics being displayed (they are useful, of course) but what I need in order to track my students' activity are data downloadable in Excel format , for further examination, etc.",

However I am php newbie, the hack took me a lot of time, and it quickly became obsolete with the important updates to the attendence module.\n\nSince then, I reworked the existing 4 ratings to include a coarse measure of behavior and attendence, on a 0 - 3 point scale.\n\nI believe an enhanced attendence module could serve both purposes.",

          "Text": "Hello, We are having an issue with grading for the Attendance module. It works great for taking attendance. However, it calculates a student's grade oddly if you are using natural grading for the course. Specifically, it scales the grade up percentage and point wise based on the student's attendance to date. The logic is so that the student is not penalized for classes that have not yet occurred. However, the grade is inflated to the max points for attendance for the entire course. For example, if the total attendance grade for the course is100 points for 10 classes - the student will see they have 100 points in the gradebook after the first class attended rather than the 10 points they have actually earned. The problem resolves itself at the end of the course when all sessions have been completed. However, it skews the grade while the class is still in progress. Has anyone else encountered this and do you have any recommendations? Thanks! Eric Evans Union College",

Or should I set up separate sessions for each group (which seems a lot more time consuming). If I go for the first option of one single session using groups, that session gets marked as completed (green arrow) in the actions menu as soon as any one of the tutors marks attendance for their group ( which is a bit confusing for the other tutors who have yet to record their attendance). Is there a way for groups to share a session but only have tutors see it listed as completed when their student group has had attendance marked? Any advice would be gratefully received. Kathy",

I have it set up to semi-automatic, however when I add the session for the week (I don't want to add multiple sessions as I would have to probably put the main under general and try and add each session to each week) I had a student go in and try and check into the course. I was not logged into my teacher interface; they got an email permission error. So, am I misunderstanding how this works? I plan to try and do this tomorrow, if possible, so 1. what is the quickest way to add multiple sessions without going to each week and adding 1? If I add multiple after going to the week number and adding attendance as an activity the whole thing will show up in week 4 in this case. I kind of do not want that. I want each week to be a separate check in. And now that I checked the semi-automatic option in my admin interface, how then can I have the student mark themselves as present if I'm not logged into the interface. Can I have it send an auto email? Or so I need to be logged into my teacher interface, or have one of the other instructors who are in the class be logged into theirs? I did read the docs, but the process is not very clear to me yet. I will get it; it just takes me a while sometimes to grasp a function. Btw my students are visually impaired, well some of them are, and so the QR code might not work well for them even though I have the rotation set to me think 2 minutes to give them time to scan with their phones. Is there another way they can mark themselves as present and accounted for? I want to make sure they are not having any issues due to accessibility . I am taking attendance via a google docs spreadsheet as a back up btw. So that works fine. I'd rather have a backup, always always always.

Then visit /admin/index.php on your site and trigger the attendance plugin upgrade. Make sure you have debugging set to developer with display errors set to \"on\" Then check to see if the attendance activities exist in your site.

Like many colleges, ours is required to track attendance very closely for financial aid and retention reporting purposes. We need to be able to generate campus wide reports that show things such as: 1. Any classes where attendance has failed to be taken within 24 hours of a session. 2. Any student who has missed two classes in a row. 3. The last day of attendance for any student who has dropped below the number of credits required to qualify for financial aid. (This one is particularly problematic because when a student is unerolled from a class, the reports in the attendance mdoule no long show any record of attendance for them.) Does anyone know of any existing report plugins that can extract this data from Moodle database tables or even better a custom MySQL query that can do this. Much appreciated. Todd",

I've upgraded moodle from 2.4 to 2.6. and as for the attendace mod/block I installed the following versions: mod:   2014061301 block: 2014062600 I updated the deprecated function get_context_instance manually since it was throwing warnings about it and still I need to remove navmenu() which is also deprecated. Are these updated in any later version by the way? The issue that has arisen after the upgrade is that although the students submit their attendance with success, at the end they can see the error: \"Can not find data record in database table course\" (Debugging is turned off).

As the lead maintainer of the plugin, I was hoping you may be able to answer some questions regarding the plugin's privacy: What are the type(s) of personal, critical, or sensitive information collected, maintained, or shared by the Attendance plugin (if any)? Who has access to the collected data? Do any third parties/developers/maintainers of the plugin have access to it? Does the Attendance plugin store data within the Moodle instance it's installed in, or on a remote server ? If the data is stored remotely, where is it stored?

Only users with access to login to your Moodle site (or access to your Moodle database ) will be able to access information stored by the plugin. The attendance plugin is also fully compliant with Moodle's Privacy API - some of your questions would be covered by installing the attendance plugin in your Moodle site and visit the Plugin privacy compliance registry report in Moodle under admin > users Plugins that are compliant with Moodle's privacy API that share data with external services (like plagiarism plugins etc) will list in this report the types of data they share with an external service. If you select the attendance plugin on this report, under \"activity module > Attendance\" you will see the following data: attendance_log Log of user attendances recorded. sessionid Attendance session ID. studentid ID of student having attendance recorded. statusid ID of student's attendance status. statusset Status set to which status ID belongs. timetaken Timestamp of when attendance was taken for the student. takenby User ID of the user who took attendance for the student. remarks Comments about the user's attendance. ipaddress IP address attendance was marked from. attendance_sessions Sessions to which attendance will be recorded. groupid Group ID associated with session. sessdate Timestamp of when session starts. duration Session duration in seconds lasttaken Timestamp of when session attendance was last taken. lasttakenby User ID of the last user to take attendance in this session timemodified Timestamp of when session was last modified attendance_warning_done Log of warnings sent to users over their attendance record. notifyid ID of attendance session warning is associated with. userid ID of user to send warning to. timesent Timestamp when warning was sent.

The attendance marking page uses the \"Show user identity\" setting found under Admin > Users > Permissions > User policies. \"Email address\" is the default setting - you could untick this box to remove it but it would also remove it from a number of other reports in Moodle that will currently display the e-mail address. It may make sense for the attendance plugin to have it's own \"showuseridentity\" setting instead of relying on the core setting - pull requests and funding (including MUA) are always welcome, but if the intent is to make it easier for teacher marking you may be interested to hear that I am actively working on adding support for the Moodle Mobile app - the code in the github master branch already supports student self-marking within the app and I am currently working on support for teachers to mark attendance as well.",

To change it so that Excused gets the same credit as Present, it can be changed in the Site Attendance settings. Under the tab 'Default status set' you can customise the value of each status. When you create a new attendance activity, it will use these values. I understand that you are already 4 weeks in but you could do the following: 1) Export all attendance data for the course so you don't lose who attended when 2) Create a replacement attendance activity (name it something slightly different to the old one so you don't muddle them up). 3) Create all replacement sessions for your course 4) For each session you have already recorded, you can upload a CSV file to repopulate the entries: a) Click the button to start the register b) Click 'Upload attendance by CSV' c) Drag and drop a csv file with just two fields. I did email and status e.g. \n```text\n    email,status\n\n\n    examplestudent1@thisplace.com,P\n\n\n    examplestudent2@thisplace.com,P\n\n\n    examplestudent3@thisplace.com,A\n\n\n    examplestudent4@thisplace.com,E\n```\n Apparently it will except username as an alternative to email but I didn't try that. 5) Delete the old attendance activity",

It's only a small group (33 students in total) so it's too bad to do, but it would be a bit tedious for a larger group.

          "Text": "Dear Dan and All, Apologies if my questions will appear very basic, but I just can't get the Attendance's automatic feature to work like I would want.. I'm using version 3.5.6 on Moodle 3.5.2. Tried a few sites. Is there a configuration that would allow me simply to: 1) automatically set student status in a session to Present if s/he has accessed the course at the required time period (from an IP controlled machine). 2) automatically set student status to Absent under other conditions. I want this to be done **fully automatically** -  without students having to click on \"Submit attendance\", and ideally without even displaying that \"Submit your attendance\" button at all. I'm not sure I understand how these options above interplay with each other and with the session settings below. (2) Session > Edit session I thought the natural settings for me were : Automatic setting: Yes - I just wonder why this is enabled only when \"Allow students to record on attendance\" is on..? Just how much automatic is \"automatic\"? Is this the setting to avoid pressing \"Submit attendance\"? But I still can see that button there... (Another puzzle, why do the other two options require a possible password..? However, I don't think i need to undersand that right now if it does not concern my problem.) \"Automatically select highest status available\" - I assume this reads the \"Available for students (minutes)\" statuses of a given session , right? So I have that selected. Require network address: Use default or enter manual value - this works. Prevent student sharing ... - I don't need this now, but why does the \"Yes\" setting throw the \"Invalid minutes to release\" alert..? My problems  seems close to what I found  here: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=364282 , but I just could figure out the settings.. Please advise, whoever can. Many thanks. Przemek",

When I pointed out that clicking on the column headers allowed the instructor to mark all of the students at one time they were astounded. I am not a user interface designer but I presume there would be some design element that could be added to make this feature more discoverable. It is common practice now to allow a table of data to be re-ordered by clicking on column headers. Normally there is some indication that this feature is available such as a small up or down arrow next to the column header. Perhaps in this case a small check mark might serve as an indication to the user that clicking on the column header would check all entries in the column? Only a small suggestion and, as I say, I am no designer. Thanks to all of the people who work on this module. It is extremely useful.",

In principle, in its normal use, it works very well, the\nsessions are created to control attendance, it controls the times, it\ncollects the signings, it makes its minutes, etc... With the\nadministrator role, if I take the course where it is to a new course, on\nthe same platform, through a process of creating a backup copy and then\nreloading it in the new course, deleting the content of said course, it\ndoes not load the sessions that I have. there would be in the\nattendance plugin. It has the same behavior, if I make a partial backup only of the support activity created... Let's go with information: Moodle Moodle 4.1.4+ (Build: 20230714) Plugin version: 2023020107 What's going on? How is this incident fixed? Thanks in advance and best regards",

For users who would like to do so, there is no good option for them, and we have had multiple requests over the last two weeks for such functionality. Workarounds include setting up a status set with a \"Dropped status and using the \"Report\" to track how many sessions someone has missed and filling in the first two absences with \"Dropped\". This is not ideal as it requires manual adjustments and is unsuitable for one of our instructors who runs a 240 student course. The other workaround is to use the Attendance module to track attendance, and then use the report to generate grades in Excel with formulas. This is another manual step, but it works if attendance is only being reported to the gradebook at the end of the course. I suggest adding a \"Drop the lowest...\" setting to the Attendance settings so that the feature is available.",

Feature development on the attendance plugin is largely influenced by funding and community contributions. If you have internal development resource that can make improvements to the plugin I'm always really happy to review pull requests. If this is something you are able to fund you could contract your local Moodle Partner to make the changes and get them to file a pull request against the core plugin or contact me directly if you would like to fund my time to work on the plugin. thanks!",

This list should be used in many attendance \" activities \" as this days are common to all the courses. So if you have a classe on Tuesdays, and one Tuesday is on the list, then its deleted automatically. 2 - Add some duration to the course: ex: my course is on tuesdays one hour from 16-17 and i give 24 hour/course. I began on 12 October. So it would create all the sessions needed ( ideally it would pass the holidays as mentioned in the suggestion above). 3 - Possibility to add two-hour sessions ex: Tuesdays from 16-18,,, Really would be equivalent of two sessions one from 16-17 and another from 17-18. A pupil can miss one class but attend the other.... 4 - Percentage of missing classes about the total length of the course. If one course has 25 hours. And i have missed 3 classes. Then my missing percentatge is 12% ( 3 over 25 although we are still in the 10th session of the course) . Misses about the whole course and not what classes have been passed. Thank",

One of the requirements is that we need to record attendance for students as well as teachers and teaching assistants. I come across Attendance module which almost meets the requirement except for the teacher/teaching assistant part. I know it is a special requirement from my side, so I love to receive some guidance on how to alter the code to cover teachers and teaching assistants in the Attendance procedure. I downloaded the code and read it for hours, and hardly found the way out. One of the reasons is because I'm new to PHP and Moodle (though I'm a quite sophisticated Java / C# / SQL programmer). -wenbin",

Use Meta Courses and Child Courses for the above. If Moodle allowed you to enroll students into a Course category you would be better off (less work to do later when it comes to reporting). - Schedule the training plan Do this by creating sessions in Attendance module? - Take attendance for each of the planned course [If there is an option to capture the attendance if an only if someone has provided the feedback, it would be great] Do you mean you don't want them to appear on the list unless they've provided feedback to a specific feedback questionaire? If so, you would need to edit the attendances.php file and possibly the locallib.php file. You would also need to create a form of some sort and add database table/fields where you can store which feedback instance has to be completed for them to appear on the list. This whole part is a big job!",

However have few more queries. - As you mentioned , I will be able to take report based on the permission that I have. What is the kind of permission it looks for? Course creator,teacher or anything else. As an admin of whole site, can't I have access to all courses? - There is no export to excel feature availabe when I take advanced report. Everything will be displayed on the web page itself. Is there a way I can export that to excel? - Also the fields like 'Category' and 'attended date' is not available. Category will be an important field to segregate the courses further. Is it possible to add that field? Thanks, Ramamoorthy",

You could always remove the check for permission if that fits in with your setup. I have not worked on the excel export feature. From what I remember it's not too difficult to modify. You can add 'Category' field if you want. I don't have time to work on it and don't have any need for it. It should be simple. Maybe look at how I added 'groups' and work from there. (You basically just have to use the category table instead of the groups table from the database). By the way the 'groups' field doesn't check for permissions as far as I remember. Not sure what you mean with 'attended date'. Do you mean the time that the student arrived/left? Cheers, Barry",

          "Text": "Hi Ramamoorthy, To have a course's attendance included in the advanced report you need the following: Students enrolled your courses Attendance sessions created Attendance taken. The right combination of filters (to report everything leave everything on 'All') A valid date range set in the filters Also on the advanced report page in the 'Status' filter section, if you select e.g. 'Course 2 - * Present' and 'Course 1' under the Course section you won't get any results. In other words if you drill down that far you have to take it one course at a time because each course has it's own set of statuses in the database (even though they look the same). I have just tried with two courses following all of the above and I get everything on my report (only the sessions where attendance has actually been taken), so I can't reproduce your problem. To find out which files to edit: Browse to the relevant page in your browser and then look in the address bar. The name of the main file will be there. I also use Eclipse to help me find out where functions were defined etc. Saves me lots of trouble. Cheers, Barry",

If you could figure out (by experimenting) what triggers certain courses to be listed and certain courses not listed in the dropdown box I'll be able to fix it. It's not giving me any problems. Maybe write down all the variables of your 20 courses e.g. course start date, session dates, attendance has been taken, students are enrolled, etc. Then see if your list makes sense. From the list then check which courses are not being displayed in the dropdown box. With this info you/I should be able to figure out what's going on. Cheers, Barry",

The regulations for the University require that I take attendance in every lecture (don't ask me why). The class is quite large (~ 500 students). Every lecture, I have teaching assistants (~ 5-10) come in and start taking attendance on pen and paper. This is a nightmare as all those papers have to be recorded electronically somehow. Otherwise, they are useless. My initial plan was to use the Attendance plugin for Moodle on mobile phones of my TA's and have attendance taken. That is not going to work. I am looking for some alternatives. There are some attendance taking apps on Android (most TAs - or almost everyone here, uses Android). Some even claim to export their results in CSV format. Has anyone ever used any app like that to collate attendance and then use the CSV file at the end used as an upload to the Attendance module?",

When a student logs in to her account in her upcoming events in her course which has an attendance activity she will see a notification for every day that attendance needs to be taken. This is not new information for her and certainly not useful. It would be useful to the teacher taking attendance but not to a student. Is there a way that the student does not see the attendance notification but the teacher can? Or worst case no notification need be seen by anybody since the teacher knows that attendance needs to be taken every time there is a class anyway? Thank you once again for an excellent plugin.

Issue:  I wish to create Repeat Sessions over a Semester for the Monday and Thursday series of lectures.  However, in setting up Repeat Sessions it appears to me that only one time period is allowed by default.  If I use the Monday 11am-12 noon time period, I have no option to change this for the Thursday lectures at 9 am. Solution?  Is it possible to have two different time periods included when creating  the Repeat Sessions or must I consider create all repeat sessions using just the Monday time period and manually alter the 13 Thursday sessions to the appropriate time. Many thanks for reading this.",

Teachers cannot give additional time for subsequent entry. It would be good if students are possible to record their attendance even some time after the course.

I got around this by using language customization to change first name to Chinese name, surname to their English nickname . This means a student could be displayed as say 高富帅 John. Within school records, all students have a unique student Id and all ordering on their documents is by ID. Students know their order so a roll call uses this order. However the attendance register uses the nickname ( the renamed surname) for order. This makes it necessary to use a paper record and then transfer instead of hunting up and down a list. I have also created groups within my classes, so  a class may have 3 groups of 18 students. Thankfully the groups follow the student ID order but I still have to check three different groups for each class. Ideally I would like a grouping of my three groups, ordered by student id.  I could then simply open one session, set all to present, read the names from the session, and mark the absences. How could I do this?",

The fix is to make Moodle's usergetdate function (in lib/moodlelib.php) return the same parameter order as php's getdate function. This will require a change to the attendance module. Specifically, the report module will need to be modified to work with the changed usergetdate function. The suggestion from the bug report is to \"access the array using keys like this... $thisdate = usergetdate(time()); echo($thisdate ['mon'] ); Accessing usergetdate in this manner will work with any argument return order and thus work if people have the \"old\" version or new version of moodlelib.php.

Grading works sporadically.   If we set the grade to 10 points at times the grade records in the grade book properly as points out of the percentage of 10.  Other times it gives all 10 points even if a person has attended 1 period out of 20. I know we should go to 2.x and we will, but right now we are on 1.9.   What version should I be on for Moodle 1.9...latest stable?   Who is now in control of this module?     Are there different owners for the Moodle 1.9 and Moodle 2.x Attendance modules? Thank you for your time.",

There is some improved handling for student self-marking in the latest version of the attendance available in github that will allow you to hide various the status values based on timing though. hope that helps!",

I have some same courses, with diferent group (one group for teacher) Can a teacher change the attendance of your group, but not the attendance of another group-teacher? Some teachers, have more what one group in a single course. I have see, what the teachers in the attendance module, have a \"#\" precedent at your name, but when enroll this, the teacher disapear from the left colum, and i can´t add at another group.

          "Text": "Hello All, Is there a way to hide from students the \"User Enrollment starts:\" date so students cannot see it when checking their attendance reports? The reason being is our admin staff manually enrolls all of our students into all courses using a Bulk upload of a CSV file each semester. This bulk  CSV file is frequently reuploaded daily during the first month of a semester into Moodle. The Registrar updates our Student Information System (Separate from Moodle) and our admin staff exports a CSV file from the SIS and then uploads it into moodle almost daily for the first month of a new semester. This is a blanket roster upload across all courses updating whichever students were not in the previously imported CSV file. Reasons can be late registrants to courses or students who are in appeal to be reinstated into our University after being previously dismissed during the previous semester. We have only begun using the Moodle attendance plugin in the last year and did not realize that every time we do a bulk CSV upload into Moodle it changes the Students enrollment date to the last time a CSV bulk upload takes place. Since all of our enrollments are manual and we do not use start or end dates we have no need for the student to see the enrollment start date in the attendance plug-in and it only concerns them when looking at their attendance reports that their enrollment date does not match the date they originally enrolled in the course. This is the method we have used to upload Rosters into courses since the beginning of time when we started using Moodle back in 2010. It is only after implementing the attendance plug-in that we noticed students could now see every time the admin staff did a bulk roster upload as it would change their User enrollment date starts to the last time a bulk upload of users took place. Thanks in Advance for any advice on how to remedy thuis",

For us, each students needs to attend to a number (12) of attendance to get a badge fot this activity. Fot that I set the statuses with 1.67 points for each attendance so the get get 20 points if they attends all of the audioconference. But the way to set the badge is the completion of the attendance activity, completion that is based only on 'The students must recevie a grade in order to complete this activity'. Why not add a completion based on 'The student must pass the grade in order to complete this activity' ? And more, when the student assists at the first attendance, the grade report show that the student receives 20 points for this attendance and the global grade for this activity is 20 points.. For me, receiving 1.7 points should be the good points to display. Is there something I didn't understand or I missed in setting this activity ? Sorry for my English, I'm a french lady. Nadine",

I think the reason that the newest (Artem's version) is not in the plugins database is because he did not choose to put it there.  I don't think anyone else would be comfortable adding it, since that is more appropriately the developers choice.  I had some correspondence with him about it last year, but it appears that he prefers to keep up his github site instead of publishing in the modules database.  His github site is commented, and he has more projects on it than attendance. With respect to Dmitry's version, it still resides in the old plugins and modules database, but as far as I know, is no longer being kept up.  Of course as we move further and further from Moodle 1.8, the less likely it is that people will want to install that particular version.  In our case, we were using a REALLY old version, not wanting some of the extra features he put in later. As far as I can see, the release notes for Moodle 2.3 do not include attendance, so it won't be in core any time soon.  Perhaps you might want to direct message Artem and ask? Perhaps the best way to deal with the docs situation is to find out how to open up a new page that focuses on Moodle 2.x attendance.  In that case, I think the only module would be Artem Andreev's.  Would you be willing to get it started?  We are just now moving to Moodle 2.x, so I haven't had any experience with the new attendance module.  I can ask Helen or Chris Collman about it. atw",

Attendance v2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 is the development of Dmitry version. v2.2 added common and groups sessions and some ui improvements. v2.3 added ability to add multiple attendances in course + some ui additions. v2.4 is module rewriting for Moodle 2.x. 2. New plugins directory has some strictly requirements. I tried to register module in october 2011. I got error with table names. And I don't know how much errors current version of attendance module has. I think it should be a lot of time to meet all the requirements and careful testing in order to avoid regression. Unfortunately, I do not have time and desire to solve all these problems for adding attendance module to the plugins directory. 3. As far as I could understand from the description, this module addresses a slightly different task. 4. I propose to discuss this question in the appropriate forum topic.

There are times that I have absences that are excused and tardies are considered absences.  Just think based on the way this module is organized, it might be easier to program additional categories than showing the comments. The module is great as it is, but in the area of wishes and having applications for the additional categories, I was curious at how difficult it would be to increase the quantities of categories.

          "Text": "Note: This message may appear in multiple forum threads, as I hope it will be of interest to many. Fellow community members, I understand that a Moodle module for attendance is now in late stages of development / testing phases. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a Moodle solution that Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) has developed. For the past 2 academic years MMU Department of Computing and Mathematics (DoCM) has been utilising the Moodle quiz module to monitor the attendance of students known as the Student Monitoring System (SMS). MMU staff understand the need for an attendance monitoring system in order to protect the best interests of the student; not only to ensure the best academic performance possible, but also the pastoral care of students who have for instance, recently moved away from the parental home for the first time. Attempts at MMU for paper registration systems and in-house developed electronic solutions have failed to engage staff due to the commitment required to enter data manually from the capture sheet, nor the student body as it does not offer them any added value. The quiz module has been used in DoCM by setting 2 Moodle quizzes for each day of the academic calendar; AM and PM. The quizzes are Subnet IP restricted, so students must be within the department network range to be able to respond to a quiz. As teaching from within the department is mostly “hands-on” there is no issue of time required for a student to log onto Moodle to respond to the sessions quiz. Students are only expected to respond to 7 quizzes per week, of the possible 10 (Monday - Friday, AM/PM) to show their commitment to the course. In exchange for students engaging in the quizzes, within the feedback of the Moodle quiz a link to the forums is shown. Though like virtually all university courses a forum has been available for many years, since the beginning of this experiment there has been an increase in forum posts of 50 fold, creating a community spirit within each year group. Further to this, students understand the requirement for the University to monitor their attendance and when asked, most students will report that the system shows that the University care about their well being as well as their education.",

A teacher can mark the attendance status of a student as \"Present\", \"Absent\", \"Late\", or \"Excused\". These status descriptions are configurable, and more can be added. The teacher adds Attendance as an activity of a course, and then sets up the sessions whose attendance is to be tracked.

There are three issues (2 minor and one major) They are: #1 (minor) Is there a way to display the dates in the mm/dd/yy format? This is the North American standard, and it is difficult for some to adapt. Its really easy to forget and pick the wrong dates. #2 (minor) Is there a way to change the duration of a class manually? The drop down box for class duration only makes 5 minute increments. But my classes change sometimes at, say, 2:12, and 3:14, etc., and they last 50 minutes. But I think some schools have different durations and class start times that do not fall into neat 5 minute increments. Just allow me to manually enter the exact times for start time and duration and I will be happy! #3 (major) Although I can access the attendance module in section zero (it is invisible so that students can't see it there) and it works fine if I click on it there, when I try to use the \"BLOCK\" version of attendance (to take attendance for example), all I get is a white screen and Moodle hangs. If I go back a screen, I can still use Moodle, but accessing the attendance from a block when the module is installed and working (but invisible) in section zero causes the block to crash.

It contains remarks that I use to evaluate a student on their tardies, or on whether they brought required materials to class. Not being able to see those remarks is irritating. Is there some workaround? Now, as far as what is happening to the block. Well, I installed the version andreev-artem-moodle_blocks_attendance-b0c969a I am running the most current version of moodle (2.3.2) What happens is that I use \"Add A Block\" to put the attendance block on the same page as the course. I then click on the \"Take Attendance\" and all I get is a white screen. It goes nowhere and does nothing. I can go back a page to see the moodle page again, so it doesn't lock things up. It just doesn't function. So tell me, how is it that the Block version of Attendance is \"calling\" the attendance activity? How does it know? Maybe that linkage is missing? I would love to make it work, but as of now, it doesn't.",

But as for remarks, well, I REALLY need to be able to see them in a master report. For example, I write down that students do not have their materials ready when I take attendance. There is a penalty I assess after three times of no materials. But unless I can see those three times in a report, I cannot assess my penalty. I looked in the database , and the remarks are recorded, so wouldn't it be a simple matter to include that field in an output, such as an Excel report?",

I am adding temp users profiles and their attendances by modifying the database . I know that the logic is that you first have to add 'normal user' to table moodle.mdl_user and then temp user to moodle.mdl_attendance_tempusers then add attendance to moodle.mdl_attendace_log. My problem is that I do not see those manually added attendances when I open the session page in my browser. The SQL queries: 1) \n```text\n\"INSERT INTO moodle.mdl_user(auth, confirmed, deleted, email, username, idnumber, mnethostid, lastname) \" \\\n\n\n\"VALUES('manual', 1, 1, %s, %s, 'tempghost', 1, %s);\"\n```\n 2) \n```text\n\"INSERT INTO moodle.mdl_attendance_tempusers(fullname, courseid, email, created, studentid) \" \\\n\n\n\"VALUES(%s, %s, %s, %s, %s);\"\n```\n 3) \n```text\n\"INSERT INTO moodle.mdl_attendance_log(sessionid, studentid, statusid, timetaken, takenby) \" \\\n\n\n\"VALUES(%s, %s, %s, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), %s);\"\n```",

The data for un-enrolled users is still retained within the attendance tables, so it's possible we could improve the attendance reporting to include un-enrolled users, but that would likely require funding for my time to improve the reporting. The longer term aim is to replace some of the reports within attendance with the new Reportbuilder API that is available in moodle 4.0 and higher though - so I'd prefer to see that work completed first before we added further functions to the reports.",

Yes, in the case of the students, with only one instance of the block per course students log in and only see attendance information for the group they belong to. But this doesn't seem to apply to teachers. With only one instance of the block, teachers see one 'general' take attendance block in the side bar or drop down with a list of all the groups in the course (including those groups that they don't teach/belong to) and have to then manually filter to their own group. Perhaps I am going about this the wrong way and there is a way to hide certain group sessions from teachers?",

With debugging turned in, this was the error detail: Debug info: The ntext data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT because it is not comparable. SELECT ats.id, ats.groupid, ats.sessdate, ats.duration, ats.description, al.statusid, al.remarks FROM mdl_attendance_sessions ats RIGHT JOIN mdl_attendance_log al ON ats.id = al.sessionid AND al.studentid = ? WHERE ats.attendanceid = ? AND ats.sessdate >= ? AND ats.sessdate >= ? AND ats.sessdate < ? UNION SELECT ats.id, ats.groupid, ats.sessdate, ats.duration, ats.description, al.statusid, al.remarks FROM mdl_attendance_sessions ats LEFT JOIN mdl_attendance_log al So the issue is with the ntext field attendance_sessions.description being included in the UNION/SELECT DISTINCT, ntext fields are not allowed to be used with these commands.  The ntext field type is deprecated in MS SQL Server 2005+ in favor of nvarchar(MAX). After changing the description field type to nvarchar(MAX), the report page is now working for both teacher and student with existing data.  In brief testing of creating a new session and taking attendance, it also worked correctly.  Our faculty return next week for our Fall quarter, and I should know then if there are any issues after they use it more extensively.",

When I mark my attendance, I do so for my group (class) however the problem is that other teachers cannot mark their attendance as the green button disappears. Now excuse my ignorance, but if the green 'take attendance' button remained an option after I had marked my group - could other teachers not jump in and mark their class too (on the same day). Is it possible to modify code etc to keep the 'take attendance' button as an option? If yes, how would I do this? Cheers",

          "Text": "i found that 9 year before post but not clear I am using latest attendance plugin with moodle 3.3.1 . Any body can tells how to do in latest version of attendance . I want to disable grade in attendance module . There are two solutions here: put the attendance grade item in a category with grade type set to \"None\", then hide the category so users cannot see it. change a few lines of code in the attendance module to prevent it from registering with the gradebook. Let's start with the first method, since it involves no hacks. Whenever I use activity name , replace it with the name you gave to your new attendance activity. When you create a new attendance activity in your course, at the bottom of the form you can choose the grade category. It defaults to \"uncategorised\". Select instead \"New category\". Save your attendance activity Go to Grades -> grader report You will see your attendance activity inside a category called \" activity name \" Next to the \" activity name \" grade item is another called \"Category total\". If not already done, click the button \"Turn editing on\" A little edit icon appears beneath the Category Total heading Click this icon In the \"Grade type\" drop-down menu, select \"None\" Save your changes Hide the activity name category (there should be a little \"eye\" icon under the heading, if not click the \"Hide show/hide icons\" link above the report, it should make the icon appear). This will hide the whole category from students in your course. Now for the second solution: You need to comment out a few lines in two files: In attendances.php, comment out lines 76 and 85 (put // at the beginning) In lib.php, comment out lines 22 and 40 That's it! However, this second solution doesn't solve the grade items already present in your courses set up before you comment out these lines. You will have to use the first solution for these.",

As far as I understand, there is no option to unmark or clear all statuses blank for a particular student so that while calculating the attendance report, this particular session is not included in the total taken sessions for this student. There is no option to uncheck/unmark all statuses as once selected we must have to select at least one from the available status option. Is there any workaround for this where we can clear the status of a particular during taking attendance or while editing? I hope I could clarify myself. I shall be grateful for the support.

The version file does not list a version number, so I don't know what version of this module I have. I do know something is not right about it. All I actually have is an attendance chart. I can manually click on a few options (OK, substituted, excused, - ) but these don't mean anything as they are out of context . According to the language file, there seems to be something about automatic attendance and a lot of other really cool things that seem to be used to configure the module. Unfortunately, I have nothing 'user-side' to configure or update. All I have is ... a chart. I guess what I'm trying to say is something is missing. I have read this entire forum, all the way back to 2004, and honestly, I can't make heads or tails of what is actually available and working. Could someone please direct me to a working version of the Attendance Module (with everything it's supposed to have i.e. blocks, updates, bug fixes, whatever else) for Moodle 1.7 and would someone PLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE be so kind as to put the latest version on the Modules and Plugins page?

          "Text": "It would be very useful to be able to tie conditions in the Attendance module to the Moodle messaging system, to automate notices to students based on attendance data.  For example, to send a pre-defined message to a student if she/he has two absences recorded for the course. From a user interface perspective, I would see a Notifications tab added after the Reports tab in the instructor view of the module.  The Notifications tab would allow an instructor to define notifications for the specific course -> what are the criteria (e.g. number of absences) and what is the message text to be sent out as a notification when a student hits that criterion.  The Notifications tab would allow multiple notifications to be set up for a course, for example, a warning message when a student accumulates 2 absences and a notice of failing the course when 5 absences have accumulated. I initially thought this might have to be a Cron job, but it probably makes more sense to just have it triggered when an instructor submits a session's attendance data.  Submitting attendance data for a class session could cause the module to check to see if any students have hit the criterion for a notification, and send the defined message for that notification out to the student.  The data tables for the module would have to keep track of which students have received which nofications, so that a student with eg, 2 absences only gets the warning notification once, and not every time thereafter that the instructor submits attendance data for later class sessions.",

If you report someone absent on your list, and then that person subsequently gets deleted as a user (from Moodle admin), the attendance report will still report an absence from an unknown person. That is, if you had, say, 14 students in a class, and you took attendance and listed a student as absent, then that student was deleted from Moodle, the attendance report will list 13 present and one absent (total of 14), even though the total number of students in your class is now only 13. This is important because at the beginning of a year especially, when students are enrolling and unenrolling, the list of students you have is constantly changing. Knowing who was absent on any particular day is important for auditing purposes when the administration wants to know who actually showed up in your classes. If the totals are wrong, there is no way of knowing who showed up and who didn't.",

If you installed manually ... are you sure the plugin/addon you are attempting to install is compatible with version of Moodle? Please see: http://docs.moodle.org/25/en/Installing_add-ons note that is for version 2.5 of Moodle. 'spirit of sharing', Ken Ken, thanks for your answer...I believe, you are correct, I had just downloaded the \"Attendance Plugin (just the zip file/folder)\", but never configured it or installed it on the server or system (actually I am not at all tech savy). Now I understand that I should have taken help from the developers, who created the site over a server. What should have happened is that post downloading the plugin (just the zip file/folder), I should have installed/configured it on my system (I think), so that the successful installation message could be seen on the Moodle Site Notification. But, the notification was never shown. I still went to install it, which is when I started getting a blank screen. Please help me out..",

          "Text": "Dear Amitesh, I hope you’re doing well. It’s always a good gesture to share problem, thus engaging in a learning process. Coming straight to your problem: When you download an attendance module zip, in that zip, there’s a file named readme.txt. It provides the detailed instruction of how to install and configure the attendance module. The first requirement of that mod is, as you unzip the plug-in, the folder name should be renamed to \"attforblock\". Then it needs to be copied under the mod folder i.e., your_moodle_folder/mod/attforblock Then from your website you need to follow the site map given below: Home ► Site administration ► Notifications Here the setup is ready and it’ll ask for a confirmation for installation. After successful installation the attendance module is ready to use. Note: - Please make sure you check the version of attendance plug-in and check whether it’s compatible with your Moodle version or not. After performing the above instructed action, if you get a blank screen it means you’ve some error in your site. In that case I’d suggest you to do the following: Please write down the code given below at the end of the file- config.php(path:- your_moodle_folder/config.php) and save it. @error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT); // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! @ini_set('display_errors', '1'); // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! $CFG->debug = (E_ALL | E_STRICT); // === DEBUG_DEVELOPER - NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! $CFG->debugdisplay = 1; // NOT FOR PRODUCTION SERVERS! After performing this instruction, browse the blank screen from your browser and it’ll show the error in your site. Kindly provide us the screenshots of those errors so that we can help further. I hope this’ll be of your help. Please get back to us for further query. Thanks and Regards Purnendu DualCube",

In the module now you can make a remark but I think it also would be nice if the teacher could make a longer written observation of a students performence. If I as a teacher could choose to make a longer notes in a texteditor (and grade it!) it would be nice....",
