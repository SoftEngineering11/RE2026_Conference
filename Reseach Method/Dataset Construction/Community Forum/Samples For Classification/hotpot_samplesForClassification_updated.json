What about if you look at the \"Raw score\" stored by the HotPopt module for that attempt: Course page -> Hot Potatoes quizzes (in \" Activities \" block) -> View reports for xx attempts. That page page also shows that \"Grade\", which the HotPot module passes on to Moodle's main grade calculation subsytem. Can you show us a screenshot of this page, and explain what it is that does not seem right to you. many thanks Gordon",

(I set this to 'No' because the course page becomes much too cluttered if it is set to 'Yes'.) I need students to see the 'Mark as complete' button: a) as a way to demonstrate which activities are mandatory and which are not (the 'Mark as complete' ones are optional); b) to help students remember which optional exercises they have done and which they haven't. How can I make the  'Students can manually mark the activity as completed' setting work? Thank you for your help. Susanna",

Hot Potatoes is a separate program which is available from their website - http://hotpot.uvic.ca/ .  It is Open Source and free in some instances, but take a read through the licensing blurb to see whether or not you qualify. Basically you create Hot Potatoes quizzes on your computer and then they output to and html or a SCORM zip folder.  Both of these can be uploaded into Moodle.  You will not automatically see the Hot Potatoes module in Moodle.  It is part of the standard download , but it needs to be turned on in the Administrator settings>Modules> Activities and make sure that the eye shows as open in the Hide/Show column. Once it is visible, you can add it as a Hot Potatoes Quiz activity into your courses (or SCORM through the SCORM module depending on how you have done your output).  Note that you upload the html file rather than the .jcl etc. files.  There is quite a bit about it on the forums, but feel free to ask again if I haven't been clear.

You can save QuizPort a little bit of work if you don't use both \"<=\" and \">=\" in the post-conditions. For example where you have: >=90%: Skip next quiz <=90%: Next quiz Strictly speaking, the second post-condition should be <= 89%, but actually you only really need the following: >=90%: Skip next quiz Next quiz This is because QuizPort will check the post-conditions in the order you see them listed here, and will act on the first post-condition that is satisfied. You can think of the final condition as a catch-all condition with an implied meaning of \"otherwise do this ...\". This principle makes even more sense if you have more post-conditions. Consider the following example: >=100%: Skip next quiz >=80%: Next quiz >=60%: Same quiz Previous quiz As general principles then, I recommend you use either \">=\" or \"<=\" but not both, and make the final condition a catch-all condition with no score restrictions. all the best Gordon",

When you download the HotPot module from the plugins page on Moodle.org, you get a zip file. You need to to unzip that file and inside you should find a folder called \"hotpot\". Upload that folder and its contents into the \"mod\" folder on your Moodle site, to create a new folder at \"mod/hotpot\". Now go back to page where you found the error before, and this time the message for the HotPot module should say \"to be updated\". Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the \"Continue\" button. The installation/upgrade should then begin. regards Gordon",

This solution is hopefully more robust than the previous functionality. It should not interfere with the HotPot's \"delay3\" setting (= time delay at the end of the quiz). At the same time, it will allow the results to be saved if students navigate away from the page. I tested the new functionality in JCloze, JCross, JMatch, JMix and JQuiz, in all combinations of STOP button, and Delay3, and a number of different output formats. Please be aware that I have not tested yet in Rhubarb and Sequitur. If you could send any feedback on those two type of exercise, with and without STOP button, I would be most grateful. best regards Gordon",

It is very secure and you can easily set things up so that students only get one chance to give an answer. The Hot Potatoes quizzes are not intended to be used as tests. The are more exploratory exercises, which let students experiment and find a correct answers, using what they know and the feedback that they get from wrong answers. Here is a link to a tutorial on how to set up a JQuiz so that it only lets students give one answer: http://hotpot.uvic.ca/howto/maketest.htm You may also like to know that you can import questions from Hot Potatoes quizzes directly into Moodle's standard Quiz module, so you don't have to type in all your questions again. hope that helps!

When I go to edit a chain (for example I want to replace a version of a hot potatoes exercise or an hot potatoes exercise that has an error in it),  I click on \"edit task\". Then I click on the exercise I want to edit, and it takes me to the source (or source folder). I open the folder and click on the exercise I want to replace my existing exercise for. I am then presented with \"set main file\" button and \"update\" button. If I just want to replace one exercise, which should I click on?  I think \"update\" just adds all the files/exercises in the folder-doesn't it? Will \"set main file\", just replace that one exercise then? If so, shouldn't there be another button like \"choose this task/exercise only\"? 2. In quizport, we could re-grade student attempts. This was particularly useful when we had changed the grade policy or some grading conditions. I see, \"delete attempts\", but I don't seem to be able to find \"re-grade\". Thanks as always Robert",

What happened after the end of the last message? Did the browser time out? Did you get an error saying \"maximum execution time exceeded\"? Did you click the browser's \"Stop\" button, \"Back\" button or close the browser window? By the way, why did you have to \"delete the Hotpot directory in order to complete my upgrade\". Did you get an error message on a previous attempt to upgrade? Or did the earlier attempt to upgrade also appear to \"freeze\". There is a strong possibility that the HotPot tables in your Moodle database are currently in an unpredictable state, so it is important to restore the system to a previous \"happy\" state, or find a way to make the upgrade work as soon as possible. From what you have said, I think the update will complete successfully if you give it more time. regards Gordon",

Perhaps you have a backup of the whole Moodle database? We could extract the hotpot tables from that and proceed from there. If you don't have a backup, my best suggestion is to allow me acess to your site so I can check on the state of the hotpot tables and try and repair them if necessary. I would need FTP access to the hotpot directory, and administrator access to your Moodle site. It's a lot to ask, but it would only be for a short time.

Anyway, it seems that the data about attempts was not important to you, in which case emptying the \"hotpot_events\" table was the best way to go. > What causes this to happen? I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that question. The upgrade is supposed to be smooth and hassle free. It looks like you have upgraded now and are moving on, but I would still welcome the opportunity to have a look at your hotpot tables to check things are as they should be. all the best Gordon",

In this thread, you can get to try some of the new technology we've been experimenting with in a proof-of-concept form. We'd like feedback from people at this stage as well. Essentially, Qedoc will be adding two things to the Moodle experience. First, an interface for any quiz/learning activity which offers considerably more than an HTML interface (start by thinking Flash - then continue). Second, an editing interface to match. You can try these right now. We've pretty well got the technology sorted out, although these links are not yet connected up to the Moodle database . Just click on the URL 's and see what happens - it may take a while for the initial load, so be patient. Please post your thoughts and questions afterwards.

          "Text": "Dear HotPot Moodlers, QuizPort Moodlers, please welcome the Qedoc Moodlers! James and I have been working feverishly away at the QuizPort - Qedoc collaboration and we have to the point where you can add your Qedoc module to Moodle as QuizPort activity, run the Qedoc module through the Qedoc player and the results will be returned to Moodle where QuizPort will store them in the database, ready to be displayed later in results and reports. To try the new functionality, you will need a Qedoc user id (available free from qedoc.org) and then you will need the latest version of QuizPort: QuizPort module for Moodle 1.0 - 1.9 You will notice form the above link that QuizPort is now compatible with all Moodles back to the earliest publicly available version. This has been achieved by \"smartening up\" the API of the earlier Moodles, rather than \"dumbing down\" the functionality of QuizPort. The result is that you can enjoy all the subtle finery of QuizPort whatever version of Moodle you are running. This will be particular appealing to administrators of heavily customized Moodle sites who dread the thought of upgrading to a new version of Moodle and re-doing all their customizations. You don't need to upgrade to install QuizPort. You can run it just as you are. In addition, developers of educational authoring software such as Hot Potatoes and Qedoc are offered a stable and consistent API to which their software can interface via QuizPort to Moodle. This was my dream 2 years ago and I am very excited to see it coming to fruition. BTW , QuizPort will work with Moodle 2.0 as soon as I get my head round the new way of storing files. best regards to all Gordon",

They're wonderful for that. If this is not what you want, try Mary's suggestion or mine. Both our suggestions mean that images, audio and video files can be included. The Book activity is very easy to learn to use (much simpler than Hot Potatoes itself and the HotPot and TaskChain modules) but actually integrating each Hot Potatoes exercise is quite time consuming if you want a specific link to each exercise.

I'm creating long chains of single-item JClozes that are configured to output in the FindIt(b) format. In these items, students must study a given sentence and then, using a dictionary embedded in the page, identify an error of grammatical collocation (obviously by clicking on it) and then fix it using information from the dictionary. For research purposes I'm using a time limit with each item and allowing students only a single attempt. Here's the problem: sometimes students get hung up researching the dictionary and if time runs out before they've clicked on anything, the QuizPort hangs. Clicking on the Check or Hint buttons won't do anything and there's no OK button to click. The only option is to leave the page, and they've got no more quiz attempts. This happens with every browser I've tested. Any ideas how to fix it? Best, Jim",

If at this point students click in the exercise or press Check or Hint and then try to refresh, they go directly to the \"Quiz Attempt Not in Progress\" page. If instead they don't click in the exercise at all but refresh directly, they get a second crack at the item and then, if they get the answer right, it goes to the \"Quiz Attempt Not in Progress\" page. In either case, resuming the QuizPort from that point is not intuitive. Refreshing the page does nothing. Students have to go back to the main course page in order to get going again or else click on the QuizPort title in the breadcrumb navigation.

How many students are logging in at once? How are you hosting Moodle? On a remote commercial server, or locally on one of the lab computers? Will a Hot Potatoes quiz work to completion if you copy the htm file to the hard drive of a lab computer and run it from there, independently of Moodle?

You are welcome to put some of the quizzes on my server and then during class ask your students to access them all at once from there. Put the same quizzes on your own server and then ask your students to access them there. That will help you identify or eliminate the server as the cause of the problem. If you would like to do this, let me know how many students you want to do the trial and I will set up some temporary student accounts on my server. Other tests you could try are to do different kinds of Hot Potatoes exercise and see which ones fail. Also try exercises with very few questions, and others with very many questions. you could also try varying the number of images and sound files in the quiz to see of that affects the performance of the quiz. You could also try limiting the students taking the quiz to half (or a third or a quarter) of your class and see if that helps. While some students are taking the quiz, the others can be working on a different activity, so that as far as the students are concerned there is no idle time. That browser that you use may also be a factor. Try different browsers (IE7, Firefox , Safari) and compare the behavior. Finally, could you describe the symptoms of the \"crash\" in more detail. Do you mean the server crashes or the student's computer crashes. If we are talking about the student's computer, does the browser close without warning? freeze? display an error? display a white page? perhaps the whole machine freezes and you can only proceed by rebooting it? thanks Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, Facts and justification for migration to SWFObject. So far Moodle up to v1.9 has used ufo javascript for the media plugins to embed flash content through JW's mediaplayer. (There are other Moodle plugins which use the JW mediaplayer too) ufo and swfobject 'married' and gave swffix, later renamed back to SWFObject2 to offer the ultimate and best embedding of flash content. JW mediaplayer uses SWFObject to dynamically embed flv. JW mediaplayer can 'do' mp3, mp4, swf, images, flv and other video formats, xml playlists;html5 support, skins, colours, and basically it's the best out there. If HotPot is to live in the core of Moodle 2, and Moodle 2 is to implement SWFObject 2 for the media plugins, then HotPot can use SWFObject too, eliminating redundancy and complying with the latest and best in the dev. Currently, on my Moodle 1.9, If I have SWFObject2.2.js in a hotpotatoes exercises via QuizPort or HotPot, I also get the ufo.js. Consequently, both scripts start fighting which one to display the flash and I end up with no player. if the above is to happen after a migration, there'll be swfobject.js referenced twice resulting in duplication but giving no error and still displaying the flash content. I solve my problem currently by using neither HotPot nor Quizport but display a simple 'Resource'. Or I use the squarebrackets notation and trick them into using my JW mediaplayer, asuming its dewplayer or another one, but getting only the basic JW mediaplayer. If you decide to migrate from ufo to swfobject, you can use the core Moodle URL re-write routines; and you can include JW mediaplayer in the square bracket notation. (I believe someone will get down to writing the Help/Documentation for the squarebrackets notation for new users.) We can also improve the square brackets notation to include background colours and other enhancements for the JW mediaplayer. What do you think? Stan",

          "Text": "Can anybody tell me what the effect of the 'Give up' button is? Actually, this is the option I've been choosing for my HP quizzes for quite a while. My assumption was that it allowed students to give up the exercise without being penalized and they could resume it at a later time. By default I also choose the option 'first attempt' as 'grading method'. The reason being that I'm interested in seeing where the students weaknesses are. Recently I'm receiving messages from students that complain that they have used the 'give up' button to exit the exercise and that even though they have returned later and completed the quiz, they are getting scores of 0. Is the the combination I'm choosing ('give up' + 'first attempt') responsible for these results? I would have expected that the 'first attempt' option would record the scores for the first attempt when the quiz is retaken again (after having given up). But this doesn't seem to be what is happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Josep M.",

If a student clicks the Give Up button, then that is the end of that attempt at the HotPot activity. In the current HotPot module, they cannot resume an attempt, but they may be able take several attempts. Depending on the \"Number of attempts\" setting for that HotPot, it may be possible for the student to start another attempt. However, if you have set the number of attempts to one, then I would think that the students cannot start another attempt. In other words, once your students press the Give Up button on your HotPot activities , that is the end of of the quiz for them.",

It assumed the audio URL would be the last part of the url specified in the <param name=\"movie\" ...> tag. Unfortunately, this is the wrong place to look in your quizzes. After some thought, I decided to make the software look for one of the following named arguments in the query string of url: file source thesound mp3 I confirmed that this allows the correct transformation of relative URLs to absolute URLs in your quizzes.

If it doesn't work on my server, then I wold be grateful if you could leave the quiz there for me to investigate. By the way, did you know that a quick way to add many Hot Potatoes quizzes to Moodle 1.6 (or Moodle 1.5 with v2.1 of the HotPt module) is to put the quizzes in a single folder in the \"Files\" area for you Moodle course, then add a \"Hot Potatoes quiz\" activity and specify just the folder name in the file name. The HotPot module will then ALL the quizzes in the folder - one HotPot activity for each Hot Potatoes quiz. all the best Gordon",

The important point about Matt's new player is that allows the teacher to control how many times the audio is played in each attempt at the quiz. It answers the call I sometimes get from teachers who wish the students to be allowed to listen to the audio only once. You can find out more about the player here: http://code.google.com/p/moodle-mp3-player-for-tests/ You can insert it into a QuizPort quiz as follows: [audio.mp3 matbury] The default settings for the quiz will load the audio file and wait for the student to click the start button before playing. You can also have the audio file play back immediately and automatically using the following settings: [audio.mp3 matbury showPlay=false waitToPlay=false] As always the QuizPort module can be downloaded from my server : QuizPort module for Moodle 1.0 - 1.9 all the best Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi, Thanks in advance to any help/ideas that may be offered. I've recently upgraded to Moodle 1.3.4 and added Tom's latest hotpot module (1.3.5?). Seems to be working okay, at least when adding hotpotatoes ex's using Netscape, (as IE gives 'HTML area is undefined\" javascript error in the Add hotpot ex. screen). The problem/challenge is that the student scores for completed exercises (using IE) are showing up as zero, not their proper scores. (Grades do not seem to be recorded at all using Netscape, which doesn't really matter, as students will be using IE.) I had Moodle 1.1.1 and the hotpot 1.2 mod working fine since last March. Perhaps the upgrade may not have been such a good idea, as the course goes live for about 180 students next week. I suspect the grading issue is something minor, but I'm quickly running out of possible solutions. Any ideas? Thanks again, Jim",

One of the teachers have a Hotpot activity with an image and audio file (m4a) in the title. (I can only see the htm file. References to files are  within the tag: <h2 class=\"ExerciseTitle\"></h2>) If I add a new Hotpot activity with those files, the result is that the image and the audio are not displayed. I've also checked the HTML tags with the tools of the browser and it seems that these code lines have dissapeared. However, when I make a backup of the activity (from another installation of Moodle to my test installation), both files are displayed without problem. Any idea what's going on? Maybe I missed some configuration parameter? Thanks in advance, Maria PD: because of the size of files I can't attach them to the forum. In the following link you can see the files I've used to create the activity (hotpot-day of dead.zip) and the backup of the original activity. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xxrdqe1p9tssuhq/AACU9ZOpi4j0Qup5vwhndDNNa?dl=0",

Within the lesson editing structure, I am given the options to: Add a content page Add a question Add a cluster None of these options from what I can see enable me to add in my Jcloze activity. The closest work-around I have found is to save the Jcloze at a .htm file, then open that file in a text editor (notepad), then copy/paste that html code in a content page using the html editing function. But, if I do that, the question loses the functionality of checking answers and marking complete etc. Does anyone have a solution for this?",

I noticed that one of the Michael Rottmeier's hot potatoes tweaks \"Find-it a\" does not behave as it should when in moodle. 1. bold text instructions bracketed by <b> </b> does not show as bold text. 2. The little hovering hand does not show over all of the words / symbols in a sentence. ( a student will soon figure out where to click on the correct point). Outside the moodle environment the exercise works as it should. I tried to upload to your test site but keep getting error messages. I have attached the files, if that helps... Cheers Robert",

In other words, this is a new type of Find It (A) activity that you are trying out in Moodle - is that right? The difficulty is that in Moodle, TaskChain doesn't consider individual punctuation marks to be a \"word\". If you changed the individual pucntuation marks to a string of letter, e.g. \"HERE\" or \"XXX\", then I think the exercise will be have as you expect.

First there is an error. Then, when trying to report the initial error, the server has a further error in SSI. Therefore, to get the full story, you need to look in the server logs. If you are using Apache as your web server, then there should be an error log which will tell you what is causing the \"an error occurred while processing this directive\". It may also be useful to try enabling Moodle debugging: Administration -> Site administration -> Development -> Debugging Debug message: DEVELOPER Display debug messages: (check this box) You said that the hosting support desk told you that following lines are causing the error: RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^ www.epikinonia.org $ RewriteRule ^/?$ &quot;http\\:\\/\\/www\\.google\\.com\\/a\\/epikinonia\\.org&quot; [R=301,L] The second line doesn't look right to me.

          "Text": "Hi Nicola, thank you for giving me access to you Moodle site. I tried the \"Articles\" HotPot, as a student - you can see my score of 100% was correctly recorded. I tried the HotPot again and this time I answered a few questions, clicked the check button, and got a a message saying my score so far was 7% but that there were still unanswered questions. Then I deliberately clicked on the link at the top of the page to go back to the course page. I got the message asking whether to stay on the page or navigate away. I chose to navigate away. When I went back to look at my score for that attempt, it was 0% - not 7% as I might have hoped. From this, I would say that it seems that the score is not recorded if you navigate away from the quiz before completing all the questions. You do not need to answer every question correctly first time, but any questions you do not answer correctly, you need to keep going until you do answer each question correctly. This is the way HotPots work. The HotPot is only finished when all questions have been answered correctly. Only then are the results sent back to the server. In the past, it was possible for the browser to send the results so far if the student tries to navigate away from the page before the HotPot was completed. Perhaps this functionality is broken now on some or all browsers. We could that that more. However, I am pretty sure that if users complete the quiz, i.e. keep going until they find the correct answers to all the questions, then the grade will be recorded. regards Gordon",

This is logical for what are intended to be learning exercises, not tests. I also found it helped in JQuiz for students to get a \"smiley\" when clicking on the final choice (by default the question mark remains). Students don't get a score, but they are sure that they've found the correct answer. If they look over the finished exercise and note the correct answers they should see a pattern - if the exerecise has been designed for that. I never managed to convince Martin Holmes of my logic, but he showed me how to do it anyway: In jquiz6.js_ Find: //Show the feedback ShowMessage(Feedback); // New for 6.2.2.1: If you want to mark an answer as correct even when it's the final choice, uncomment this line. // if (I[QNum][3][ANum][2] >= 1){Btn.innerHTML = CorrectIndicator;}else{Btn.innerHTML = IncorrectIndicator;} return; } Change to: //Show the feedback ShowMessage(Feedback); //New for 6.2.2.1: If you want to mark an answer as correct even when it's the final choice, uncomment this line. if (I[QNum][3][ANum][2] >= 1){Btn.innerHTML = CorrectIndicator;}else{Btn.innerHTML = IncorrectIndicator;} return; } HTH , Glenys",

I have tried the quizzes in Explorer 10 and the latest Chrome and made sure to answer all the questions correctly.  When I did this, it allowed me to exit the quiz and the grade was recorded. However, in some cases (for example listening gapfills where they have to fill in the missing words), some students just cannot get all the answers right.  It seems really unfair that they can't get any score at all just because they can't answer everything correctly.  In the past, this wasn't the case. Also, this only affects some students who are using certain browsers, it seems. Firefox and earlier versions of Explorer (and Chrome?) don't seem to do this. It is also rather misleading, as the browser warning message in Chrome says \"Confirm Navigation - Your results so far will be saved and you can redo \"XXX\" later.  Are you sure you want to leave the page?\" Now I know the problem, I can work around it by getting them to send me a screenshot of the top of the screen showing the score if they can't answer everything correctly (and then manually entering the grade), and/or by putting in a hint button on the quiz. However, it would be great if this could ultimately be fixed so that students aren't obliged to enter everything correctly just to get a score. Many thanks, Nicola",

This allows the student who is completely off track to find the correct answer when s/he is required to fill a gap by transforming the gap-fill question into a multiple choice question. This is less frustrating for the student, avoids the 'hint' button which you may not want to use and will allow the student to know the right answer straight away, which is why HotPot is so useful. The number of attempts to fill the gap before the multiple-choice question appears can be adjusted if you don't want to make the task too easy. Of course, this only applies to JQuiz, not JCloze.

Indeed, that is precisely why I programmed the HotPot, QuizPort and TaskChain modules to try and save the intermediate results if the Moodle user navigates away from a HP exercise before al the correct answers have been found.

This is to prevent malicious scripts from trying to block a user's attempt to close a window. As you have found, some browsers (e.g. FF 23 for Mac) will allow the intermediate results to be sent, but others (e.g. Chrome 29 for Mac) will not. I am grateful for you bringing this issue to my attention, and I have added it to my list of things to investigate when I have time. I don't think I can sort it out soon, but I will get to it at some point, and see if there is solution to be found. best regards Gordon",

As we discovered, the issue is confined to the most recent versions of certain browsers, notably Chrome and possibly IE too. It appears that these browsers no longer detect, or refuse to act on, a user navigating away from a page. My understanding is that this is to prevent malicious pages trying to trap you in a page. You will be pleased to know that I have been able to find a workaround that I have tested in most recent versions of Chrome and Firefox for Mac.

I have successfully installed and used the software on Windows 7 and 8.1. Answer 2: You can export the Hot Potatoes exercises straight to a SCORM-compliant file, which you can then add to administer using Moodle's SCORM module",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon A couple of students have come up to me and said that find it inconvenient not to be able to access quizports they have not attempted via their gradebook. When they try to do this they get the message \"No results found for this report\". And of course they must go back to the course page to continue. (Personally, I don't see it being that big a problem, but students did say that when hotpotatoes was used last year, they could access the hotpotatoes that they had not attempted via their gradebooks). My guess is that students are doing a quizport, then checking the gradebook and from their they want to go directly to the next/ unattempted quizport. Other moodle activites such as quiz allows them to access via the gradebook, they say. Is there a setting that will allow students to do what they want to do? Cheers Robert",

I go through the procedure of importing just qp6. When I go to sub-category (2) to view the imported qp6, I can see qp6 on the course page, but the associated files did not import. I am using \"weekly tab format\" in these courses. I tried importing, doing the same procedure as above but this time import from sub-category (1) to another separate course. QP6 imported successfully, but I find that all qp1-qp6 files have been imported as well. ( I only specified to import qp6). Changing the type of format does not appear to fix this phenomena. I am using moodle 1.9.11. Any help appreciated Cheers Robert",

Looks like the restoration of files is not granular, so you either get *all* the course files from the source course, or none of them. In your case, I guess that you would be best selecting \"No\" course files, and then transfer the files manually yourself after the import of the QuizPort activity is complete. regards Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, Is there some way to get quizport to ignore any abandoned attempts of any exercise/ activity in a quizport? The reason I am asking is that when the setting \"average score\" is used, I have noticed that some students will often open an exercise, and then for whatever reason, immediately abandon it. If the settings are set to \"average score\", then abandoned attempts are almost always treated as \"0\" score, so any subsequent attempts at an exercise, will be calculated against that \"0\". (So , for example, even if on a subsequent attempt a student gets 100%, only \"50%\" will get recorded in the gradebook). Does a setting tab in quizport \" ignore abandoned attempts\" exist or would it be possible to add such setting tab? (I know that a teacher can delete abandoned attemtpts manually, but having this done automatically by quizport would save a lot time and energy- for me at least!) Cheers Robert",

But I think there is something else, because since version 46, we cannot use HP 6 files with html format. The source type is incorrectly identified: instead of type hp_6_jcloze_xml (or whatever) in database is set to type html . In version 44, this doesn't happen. By the way, if I change the sourcetype field in database, it behaves correctly, so I guess it is just a matter of identifying the file format. In the commit for version 46 , I have seen that the functions sourcetypes() , now return an array that includes HP7 format ( array('hp_6_jcloze_xml', 'hp_7_jcloze_xml') ). And that happens in files that are under the directory attempt/hp/6/ . I don't know if it is correct or not, but it sounds strange for me. Best wishes, Toni",

It seems we have to delve into the server files to manually fix this. Rgrds, Paul.",

There error says that the user does not have permission , so I suggest you start by checking what role the user who got the message was using when the message appeared. Then check the site role definitions (Settings -> Site administration -> Users -> Permissions -> Define roles). Find the role you are interested in and click the \"Edit\" button. Locate the setting for the \"mod/hotpot:attempt\" capability, and set it to \"Allow\". If that was already set to \"Allow\" then, you'll need to check the Course user permissions in the same way and check that there are no permission overrides. You can do all of this via the standard Moodle interface. There is no need to \"delve into the server files\". Please let us know if checking/changing the permissions resolves the issue for you.

Both sites are the same version of Moodle in the same server with the same version of hotpot, upgraded on the same day. I received no errors while upgrading. How is it possible that all those permissions simply vanished? (And how do I get them back?)

Creating HotPot activities automatically from questions in the Moodle question bank, which I think is what your question is asking about, is theoretically possible, but neither the HotPot module nor the Moodle Quiz module currently offer that functionality. Therefore, to get started, I suggest you download Hot Potatoes to your PC and create a few Hot Potatoes quizzes there.

I can upload them to moodle directly from the software. The problem is not using them in Moodle, but rather using them in in HotPot, because it will only accept quizzes that were made using Hot Potatoes. My goal is that when a student finishes a quiz, they are presented with the correct feedback, and then instead of the \"re-attempt quiz\" button, they are present with a button or hyperlink to the next activity (A lesson or another exam). When I said \"link a quiz to the next lesson\" I meant that there was some kind of button or hyperlink that took the student directly to the next activity instead of having to navigate back to the course overview page. I'm using conditional activities to restrict access to the next activity until the previous activity is marked complete (lesson) or complete with a pass grade (quiz). I hope that makes it more clear.

Currently you can only link from the end of a lesson to another activity.  It would be nice to be able to link from the middle of an activity to something else and then have a link from that activity that brings you back into the lesson.  I realize this is far from simple.  The reason I think this would be useful is that I've struggled with the limitations of the questions within lessons compared with what can be done with them in the quiz activity (just as a simple example, you can do cloze type questions in a quiz, but not in a lesson).  Also, there are lots of powerful plugins for the quiz activities, which I'm only starting to explore, but seemingly no plugins for lessons.  So it would be nice to be able to get access to the flexibility of the quizzes from within the structure of a lesson.",

The square brackets notation only works with QuizPort, which is not yet part of standard Moodle, but hopefully it will take over from HotPot in Moodle 2.0. In the meantime, QuizPort works well with Moodle 1.6 - 1.9 as a non-standard module, so please feel free to download it and try it out . One of the many things that QuizPort does better than the HotPot module, is that it let's you insert media players using just a file name in square brackets. For example, if the media file is an mp3 file in the same folder as the quiz folder, you could use any of the following to insert a media player:",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, First of all I'd like to apologize for taking so long in acknowledging and thanking you for your response. I posted my message because of an emergency at a very busy moment in our quarter. I managed to solve the problem by linking directly to the Moodle Flash video player but I completely forgot to respond the message and thank you. Sorry about that. Now that things have calmed down a little bit I can devote a little time to this subject. This is good news. I had not been following the Moodle forums for quite a while and I didn't know that you had developed what looks like a completely new module. I will have a look at it as soon as I can. The problem is that now that we have Moodle as the official LMS in our university most of my colleagues won't be able to use your new module for a long time since the IT people are very reluctant to install non-standard modules. Although I have my courses on a different Moodle installed on a different server and hence I will be able to take advantage of your new module, I like to help my colleagues to solve their problems in the official Moodle as they cannot always find the support they need. So here's my question. With HotPot module is it possible to use some Flash player other than the one that comes with Moodle? As I said, I found a way to make it work by adding the following code: <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" data=\"/ whatever_your_Moodle_is /filter/mediaplugin/flvplayer.swf?file=savingenergy.flv&autoStart=false\"> For some colleagues, this creates problems because they have old Hot Potatoes exercises that they have used in other Moodle installations and they are intimidated by the code. They'd like a system where they would simply have to unzip a folder with all the necessary files and simply link to the Hot Potatoe file when creating the activity. Is this possible at all? I mean, can one use some player other than the one living in the Moodle /mediaplugin folder?",

It does everything the HotPot module does yet it is more efficient, flexible and robust, and furthermore it has a lot of functionality and potential that the HotPot module does not have. Most importantly, it does all this in a sustainable way, that is to say it is compliant with the programming standards of Moodle 2.0 and can probably support itself financially into the future while at the same time continuing to have an open source core. You are welcome to download the QuizPort module and experiment with it: QuizPort module for Moodle 1.4 - 1.9 Or you can use the access information for my server (see above) and try out the QuizPort module there. all the best Gordon",

As a result it doesn't work either when run from the Files area of a Moodle course, or via the HotPot module. As a workaround, you need to use an absolute URL that does not go via file.php. You could put the player outside of Moodle, e.g. http://mywebsite.com/flvplayer.swf . Alternatively, you could use the url of the flv player that is included in Moodle, e.g. http://mywebsite.com/moodle/filter/mediaplugin/flvplayer.swf . Whichever one you choose, you then need to replace all occurrences of that player in the quizzes with the absolute url. The is also a workaround which will force the HotPot module to insert the standard Moodle flv player, and that is to replace all occurrences of the \"flvplayer.swf\" with \"flvplayer.xxx\". This will make the HotPot module ignore the url for the player and instead pick up the url of the flv file and insert the standard Moodle player for that. For a similar reason, you could replace all your players with something like the following: <object ><a href=\"myvideo.flv\">any text</a></object> The space after in the opening <object > tag is required. Any of these workarounds require that you set the \"Force media plugins\" to \"Yes\". Finally, you may decide to forget about flvplayer.swf and use the FlowPlayer that Glenys suggested. Here is the code if you want to use that: <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"FlowPlayer.swf\" width=\"320\" height=\"280\" id=\"FlowPlayer\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"FlowPlayer.swf\" /> <param name=\"autoPlay\" value=\"false\" /> <param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /> <param name=\"scale\" value=\"noScale\" /> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /> <param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"config={videoFile: ' myvideo.flv '}\" /> </object> all the best Gordon",

I think that I'll use Hot Potatoes to make Matching activities and quizzes that ask students to identify certain sounds in English, and then use the Masher to create web pages that contain an online voice recorder which asks students to create sound files relevant to the exercises. So students will first be asked to identify, and then produce, certain sound patterns in English. I guess for me, the most exciting thing (in the world) would be a Hot Potatoes activity that elicits an audio response from a student.",

Basically, I wanted to write an interesting introduction to a hot potatoes cloze activity. So far so good, it's written and ready. I used the \"Lessons\" activity and made a slideshow using Powerpoint, which I have now uploaded. It is sitting there nicely (all working fine) as a branch table waiting for the 'piece de resistance' my hot pot cloze reading. However try as I might, I just cant seem to work out how to get the \"Next\" button in my lesson to link straight to the Hot Pot activity. Is it possible? Talking of which I'd very much like for the students to continue on after the Hot Pot activity to a discussion forum. Could I create a lesson question page to offer them the chance of entering the forum too, or do they have to go back to the main \"topics\" page and manually choose to enter the forum? I'm really sorry if this is an elementary Moodle question, I'm still a bit of a newb I'm afraid!",

          "Text": "Thank you for uploading your quiz. I see you are using a custom format for the titles in your Find(a) quiz. The \"Title\" is intended as the text to display at the top of the quiz and in the list of quizzes in a QuizPort unit, so by putting a mediaplayer in there you are going against the grain of the design of the software. You will have an easier time, if you use the \"Title\" field for just text, and put the audio files into either the quiz subtitle, JCloze -> Options -> Configure Output -> Titles/Instructions, or the reading. To this end, I respectfully make the following suggestions: In the \"intro_to_grammar.htm\" file, locate the following code: \n```text\n<!-- BeginTopNavButtons -->\n\n\n\n\n<table cellpadding=\"0px\" border=\"0px\" cellspacing=\"0px\" style=\"width:100%\">\n\n\n<colgroup span=\"1\" width=\"15%\">\n\n\n<colgroup span=\"1\" width=\"70%\">\n\n\n<colgroup span=\"1\" width=\"15%\"></colgroup>\n\n\n<tr>\n\n\n <td style=\"margin-bottom:0px\"> \n\n\n <img src=\"logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></td>\n\n\n <td align=\"center\"><h2 class=\"ExerciseTitle\"> Introduction to grammar. <object ...> ... </object></h4> </h2></td>\n\n\n \n\n\n</tr>\n\n\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- EndTopNavButtons -->\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Titles\">\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n```\n And change it to this: \n```text\n<div class=\"Titles\">\n\n\n<table cellpadding=\"0px\" border=\"0px\" cellspacing=\"0px\" width=\"100%\">\n\n\n <tr>\n\n\n <td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\"><img src=\"logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo.jpg\" /></td>\n\n\n <td align=\"center\"><h2 class=\"ExerciseTitle\"> Introduction to grammar.</h2></td>\n\n\n </tr>\n\n\n <tr>\n\n\n <td align=\"center\"><h3 class=\"ExerciseSubtitle\">\n\n\n <object ... > ... </object></h3></td>\n\n\n </tr>\n\n\n</table>\n\n\n</div>\n```\n More fundamentally, I suggest you change the layout of the titles in the *templates* which produce your quizzes, to the following: \n```text\n<div class=\"Titles\">\n\n\n<table cellpadding=\"0px\" border=\"0px\" cellspacing=\"0px\" width=\"100%\">\n\n\n <tr>\n\n\n <td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\"><img src=\"logo.jpg\" alt=\"logo.jpg\" /></td>\n\n\n <td align=\"center\"><h2 class=\"ExerciseTitle\">[strExerciseTitle]</h2></td>\n\n\n </tr>\n\n\n <tr>\n\n\n <td align=\"center\"><h3 class=\"ExerciseSubtitle\">[strExerciseSubtitle]</h3></td>\n\n\n </tr>\n\n\n</table>\n\n\n</div>\n```\n Then put your mp3 player in the \"subtitle\" of the quiz and keep the titles containing only text.

You can makes those HotPots act something like a chain if you do the following: on the course page hide all except the first HotPot for all except the last HotPot, click on the edit icon and then set \"Show next quiz\" to \"Yes\" It is laborious to do this after you have added the HotPots, but there is a faster way if you use do the following when you add the HotPots put all the Hot Potatoes quizzes into the same subfolder in the \"files\" are for your Moodle course e.g. myhotpots if necessary, switch the Moodle course page into Edit Mode in the section of the Moodle course where you want to add the HotPot activity, select \"Hot Potatoes Quiz\" from the \"Add an activity ...\" drop down menu on the \"Adding a Hot Potatoes Quiz\" page .... put the folder name in the \"File name\" text box e.g. myhotpots set \"Add quiz chain\" to \"Yes\" set \"Show next quiz\" to \"Yes\" check the other settings are those that you wish to apply to all the HotPots in the chain click the \"Save changes\" button at the bottom of the screen The QuizPort module, which is the successor to the HotPot module, allows you to group the HP quizzes into a single unit of quizzes, which you can manipulate much more easily as a single entity. However, probably the HotPot module will be adequate for you to get going.",

I need to install the module urgently as I have prepared some assignments in Hot Potatoes for one of my courses and I need to post them in time for students to be able to complete them. I have Moodle 1.4. Is the version of the HotPot module that can be downloaded from moodle.org incompatible with version 1.4? If this is not the problem, what is the problem then? As I said, I think I have done everything properly: copy the folder HotPot (which results from unzipping the dowloaded file) within the 'mod' folder in my Moodle installation. However, the module is invisible when I access my Moodle as administrator. This happens both in my local installation of Moodle and in the one in the server . I would really, really appreciate it if someone could lend me a hand with this.",

Actually, \"Unseen quiz\", \"Unanswered quiz\", \"Incorrectly answered quiz\" all select randomly from the quizzes in the unit, but in addition the pick out unseen, unanswered or incorrectly answered quizzes respectively. I think you want \"Unseen\". > Is it also possible to have, for example, > 10 questions and QuizPort use only 5 of them? No and yes. No, quizport won't let you do five randomly selected quizzes and then regard the unit as finished. Yes, you can put banks of questions into a single JMatch or JQuiz and then use the setting on those quizzes to randomly select a finite number of questions from within the quiz. Unfortunately, JCross, JMix and JCloze only have one \"question\" per file, so you can't do randomization with those kinds of quizzes. regards Gordon",

          "Text": "There seems to be a problem on your server . It cannot send \"204\" headers. What I mean is this. When you click a button in a HotPot quiz, the results so far are collected up and sent back from the browser to Moodle. Moodle stores the results and then checks the status of the quiz. If the status is \"completed\" or \"abadoned\" or \"timed out\", then Moodle will return to the course page (not the site page). However, if the status is \"in progress\", Moodle sends a \"204\" header to the browser, which tells the browser to do nothing i.e. continue the quiz. In your case, I think the \"204\" is not sent, or is sent with an error. For this reason, I don't think any HotPots have ever worked on your server. Does that sound right? Please check your server (= Apache ?) logs to see if it reports more information on the cause of the problem. Alternatively, please contact your hosting company's support desk to ask them if they can shed any light on what happened to the \"204\" header that \"mod/hotpot/attempt.php\" is trying to send. You can check for yourself that the quiz should work with Moodle by running it on my server: URL : http://bateson.kanazawa-gu.ac.jp/moodle/18/ms/ Course: Course Fullname 101 username: guestteacher password: hotpotv23",

          "Text": "Hi there, In the past, I've felt in control by having each of my Hot Pot exercises in a folder along with all its related files: audio, video, images.... The links from the Hot Pot exo to the media files were all relative . I've been able to easily move these folders around from one server to another, to display the exo on Moodle or elsewhere, through the HotPot module, or QuizPort or Book. All the links worked everywhere. Now I gather, I should be doing things differently by using a repository, or maybe several repositories. I've already been doing this with my Flash videos: I've uploaded them to YouTube and inserted them from there with an absolute link. That's been fine - I have relatively few videos - and YouTube seems likely to be around for a long time. However, I've got far more images and sound files and I'm not sure how to manage them elegantly, easily and not to have to redo all the links in the foreseeable future. I've tried to display my Hot Pot exercises in Book on Moodle 2.4 and none of the media files appeared (they did in TaskChain). I'm experimenting with Stan's suggestion for using the JW Player for displaying a playlist in a Hot Potatoes exo. There too the playlist code requires an absolute link. There are so many repositories ( Moodle doc Repositories lists 13) I've no idea which one(s) to choose. What have other people done? What suggestions do you have - in particular as regards future proofing? Cheers, Glenys",

          "Text": "Hi Glenys, there seem to be too issues to address in your post: should we use relative or absolute links in files? if you are using the HotPot or TaskChain module you can stick with relative links. If you use the Book module, you will need convert the links to absolute links. Note that you may be able to do this automatically if you insert some additional Javascipt into the HotPot exercises, something akin to what we did for Claude: Moo dle Ho tPo t for um: embedding one hotpot in another and moodle 2.3 what kind of repository should we use? You can most easily share files between activities and courses if you use a \"File system\" repository. Basically this allows you to store you files on your server's hard disk and then Moodle has access to these files. If you are using Moodle 2.3 or later, you can add those files within Moodle activities resources as an \"alias\" or \"shortcut\". This means that changes to the file on the hard disk should be reflected in the activities and resources that are linked to the file. Philippe has reported that this linking does not work 100% satisfactorily, and I also have had mixed success in the past, but this SHOULD be the best way to share files if it works as advertised.

That would help since the website might be advertised in similar gov programs nationally here. Since there is a steep learning curve for me to make more out of the potential Moodle and these apps have stored in them, it would help me out greatly if I could easily convert the already-produced HotPot material into iSpring --- and get it connected to Moodle's quiz analytical processes...",

If we use our server, result analysis will be a big help.  We could go to automated testing, and it seems to me that is where iSpring comes in more handy because it has test-taker input data built in ----- if I could just figure out what I'm missing in connecting the iSpring quiz with taskchain...

When I logged in as one my students in another institution's network, the background images failed to appear again. Is this something to do with quizport, or am I looking at a network issue, or something else? Any help would be appreciated! Cheers Robert",

          "Text": "Hi Robert, the first thing I would suggest is to clear the browser caches and \"Force-refresh\" the page in your browser. But probably you have already done that, so ... THe next thing I would try is to go to one of the computers that is misbehaving and find out what URL it is trying to access for the background image. If the image is within one of the HTML tags, then you can use the browser's \"View source\" menu option to open the source HTML and find the URL. If the image is defined in a stylesheet (i.e. a \". css \" file), then you will need to get the URL of the css file (again, using the browers's \"View source\" menu option), and then paste the stylesheet's URL into the browser's address bar. Once you have the URL of the background, check it is an absolute URL, then paste it into the address bar of your browser. If it doesn't show, then go to the course files folder of your Moodle site (or whereever the image is stored), navigate to the image file and click on it. The browser should display the image. That's enough for now. Please let me know what happens, and we can take it from there. cheers Gordon",

Pattern match \"../../\" ) is that the url you are accessing to play that mp3 includes the sequence \"../../\" which means \"go down 2 directory levels\". It's sometimes possible for people who are trying to get to places that they shouldn't have access to use this trick to bypass security checks and dig about the file system so that server is rejecting it on principle (even though in this case it looks totally harmless and proper for it to be looking for that particular file). It could possibly be considered a bug in the multimedia filter and that it should always use the full URL starting \" http://your.moodle.url/blah/blah blah...\" but it depends on how that's interacting with the original file link. It probably just uses what's there in the html in Moodle, so if you change the original download link to avoid needing \"../../\" it should start working, I think. (there also seems to be a sub-error, that the security code is triggering a 500 error a.k.a Internal Server Error, but the page it should display in that case `/home/efleg/public_html/gakuen/500.shtml` doesn't exist.)",

Nowadays I'm working with the 2.3.3 version of Moodle and I've found myself a problem after installing the hotpot. My problem is that when I'm in the page to add a hotpot. In the general section (sorry, if these are not the exact terms but I'm working with a Spanish version), where you have to give the hotpot a name and add the actual file, I DON'T have that \"add file\" box.  The only thing that appears is a bar which seems to be forever downlaoding but nothing comes out.

Moodle thinks this is another module and tries to install it. If you delete the \" hotpot_old \" directory (or move it somewhere else), I think the fatal error will disappear. You should also remove the \" hotpot_Viejo \" directory, if there is one. By the way, the \" Warning \" messages are telling you about some abandoned attempts at HotPot activities . It is normal for there to be a few of those. Please let us know how you get on. all the best Gordon",

Upgrade from 1.9 - 2.1 with hotpot module removed, then add back in hotpot after rest of site successfully upgraded and run hotpot upgrade by itself 3. Same as 2. but wait until site upgraded all the way to 2.3.3 before adding hotpot module back in. All 3 options result in the same error message, and it happens each time when upgrade gets to Migrating Hot Potatoes quiz files: (2288/4094) So am suspecting some sort of corruption with quiz file 2288 or 2299. Does anybody have any suggestions to get around this - is it possible to find out what quiz files 2288 or 2299 relate to and remove them from the 1.9 site to see if that gets around the problem?

          "Text": "Hi Glen, thanks for reporting this. Sorry to hear that the upgrade has gotten stuck. The reason that the upgrade has got stuck is that at least one of the HotPot activities at your site specifies its \"source file\" as a full URL (e.g. \" http://myserver.com/myfile.html \") instead of a file path within the Moodle course \"Files\" folder (e.g. \"myfolder/myfile.html\"). If you are in a hurry, there are several ways we can get the upgrade to succeed. locate and fix the unexpected URLs in the HotPot activities open your favorite database administration tool (e.g. phpMyAdmin ) select the Moodle 1.9 database that you are trying to upgrade run the following SQL command: SELECT * FROM mdl_hotpot WHERE reference LIKE 'http%' convert the fulls URLs to relative paths by at least removing \"http://\" force the HotPot upgrade script to ignore files specified using URLs open \"mod/hotpot/db/upgrade.php\" with your favorite text editor (e.g. Notepad++, TextWrangler, vi) locate the following line (around line 494) $file = $fs->create_file_from_url($file_record, $url); change the above line to the following: $file = false; save the file and run the upgrade again. You will get messages explaining which HotPots could not be upgraded. You may want to copy and save those message so you can clean up your the HotPots in your Moodle site. If you have more time, I would like to ask you to try a little detective work to help me make the HotPot upgrade script detect and prevent this issue happening in the future. First please check that you have Moodle \"Debug messages\" setting (Site admin -> Developement -> Debugging) set to \"Developer\" level and have enabled \" Display debug messages \". Next, please change line 494 in \"mod/hotpot/db/upgrade.php\" to the following: $file = $fs->create_file_from_url($file_record, $url, array('fullresponse' => true)); Now please try the update again and let me know what happens.

In the meantime, you could probably allow the score field to accept negative numbers if you change the hotpot_attempts score field to accept negative numbers. You can probably do that with your DB administration tool (e.g. phpMyAdmin -> select table -> Structure tab -> edit icon for \"score\" field -> set Attributes to blank -> Save) If you are using a MySQL database (and the default prefix of \"mdl_\" for you Moodle tables), the following SQL will allow reset the score field to allow negative values: ALTER TABLE mdl_hotpot_attempts CHANGE score score MEDIUMINT ( 6 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' I'm pretty sure that Hot Potatoes quizzes don't usually return negative scores, but anyway it would seem sensible to allow them in the score field, so perhaps this field should be permanently changed. I will have a think about that. Gordon",

If they go back, however, and get them all right on the first try, then the system records their score. A common denominator so far: all of the reports come from Firefox users, and the problems began around the time the new version of Firefox came out.

          "Text": "Hi Martin, I have not come across this issue as a general problem, so I think to cause of the difficulty will be something specific to your situation. Here are some of the questions which came to my mind when I read your post ... is the problem confined to one classroom? particular computers? can you reproduce the problem on a computer that stalls? is the problem caused by a particular type of HotPot? are there any common features of the HotPots that stall - for example do they contain media players, images, many questions, accented characters, apostrophe's, double quotes? do the errors happen all at once? always on the same day? same class period? when many students are accessing simultaneously? have the errors started happening only recently? do the same students seem to be getting the errors? would you categorize those users as novice, competant or advanced users? have you been ever able to reproduce errors based on what a student tells you they did? have the client machines had any firewall software installed? has the network been upgraded? does the server have a firewall? what OS is the server and what webserver software are you using? is all your software uptodate? what version of Moodle are you using? I offer these questions, not expecting you to send back written answers to them all, but in the hope that they may trigger some line of investigation for you which leads to your being able to identify the particular circumstances which cause certain computers to stall. The only experience I have had which is similar to yours, is when we had trouble with a memory leak on Apache 2.2 runing on Windows 2003, which caused the server to grind to a halt occasionally when it eventually ran out of memory. regards Gordon",

          "Text": "In Moodle 1.9 you can enter the folder name and the HotPot module will detect all HP quiz files within that folder and add a \"Hot Potatoes Quiz\" activity for each one. In Moodle 2.x, I'm afraid you have to create each HotPot activity individually when using the HotPot module. As reported on the following Moodle docs page, you can no longer add several HotPot activites at once: http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/HotPot_module_for_Moodle_2.0 Whether you use the HotPot module for Moodle 1.9 or 2.x, you will end up with 190 links on the course page. That's a lot of links and will be tough to navigate for both you and the students. If I were you I would use the QuizPort module for Moodle 1.9. It allows you to add several HP quizzes as a single unit, creating only one link on the course page. Furthermore, you can add pre- and post- conditions to the quizzes so that students can be guided on a certain path through the quizzes depending on their performance; good scores zoom ahead, poor scores go more slowly. The QuizPort module is available now, it has been around for a few years and I consider it to be a very stable piece of software. However it does not work on Moodle 2.x. The successor to the QuizPort module will be the TaskChain module. It will work on Moodle 2.x. It is currently in the final stages of creation, but it is not finished yet. I will be finished in the next few weeks. regards Gordon",

On another note,  I am a little confused regarding the use of the terminology in quizport. If I am correct, as it stands now, a collection of quizzes is referred to as an \"activity\". I am wondering if it might be better to refer to a collection of quizzes as \"unit\" instead? So, for example, where you have \"Retry: Retry this activity\", perhaps it would be better to make it read \"Retry: Retry this unit\". For me the term \"activity\" is more synonymous with an individual quiz rather than a collection of quizzes. I note that in \"Results\" there is a heading \"Unit attempt\" ( = activity attempt?). Just a thought. I wonder how other people feel about it? Cheers Robert",

In the following document, I have tried to describe the the concepts and terminology I use when talking about QuizPort: Introduction to QuizPort From the above document, you will see that a QuizPort activity includes not only the unit of quizzes but also the entry and exit pages. I agree with you that the collection of quizzes can be referred to as a unit. However, I think \"Retry this activity\" expresses more clearly what will happen than \"Retry this unit\" because the students will see not only the unit of quizzes but also the entry and exit pages. > For me the term \"activity\" is more synonymous with an individual quiz > rather than a collection of quizzes. That may be true for you, but the word \"Activity\" is already established in Moodleland as the generic term used to refer to module that adds a link to the central column on the course page. Therefore. I think Moodle users so should understand the phrase \"Retry this activity\", but they may be confused by \"Retry this unit\" because they may be unaware of the special meaning of \"unit\" within the QuizPort way of looking at things.",

If yes, then you can force the quiz to start with all questions showing if you do the following: if you haven't done so already, open JQuiz and generate the HTML file for the quiz open the quiz's HTML file with a text editor locate the \"SetUpQuestions\" function: search for \"function SetUpQuestions()\" locate the following last line in the \"SetUpQuestions()\" function search for \"SetFocusToTextbox()\" insert the following line, above the \"SetFocusToTextbox()\" line ShowHideQuestions(); save the file and close your text editor Now you can use this HTML file as the \"Source file\" for your HotPot activity in Moodle. best regards Gordon",

Or do they select 'Add...' and select the revised HP file off their desktop and upload it? (I fear the old file will not be replaced?)

You may know that I am currently working hard to create the next major version of the HotPot module. It will be more flexible than the current module, and it will be much easier to to create \"plugins\" to handle different types of quiz, e.g. Quandary. Next summer (i.e. 2008), I hope to recruit some student programmers participating in Google's \"summer of code\", to create plugins for several of your favorite quiz types, and you will be pleased to know that Quandary is already on the list. best regards Gordon",

BTW , the quiz popup messages displayed OK on Safari 3.3.2 on a Windows PC. I would be interested to know if the same problem occurs when you adminster the quiz via QuizPort. I would expect QuizPort to behave better. Firstly, it generally does not send results in the middle of a quiz, and secondly, if it does send results in the middle of a quiz, it uses AJAX to send the results on a different channel that the main client - server connection.

If it does then you can make the code a little cleverer to check to see if the browser is Safari. If it isn't iPhone Safari, send the 204 status code as usual. If it is iPhone Safari, don't do anything. You could also try just commenting out the \"header\" first line, and see if that helps. regards Gordon",

When I \"create a webpage\", the crossword puzzle looks as it should, but when clicking on the numbers, nothing happens. The \"across/down\" clue with space to type in your answer does not pop up. The \"check\" button also does not work, and does not change colour when resting the cursor over it, although I see the pointing hand. I have Hot Potatoes 6.3 and am using Windows 7. I used the 6.3 installer and not the Java Hot Potatoes download . I have uninstalled Hot Potatoes twice, once with its uninstaller, and once with the control panel. I have registered it under my name, although it's free and only asks for my name and if I am an administrator. I just put in my name. A curious thing, is that when I uninstall it, and reinstall it, my name shows up in the registration popup. I expected it would be blank. The second time I changed my name slightly (added an initial) and when I uninstall/reinstalled Hot Potatoes, the changed name showed up. I would have thought it would show nothing if it had really uninstalled. The files are all in one folder, and there are no spaces in the name. I have attached the files if you need to look at them. I hope you can help as I cannot think what else to do.",

If you were the owner you would have the original files, and if you had asked the owner, you would probably have been sent the original files. Having read your initial post, I too was left wondering whether or not you had obtained permission to use the files, Your message was not explicit in this regard. It seems I was not alone in thinking that maybe you had not observed the rules of netiquette. However, my mind was put at rest when you stated clearly on another thread, one hour after your original post on this thread, that you had \"first obtained the requisite permissions\". When I found that out, I added a note to this thread to make it clear to everybody that you had permission. There was no misunderstanding about your ethics, and that should have been the end of that ... .. but now you have said some very impolite things in a very public place about someone who has helped and supported many Moodle users and is held in high regard on these forums. For these reasons, I feel your vitriolic reaction to a message written 8-months ago is unwarranted and excessive.

Referencing the file with a relative path works fine when using the default Moodle player but If I specify a media player (like dew) the player doesn't appear. This works: [Audio.mp3] This breaks: [Audio.mp3 dew] When specifying a media player with the relative path an img tag appears instead of the player: <span id=\"dew_mp3_player_129044927900\" class=\"mediaplugin_mp3\" style=\"visibility: visible;\"> <img width=\"200\" height=\"20\" alt=\"MP3 audio\" src=\"http://intranet.local/moodle/pix/spacer.gif\"> </span> I found out that referencing the file with its absolute path works ([http://abs/path/to/Audio.mp3 dew] -from this post ), but doing that for each exercise isn't feasible as the absolute path for the file isn't known until the unit is uploaded. It would also make it hard to move units between courses. I've looked at the source code for QuizPort and it seems that at quizport/mediafilter/class.php:609 the variable `$spantext' hasn't been set, causing the replacement <img> tag. I haven't found $spantext defined anywhere else, so I don't know how or why it's not being set properly when using relative paths. I had a look at the url_convert_relative() function but didn't get anywhere. Any idea why the media filter is choking on relative paths for non-Moodle players?",

Are you running the quiz from the XML file or the HTML file? Did you get a JavaScript message in your browser? In the source code of the page that was sent by QuizPort to your browser, can you locate the URL , relative or absolute, of the mp3 file? I expect it to appear in some JavaScript near the end of the page source. I don't think the inserted image is a problem, as that is intended as a space holder while the page is loading in the browser. Once the page has loaded the media player should be inserted by JavaScript. If you set up a duplicate QuizPort on my testing server , that would really help me locate the cause of the problem.

Actually, Moodle tries to prevent the creation of folders with names that contain spaces, but it is possible to create them if they are part of a zip file that is unzipped within the \"Files\" area of a course. Anyway, if spaces was the cause of the problem, you can fix it either by removing spaces from the folder or file name, or you can download and install the latest version of QuizPort. QuizPort module for Moodle 1.0 - 1.9 After installing, you may have to clear the QuizPort cache on your site: Site Administration -> Modules -> Activities -> QuizPort -> Clear cache all the best Gordon",

I think the best you could hope for would be to add all the Hot Potatoes exercises as seperate HotPot activities , and then perhaps use Moodle 2's \"Conditional activities\" functionality to prevent access to each HotPot until the previous one has been completed satisfactorily. As you may know, I have been developing a module called the TaskChain module which will allow you to add several Hot Potatoes exercises in a chain that forms a single Moodle activity. At the moment, that module is at the stage where I can add several Hot Potatoes exercises (=tasks) to a TaskChain activity, and I can display a single task. However, I need to finish the programming required to choose which task in the chain to display next. I expect it will be ready in a wekk or two. kind regards Gordon",

Media players in Hot Potatoes quizzes Some media players will not accept the media file if it comes via the script which guards the course files. In this situation, it is necessary to replace the media player with one that is known to be compatible with Moodle. You can do this yourself by modifying the reference to the media player in the quiz, or you can force Moodle to do it by setting the \"Force media plugins\" option on the quiz's settings page to \"Yes\" . 1. This the only help I can find in moodle.org about uploading a hotpot with media files. I can't understand it. Where is the quiz settings,it talks about to change the 'Force media plugins'? 2. My hotpot is about 50megs. I haven't been able to upload it. Does it have to be only 2megs? 3. Can I Ftp a hotpot upload, or is it the only way to upload it through the course? Thank you!",

Teacher accounts cannot FTP stuff, only admins can. So teachers can only upload via the course. As Admin, you should know where, which folder to upload the files to. (i.e. which course; this is a number usually, and this is sometimes hard to find out) Force media plugins is at course level in the Teacher's role when you Add an activity>>Hot Potatoes Quiz. File upload varies from installation to installation. For instance, my Uni.'s got a 80MB restriction; seems your Moodle has like 2MB. Hotpot file about 50Mb - You're probably talking about the embedded media (audio, video, imagery) files together with the hotpot file. I've never seen a hotpot source or output file alone bigger than 100Kb, as it is plain xml or htm. I'd suggest four options: 1. zip or rar your media files by splitting the archive into several 1.5MB archives and then upload them one by one and unzip them once uploaded via the course. 2. convert your media file to reduce the file size - usually losing a bit of a quality of sound (mono vs. stereo is OK, 128bitrate to lower bitrate is OK too) or video quality of image (30 frames per second to lower) 3. get Admin access (or get the Admin to) find out the course folder (usually a number) and FTP the stuff. 4. get the Admin to increase the file size upload restriction site-wide (as I said my Uni allows 80MB) Then, into your course, Add an activity>>HotPotatoes Quiz, under Display there's the Force media plugin>> set this to 'Yes' I can't be more of help without more info.

Are you uploading as a Teacher or do you have System Admin access? I think as a teacher because I'm trying to do it from within the course.

          "Text": "Hi Alex, in Moodle 1.9: 1: You can check and change your upload size limit from: Administration >> Courses >> Course default settings>>Maximum upload size If you can get it big enough, and if you reduce the size of the media and split the archives, you can upload it from within the course without messing around with ftp. This way the uploaded files will live in the course folder; other courses will not be able to use them since their course folders are different. This will save you trouble in the future, I believe. And you do it site-wide. The disadvantage still stays with files larger than what you can set as default Max upload size. OR 2: FYI , a course folder is usually in moodledata/#/ where # is the number of the course. You can find the number of the course from the url of a course, e.g. http://yoursite.com/moodle/course/view.php?id=7 , so 7 is the number of the course. If you log through an ftp client into your moodle directories, search for /moodledata/7/. Inside are the course files. FTP the media in there. Then, login as usual with your Teacher account and Add an activity>>HotPotatoes Quiz, under Display there's the Force media plugin>> 'Yes'. That should set you going. The good things are that you won't have to split archives, reduce media quality, etc. Hope that helps. I can't say what it is with Moodle 2 as my host hasn't yet upgraded the PHP version and Moodle doesn't continue the install. Hopefully, I'll be running both versions alongside soon in view of preparation for migration. Cheers Stan",

Will HotPot files be able to be converted to Task Chain files?\n3. Does Task Chain have a space (e.g. like the 'add a reading task' or 'subtitle' in Hotpotatoes where material can be added which the students need to learn before doing the quiz?\n4. I do like the possibility of a report (separate from a Grade mark) for Task Chain - and I guess Task Chain solves the problem I see people discussing of Hotpotatoes finding all media files in the 2.x versions. Is there somewhere that I can find out about any additional features (I read the link you gave in an earlier thread on Task Chain).\nThinking ahead - as I'm creating hotpotatoe files for academic language skills for a a number of courses. I need to know that that work can be used for sometime into the future!!\nThanks a lot\nKathy",

I thought that this had been changed under QuizPort, such that you could have as many wrong answers as the post-conditions permit. In many cases, there are only two choices, so the feedback telling you that your choice was wrong already tells you what the right choice is. If HotPots will continue to require that the correct answer be chosen, that is not a bad thing. It just requires a different set of directions on how to use the quizzes.

Rather, it behaved as you would like it to behave. Namely, questions on which I had chosen all the wrong answers, leaving one unselected correct answer were flagged as being completed. For example, on the first question, which has two possible answers, I chose the wrong answer \"airbase\" and I did not select the correct answer, \"air base\". Then I did the other questions in a similar way. I finished the final question, a message saying \"you have finished this quiz\" appeared, and my results were returned to Moodle.

However, if you go back and click the remaining answers till you get a correct answer on each item, the quiz will advance normally to the next step in the Quizport. In using Hot Potatoes quizzes on Moodle, I have occasionally seen this same behavior (outside of Quizport), resulting in a quiz that will not record its grade until the student has clicked a correct answer for every item (except possibly the final one). BTW , as part of my own investigation, I did validate the xhtml in the quiz above. It returned one warning about \" Mismatch between Public and System identifiers in the DOCTYPE declaration.\" That mismatch remains, since it will probably occur in all Hot Potatoes quizzes.

There you will find some short quizzes using actual questions -- and these reproduce the problem, but erratically. When I try these quizzes on Mac-Firefox or Mac-Safari, or on Vista-IE7, I get erratic results in this respect: Sometimes the Hot Potatoes quiz inside the QuizPort will not process until I have gone back and corrected every incorrect answer. (Qualification: It might possible permit one error to stand.) Sometimes, the quizzes will process even when they contain one or two wrong (and uncorrected) choices. Usually, if there are errors that bring the score below the required post-conditions score, the quizzes just hang. Nothing happens. Thirty seconds, nothing happens. Other times, a quiz will be processed with such errors. But rarely. Note: I can't duplicate this problem with a fresh quiz created using dummy questions. The problem occurs (so far) only with \"real\" questions and \"real\" feedback. Question: Is there something embedded in my \"real\" questions that is hanging up Quizport? I've looked with a text editor, and I can't find a thing. One question does contain a semicolon, but I don't think that's a problem. Is the &apos; (apostrophe) code a problem? Some items do contain that code. Thinking back over early versions of Hot Potatoes... (and some of these questions were created on early versions): has more recent coding changed from &alpha; codes to numerical unicodes in a way that residual alpha-codes might cause a problem? I've loaded the source files into the latest Hot Potatoes and re-saved them, with the expectation that any coding in them would thus be updated. Does that sound right?

One question is lifted from an actual quiz and has four choices. This is Sample Quiz 5, inside A2Test. No matter what combination of answers I choose -- keeping one of the three questions incorrect (yielding a score of 66%, which is below the 90% needed to advance to the next quiz -- I get erratic responses. Sometimes the quiz repeats as it should; mostly it just hangs. Most strangely, if I choose Correct answers on Qs 1 and 3, then just keep clicking on the Wrong answers on Q 2, the quiz will eventually process. The response is erratic. Much of the time, as long as one question continues NOT to have the correct answer checked, the quiz just hangs. Other times, with that correct answer NOT checked, the quiz processes and repeats as it should. As soon as I can, I will get to other Internet connections, computers, and browsers and try them. If anyone else is around to try this, please report on what results you get. Thanks, Gerald P.S. This detail might be meaningful. On the 3-item Sample Quiz 5, if I choose Incorrect answers on all 3 questions, the Quizport hangs and does not process (it should repeat the quiz). However, if I click ALL THE OTHER WRONG ANSWERS on the one question with multiple answers, the quiz then processes -- even though no question has any correct answer checked. Is there something in Hot Potatoes or Quizport that is counting the clicks on multiple choices and submits the quiz when all but one choice has been chosen (reasoning that the one remaining choice is the obvious correct one)? The problem occurs ONLY when the \"real\" question with four choices has a wrong answer in it. Otherwise, the quiz behaves as it should. Stumped on Labor Day Weekend...

When I pick the Correct answers on any two of the three questions, and an incorrect answer on the third, the quiz hangs and does not process (it is set to repeat if the score is less than 90). I can get the quiz to process in two ways: (1) click the correct answer (and OK), or (2) click all the other incorrect answers but not the correct answer (and OK after each one). This suggests that, in quizzes with multiple choices for answers, something somewhere is counting the number of attempts at answers and comparing it with the total number of choices. That count may be, at times, preventing the quiz from processing when some questions have incorrect answers. If there is a count that says \"go ahead and process the quiz if there is only one remaining unchecked answer, even if the correct answer has not yet been checked,\" that might explain the erratic results in quizzes where some questions have only two choices and some more choices. In those cases, sometimes quizzes would process (submit) with incorrect answers, sometimes not, depending on how many unchecked answer choices there were in a question. I hope this helps elucidate something. Gerald",

(1) the quiz is not complete until all questions are complete (2) a multiple choice question is judged to be complete if either of the following is true (a) a correct answer is selected (b) *all* the answers except the correct answer are selected I think that when you started this thread you expected a single wrong answer to be sufficient for a question to considered finished. For mutiple choice questions that have only two answers, it is indeed sufficient just to pick one answer, right or wrong, and the question will be marked as completed. However, choosing just one answer on a Multiple choice question with three or more possible answers is not enough to complete the question. You must continue selecting answers on that question until you have satisfied conditions 2(a) or 2(b) above. Does that explanation fit with your experience and current understanding? Gordon",

Pragmatically, however, if a student takes a Hot Potatoes JQZ and inadvertently neglects to choose the correct answer for one question out of 10 or 20 or more questions, the quiz just stops. Some students tell me, \"I restarted my computer because it hung up.\" There is no message at that juncture saying what to do. And I can't think of a way to get an instruction to appear at that point. If you know of an effective way to address this blank moment, I'd appreciate hearing about it -- other than introductory instruction on how the quizzes work, followed by reminders.

          "Text": "Hi Ryan, my understanding is that certain Moodle modules are disabled by default so as to simplify the initial user interface. Also, as you may know, the HotPot module was originally not part of the core Moodle system, so there may be \"legacy\" reasons why it is currently \"in\" but initially hidden. And finally, probably the most important reason that the HotPot module is disabled by default is that Hot Potatoes (the software that you use to make the quizzes) is not open-source software and so you need a license to use it to make Hot Potatoes quizzes and distribute them to your students. Here's a relevant excerpt from the Hot Potates End User Agreement: Hot Potatoes is free for use by state educational institutions which are non-profit making, on the condition that the material produced using the program is freely available to anyone via the WWW Therefore, I think it is a good idea to require a deliberate act to enable the HotPot module. A few points you should be aware of that people sometimes ask me about:",

It may not concern many people, but on their Hot Potatoes Commercial Licences page they say: The Large Publication Licence The large publication licence is suitable for publishing companies who wish to distribute material made using Hot Potatoes with a publication, on CD-ROM or perhaps on a floppy disk. The typical case would be a textbook publisher distributing a CD of exercises with an edition of a textbook. Personally, I think their USD $ 100.00 single user licence fee is very reasonable for those working in economically developed countries. Cheers, Glenys",

The Hotpot question-import appears to have converted the questions from short answer into multiple choice questions. When I add those questions to a quiz, they come up as multiple-choice questions that contain my list of right-and-wrong matching texts as the mutiple choice items. There is no short-answer blank.

I number the exercises and usually people do them in order unless they are confused by seeing \"Choose one of the following\". collections of exercises (say, on prepositions) where the order isn't important and the users should be free to choose the subjects they feel they need to work on. \"Choose one of the following\" is not a problem but I don't feel it's necessary either. In fact, I don't really feel the need for any instructions at this point. If necessary, instructions can be given in the Entry page text - that's where instructions are intended to given, isn't it? (As Robert did.) At the moment, where I'm admin, I've changed it to simply: The exercises: If I remember rightly, you put this instruction in because one group of users (more than one?) saw the list of exercises and didn't realise that they should click on one. Had they been given instructions in the Entry page text? Maybe this was before the Entry page text existed? Could a very simple solution be just to remove it?

If you want to backup on 1.9 and restore to 2.7 you will need to make sure you back up the course files on the 1.9 site. Since you can't back up selective files form the course files, you will need to include ALL the files from the course containing the HotPot activity you want to transfer. When you restore on the Moodle 2.7, you can select which activity you wish to restore. But first of all, I suggest you ask the instructor to recreate the HotPot on the Moodle 2.7. It is probably quicker and certainly more empowering from him/her to do that. regards Gordon",

We\nare finding that since an upgrade to Moodle 2.9.5+ and Hotpot build\n2016011287 (we have also had this problem on the most recent version of\nthe plugin), we are seeing Apache crash when certain Hotpot quizzes are\nattempted. We have narrowed it down to quizzes which have at least one\nquestion that has at least one question text element or feedback element with 105 or more\ncharacters in it (at 104 or fewer characters, there is no problem). The\nApache error log is in this case not all that helpful, but there are\nclues that lead us to believe that it is a stack overflow issue.

When you say, \"Apache crash\", do you mean that Apache comes to a stop and has to be restarted? What do the error logs reveal?

We have narrowed it down to quizzes which have at least one question that has at least one question text element or feedback element with 105 or more characters in it (at 104 or fewer characters, there is no problem) If this is true, then it should be possible to reduce the sample jqz to just one question that breaks your server.

So Apache crashes and auto-restarts immediately. A Google search on that status code returns some results - all older, unfortunately - that indicate a buffer or stack overflow issue is occurring. Most of the results show that it's an Apache/PHP on Windows issue. Some suggest increasing the thread stack size, but that setting (again, for Windows users) has been removed from newer versions of Apache. I have since tried restoring to an older version of Hotpot (2015021162), and the problem doesn't occur using any of the problematic quiz files, including the one attached here. Trevar",

          "Text": "Dear all, I have some JCross exercises that I want to use in my Japanese Moodle course. Today, I uploaded them into my course to test but discovered that the section of crossword grids is displayed almost completely out of the screen to the right in Firefox . When I moved the page to the right using the horizontal scroll bar and clicked one of the question numbers in the grids, however, the grids displayed properly in the centre of the page. Strangely, this does not happen if I use Internet Explore 7, which is the standard browser at my university, to view the course. Unfortunately, both my students and I have to use Firefox this coming semester to access to the course.  My course is set to UTF-8 to allow me to use both English and Japanese within the course but, I recently found that IE 7 has a Kanji display problem (it displays all Kanji characters in a Chinese font, not Japanese) if a web page is tagged with non-Japanese encodings, including UTF-8. I have tried to use JCross file instead of html version, but it did not work either (keypads were displayed only partially). I am using Moodle 1.8 and Hot Potatoes v 6.2.1.2 (i.e., the latest version). I am not sure which version of Hot Potato Module that we are running, but I could find it out from IT. I attached an example JCross file that I had a problem. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could help me to solve this problem. Best regards, Kimi Furuta",

          "Text": "Hi Tania, I think I see what you are trying to do. You want to use a QuizPort activity as a filter, so that students who get a high grade for the QuizPort go into a \"Advanced\" group, those in the mid-range go into a \"Standard\" group, while those with low grades go into a \"Beginner\" group. The difficulty is that QuizPort pre- and post-conditions are only aware of the scores on other quizzes within the QuizPort. They do not have access to the current or final grade of the QuizPort activity. If there was only one quiz, or at least only one quiz whose score could be used to determine which group the students go to, then you could add the following post-conditions to the quiz: >90%: Advanced entry page >60%: Standard entry page Beginner entry page The entry pages are just html pages that you have added to the QuizPort. They have some text saying \"Well done. Click her to join your group in this class.\" and a link (that you have copied and pasted) to the page students access to join a group. The process is not automatic, but it will look quite smooth to the students I think. If you have lots of quizzes and you want to base decide based on their total score then I don't think QuizPort can handle that situation elegantly. I know that Moodle 2.x can send students to different activities based on their results of the activity they have just accessed, so maybe that could do what you want. Of course, QuizPort doesn't work with Moodle 2.x, but I am just starting the big push to get TaskChain up and running. TaskChain is the successor to QuizPort and it will run in Moodle 2.x. regards Gordon",

There are several ways: with your Moodle course page in edit mode (click the \"Turn editing on\" button), locate the \"Add a resource\" menu in the course topic/week where you want to add the html page, and select \"Compose a web page\" using your favorite HTML editor, create an HTML page on your PC and upload it to the \"Files\" area of your Moodle course. Then, locate the \"Add a resource\" menu in the course topic/week where you want to add the html page, and select \"Link to a file or web site\" to add an html page into a QuizPort, for example to explain to students where they are what they are supposed to do next, add the html files as a \"quiz\", in the sae that you would add a Hot Potatoes file. QuizPort will recognize that the file is an html file and display it with a \"Continue\" button at the bottom of the page > quizport and courses don't support them That doesn't sound right to me. I would say that courses definitely support groups and groupings, because that is where you set them up. QuizPort supports groups, to the extent that you can specify that pre- and post-conditions only apply to certain groups. It is therefore possible to specify that members of the \"Advanced\" group need to score >= 90% to progress to the next quiz, where the \"Standard\" group require score >= 80% , and the \"Beginner\" group can progress with a score >= 70%. In my experience, groups and groupings get complicated quickly, so although I have used them in past, for example while I was developing material for a course, I avoid them now, and instead give students seperate courses, with the QuizPort content stored in the site files and shared from there. best regards Gordon",

One of our teachers has just created a hotpot quiz (matching right-col statements to left-col statements). When we modify the moodle quiz, there is no assessement/grading options, which means that when the kids do the quiz we can't find out how they've done. I've read through some of the topics here to try to see if this is as intended, but I can't find a clear answer. So this is a terribly basic question: Does the hotpot module allow grading? And if it does, then any idea at all where I might have gone wrong with installation (I set it up around September 04). Or does it depend on which hotpot test is being used?",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, In the course I'm converting to QuizPort, the WebRhubarb exercise which is still in the Hot Potatoes module is causing problems. As you know, this kind of exercise means a lot of clicks and therefore a lot of \"requêtes sur le serveur\" (sorry I don't know how to say this in English). In my first university (2 and 3 years ago) this didn't seem a problem, they had enough RAM to handle it. In another university and now on shared hosting (the \"Premium package\" offered so not bottom of the range), as few as 6 students working at the same time leads to them being ejected and losing all their work. Extremely frustrating for them. For the moment, I've hidden these exercises but the course is built in such a way that the WebRhubarb (in fact a dictation) is the culminating exercise for each unit so removing it would be like cutting out the last act in Hamlet because the play is too long. Do you have any ideas? Will it make any difference when WebRhubarb is available through QuizPort? I don't know if it's a related problem, but I'm also unable to backup the course. This is a problem I've frequently had with my Hot Pot rich courses. I have no problems backing up and restoring until the students start working and then, not immediately, but at some point the backup starts to just \"hang\". I've mangaged to get round it by backing up \"bits\" of the course and restoring them bit by bit. It's very laborious because I don't have criteria for choosing the bits and often the bits I choose lead to corrupted files. I've spent a lot of time asking on other forums and even my host at moodle.com couldn't find an answer this spring. I'm not sure it's related to the Hot Pots - it could be something else.

          "Text": "Hi Glenys, thanks for your posting. You raise  several interesting points. I was not aware of the fact that WebRhubarb exercises run via the HotPot module can quickly overload the server . I will have a look at that and see if we can sort it. Related to this point is the fact that the HotPot and QuizPort modules behave quite differently when sending results. HotPot sends results whenever it can, i.e. every click, whereas QuizPort sends them whenever it needs to, i.e. when the student leaves the page. The end result of both approaches is that all the results get saved even if the students stop before completing the quiz, but the HotPot module generates a lot more network traffic, and from what you say it seems that WebRhubarb generates the most of all the types of HP quiz. Another difference between the two modules is that HotPot always stores the raw data returned from the browser. It all goes into a table called \"hotpot_details\". This table can get *very* big, so I recommend you empty it, using your favorite DB administration tool, e.g. phpMyAdmin , before you take a backup. Another way to reduce the server load during backups, especially if you are making backups in order to copy the activities elsewhere, is to omit the files from the backup. You can always copy the files later via ssh, FTP or even Moodle's own interface to the Site and Course files folders. You will pleased to know that I intend to get WebRhubarb and Sequitur quizzes (HTML files) going with QuizPort in the near future. It is the next thing I want to do with QuizPort, but there are several pressing things I have to do first as part of my job at university. kind regards Gordon",

I'm going to retire at the end of this academic year so I have more time for the things I really like to do. And I'm happy too to get confirmation of what I'd suspected from remembering what you'd written to other people that QuizPort is generates much less network traffic. I've managed to back up and restore the course locally by changing the php.ini setting max_execution_time = 400 (instead of 60) thanks to a tip from Simon Dupuich who administers Moodle at the University of Franche-Comté. However I don't have access to the php.ini file on the distance server where the course is hosted at the moment. Thanks a lot, Glenys",

Also, if you do not complete the quiz and then start another attempt at the quiz (by refreshing the browser window or leaving the quiz and then trying it again later), the earlier attempts will be marked as \"abandoned\". Perhaps you have a long quiz? or a difficult quiz that students are not able to complete? I am currently working on some enhancements to the module that may be useful in this situation. Firstly, the reporting of results will be done every time the student clicks the \"Check\" button, so the teacher will be able to see the responses to questions that were attempted, even if the whole quiz was not finished. Second, I am considering adding a comment box to the feedback popup box, so that if students cannot answer the question, they can write to you to tell you what they are thinking. best regards Gordon",

The copying of the file icons is \"optional\" because you will still get generic icons instead of the pretty hotpot ones.  In Moodle 1.5, these are included. Without looking at the current download , I can only guess, but me thinks that the directions in that readme file may not be uptodate.  At one time, before Hotpot became a standard part of the distribution, there were many more things that had to be set up to make it work.  Slowly, different elements started to be included in the \"standard distribution\" so those items no longer had to be manually inserted.",

Staff have submitted me homeworks and I set myself the challenge of replicate them on Hot Potatoes - to some success. Obviously for some of the more challenging pieces eg a Power Law HW in Physics, there is the possibility some of the \"less interested\" could be there all week trying to get all the questions correct hence the query. Your module is superb and a big step forward for Hot potatoes - many thanks. Good luck with the new term. Gideon",

Student commences assessment and if s/he gets an answer wrong s/he will receive automatic feedback why the answer is wrong. Unfortunately from now on s/he is not eligible to pass, but is encouraged to complete the assessment for learning purposes and can have as many wrong answers. To pass this assessment s/he has to start the assessment again from the beginning. I would like to see the questions shuffled and a time gap in between the first and any subsequent assessment attempt. I would like to use hotpotato for these assessments, but have very limited knowledge of this program. I have made a sample assessment with all the questions, answers and possible feed back, but this is where I got stuck. How can I set it up so it only accepts a 100% pass rate, a time gap in between attempts and shuffling of the questions? Perhaps someone has a better idea? I am still using Moodle 1.9 but will most likely upgrade in the next year or so.",

You can enable the following setting within JQuiz if you want the questions shuffled into a different order each time they are displayed to the students: Options -> Configure Output -> Other -> Shuffle order of questions each time page loads You can add the JQuiz file to Moodle 1.9 using the HotPot module, but if you want a delay between attempts I suggest you use the QuizPort module. The QuizPort module is the successor to the HotPot module module, but it is not included in the standard download of Moodle 1.9, so you will have to downoad it and install it separately: QuizPort module for Moodle 1.x The QuizPort module allows you to put several Hot Potatoes exercises into a single QuizPort activity. You can add post-conditions to the exercises so that students can only finish the exercise if they get the required score - 100% in your case. The post-conditions would look something like this: >= 100%: end of unit same quiz In plain English this means, \"If the score for the Hot Potatoes exercise is 100%, then this student has finished this QuizPort activity, otherwise show the same exercise again\". On the settings page for the Hot Potatoes exercise within QuizPort you can specify delays between attempts at the exercise: delay1: the minimum delay between first and second attempts delay2: the minimum delay between attempts after the second attempt If you need help installing the QuizPort module, please let us know. cheers Gordon",

If we want to make the change available to everybody, we are supposed to create a new \"issue\" on the tracker, explain the problem, offer the solution, explain how to test the solution, give test files for the testers to confirm the solution and then wait and see if the fix is approved. It is a little bit more than I can manage at the moment, so instead I will offer a link to the latest zip file on my own server : HotPot module for Moodle 1.9 For QuizPort, I am supposed to upload to the Moodle.org plugins repository, but I cannot do that because uploads do not appear to be working at the moment (see MDL-33965 ), so instead I offer a link to the latest zip file on my server: QuizPort module for Moodle 1.x Similarly, I cannot upload the latest HotPot module for Moodle 2.x to the Moodle.org plugins repository as I am supposed to (see MDL-33965 ), so instead here is a link to the latest zip file on my server: HotPot module for Moodle 2.x I have commited the new files for HotPot Moodle 2.x to the CVS repository, so if you are updating from there then you should be able to get the new files the next time you update using CVS. best regards Gordon",

See: as ... as 2 I did the same in the QuizPort and there the help links work no problem. As you can see, there's no problem incorporating images as prompts in the JMixes and I have an idea for some with audio prompts. Can't imagine what a video prompt could be but maybe someone else can.

Some students who are able to start the quiz have been abbandoned from the Quiz, like 15-25 minutes after the test. Those studens are still shown as \"Test in progress\", but time used is frozen. 3. If some students have difficulties with PC or internet connections, they cannot continue the quiz ( maybe 2 attempts be a solution?) So I am asking for a solution of this problem. The following setting were made for the Quiz: It was open for one hour; one attempt; when you start it, you have 45minutes to finish it; all questions are shuffled for each student. As far as I could think of, these settings could have any diffrence on what happened. What is worth to mention, that I wanted for about 170 students to start the Quiz in one hour interval (130 participated). So maybe this problem was caused by an overload of server ? I think i've listed all of the information about problem, I may have missed something so please ask if you need anything more. Looking forward for help!",

You have two solutions: reduce the number of items or use the alternative output with a dropdown menu. Personally, I would say that about eight is the pedagogical limit for most exercises of this type whatever the output type. More than that tends to confuse students. Cheers, Glenys",

I think you mean \"restoring individual HotPots to a course\", but maybe you mean \"importing Hot Potatoes files to the Quiz module\"? Please could you confirm. I wonder if you could try a few experiments to identify the conditions under which the unwanted grade book entries appear. It might be simplest and safest to try these experiments in new Moodle course. add a HotPot, try a few attempts and then delete the HotPot restore a single HotPot from a backup, try a few attempts and then delete the HotPot restore a single HotPot from a backup, then restore it again (so there are two copies of the same HotPot in the course), try some attempts Everything OK so far?",

For some reason, we cannot use the original Hot Potato file (I think we know what the problem is - something to do with our php server version that is wrong. We also cannot import without losing the '<' and '>' tags. The IT support still has to sort that one out.) Now, to the issue of this post. Due to the problem described above we have resorted to using the html version. However, for some obscure reason the dragging and dropping doesn't want to work in Internet Explorer 8. Although I support using Firefox our IT support person doesn't think it is a good idea in our network setup because the browser setting are automatically pushed out for each user and Firefox doesn't handle that well. Which means we are stuck with IE . Has anybody else come across this problem, IE refusing to play along when dragging and dropping from the Hot Potatoes html version? More importantly, does anyone know why it is doing so and is there a quick solution? Thanks Marius",

Your students log in to Moodle and they will see the course you have enrolled them in either in their navigation block under \"my courses\" or in the centre of your front page in a list of courses. When they click on the course they will see your Quiz and other stuff and be able to do it. Does that help?",

          "Text": "Hi Glenys, thanks for the jmt file. Probably the code in the HotPot module which generates \"fixed\" items needs to be changed, but I will investigate and report back. By the way, the first Hot Potatoes quiz in a chain can be an html file or a HP XML file (jcl, jcr, jmt, jmx jqz). The quizzes in the \"tail\" of the chain have to be the html files, because the \"Next\" links in a quiz always point to an html file. It's probably easiest to always use an html file as the \"head\" ofthe chain too. > It's all a mystery to me how the Hot Potatoes file can correctly generate the html file on Moodle when it no longer has access to the source files. Perhaps you are confused because you are wondering \"if I use the jmt file as the source file, where is the html file\"? The answer is that there is no actual html file. It is generated \"on-the-fly\" by Moodle as it is sent to the browser. The browser accepts the html as if it were a static html file from the server 's hard drive, but actually there is no such file. > I don't know how a file is recognised as \"next\" in a chain Basically the HotPot module looks for file specified in the \"Next\" button, which is set from the \"Next exercise URL\" on the Config - Options page within Hot Potatoes. When adding a chain, the HotPot module uses a function called \"hotpot_get_titles_and_next_ex\" in \"mod/hotpot/lib.php\". This function first checks to see if the source file is an html file or an HP XML file. If the source file is an html file, the function looks for the last <BUTTON> in the first <DIV> called \"NavButtonBar\" and extracts the name of the \"Next\" file from there. If the source file is an HP XML file, the function looks for the \"next-ex-url\" setting and uses that as the name of the next file in the chain. best regards Gordon",

The idea is, students practice the quiz at one point in the course, up to 5 times for a small grade. Later in the course, they take the same quiz once (with questions in random order), for a bigger grade. Will this work? Is it likely to cause any problems? Will the counts of the different attempts interfere with one another? That is, when students go to take it on the second occasion in category \"Test,\" will Moodle think they have already used up their one attempt?

Of course, each time you use it, you have the option to use the same or different quiz settings that QuizPort offers, such as time limit, score weighting and output format. If the Hot Potatoes quiz file is in your course files folder then you can share it easily between QuizPorts in the same course. If you are a Moodle admin, you can put the Hot Potatoes quiz file in the Site files folder and share it between QuizPorts in all the courses on that Moodle site. And if you put the quiz file on a server that is accessible via the internet, and enter the \"Source file\" for the quiz as a url (i.e. an internet address beginning with \"http://\"), then you can share your Hot Potatoes quiz file with all your Moodle sites in the whole of cyberspace. That last solution probably works best with html files. The attempts at the quiz are kept separately within the results for each QuizPort, so you needn't worry about attempt scores getting mixed up or lost somehow. So, go ahead and re-use your Hot Potatoes quizzes for all they're worth. Yay! Gordon",

I have set the relevant course for guest access with a key ds for the next few days if you would like to see the basic links in operation (right hand block: \"Logger Pro main modes\"). The object section for use with Hot Potatoes was obtained by simply copying the object section from the html file generated by Camtasia which links together the config, controller and swf files. When uploaded to Moodle the original Flash files work outside HotPot when linked to the html file from Camtasia. Although the reference to the html file is absolute, all references within the file remain relative ( the key point - these links should remain relative if the files are to work?? ) Sorry for the bother but it would be very useful for us to get this working if at all possible.",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, I would appreciate your advice on how to use hot potatoes with sound embedded in moodle. I would like to make them work in any browser without having to worry about plugins. That's why I thought of Flash. I prepared a set of activities with mp3 and a flash player proposed by Stan Bogdanov in http://ewbooks.info/hotpot/tutorials/hotpotatoes-tutorials/flash-mp3-players.html (the second one). This is the code: <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"hbs_mp3player3but.swf\" width=\"150\" height=\"20\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"> <param name=\"type\" value=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" /> <param name=\"src\" value=\"hbs_mp3player3but.swf\" /> <param name=\"data\" value=\"hbs_mp3player3but.swf\" /> <param name=\"codebase\" value=\"hbs_mp3player3but.swf\" /> <param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"TheSound=your_audio_file.mp3\" /> <param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"sameDomain\" /> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"hbs_mp3player3but.swf\" /> <param name=\"loop\" value=\"false\" /> <param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /> <param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /> </object> I added the code to each activity and then placed the player in the file with the activities. They worked well locally but keep giving me problems when uploaded to the school's moodle and when I open them from outside the school. Some of them work but others don't. I suspect that the sound is taking ages to download and the player won't start until the whole sound file is stored somewhere in my computer. I must say that the school's server ADSL upload speed is not very good (250 kbps). Once they work the first time they work well when I try the activity a second time. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

Let's say that my problematic files are all of them but there was one that didn't work at all. It was only a mistake in the link to the audio file. Sorry, I just realized when uploading it to your moodle. In any case all of them showed a problem (even in your platform) the first time I opened the activities (nothing happened after clicking on the play button; I had to click stop or move the slide bar for it to start playing). This problem is worse in my school's moodle. More loading time which, of course, must be due to the upload speed. Isn't there any other simple way of improving this? Perhaps using streaming or something similar?  Would you suggest any other flash player that does not show these problems? It would be nice to find one that, apart from working better, also has a better appearance? Perhaps I could reduce the mp3 files sizes? How? Another question that worried me was, when allowing the flash functionality in my moodle site, it advised ('as a default security measure, normal users should not be allowed to embed swf flash files'). Can this be a real problem? What does moodle mean by normal users? How can I avoid lems with this? Cheers, Juan",

All I can say for sure is what I use: small audio files (usually less than 100kb, a large one would be about 300kb) the Moodle media player (with \"waitForPlay=no\") on my university LAN ... and my students don't generally have to wait more than a second or so for the page to load and the media to be ready. It seems to me that 1MB is quite large for an audio file that you want to use in a HP quiz. The more students you have, or the lower the server and network capacity is, or the older your client computers are then the longer you will have to wait for the audio file to download. If you are taking your settings from Stan, then maybe he can give advice on how to optimize them? I suggest you prepare the html verions of the quizzes and put them on your server outside of Moodle, then you can show Stan and maybe he can advise what to do. regards Gordon",

For your information, I haven't had any problems using them in schools LAN even with quite large groups (about 30 students). Probably because they do not usually start the same activity at the same time. The only problem I have is when working with moodle from outside, which is, obviously, due to slow upload in the schools server. Probably a different player would improve things a bit. Perhaps a player that indicates that the sound is downloading. With this, students would know they just have to wait a bit and that 'the thing' is working. Any further suggestions would be welcome. In any case, I have already found some information (this same forum) on how to embed the moodle media player in Hot Potatoes and will give it a try. Cheers",

Just press play! I embed that Flash content in the Reading frame so that students can stop, rewind, etc. easily while completing the activity. To do this, I use MP3 files and a program called MP3 sound stream (shareware). It takes the audio and outputs Flash. Since Moodle has the media filter for MP3 files in other locations, I am able to tell my students that all they need is the Adobe Flash/Shockwave player to handle all audio in my course... Windows media player, while widespread, would be a pain for anyone who runs linux or mac.",

          "Text": "Am using Moodle 3.2 with the last or close to the last version of TaskChain. Not quite sure how these hopes get expressed so I thought I would just post them here. TaskChain is really well developed tool and things evolve. So if I have missed something, let me know. There are two upgrades that I would love to see. The first is that TaskChain update everything coming from the Hot Potatoes Files when those files change. So if the opening instructions change in the linked file, they would also update in the TaskChain. The other is that the task titles update when the linked file is updated. This is really helpful when one is making major changes to lessons on a working server . The only way I know to do this at this point is to edit them manually in edit tasks and edit settings which creates more to pay attention to. I'd rather just edit the files, upload them and let TaskChain take note of all of the changes, including changes to first page instructions and task titles. The second thing I wish is that there were a couple of standard settings rather than or in addition to options with pre- and post-conditions. I realize the pre- and post-conditions really provide total flexibility. However, I am guessing that many educators would mostly use the following three settings: a. The first is where you finish a task and return to a list of tasks and choose your next one. b. The second is where students are simply taken to the next task after finishing a task until they have done all of them. They would also resume at the last unfinished task. If I remember correctly, I believe that these options were part of Quizport back in the day. c. The last one is like the second one only with a previous button. Just a wish list. I know that they may not be simple hopes. I'd be happy to know if others wish the same. I would also be happy to see what settings people use the most when working with pre- and post-conditions.

I understand that by \"opening instructions\" you mean the text on the Entry page of the TaskChain activity. At the moment, I think this comes from the \"Introduction\" of the first task in the chain of tasks. Are you saying that you would like to the the text on the Entry page synched with the \"introduction\" in the first task file? This is exactly what I am saying. Usually, all of my changes/edits occur in the Hot Potatoes file including instructions (which turns into the introduction for the first task in the chain), the exercises, titles and everything else. So with this change, along with others you indicate below, it means that all edits occur in the Hot Potatoes File and TaskChain takes note of them all when it replaces an active file online. This assumes, of course, that the file has been aliased. The other is that the task titles update when the linked file is updated. This is done now.

I have thought about implementing it as a \"conditions template\" which consists of [conditions for 1st task] + [conditions for middle tasks] + [conditions for last task] Right now there are conditions and they really do provide total flexibility. I admit though that it is not something that I have my mind around. My impression from the limited discussion on this list is that few people use them. I might be wrong and should perhaps try again. I mostly use the default where the students move back and forth from each task to a menu of the tasks. What happens is that students learn to pop into one of the tasks where they figure out answers, then they pop out and back in right away to re-do the task and get a better score repeating the process until the task has 100% before they move on to the next task. For some reason, they also don't always do the tasks in order even the the lesson design might call for that. I imagine the hoped for scenario to be progressive or some name that suggests that. In order? Sequential? Linear? It means that the students never see a menu. They start with the first task and when they have finished or when the give up, they would be taken to the next task. So I would also imagine the following buttons: Abandon (which would take them back to Moodle and should they re-enter, they would return to the task they were at when they abandoned), Check (which checks their answers. Ìf they are at 100% they would be taken to the next task or out if it is the last task. It would be great if it told them which task number they were going to on the total number of tasks - so task 2 on 10, for example.) Give Up and Continue (which sets the score for the current task and takes them to the next task. I expect that this is where some teachers might like to have conditions in that it might permit a student to breeze through all of the tasks without putting in much effort and then start a new attempt in a situation where the exercises were supposed to build on each other.) My impression is that Quizport, back in the day, had this built in. (c) is a new idea for me. I see what you mean. The Quiz module has this kind of navigation where you can move around to other questions.

To really make (c) work, I think we would have to sort out the difficulty of restoring an HotPot to a previous semi-complete state. Previous may not be all that useful. Perhaps teachers that would allow it, would be inclined to use the default. Thanks for all your work Gordon. This is an amazing tool given the rich variety of tools that it allows us to work with in chains in Moodle. Mel",

          "Text": "Hi, I have made a hotpot quiz where students are required to answer a question by choosing from the correct answer from two multichoice response audio files(mpeg-3) that i have embedded in the answer section. The problem is that although I specify the height = 30 and width=100 of the wmv player, when i go to view the quiz in the browser, the player always shows a size much greater than i set it to. (If I choose multi-select instead, then the player size i specified remains intact). I have tried to force the media plug in in the hotpot activity settings, and while this does keep the flash player size small, the audio speed is too fast and unintelligible. Is there a way to keep the specified wmv player settings intact in the quiz using the multichoice answer function, or if I use the force media plug in in the hotpot activity settings, to make the flash player sound intelligible and play at normal speed? Any help appreciated! cheers Robert",

          "Text": "Hi all! This \"bug report\" is not strictly related to either Tomas's HotPot nor Gordon's HotPotatoes modules but it might be of interest to anyone using HP-authored exercises on a Moodle platform. We are using Moodle 1.4.2 at our university. I have recently authored a few sample Hot Potatoes exercises (with version 6) and have uploaded them to our Moodle server . To my surprise, the HTML exercises did not work: it looks as if the Javascript is not recognized by our Moodle installation, the buttons, etc. just sit there but can't be activated! On the other hand I have been unable to replicate the problem on my various local installations of Moodle (1.1.3, 1.5, with various brands of Apache , etc.): locally on my machine it works fine... I have finally found a solution: when you save an exercise to HTML, Hot Potatoes version_6 offers you the choice to save it either as one HTML file or as 2 separate files: an HTML file and a JS file. Strangely enough, an exercise thus saved and uploaded to our Moodle server works, whilst the former solution of date+code in one file did not... If this workaround can be useful to other perplexed HP+Moodle users, then I won't quite have lost my day. On the other hand, I'd really be curious to hear of others who have had this strange experience and of other ways to solve the problem. All the best, Joseph_R",

I have made some JCloze that has a picture. I know how to put a picture in HotPotatoes, I did it all the time in version 1.9. I do not know how to figure out the URL of the image saved in my Moodle course files, in order to put the URL in the HotPot. I uploaded them at the same time, tried putting them in the same folder, made sure I made the actual HotPot the main file... All the questions I've seen in the forum up until this point seem to be about older versions, or way too technical for me to understand. Also when I checked it myself, the picture shows up where it's supposed to be, but when my students try the JCloze, the Alt Text is the only thing that shows for the picture. This makes me think that it's something to do with a file only I have access to, but not my students. HotPot 6.3 Release 0 Build 4",

After Googling for the message - have you tried Googling for the message? - I saw that this message can be caused by many things including something as appararently trivial as empty blank lines at the beginning of an XML file. You do not say what kind of video you are trying to insert or how you are trying to insert it, neither do you say what kind of Hot Potatoes exercise you are using nor do you tell us what settings you are using for the HotPot activity, but from the very limited information you have given, I would guess that you need to look at any XML files associated with the video.",

Doing either hot potatoes or texttoys exercises with an embedded video clip outside moodle environment does not result in this problem-that is, clicking on an answer does not result in the wmv player reverting to the beginning I have tested it using moodle 1.5.3 and 1.7- same result. Anyone have the same experience, and if they did, have they been able to fix it? Cheers robert",

Context : Using Hot Potatoes quizzes in a Moodle course (not QuizPorts). Some students get the \"No More Attempts Allowed\" message, and I don't know why. The quizzes in this group are all new files; that is, no activity here points to a quiz file that has been used before in the course. I set the activities up this way to eliminate one possibility for why the error message might appear. (1) Some quizzes, which students had never seen before (they were only just made available) opened for several students with the \"No More Attempts Allowed\" error message. This was the first thing they saw, before beginning the quiz ever. (2) Two or three students got the \"No More Attempts\" message during the quiz, but could not remember what they had just been doing to bring it on. I was walking around the class most of the time, so I doubt anyone was doing anything exceptionally strange. (3) Before thinking, one student popped out with \"Oh, I know how I got that message!\" and said it happened when she opened another window. I asked her in various ways to describe just what she did, what it meant to open another window, if this was a tab or another window or another application -- but she immediately became evasive. This suggested to me that she might have been opening another tab or window in an attempt to look up answers to the quiz questions, and she was unwilling to reveal anything more. (4) One student (who makes high scores and has no reason to cheat) got the No More Attempts message partway through a quiz. When I went looking for his Attempt to reset it, I did not find it. All the other students' attempts showed, but not his, so I could not delete his attempt. It did not show up an hour later. I could see in his Activity Report that he had begun this quiz, but it did not show up in the place where I might reset it. How can I reset an attempt in such a case, so he can repeat the quiz? The only method I've worked out is to increase the number of attempts from 1 to 2 -- though, once they figure this out, this just allows some students to take the quiz twice and take the higher grade. I'll try again tomorrow, but it is hard to do something new on the last class. Some students have already gone home for the semester in all ways but in body...",

In those cases, the completed quiz just sat there on the screen, neither closing nor giving any indication that the score had, in fact, been submitted (it had). I do not know if the change in code caused the Thanks page to disappear, and for only some students with some quizzes. Erratic problems are frustrating. There was too much to do tonight to pursue the “No More Attempts Allowed” problem. I spent more time monitoring student usage, however, and I see some opening Facebook and email in the middle of completing a quiz. This may affect the No More Attempts problem. More legitimately, they may click between the quiz in progress and a second window containing a list of the quizzes to be completed. However, some students still logged on to a quiz, for the first time, and got a No More Attempts message. The class is over now except for the final exam, so I won't have another opportunity to troubleshoot the Attempts problem. All told, some this group of students -- two classes of about 20 -- had inexplicable difficulty executing the quizzes. And I had to spend far too much time deleting failed attempts. I hope the next iteration of this course, which will group the quizzes into QuizPort sequences, will go more smoothly.",

I read the forum and I found a few differences - you were using Hot Potatoes and we are using the Quiz module; you experienced the error when students first got into the test and we experience it when we save or submit the test; you had access to change tabs and windows - in our Testing Lab, the browser was secured with the Respondus LockDown Browser; and we haven't had an issue where the student's attempt is not visible, whereas, you had to look at reports to see if the student attempted it. After reading this, I came up with a chart to see what the similarities and differences were: Testing Lab (university owned computers in a controlled environment): Uses the Respondus LockDown Browser (LDB) (cannot navigate from the test) Uses IE8 (the LDB is masking over IE ) PC only Tests were imported with Respondus 4.0 this semester Pharmacy (students use their own laptops): Does not use the LockDown Browser or any other security browser (students could open other tabs, windows, or applications) IE, Safari, Firefox PC and Macs Tests were imported with Respondus 4.0 this semester Error messages occurs when: Some students click on \"Save without submitting\" Some students click on \"Save and submit\" Are the tests submissions recorded? Sometimes, all of the answers are recorded. Sometimes, all of the the answers are completely gone and the test is blank. Sometimes, the answers are partially saved and partially blank. What can be causing this?  It is as if Moodle loses connection to the servers after a quiz has been started, so when the student goes to save or submit, it fails.  Could it be a Javascript issue? (I have also posted this to the Quiz Module since my situation is dealing with quizzes.)",

          "Text": "As is often the case in Moodle, the \"best\" way, depends how familiar you are with the tools you have at your disposal. For me, the quickest way would be to extract the information from the Moodle database . If you have access to a database administration program, such as phpMyAdmin , you could extract the lesson pages with something like the following SQL : SELECT title,contents FROM mdl_ lesson_pages WHERE lessonid IN (SELECT id FROM mdl_lesson WHERE course= 99 ) You may need to change \"mdl_\" to whatever prefix database table prefix your Moodle site is using (\"mdl_\" is the default). Also, you need to change the \"99\" to whatever the id is for the course where the lessons are. You could take the above idea a stage further and have the database server create the html too. The following code works on a MySQL server: SELECT CONCAT( '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"', ' \"h t tp://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">', '<html><head>', '<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />', '<title>',title,'</title>', '</head><body>',contents,'</body></html>' ) AS copy_and_paste_to_an_html_file FROM mdl_ lesson_pages WHERE lessonid IN (SELECT id FROM mdl_ lesson WHERE course= 99 ) As before, you will need to change \"99\", and maybe \"mdl_\", to suitable values for your Moodle course and database. regards Gordon",

When I make a flashcard exercise the \"give up\" button doesn't work (it works fine for gapfil and drag and drop exercises). This problem has repeated both on a local install (using easyphp) and on a remote site. It is also the same with Firefox / IE . Also, the \"give up\" button itself is not being detected as being unicode and is appearing in garbled form when the site language is switched over to Japanese. Does anybody have any ideas about these problems? Best regards, James Phillips",

I have furhter fixed your hotpot-full.js, so that the modifications to let FLashCards work, do not interfere with the other types of quiz. It should all work OK now. The Japanese \"Give Up\" appeared because the encoding for the HotPot htm file is \"iso-8859-1\", but the Japanese messages are encoded as unicode. If your browser shows garbled characters, you will need to tell (=force) it to use the unicode encoding when displaying that page. A more permanent fix would be to open up the htm file and locate the following line: <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset= iso-8859-1 \" /> Then change the above line to: <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset= utf-8 \" /> Probably, the HotPot module should do that for you, and I might make that change in the near future. all the best Gordon",

Is that right? The HotPot module was never intended to work with the JMatch Flashcard format, because the Flashcard format does not produce a \"score\" and there is no information about which words were shown or whether the student was able to give a correct response or not. If the FlashCard exercise is not in a \"chain\" of other HotPot exercises, then I suggest you add the FlashCard exercise as a Moodle \"Resource\" activity, rather than as a \"HotPot\" activity. Then you will not have to mess with the scripts and you can rest assured that your site will have no problems upgrading in the future. However, I understand that you probably have good reasons to want to implement this modification so without further ado, here is the link to the amended file: hotpot-full.flashcard.js regards Gordon P.S.

One way you could adjust the size of individual text boxes would be to generate an html file for the Hot Potatoes quiz and then adjust the CSS styles on the individual text boxes to make them the size you want. Then, upload the HTML file to use as the source file for a HotPot/TaskChain activity. Another way, would be to use the jcl file as the source file for the HotPot/TaskChain activity, but then specify a configuration file that includes the CSS styles you want. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to regenerate the HTML and manually edit it every time you make an adjustment to the quiz. Also, you may well be able to use the configuration file on several HP quizzes. Both of these methods require a working knowledge of HTML and CSS, and as such may be considered too \"technical\" by some teachers to make them suitable solutions.",

The files also uploaded and it is in the moodledata directory. My issue is after user updated the answer and image he can view his submitted answers and image. But all the answers are visible but the images is not visible. If i copied and paste the image location I got this error \"Sorry, the requested file could not be found\". I am trying to fix this issues but I cant get any idea. Kindly help me to solve this issue. Thanks, Sankar.",

So I fixed it. Henceforth, QuizPort will always check the post-conditions on the most recently attempted quiz and act accordingly. If the conditions specify \"End of unit\" the unit attempt will be marked \"Completed\". Otherwise, the unit attempt will be left \"in progress\" and the student will be shown the quiz specified by the post-conditions. If there are no post-conditions, then QuizPort will check to see if all the quizzes have been completed, and if so, the unit attempt will be marked \"Completed\". Otherwise the unit attempt will be left \"in progress\" and the student will be shown a menu of quizzes that are available, i.e. quizzes whose pre-conditions are satisfied. Please download the latest version of QuizPort when you can, and check that it behaves more inline with how you thought it would. QuizPort module for Moodle 1.0 - 1.9 thanks Gordon",

I found that conference where you discuss the various aspects of Quizport and how to implement features. I would stop it and go back a little as I tried conditions, etc. Once I got the hang of things was able to add various hotpots fairly quickly. I dry ran it and it seemed to work fine. I guess I did not try the very last one. My students have used Moodle only a few times. I have been using it as supplement for review and reinforcement. This was the first time the students did a Quizport. Beforehand I told they had to repeat some hotpots until they obtained a certain percentage. Because this was a review for a test, I made them get 100% on everything. They got upset when they were booted out of the last one. During lunch I thought about putting an exit page. I made a copy of the entry page and used plain old Wordpad at school to edit it. Then as mentioned earlier everything went fine. Thanks, Jeff PS.

I was wondering whether it is possible or will be possible in the future to add a secure window feature to quizport? (something like moodle quiz has now). Cheers Robert",

I don't think you can achieve your goal with technology alone. It would be possible to replicate the \"secure\" window that the Quiz module has - indeed we are halfway there already, because you can have a QuizPort display in a new popup window without any controls. However even if you use a \"secure\" window, I am sure your students would quickly realize that if they open another browser window they can initiate another quiz attempt from there (in another \"secure\" window) and you would be back to the situation you are currently in. The only way to stop them looking a several quiz attempts at once is to limit the number of quiz attempts to 1. How about give them free access to several preparatory quizzes and set up a final quiz to allow only one attempt and be weighted to 50% of the unit grade, while the the earlier quizzes are set to \"Equal weighting\". Just before the final quiz, you can insert an html page which says something like: Well done for getting this far you have only one more quiz to do You will only have one attempt at the next quiz Click \"Continue\" when you are ready to begin You can also put an explanatory html page or two at the beginning of the chain to explain the methodology of the unit and that in order to do well on the final quiz, it is important to not only find the answers on the earlier quizzes, but to understand why the correct answers are correct.",

Please download it and install it and let me know if it works better now for you. I tried using the \"New window\" setting on my Moodle 2.0 site and the TaskChain displayed with no problem, so to help you any further with this I need to know the PHP error that is causing the problem. Could you go to  the Moodle debugging page (Site administation -> Development -> Debugging), and then use the following settings: Debug messages: DEVELOPER Display debug messages: YES Remember to click the \"Save changes\" button at the bottom of the page. regards Gordon",

Or, if you want to leave Moodle's debugging at \"Developer\", you can add the following line at line 1082 in \"course/lib.php\" $mod[$seq] = new stdClass(); However, you will probably get more PHP warnings because basically the version of Moodle you are using is old and not intended for the version of PHP that is running on your server. You will fix many problems if you upgrade to a more recent version of Moodle. When you upgrade your site, you will need to upgrade to Moodle 2.2 first, and then upgrade to the most recent stable version of Moodle - currently Moodle 2.6. regards Gordon",

I am talking about settings and tables in the Moodle database ; specifically the tables used by Moodle's HotPot module. The Moodle database is on the web server where your Moodle site is hosted. If you are an administrator of the web site, you may have access to the database and you can have a look at the database tables there, on the server. If you look at the database tables, then I think my previous message will make more sense. The database tables are not on your PC and you cannot view them using JQuiz.",

Here is an example of one of them. http://www.strivney.com/new/mod/taskchain/attempt.php?cnumber=-1&taskid=4452&action=preview Even if I delete the TaskChains and re-build them - which I don't want to do because they have taken me hours to build (I've got a complicated setup) - I will still need to change the links once I create the new TaskChains and as am unable to add new tasks, it seems I will never succeed. I hope I have made my problem clear; it's complicated and I am having a bit of a melt down! Hoping you can wave your magic wand and resolve all these issues. Thank you, Deborah",

There are two things I suggest you do: Try setting a a different htm file, such as \"A_Encouragement_11.htm\", as the \"Main file\" for this task.

The romanian version of this can be found here http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ro/cniv_2005/volum/documente/pdf/sectiuneaC/24_13_IVlasin.pdf . I suppose that is no verry difficult to understand the main ideea. Now I want to use this with moodle. Before to try I want ask experts that use the hot potatoes module and integrate the quiz with moodle if I can use same quiz with moodle. I want to save the results. I attach an example (5 quiz without images), you can try to see the automaticaly jump after 3 responces to next/previous level if the responces is all good/ bad. The conditions: the score after a number of questin is in some limits. Enter on nivel 3 or another. Thanks!",

There are several ways to come closer to your goal: you can modify the Hot Potatoes html files: http://hotpot.uvic.ca/howto/hacking_workshop/task_10.htm you can try the \"Activity Locking\" modificiation to Moodle: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=933 you can experiement with branching in the Lesson module However, the new HotPot module, which will come out in the next few weeks, will include the ability to add pre- and post- conditions. You can use the pre-conditions to lock a quiz based on the score and study time of other quizzes. Once a quiz is finished, you can define what to do next based on the score. For example, you can repeat the quiz, do an earlier quiz, do the next quiz, skip ahead two quizzes, and so on. regards Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, I gather you are busy, or away?  Sorry to keep adding more questions here.  I'm just working on a deadline to convert to Moodle 2.6 by end of March so hoping to iron out the various problems. I have found that if I try to add more tasks to an existing TaskChain via: Edit Tasks>Add (more) Tasks>select file from File Systems Repository - it adds the new task and renders the existing tasks in the TaskChain unusable.  I have copied the error I get below. I have gotten round this by adding all the files I need for the TaskChain in one file, but due to the way I originally built the files it means I have to put all the files for four large TaskChains into one file and I end up with over 1,000 items in the file. So I have two questions: 1.  Is it possible to build TaskChains from different source files? 2.  If I use a file with over 1,000 items will it slow down the functioning of Taskchain while it has to search for the various resources in the file?

Especially when I want my student to re-do the test the 2nd time at least, say 60 mins later, after the 1st trial, it's good to the students not only they have enough time for revision but also their 2nd trial may not mainly depend on \"memory\". This could be applied to Hotpot exercises which I use it mainly for exercises, Classwork and assignment & revision purpose. I'm running a Moodle 1.6+ and I wonder which files should I add the \"timedelay\" functions if I want the same functions in all hotpot exercises. Should I insert a \"content page\" before a hotpot page? I hope someone could give me a hint. Thanks in advance. James",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, Thanks for responding so rapidly on the Find-It problems. Sorry I wasn't around to answer your questions to clarify the problems. Now I'm writing about another problem you already know about: my students are still finding that an attempt has been classified as \"Abandoned\" when they did not intend it. They have to start a new attempt. I've told them they don't have to start again from the beginning, but it means I have to manually add up the scores on the two attempts to find out what their real score for the unit is. Fortunately, it hasn't happened more than once in a unit to any student. I've asked them to report to me what exactly they were doing when the unit becomes \"abandoned\" but they're not very techie people and I haven't had any replies. The course finishes at the end of next week and I'd really like to get to the bottom of the problem before then. I still don't really understand what \"Abandoned\" means or why it is necessary to have this possibility. I would have thought \"In progress\" and \"Completed\" would be sufficient. If a student wants to deliberately mark an attempt as abandoned, what do they have to do? This \"abandoned\" problem concerns individual exercises as well as units but students don't complain about the exercises because it usually doesn't take too long to redo one exercise. Has anyone else had this problem? Do you remember, Gordon, you said some time ago you'd look into the possibility of students being able to go back into a \"Completed\" unit? Have you had time to look into this? Very occasionally a student completes a unit with a low score and then would like to go back and redo the exercises for which they had low scores or which were classified as \"Abandoned\". There are also conscientious students who just want another look at the exercises.",

I am not sure how to explain abandoned in a way that will make sense to you. Abandoned means abandoned. The student started the attempt and then chose to do something else. They abandoned the attempt. They may have been shown a message which said \"if you leave this attempt you cannot resume it\". Maybe they left off from doing an attempt that can be resumed, in which case the status of that attempt would have been left as \"in progress\". Later they could have come back and resumed that attempt. That's OK. No problem there. However, if they later chose to start a new attempt rather than resume the previous \"in progress\" attempt, then the previous attempts would get marked as \"abandoned\". This is to prevent the situation in which there are lots of \"in progress\" attempts. That would makes it difficult for QuizPort to decide what to do next. Have you tried setting the QuizPort \"Allow resume\" setting to \"Force\" ? Gordon",

But is there a way, perhaps with Quizport, to have only one master file containing the course, from which each separate course (or section) draws contents? -- And thus avoid duplicating the quizzes and assignments in each separate instance of the course? This arrangement would simplify making changes to the individual parts of the master file. As things now stand, with each course holding a copy of all the course contents, I have to make each change in each copy of the course. I don't think using Groups will do what I want, unless there something about Groups I have not appreciated. Any thoughts? -- Thanks, Gerald.",

QuizPort can handle the sharing of resource between Moodle courses in two ways: store the quizzes in the site files folder if the course teacher is also a Moodle adminsitrator and can access the site files folder, then you can put your quizzes in the site files folder and from the QuizPort quiz settings page select \"Site files\" as the location of the quiz file access the quizzes via a url when entering the source file a Q uizPort quiz, instead using a path within either the course files or site files folder, you can enter a url that begins with \"http://\". The url can be for a file anywhere on the internet that your students can access. This method allows you to share resource between different Moodle sites even if they are on different servers. hope that helps! Gordon",

Four Hot Potatoes JQZ files are set up so that, if student gets 90 or more, he advances to the next quiz; gets 89 or below, repeats the current quiz. Grading is set to unlimited attempts, highest grade. The \"repeat at 89 or below\" works (but see below) for all but the last quiz in the sequence. If I get less than 89 on the last (4th) quiz, Quizport takes that as the grade, averages that in the gradebook, and returns to the front page . I am not given the chance to retake that last quiz, even though I am given that chance for the others. As a result, a student who does poorly on the final quiz cannot retake it and raise his grade, even though the settings seem to permit this. A puzzling detail: On quizzes 1-3, when I get less than 89, instead of being taken back to the beginning of the current quiz, I am taken to a chart showing my grades in the quizzes so far, with no instruction on what to do now. When I get 89 or below, why doesn't it just take me back to the start of the quiz, as the postcondition says it should?",

QuizPort had been assuming that if at least one quiz attempt was completed, then that quiz could be marked as completed. But obviously this was not the case in a situation like yours, where a quiz attempt with a score of 50% could be said to be \"completed\", but where the post-conditions specify that a score of 50% requires re-doing the same quiz. I have modified QuizPort to detect this situation and act accordingly and I tested that a copy of your QuizPort that I created on my server behaves as required. When you have time, please could you download and install the modified QuizPort scripts and confirm that your QuizPort now does what you want it to do. download the QuizPort module for Moodle 1.0 - 1.9 Thanks again for giving me access to your site to have a look at the issue first hand. best regards Gordon",

          "Text": "Hello everyone, I am just wondering, and perhaps Gordon _hi there_  could answer, why it is not possible for Moodle to work with SCORM or HotPot files that are not actually \"within\" the course page. Why can it not \"import\"/read the files off from a \"distant\" repository? I'm asking this for 2 main reasons: Backup/Restore and Update still do not work well at this stage, even with the latest Moodle stable. Just this morning I was updating an html JQuiz (just a typo). The activity (in the course) was an alias from \"Private\". I modifed the \"Private\" file (which did have the \"chain\" showing it was linked to that course). But the \"old\" file with the typo kept showing up when the activity was called for. I had to delete the \"alias\" in the activity, then insert the new file, set it as \"main\" to have it show the corrected screen. That's all very well for one file, but what happens when you have tens, in several course? If there was a way to have the tables of Taskchain look for exercises \"outside\" Moodle, that would be great _under the condition that Moodle would not have to \"hardcopy\" the file before using it, in which case, we would return square one, not always having the latest file showing up.

          "Text": "Hi Philippe, in answer to your question, I would say that from a Moodle 2.x viewpoint, the most complete way to control access to content in any part of Moodle is to give each part of Moodle a \" context \", and then make sure only users who are allowed to can access and operate in that context. As you may be aware, Moodle has a hierarchy of these \"contexts\": Site -> Course category -> Course Section -> Activity Block By enforcing access by context, we can be sure that materials are only available to people who it is supposed to be shown to. In the good old days of Moodle 1.9 we didn't have strict enforcement of this policy. However, the software was always evolving in that direction. Now we are here in the brave new world of Moodle 2.x, and the changes in the file storage system are something we must adapt to. If files are not updated when they are supposed to be, we should find out why and fix it. Maybe TaskChain should allow the use of external URLs to specify the source file, in the same way that QuizPort does. I have held off introducing this functionality, because it seemed to me that Moodle 2.x does not expect modules to do that. QuizPort / TaskChain have their own file cache. At least in the case of QuizPort I can say confidently that is *does* detect when the remote file has been updated and recreate the local cache. The PHP code that dose this has been tried and tested and could be brought into TaskChain. There are several other programming tasks in front of that though, so I suggest you first course of action is to report the problem with file content not being updated. regards Gordon",

Anytime, for example, a multiple choice answer button is clicked, the whole page is refreshed which can take a while. When I'm using a Moodle navigation frame instead, the page is not refreshed after every single click and responds instantly.

Two things that I notice about quiz \"test8.htm\" is that firstly there a lot (40-50) options for each JQuiz question, and secondly you are using an external stylesheet to modify the display. There should be nothing wrong with doing either of those things, but together they make this quiz significantly different from JQuiz exercises I have seen in the past, so I have a hunch at least of them is causing the slowness. There is also an external javascript file, test8.js, but that seems to be the standard Hot Potatoes javascript - is that right? Would it be possible for you to upload the jqz file too, so that I can see what happens with less questions, less options per questions and so on? thanks Gordon P.S. Out of interest what browser are the exercises being viewed on, and how fast is the PC on which they will be viewed? I ask this because when I view the exercises on Firefox 2, on a 1.6GHz Dual Core machine running Windows 2003, the slowness is not so troubling for me.

          "Text": "Hi Deborah, I suggest you just leave the \"Score weighting\" at 100% for any quizzes that you want to contribute toward the unit grade. QuizPort will then give them all equal weighting. Actually the weighting is relative, so they don't need to all add up to 100%. You can just think in rough terms and QuizPort will smooth over the gaps so that every thing will be a percentage in the end. The \"Equal weighting\" categories are for Quizports which split into separate streams. For example, you might have an \"intro\" quiz which asks students whether they want to take the easy, medium or advanced stream. The score weightings on the quizzes in each stream would be set as follows: Easy: Equal weighting (1) Medium: Equal weighting (2) Advanced: Equal weighting (3) In this way, the quizzes in each stream are put together into a weighting groups. You don't to worry about how many quizzes there are in each stream. QuizPort will make sure that the weightings are such that whatever stream they take, the maximum possible unit grade for doing all the quizzes in one stream is 100%. Probably, I have not made myself very clear. I fear that explanation would only make sense if you already understood what i was talking about ?! But the long and the short of it is generally you will only need to use a quiz score weighting of 100%. Then all scoring quizzes contribute equally to the unit attempt grade. Non-scoring quizzes should have a weighting of 0%.",

Nevertheless, when I make a JCross activity in HotPot6, the gradebook doesn't seem to integrate. JMix, JMatch, and JCloze have worked fine in 6... If anyone could offer advice for integrating JCross with the gradebook in Moodle 3.8, I'd be very grateful. Best wishes, Andrew Obermeier",

          "Text": "Hi folks, I found another bug that was causing the Cloze function not to work properly, but first some background info... The hotpot module works by scanning the code of the .htm file that you have created with Hot Potatoes and adding special code to it. It does this in two steps, 1) the scan attempts to detect which Hot Pot module the file is for. This isn't so easy because the code itself for many modules nowhere explicitly says \"This is the JMATCH module\" etc. so I've got to find a snippet of code that appears to be unique to that module in order to identify it. 2) After it has determined what module it is working with, then it continues to look further down in the code to find the appropriate place to insert the code for outputting the results. This, too, varies from module to module. Now, it turns out that the snippet of code that I was using to search for the JMatch module also existed in the JCLOZE module. Thus the .HTM file was wrongly identified and the code never found the appropriate place to insert the Moodle output code. The file that is attached here goes inside moodle/mod/hotpot. Could some of you who were having problems try this and report back? It works for me, but hey, with computers that often doesn't mean much!",

One is a dictionary file that goes in moodle/lang/en/ In Moodle 1.4 onwards the file is there already when you install Moodle, so there is no reason to add it. The other hotpot.php file is the engine that runs the module and goes in moodle/mod/hotpot/ You can try verifying that you've got the right files by opening your moodle/lang/en/hotpot.php file to see if it has language definitions or not. Could you send me a copy of the .HTM file that you say isn't working for me to look at? I need your ORIGINAL file, not the one that the hotpot module creates.",

The change you need to make is in the djmix.ht_ file. As you've already realised, you need to change \"var DropTotal = 3\" to \"var DropTotal = 1\" You may need to make some other changes to give your images enough space.

You can also have QuizPort change the number of lines for you, if you specify a config file, like the one attached, which has some extra XML tags to set the number of drop lines. These tags do not exist in a standard JMix XML file, but if QuizPort detects them in either the XML file (e.g. you added them by hand), on in the config file, then it will adjust the JavaScript line that you found and Glenys also highlighted. regards Gordon P.S. The attached file also sets the font on your JMix to \"Verdana\" because that is a commonly available font that differentiates between \"1\" (one), \"l\" (lowercase \"L\") and \"I\" (uppercase \"i\")",

After you have uploaded the complete Xerte folder containing the \"index.html\" file and all the secondary files, then select the \"index.html\" file as the main file. In Moodle 2.5, you do this by clicking on the file and then clicking the \"Set as main file\" button. If you are adding a new TaskChain, it will help a little if you set \"Files to be added\" to \"Add selected file only\", but this is not crucial to the success of the operation. Hope that helps!

          "Text": "Hi All, I want to see if my approach is proper/best practice given my situation. My district just switched to what I think is Moodle 2.2. Back in the good-ole 1.9/QuizPort days, I kept HotPots that I would chain together via a QP in a folder that generally had a subfolder with images in it. I do not want to change this setup . I would upload a zip of this and so on and so forth. Given how the File Picker and file management works now here is my approach. For the first HotPot I upload the zip of all related files. Unzip. Drill down and point the HotPot that I want. Make copy of this HotPot. (The copy function is one nice thing about Moodle 2.) Change name and point to the appropriate HotPot in this series. Repeat 4 & 5 as necessary. (This seems to work. Have not check rigorously yet.) Pseudochain by setting conditions to force the one to be completed before the next one can be completed. Is there a better approach? I don't like having duplicates because of wasted server space. However, for me it is too much work and local duplication with my file organization to separate them out. Thanks, Jeff PS. Is there a short cut way to figure out the Moodle version? The Moodle icon at bottom offers no info. I have been pestering the tech folks with other issues that are more important right now. I will ask them but can wait for now.",

Martin Holmes has always argued that students shouldn't get any credit for clicking on what they know must be the correct answer, but he did, as so often, tell me how to do what I wanted. If you want students when they click on the last answer in a JQuiz to see either a : - ) or an X as the case demands, this is how to do it: In jquiz6.js_ Find //Show the feedback ShowMessage(Feedback); //New for 6.2.2.1: If you want to mark an answer as correct even when it's the final choice, uncomment this line. // if (I[QNum][3][ANum][2] >= 1){Btn.innerHTML = CorrectIndicator;}else{Btn.innerHTML = IncorrectIndicator;} return; } Change to //Show the feedback ShowMessage(Feedback); //New for 6.2.2.1: If you want to mark an answer as correct even when it's the final choice, uncomment this line. if (I[QNum][3][ANum][2] >= 1){Btn.innerHTML = CorrectIndicator;}else{Btn.innerHTML = IncorrectIndicator;} return; } Cheers, Glenys",

Just an FYI: I initially installed the latest HotPot plugin, but then I ran into problems with the required qformat_hotpot. The zip file for qformat_hotpot (linked from the most current hotpot plugin download page ) doesn't have an install script, only an upgrade script, so I had to first install a base moodle-2x.hotpot-module.zip and then upgrade using the latest files above.",

Do you have a huge library of such activities ? The playful message you got comes from the Hot Potatoes quiz itself, not the HotPot module. I think Martin H. and Stewart A. (the creators of Hot Potatoes) were feeling a little frustrated supposedly \"free\" web-hosting sites inserting adverts into pages. I am slightly puzzled by the problems you report with installing mod_hotpot and qformat_hotpot. In particular, what makes you think that qformat_hotpot needs \"install\" script? Did you get some kind of message? Can you show me a screen shot of the message, or tell me how I can reproduce it? cheers Gordon",

The release notes for the latest mod_hotpot provide a link to the HotPot question import script . That zip file only has a db/upgrade.php, no install.php. When I went to Site administration > Notifications, I was greeted with an install need for both mod_hotpot and qformat_hotpot.

Well done. Although the HotPot activity module does not recognize HP5 questions, I have a feeling that maybe the HotPot question import script will allow you import HP5 questions into the Moodle question bank, as long as you import from the original \".jcl\", \".jcw\", \".jmt\", \".jmx\" and \".jqz\" files, that is to say, you can't import from the htm/html files. Please try that and let us know how you get on. best regards Gordon",

Something on your server is replacing \"<?\" with \"<?php\". For your information, this original line has been like that since Sept 2013, so I suspect that during the recent upgrade, not only was the HotPot module upgraded, but so was PHP, or at least some of the PHP settings were changed. Perhaps you now have PHP's\n\"short_open_tag On\", where it was set to \"Off\" before? Or perhaps there is some other filter at work that was not active before? Anyway, I have added a space between the \"<\" and the \"?\", so I hope this fixes the issue on your server. Please update your HotPot module and let me know if this fix works for you. Please be aware that the \"<?\" also occurs in the following scripts in Moodle core, so other plugins are also probably causing errors on your server: lib/evalmath/evalmath.class.php <? mod/chat/lib.php $query = \"(version<>'basic' AND lastping<?)

What I hope to do is each week post a drill or quiz on whatever grammatical feature we're doing, and let the students re-take it as many times as they want, until they get at least 90%. Ideally the questions would be a random selection from a pool, but at least they should be randomly ordered.  Can I do that? How? THANKS!!!

          "Text": "First, I am great fun of HotPot and I want to thanks to Gordon for his great effort and hard work! These days I have one dilemma, and I would like to here more opinions about it. At this moment we develop one moodle course that will go on monthly basis, with between 300 and 2000 users. During this one month period, users must solve 14  moodle quizes with about 10 questions in order to be graded. Except that \"exams\", course will have 14 \"excercises\" with 10-20 qustions that will not be graded. Those \"excercises\" could be made equaly in hotpot or with modle quiz activity. Questions are pretty simple, multiple choice or match, nothing specific, so it could be made one way or another. We use moodle 2.4 on cloud linux hosting (not shared) with good CPU and possibilty to change amount of RAM up to 8GB, initially it would be 2GB. I'm interested in your opinion of what is best from the perspective of improved Moodle performance, should we create those excercises like hotpot quizes or moodle quizes? I am aware of pros and cons for both hotpot (this one is my favorite) and moodle quizes in moodle context , but at this moment, better performance (smooth and eazy) is crucial. I was thinkig to made two courses with same quizes, first one maded with hotpot and second with moodle quizes, and to use tools for performace testing before we start to use this course in real context. If anyone have some expirience, opinion or comment, I would be gratefull to hear it. Regards.",

If you generate html files for your JCross exercises and use those as the \"Source file\" for your JCross HotPot activities in Moodle, then you will need to locate and modify the \"jcross6.js_\" file on your PC, then regenerate all the JCross html files from within JCross, and finally load the html files back up to appropriate HotPot activities within Moodle. regards Gordon",

I am sure it will be possible to get the results of those stored in Moodle one day, using the HotPot module. Your vb6.exe script sounds ingeneous too. A useful addition to the tool kit of busy teachers. One point I might make though, is that we should perhaps be careful of going to far down the path of making tools which create or modify the Hot Potatoes XML , because that software might then threaten the development of the original Hot Potatoes software which Martin H. and Stewart A. If there was no need to download Hot Potatoes, then people wouldn't and then license funds would not go back to continue the development of the software. As far as \"technical insight\" goes though, I think you have shown you have considerable quantities of that! Congratulations! regards Gordon",

Perhaps you would like to take a look at the attached file which has *all* the phrases used by the QuizPort module. You can get a feel for the way similar phrases should be worded. I know you don't like the word \"test\", and you may be relieved to know that when the QuizPort module becomes TaskChain chain module all the quizzes will be called \"tasks\". In English anyway, \"activity\" and \"exercise\" already have a Moodle-specific meanings so I would think there would be a good possibility of confusion if we adopot those terms as the default. However, Moodle being Moodle is flexible, so you can create your own language pack, \"moodledata/lang/fr_utf8_local/quizport.php\", and then use whatever stringsf you like. best regards Gordon",

Do you want the strings at the bottom to be translated too? Or is there a reason for them to remain in English? I'm curious to know how the translations of the interface have been done up to now. Yes, I'll be much more comfortable with \"task\": all tests are tasks but not all tasks are texts. I know it's difficult to find terms that satisfy everybody and don't already have a specific meaning in Moodle. I find it difficult to know what to call the ...err segments (that doesn't have Moodle meaning does it?) of my courses. I used to call them Modules and then switched to Units but that gets confused with QuizPort units. Yes, I know I can do what a like with terminology when I'm an administrator - but usually I'm not.

FYI , these language files can be edited via the Moodle: MoodleDocs : Language Editing As you say this can usually only be done by a Moodle Administrator. Furthermore, it must be an administrator with the following capabilities enabled: moodle/site:langeditmaster moodle/site:langeditlocal Apparently these capabilities are off default to prevent accidents, but they can be enabled for your Moodle username by a Moodle administrator. > I'm curious to know how the translations of the interface have been done up to now. I gave Philippe the English messages and help files and he put in long hours over the summer translating them. (thanks Philippe!). I know he is busy at the moment, so if you would like to take up the reins and help polish the work done so far and translate the new strings (at the bottom of the French file) that I have added recently, it would be marvellous. If anybody else reading this can help with the translation of the QuizPort messages and help files into other languages - Turkish? Hebrew? - please start by copying the \"mod/quizport/lang/en_utf8\" folder (part of the QuizPort download ) into a new folder for your language. The following thread may be useful for folks new to translating language files in Moodle: Local Language many thanks! Gordon",

Ah, ok. I had not been using this for quite a while and I didn't remember. I do remember discussing this feature (ways for the students to give feedback or ask questions about the exercise in general) with you but I didn't remember what you had decided for the forums. >It seems that you would like the teacher to choose the forum on the >add/edit a HotPot activity page. I can see that would be useful, so we should >think about adding that to the new HotPot module . Yes, I think this would be useful. The way I envisioned this was to create a special forum only devoted to comment on issues related to a particular quiz. So having the selection when the teacher adds/edits a HotPot activity would be the ideal thing because the student would be addressed directly to the most adequate forum. So, how are the plans for the new HotPot module going? I've been sort of disconnected from the Moodle forums for quite a while (only posting desperate messages when I've had problems). So, I have missed a lot of the postings in this and other forums and I'm not as aware about what is going on as I used to be. Do you have a page with the road map for this module? I'd like to know what is in store for HotPot. Thanks for your help. Josep M.",

However, since the exam is over now, perhaps we should concentrate on what we can do to prevent this situation recurring in the future. Actually I don't think HotPot activities are very suitable for exams, because they were not designed for that purpose. HotPot activities are more suitable for explorative learning, homework or revision exercises. I say this, because Hot Potatoes exercises allow students several tries to find the right answer, which is usually not what teachers want for a test. For the final test, I suggest you import the Hot Potatoes files into the Moodle Quiz module and run the test as a Moodle Quiz. best regards Gordon",

When I went back to the task chain, I was presented with the message \"Start a new attempt\". However, as admin I had set \"attempt restrictions\" =>\"allow resume\" => \"yes\". As per the definition of \"yes\" ( see below), there doesn't seem to be that other  choice that I would expect- that is:  \"resume any previous attempt that are still in progress\" . Only \"start new attempt\". Am I missing something here? Do I need to make some other setting as well?  Or do I have to choose \"force\" so that I can continue where I left off. Your directives on what I should do would  be appreciated. Cheers Robert Yes Students will be given the choice to either resume any previous attempts that are still in progress, or start a new attempt.",

Two attemps is rather standard in my system and when I, let's say, I put 8 exercises in a chain, as soon as they have tried exercise 1 or 2 twice (often by accident) they have no entrance anymore to the rest of the chain.

I think the line of code that is causing you problems is in the following function: \n```text\nfunction PreloadImages(){\n\n\n    var a = PreloadImages.arguments;\n\n\n    for (var i=0; i<a.length; i++){\n\n\n        Imgs[i] = new Image();\n\n\n        Imgs[i].src = a[i];\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n```\n Which for reference comes from hp6utilities.js_. You could try changing the fourth line to: `Imgs[i] = (window.Image ? new Image() : document.createElement('img'));` Try the above modification and let me know how you get on. And please send over the html file if you have a minute. thanks Gordon",

You do really need a fast connection, though ... which I don't. Now before Gordon deletes this message as off topic, what I'm desperate to know is if PoodLL can be integrated with Hot Potatoes as it has been with Quiz Poodll Recording Question Type [QUIZ] If I had a real course starting next week and I had to choose between QuizPort (Moodle 1.9) and new PoodLL (Moodle 2) I think I'd jump off a cliff!

TaskChain needs a bit of work in this respect. It's all to do with the notion of state. Both modules maintain information on the current state of the activity, which includes info on what the current chain/task/condition/grade/score/attempt is. I think the confusion comes from the fact that you can get to the task settings page two ways: either form the task's view page, or from the \"Edit tasks\" page. At the moment, TaskChain doesn't know how to distinguish the two, so it guesses that you came from the task's view page and takes you back there. As I remember, QuizPort behanved slightly better, so I will have to revisit that code and see if there isn't a way that TaskChain can be improved on this front. regards Gordon",

You may also choose the grading method as Highest, Average, First, Last. The Average will change, but First and Last attempts will not.

In other words, while a student was in the middle of an attempt, they could re-take a quiz if it was too low. What I am after is letting a student go back into a completed quizport \"attempt\"  at a later time and re-take particular quizzes that they only achieved a low score in, and if they got a better score for any particular quiz, then that would boost their grade for that attempt (and of course be reflected in the gradebook). As I said previously, (and as I understand it), a student is only  able to get a higher score for a quizport attempt by re-doing all the quizzes in  that quizport. (Having said all this, I suppose I could set \"post-conditions\" to a certain percentage, and that would force a student do re-take a particular quiz before moving on to the next quiz in the quizport).

I hope I did not miss anything. Doing this on the command line with nano is definitely not the best way to do this, but I was lucky and the effort seems to have paid off. I guess there are probably scripting tools available to do this in batch jobs, but I am inexperienced in sed or other tools to handle that reliably.

I have used the font \"abcprint\" in some Hot Potatoes for teaching the letters because it was the only font I found which displays the \"q\" with a nice tail.

I apologise if this is a topic for the Hot Potatoes Users Forum - I wasn't sure as the quizzes are displaying like that in Moodle/IE6 (in and out of Quizport). I tried inserting · td, th, li { font-family: \"abcprint\" , Geneva, Arial, sans-serif; } (with and without inverted commas) at the top of the quizzes but it has no effect. Maybe IE6 just won't recognise this irregular font? I was hoping you might be able to let me have one of your magic snippets to fix this. Thank you very much in advance. Deborah",

As far as I know \"abcprint\" is not installed, and so will not be available, on standard Windows and Mac systems. Therefore, if it is important to display a letter in a particular way, I think you need a more reliable method, such as using images. Also, if most fonts in general use do not have a curly tail on the small \"q\", then I don't think it is such an awful thing if the students are introduced to this version of the letter early on. regards Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, Here's a brainteaser. I'm currently playing around with two Moodles (1.9.1 and 1.9.5), both with Quizport installed. On one of them (the one I installed myself) everything works fine. On the other (1.9.5), su bmission of a Qedoc test into Quizport causes an instant timeout of the current user (\" Your session has timed out. Please login again.\"); the timeout occurs between submission of the test and processing of the test, so by the time Quizport tries to do anything with the session, the user is considered to be logged out (so quizport acts as if the user has logged out). Additionally, if the user then tries to use Moodle further, they get the usually session timeout message. This happens on submission, not launch. My current best guess is that the 2nd Moodle needs reinstalling from scratch (it has nothing much on it anyway). However if you've ever come across this timeout problem during development, and happen to know of a cause or solution, your thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks. James PS: Sorry about the red text - can't get rid of it.",

Well, I think it it *very likely* to be cookies, because they are so crucial in the way Moodle keeps track of whether someone is logged in or not. I agree that if the sites are on different domains then there is no chance of the cookies getting confused. Can you submit things from other types of QuizPort quiz page. For example, can you submit from a simple Hot Potatoes quiz OK? > On one of them (the one I installed myself) everything works fine > On the other ... Oh, so I wonder who installed the other one, and if the have the latest version of QuizPort. But as you say, if the malfunctioning site does not have anything important on it, then in yours shoes I would probably reinstall the whole site. regards Gordon",

But then the font size in the menu Options/Configure Output, in the text boxes, is so small it is unreadable. So, I then reset the font size to 8, so it is fine in the options menus, but now the font is large again in the editor window. Apparently there is some way to change the editor font size separate from the menu font size, so how do I do this to fix this situation?",

I think it would be a good idea to have an option to open a hotpot quiz in a new window (ideally, with the ability to hide the browser's menu, address bar, etc). My reason for wanting it would be to save space and get rid of the necessity to scroll. Some of my hotpot quizzes are quite large and (especially in the case of crosswords) it would be great if the quiz could occupy the whole screen. I'm not confident that I could get the two separate windows to \"talk to each other\" as would be needed. I think I know how this could be done. How about opening a popup window which has two frames? One of them (the one which sends the results to the database) is invisible and the other one (the one with the quiz) occupies 100% of the window.

          "Text": "Hi Samuli, As you may know, the questions in a Moodle HotPot activity come from a Hot Potatoes file that is stored within the activity. If you go to the settings page for any Moodle HotPot activity, you will see the Hot Potatoes file in \"Source file\" for that activity. If the Hot Potatoes file is an HTML file, then you can download it, edit it in a text editor and upload it back to the activity. This method works well for small tweaks, but not for major changes, such as adding new questions. If the Hot Potatoes file is not an HTML file, then it is probably an XML file. In this case, the file name ends with one of the following extensions: a JCloze file ends with \".jcl\" a JCross file ends with \".jcw a JMix file ends with \".jmx\" a JMatch file ends with \".jmt\" a JQuiz file ends with \".jqz\" For any of the above file types, you can download the file, edit it in the one of the Hot Potatoes editors (JCloze, JQuiz, etc) and upload it back to Moodle. Once you have opened the file in on the Hot Potatoes editors, you can see the answers. If you are somewhat familiar with Javascript , you may also be able to determine the answers to questions by looking at the source code of the HTML. Hope that helps, Gordon",

Current HotPot 6.2 provides a range of options for producing hot pots, and it gets confusing as to how various core modules may interface with the variousd HotPot output formats... As I understand it, the HotPot module only accepts htm files. However, Hotpot outputs two versions of SCORM, Web CT, Blackboard not to mention its native format. Am I correct here? I also understand that one could save a hotpot as SCORM for example, but would have to use another module to interface it. I am wondering if there is a matrix somewhere in Moodle that sets out the various formats one could use for quizzes/tests versus the modules one would use to use them in Moodle together with cost/benefit of each approach? For example, I understand that SCORM could provide more detail than hotpot, if the SCORM module could access that detail??",

          "Text": "Hi Suzanna, I can see what's wrong but I can't see how to fix it easily. Everytime you click one of the expansion arrows in the left-hand pane of the JQuiz, we should recalculate the height of the left-hand pane and adjust the height of the left-hand pane accordingly. At the moment, chunks 1-7 are roughly the same height so they display OK without adjusting the height of the left-hand pane. Chunk 8 is slightly taller than the other chunks, so it requires the height of the left-hand pane to be adjusted. You can force HotPot to adjust the left-pane height if you display Chunk 8, then click the \"Show all questions\" button, then click the \"Show questions one by one\". One solution to this issue would be to modify the javascript that controls the expansion of chunks in the left-hand pane so that it also calls HotPot's \"StretchCanvasToCoverContent()\" function. Here is the javascript to do that: if (window.StretchCanvasToCoverContent) { StretchCanvasToCoverContent(); } I can't see immediately where to put that in the file you sent, but maybe the person who created the chunking code would be able to see where to put it. There may be another solution. It would allow the left-hand pane to expand \"naturally\" by inserting the following HTML somewhere: <div style=\"clear:both\"></div> This may make it unnecessary to call \"StretchCanvasToCoverContent()\". However, I need time to ponder that. regards Gordon",

Using that as my guide, I found that your JQuiz can work in Moodle with the folowing change: open the HTML file with your favorite text editor locate the line containing the \"onopenclose:function\" (around line 2153) replace the \"// do nothing\" line with the following code: \n```text\nif (state==\"block\" && isclicked==true){\n\n\n if (window.StretchCanvasToCoverContent) {\n\n\n  StretchCanvasToCoverContent();\n\n\n }\n\n\n}\n```\n save the modified file and upload it Moodle For reference, I have attached a copy of your original HTML file that has been modified in the way described above.

I've just restored a Moodle 1.9.8 course, containing Hot Potato quizes, into our new Moodle 2.3 environment. Everything in the course restored beautifully, but none of the Hot Potato quizzes are there anymore.....they've disappeared in the 2.3 version of the course. We do have the HotPot module installed, and its present in our list of modules. Can anyone tell me why our HotPot activities are invisible?  Did we miss a step in the install (it was done by our hosting service)?  Or is there another step I must do in the restore process (like the Assignment upgrade helper)? I realize my background information here is a bit scanty, but I'm hoping this is a simple problem, easily solved. Thanks for any help you can give me! Jim Murray",

The solution is to upgrade a copy of your whole 1.9 database to Moodle 2.x, and then backup the HotPots from there. regards Gordon",

Short answer: I was going to build a couple of courses in on my own 2.2 server and restore them on district 2.2 when it was ready. Long story: My district is migrating to Moodle 2.2 from tried and true 1.9, hence my questions of several weeks ago. My Advanced Placement Chemistry kids have to do work on Moodle over the summer. There were several QuizPorts that were due by July 1 or they would get bounced out. Many did get formal notification that they were being dropped. The district has not been communicative as to when the change would occur. Because we were told to make back ups by the end of June, I would have expected the change over by. I just checked the status of my \"help\" ticket and it says that they are expecting to have it up by early to mid August. Now I have more work for the students that will be due at the beginning of school Sept 4. While there are links to videos* they can watch one the old moodle I have hidden the QuizPort. I was planning to have the HotPots set on the new 2.2. I want to allow kids time to get work done should any go on some sort of vacation just prior to the start of school. Also I was going to add some new material. Additinally, I wanted to start setting up the first-triemester Moodle. I tested out restoring from 1.9 to 2.2 but did not like the results even if it worked. What I have done is restored school Moodle course to my own 1.9 Moodle which I will use as a reference. Given that HotPots backup and restore 2.2 to 2.2, I was planning on building the summer Moodle and the first trimester Moodle on my own server and then do a quick backup and restore to the school one in a matter of minutes. That way it is working and complete right away. Thanks, Jeff *My lectures are all online. I have implemented the \"flipped class\" model for AP Chem.",

We are running Moodle 2.3 so we can install the latest version of your Hot Potatoes module, but what do you advise we do after that?

Actually, I am not sure off the top of my head how to initiate it, but hopefully you will be able to work that out for yourself. Once the Moodle 1.9 file is converted to a Moodle 2.x backup file, you can restore the HotPot activities individually to specific courses on the Moodle 2.x server, or you can restore the entire course. Note that in order to ensure that the HotPot files are transferred across, you should be sure to include all course files in the Moodle 1.9 backup. Also, the 1.9 -> 2.x conversion does not transfer any user data, so you will end up with *only* the courses and their activities. FYI , glossary entries and database entries count as user data and will not survive the conversion. best regards Gordon",

The files will probably work well with Firefox and you students will also have a more up-to-date browser on their systems (as well as a more secure browser). Microsoft no longer supports IE v.5.5 (nor Windows 98) and the HotPotatoes developers will not support older versions of their software. Your students could then browse the net with a newer, faster and supported browser (in their very own language) as well as have access to your HotPot exercices written with the latest HotPot software. Your students may find Firefox at: http://www.getfirefox.com Cheers Marc",

          "Text": "Hi, I haven't found how to add wildcards to JCloze fill-in-the-gaps exercises and I would like to know if it is possible. This is what I want to do: I want students to retype sentences putting an adverb of frequency into the correct place. For example: I listen to the radio in my car. (usually) Here students would have to retype the sentence including the word \"usually\" What is important to me is that they type the pronoun, the adverb of frequency, and the verb in the correct order; so as long as they type \"I usually listen...\" the sentence would be correct. I would not mind if they typed \"I usually listen to the rdio in my car.\" or \"I usually listen to the radio in my car (with no period)\" or \"I usually listen to theradio in my car.\" I know I can type alternate answers in JCloze but it would be too many alternate after \"I usually listen...\". I also know I can provide the rest of the sentence after the subject, adverb of frequency, and verb (___  ____ ____ to the radio in my car. ) but I want my students to type English words as much as possible. I work with teenagers so I try not to be so picky with them in respect of spaces and punctuation in this case because what I want to assess is word order with adverbs of frequency. I know you can do this with Moodle's Quiz Short answer questions by typing \"*\" as the wildcard to match any series of characters so basically I want to be able to do the same with JCloze. I hope I made myself clear. Best regards, Manuel",

I'd use JMix: this presents the words of a sentence in disorder and students have to put them in the right order. I have a set of Frequency adverbs exercises which might give you inspiration - no JMix, but I'll add one when I update the set. I'll also add a JQuiz short answer where they actually have to write the sentences: the \"questions\" would be the words in disorder. HTH , Glenys",

          "Text": "Hi Glenys, Thanks for your quick response. I don't really like JMix because it doesn't give students any credit even if they put, let's say, 4 of 6 words in the right place. They must order all the 6 words correctly or else they get zero. For that reason, I actually prefer JCloze with the drop-down list for the jumbled sentence exercises. For the example I put in the first post, there are two reasons why I would like JCloze to have wildcards: 1) students would have to type English words instead of just clicking on them or choosing them from a drop-down list; 2) the assessment would focus on what's most important to me, that is, the first three words (I usually listen). Of course I am not going to tell the students they don't have to type the rest of the sentence correctly. I would be the only one to know that. Besides, wildcards would be useful for another type of exercise I have in mind: asking students to retype sentences with contractions. Example: They are doctors and they live downtown. So, as long as \"They're\" is in the answer it would be correct. I hope you can tell me if it is possible. If it is not, I think I am going to have to stick with Moodle's short answer questions.

I believe the numeric question type in the Moodle question bank can handle those concepts more elegantly, but unfortunately there is no corresponding editor in Hot Potatoes, so you would have to import them using a different format, e.g. GIFT. The Hot Potatoes programs are more suitable for text-based exercises.

Since they still reside in the original directory, rather than along side the rewritten file in the /(course)/hotpot directory, they can't be found unless they are physically moved to the new location. I've now included code that writes a tag into the new hotpot file. This causes the browser to look in the location specified by the base tag for other files. It seems to work well on Win XP with Firefox , Netscape 7.0 and MSIE 6.0. Mac browsers weren't as cooperative for me. I'd appreciate it if anyone using graphics in drag & drop activites (or other hotpot modules) could try out the attached fix and report back the results. This file replaces the one in moodle/mod/hotpot/",

Now I can easily put together a Jmix that scrambles the formula for iron (III) oxide: Fe₂O₃ where students have to put the symbols and subscripts in order. They have to use all of the choices. That is a great exercise as students start out learning how to put together the formulas for these types of compounds. Once they have gain experience, they need more challenge. I would like an exercise where they are requested for the formula for iron (III) oxide but not have to input Unicode. Is there something out there, hotpot like, where maybe there could be whole bunch of subscript choices that they could drag down to put in proper order? There would be left over choices that they did not pick. Actually, I have done this for other work with a Jmatch, drag and drop, where there were more choices than needed. This would not work well for a formula however. Any ideas? Have I properly articulated what I am looking for? Thanks, Jeff",

As a result, the colors and layout can get rather muddled. To difficult thing is to find out which styles are affecting the element you are interested in. Please could you tell us what Moodle theme you are using, and maybe send a screen shot of the showing which elements you would like to change? Once you have identified the elements you wish to change, you can set the styles for an individual quiz by modifying the html files for the quiz. You will probably have to add another html element to surround the quiz, and then change the styles so they are constrained to affect only the element within you new element. For example, you could surround the quiz content with <div id=\"hotpotcontent\"> ... </div>, and then contrain the styles by adding #hotpotcontent to the front of the styles whose influence you wish to restrict.",

OK, I've tried to export HP exercises in the SCORM format and use them in Moodle. I've found no major problems but I don't think I will be using this functionality because I think it doesn't have much added value when compared with the HotPot module available in Moodle. Actually, the HotPot module offers better reports than SCORM. And I must also say that I find the user interface for SCORM in Moodle leaves a lot to be desired (although I hear this is going to change soon). Having said this, however, an interesting possibility that SCORM offers is to embed HP exercises in the middle of so called Learning Objects. So you get a sequence of texts and/or multimedia files and interspersed among them you have various HP exercises related to the contents of those documents as a form of self-evaluation. I am pretty sure I saw an example of this in the Dokeos site in a demo course they had until very recently. Unfortunately, I'm not able to find it anymore because the main page for the site has changed completely (unless I'm mistaken and I saw this demo course in a different site). Anyway, my question is: is this really possible and if so, how does one do it? The question is more complicated than it might sound at first because there is the issue of the reporting of the results from the HP quizzes. That is, it would seem rather trivial to embed the web pages created by HP as one more of the documents in the sequences of documents of all types that are usually part of a SCORM package. But if one does it like this, I'm pretty sure the results of the quizzes would not be incorporated automatically in the reports provided by SCORM. However, since HP can now be exported as SCORM, I'm wondering whether it would be possible to embed a \"SCORMed\" HP quiz within another SCORM package and thus be able to track the results of the HP quizzes and include them in the reports for the SCORM activity. I don't know whether I'm making myself clear but I will be happy to elaborate if needed.",

The reason we've added SCORM is that it should enable HotPot quizzes to work on any SCORM-compliant LMS. I think it should also be possible to create larger SCORM packages which incorporate Hot Potatoes exercises. I think I would use the Reload tools to do that. In any SCORM context , and HotPot exercise should happily report its results back to the server ; that's what SCORM is all about. I'm hoping that Gordon will adopt SCORM 2004 as the basis for reporting in the new HotPot module, for reasons I've explained elsewhere. The limitations in SCORM reporting on Moodle are not inherent to SCORM; the fact is that SCORM 1.2 is not very extensive compared with SCORM 2004, and there are few SCORM implementations anywhere that make an effort to provide the level of detail and discrimination in their reporting that the HotPot module is able to offer. If Gordon were to work together with us on a SCORM 2004 implementation, so that HotPot exercises report all the details he needs through SCORM 2004, and his module knows how to get all those details and report them, all the time using the standard SCORM API, then we'd have the best of both worlds: the new HotPot module would support any SCORM 2004 content, the future version of HotPot would produce exercises that run under any SCORM-compliant LMS, and the combination of the two on Moodle would probably give us most detailed and useful reporting available anywhere. That seems to me to be a goal worth striving for. Cheers, Martin",

If I understood you correctly, though, this wouldn't make much difference for what I'm interested in until Moodle fully supports the SCORM 2004 specifications. With the current implementation of SCORM in Moodle even if I were able to incorporate HP exercises within a learning object, I wouldn't be able to benefit from the full report possibilities of HP. Am I correct? I'm not technically savvy enough to determine whether SCORM 2004 is the best basis for reporting in the new HotPot module. What I'm pretty sure about is that we can expect great things from the collaboration between people like Gordon and you guys. I'm pretty excited about the features Gordon listed for the new HotPot module and solid and extensible reporting functionalities are highly desirable in my opinion.",

I'm using a modified version of the WebRhubarb source code on Moodle 1.6.4 First learn How to play MP3 files using Flash As well as Martin's tiny player, there are several other Flash players in the files section of hotpotatoesusers list. Upload your exercise to your Moodle site in the usual way and in the settings for the exercise choose Force media plugins: No This means that Moodle will use your original mp3 player. There is (or was) a problem with the Moodle player not releasing the focus and so the using being unable to type in the text field. I haven't yet succeeded in using a video Flash player in Moodle because of the problem of the player not releasing the focus but I haven't tried just recently either. This is only a problem where students need to type in a text field as with WebRhubarb (or JCloze or JQuiz short answer). If they only need to click on something, there is no problem. By the way, my exercise as it stands is too long. Students complain about having to start all over from scratch if they have a power cut or other glitch in the middle. I'll chop it up into 3/4 sections for next year's course. Hope this helps, Glenys",

That is to say, the results of my random responses were recorded, and at the end of the quiz the browser returned to the main Moodle course page. The htm version of the quiz was made with HP 6.2: \n```text\nMade with executable version 6.2 Release 0 Build 7\n```\n so I don't think that is the reason that the results are not stored.

Your problems seem to be confined to \"htm\" files, so one solution for you would be to use the jcl, jcw, jmt, jmx and jqz files for the time being, until you can schedule an upgrade in a quiet time, such as the upcoming \"Golden Week\" vacation. all the best Gordon",

If I remove the \"header\" tag, then it would be displayed fine.  However, the tags for titles in Hotpot quizzes are automatically added when exporting the quizzes to html.  This makes it more difficult to remove the tag.  I tried to use original Hotpot files instead of html versions, but it did not make any difference. It is a minor problem but a little annoying, since some of my Hotpot quizzes, particularly those with subtitles, look funny. Is there any way that I can change back the alignment without manually fiddling html tags in quiz files?",

In theory, they should always be able to find all the mistakes because they have a correct audio version to compare with the text, but sometimes they don't. As I understand it, if I provide them with a \"Give up\" button, they will be returned to the main course page and from there can re-enter and continue with the next exercise in the unit. Their attempt at the \"Correct the mistakes\" exercise will be marked as \"Abandoned\" but their score will be included in the grade for the unit. Am I right? Cheers, Glenys",

In the \"Find the mistakes\" version I haven't had any reports of frusration because there is a \"Solution\" button. (Ah! that also returns you to the course page - I hadn't noticed that before.) I think it's a \"Solution\" button that I would like. Because it means that they can see the elusive last word before leaving the exercise; with the \"Give up\" button they never see it - not so good for feelings of frustration nor for pedagogy. In fact, in both cases I would prefer them to stay in the unit rather than being returned to the course. This happens when the \"Give up\" button is clicked in a JGloss exercise. You gave an explanation last year of why this is not the case in \"real\" quizzes in Re: QuizPort \"Give up\" button because in the case where: \"Each quiz has post-conditions specifying that for a good score the student can move on to the next quiz, but for a poor score, the student will be shown the same quiz. Each quiz also has a stop button. What should we do when the student presses the stop button in this case? We can let them finish the quiz attempt. If we stay in the same unit attempt, then QuizPort will immediately check the post-conditions and decide that a poor score requires that the same quiz be shown again. The student will be in effect trapped in the quiz.\" But in my case, there is no post-condition requiring a good score, just to go on to the next quiz. But I can imagine it's a lot of coding to combine together just one particular post-condition with the Give up button. Cheers, Glenys",

Your query was precisely the object of my suggestion posted in this thread: http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=5493&parent=51874 At the moment, the only workaround I have found is as follows: after the Moodle Hot Potatoes module has successfully converted your HP HTML file and saved it to the \\ hotpot subdirectory of your Course files directory, you can move your graphics files there \"by hand\": when logged in as Teacher, go to Administration|Files; locate your graphics files ( image1.jpg, image2.jpg , etc.) and check each one; in the With chosen files droplist, choose Move to another folder , and follow the instructions. (By the way, we should have a \" Copy to another Folder \" option in that droplist as well.. ) I have installed your Thunderstorms quiz to my local Moodle site & tested it, it works OK, and I can see the graphics as well, after using the little workaround mentioned above. By the way, your Thunderstorms activity would probably be a good candidate for the JMatch program in Hot Potatoes , rather than JQuiz . All the best, Joseph_R",

Perhaps you downloaded the new module and unzipped it into the \"moodle/mod\" folder. Did you move the language file \"hotpot/lang/en/hotpot.php\", across to \"moodle/lang/en/hotpot.php\" ? If so, you are nearly there. At this point, I usually try viewing a few more of the admin pages, such as the \"Configuration\" page or the \"Modules\" page and after a few goes, Moodle notices the new module and sets about running the installation script. hope this helps Gordon",

If we could get it transferred back to Moodle as a student response, that would be pretty useful! As always, when you are embedding media players in HotPot / QuizPort, if you are having problems, then I suggest you change all the URLs connected with the media player to absolute URLs outside of Moodle. That should get it working. Then you can change the URLs one by one to relative URLs and see which ones QuizPort detects and converts to absolute URLs. At some point you will come across a relative URL that Quizport does not detect, and that is where we have to concentrate our attention. I can't wait to have a look at the sample you uploaded for me. thanks! Gordon",

          "Text": "Hi Gordon, Thanks for your reply. I would envisage using nanogong recorder in the following way. For example, it could be used with an audio file to check pronunication such as which words are stressed in a sentence. A student would listen to an audio file, be presented with the sentence, and they would either click on the stressed word ( using the add-on \"find it) or they would have to fill in some blanked out words and then they could record their own attempt using nanogong, and compare to the original. In this form it would be more of a self-study exercise. It would be interesting to as you say record students responses and send them back to Moodle, but not being \"techie\" I wouldn't know if this is feasible. Where would you store such a file? Nanogong works in the HTML editor of modules like forum, journal,(but not assignment) to my knowledge up to 1.9.2. (Maybe other moodlers have been able to make it work in 1.9.3+). Here it can be listened to by either other students and/ or graded by the teacher. For hopot or quizport, I would only see a use for it for students to be able to check their pronunication. Having said that, I suspect other moodlers will probably have some other and better ideas. Cheers Robert P.s. If you download the file I sent you to your desk top and then open it, it will work.

Along similar lines I am interested in trying to incorporate MASLE into QuizPort at some stage. MASLE is oftware which can compare sound files of spoken language and give an indication of how similar they are. This would also be very useful for checking students pronunciation. I think it is technically possibly to fix HotPot and QuizPort to recognize the nanogong player. In due course I will investigate properly and report back. regards Gordon",

The calculation of the HotPot grade is initiated by by the \"hotpot_get_grades()\" function in \"mod/hotpot/lib.php\". The calculation is actually done by MySQL , extracted from the My SQL results by the hotpot_get_grades() function and passed back to Moodle's core functions which then store the grade in Moodle's grade tables.

If low scoring students click the \"Next\" link the will only get a page that sends them back to QuizPort 2. Your post makes me think though that we could add a \"Grade\" field to the \"\"Next activity\" setting for a QuizPort, so that the \"Next\" link on the exit page is only shown if the grade for the current QuizPort is greater than the required grade.

So the long and short of it is that it may be little while till the IT people can install your update. I was wondering if on the display page where you have \"previous activity\", \"next activity\", would it possible to have another button that says \" current activity\"? And here a teacher could specify a more than so many points required before being allowed to attempt the next activity. Actually I was wondering if the existing pre- conditions and post-conditions buttons that exist for each quiz in a quizport couldn't added to the \"update this quiz\" page- that would be simplier (well, I mean for a teacher, but perhaps this is not technically possible?)

One person on Moodle quizzes, and one on Hot Potato quizzes. The training session is for teachers who have never made online quizzes before and know nothing about either Moodle or HotPot. As a program chair, we have limited time and I am wondering which one to schedule. What do you all think? I am inclined to think that Moodle offers a far more comprehensive environment, but maybe HotPot is an easier way to start that could be eventually connected to Moodle.  I have never used HotPot, and am uncertain about its future.",

Hotpot tests are for fun, unless one joins the online tracking service that they provide at a fee, or oen uses Thomas Robbs great extension module to allow Hotpot quizzes to be added to Moodle. If security/tracking/control is not an issue then I think that Hotpot quizzes are more attractive for language teaching purposes. Most of the same quiz types are available too.0 If secutiry/trackingare an issue  or there are nay maths teachers  then I would start with moodle. IMHO Tim",

          "Text": "short term \"fun\" with HOTPOT or long term happiness with Moodle Yes, I think this is exactly the trade-off that you're facing. HotPots allow beginners to have stunning results at a cost of a very short learning curve (especially if you do not introduce things like the CGI reporting, the advanced mode of JQuiz or the hybrid questions). Once they get a good grasp of the basics, they may venture into more difficult Hotpot customization. On the other hand, Moodle requires a little more training time, but in the long run can be much more rewarding (because it is not just a quizzing tool, but a full-blown CMS) So, I think it very much depends on who your trainees are and how much they are motivated to use ICT to enhance their teaching. If they are resistant, show them the basics of Hotpots first, get them hooked and then tell them about Moodle. If they are determined to learn how to use ICT in teaching, you may as well start with Moodle. Hope this helps, Przemek",

This, of course, means putting the stuff on a publicly accessibel server. Of course, a LOT more people have access to web servers than they do Moodle servers but teaching them how to create Hot Pot activities must go hand in hand with teaching them how to create a website and how to upload their files to it. If Moodle is available, then there is no need to learn how to FTP files, or to create a home page from which the Hotpot files can be accessed.",

Just learn Moodle, especially the quiz section. Most participants are reluctant and have little web background, so HP is attractive because the activities are more varied and interesting than in Moodle. However, given my workshop situation, Moodle is easier for a 90 minute workshop because we don't have to teach homepage making and FTP usage. Another question, now that Moodle has a new quiz structure in 1.4dev, Martin says it will be easier for developers to add new quiz types. Is anyone currently planning to create HP style quiz types in the near future? And what are the most interesting HP quiz item types that are missing from Moodle?",

If you could combine the two via an introduction to Moodle and its CMS/VLE aspects, a quick look at Lessons and an overview of the Quiz settings before a short intro to Hot pot, you would be giving your delegates a great idea of several possibilities.  Hotpot does have a really good tutorial which would allow people to develop the exercises on their own.  Uploading to a site is not that difficult and, in many places, not something which teachers actually have to do. I think that, if it's possible, let people gain a little exposure to both. Phil",

This allows the teacher to see a very detailed report showing the state of the quiz at each click .\nHowever, it may also mean that the size of the database grows\nvery quickly, because several \"click\" records may\nbe stored for each attempt at a quiz. What is meant by \"the state of the quiz at each click\"? If I understand this correctly, when the student clicks the 'hint' button, s/he is penalized and the points that are taken off are stored in the database. That means that whatever number of points are taken off, they will be computed in the final report you get for the HotPot exercises. If I have this option set to 'no', would that mean that no points are taken off? I don't think that this is what it means, but I don't understand what exactly it is that will not be stored in the database if the 'enable click option' is not set to YES. Josep M.",

          "Title": "Embedding links in quizport (Jcloze)",
          "Text": "Hi Gordon, I have embedded a link to another website within a jcloze exercise and want to utilize quizport's post-condition timing ability to make students accountable for doing this activity. So, when a student opens the jcloze they are instructed to click on the link and that takes them to another webpage where they are required to do some activity. They are also told to spend a minimum time (set by quizport's post- conditions) or they will have to repeat the exercise again. If they spend more than the required time, and they answer the question (\"did you spend more than x minutes on this activity?\"), and choose \"yes\", they are taken back to the menu of all quizzes in the unit. I can successfully do this by linking the webpage so that the student is taken to a new window, but I would prefer to have the linked webpage to open in the same window. When I use the following code <a href= http://xxxxxx. com target=\"_parent\"> <img src=\"xxxx.png\" alt=\"xxxx.png\" title=\"xxxx\" width=\"240\" height=\"74\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\" alt=\"QUIZLET\" /> </a> (target=\"_parent\" or \"self\" ) and click on the link, I first get the message \"Your results so far will be saved and you can re-do later.....etc\" . If I click \"OK\" then I am taken to the linked webpage and it behaves as I wish it to- i.e. it is embedded in the same window. Is it possible to do what I want without the message \"Your results..etc\" first appearing. This would, as you can imagine be confusing for students. Hope I am making sense... Any help appreciated... Cheers Robert",

It can take a lo-o--ng time to migrate all the files, and once you have finished you must always keep the database and moodledata folder together. You can't split them up anymore like you used to be able to in Moodle 1.x. BTW , I have fixed the syntax error that you reported in \"mod/hotpot/lib.php\". Thanks for reporting that. Are you sure it is possible to migrate from Moodle 1.8 to Moodle 2.0. Do you not have to go via Moodle 1.9? If you have a choice, I would recommend going to Moodle 1.9 first, then backup the database file moodledata folder at that point. Then try the migration to Moodle 2.x all the best Gordon",

          "Text": "I've spent the whole afternoon searching the forums and can't seem to find the answer to my problem. I hope someone can help me. I have a \"physical\" course, that I would like to make \"virtual\". I have a textbook and a DVD that has camtasia videos for each lesson . I am trying to create quizzes based on a video. I have figured out how to create the quizzes and include the video, but at the site I can't get the videos to play properly. Is there a way I can upload my Camtasia exe file to the site so that the students can properly watch the videos? Right now, windows media player opens and will play the sound (the teacher's voice), but will not show the images (the teacher's work on the board). I'm using moodle 1.9 and the latest hot potato version. Thank you for any help, Nora",

If you can't view the video when the Hot Potatoes quiz in viewed outside of Moodle, then I suggest you ask for help on the Hot Potatoes Users forum at Yahoo , because I have seen a lot of posts over there from people who are very experienced in using video in Hot Potatoes quizzes. regards Gordon",

I apologize in advance if I'm missing obvious things, I've looked around on the forum and played around with Moodle a lot, but am still learning things every day! I have several Hot Potatoes quizzes in my Moodle site and nearly 1,000 students have completed them. I have several ways I’d like to analyze the data. For one, I would like to be able to analyze the number of “tries” it took each student to get the correct answer for each question. I can access the type of information I would like by generating the “Detailed Statistics” report – the different colors for correct, incorrect, and ignored answers is perfect. However, this information is lost when I export the data to Excel or Text file format – suddenly, I can’t tell which letters should be which colors, and therefore which categories they should fall into. I have brought the data into Excel and Access and tried to manipulate it but it is a bit of a headache with so many students and so many combinations of right, wrong, and ignored answers! Ideally, what I’d love to be able to access would be something similar to what the “Detailed Responses” plug-in can generate for standard Moodle quizzes, where I can view the response each student provided to each question. Also ideally, I’d be able to see how many tries it took per question per quiz. Is this possible to access? Thanks very much for any insights you can offer!!",

When you looking at the \"Detailed statistics\" report for a HotPot, the number of tries at each question is the last of the three numbers in the green brackets. It would be difficult for you to extract in Excel, but the information is there. This report also shows you the \"the response each student provided to each question\". What's more it shows you the wrong answers and the correct answers. However because there are several answers in one cell, it is difficult to extract this information in Excel. On the whole then, I think this report already has the information you want, but the information is not easily accessible to Excel because one cell contains several pieces of information.",

I was asking a coding question, when the route of the problem turned out to be a hardware problem. I have a 2nd Generation iPod Touch. However, browsers that support html5 require an iOS version of 4.3 or above, while the 2nd Generation iPod Touch tops out at 4.2. When I couldn't play the html5 audio on my iPod Touch, I thought I was doing something wrong in the coding. But, when I used a third generation iPod Touch, everything worked just fine on more than one browser. So, for anyone who is interested, if your online students are using mobile devices from Apple, make sure they have iOS4.3 or above before assuming they can play your html5 audio. Thanks for your help. John",

I test on other people's devices as I don't personally own an iDevice but what I can figure out up to now goes along these lines: No 2nd Gen device can play html5. 3rd gen devices could play if upgraded; the highest supported iOS is 5.1.1. Support discontinued. 4th Gen devices, if coming with preinstalled 4.1 need upgrade (support discontinued); if preinstalled OS is 5 - play audio and video OK (support discontinued by the end of 2012) 5th gen device comes preinstalled with iOS 6, so things are a OK. What I dislike about Apple devices re: video is that they ALWAYS open the video in Fullscreen mode (unlike Android which can play it inside the exercise), so on IOS any video must be watched first, then closed so questions get answered in the HotPot exercise. As far as file formats, Android recognises mp4 only (for now), so no mp3 should be used for mobile delivery of content. But as Bob Dylan wrote and sang,  \"The Times They Are a-Changin \"; and what's true today may not be so tomorrow. Ne varietatem timeamus . Cheers Stan",

But, as you saw at my presentation in Paris last year, I do have a handful of tips to share with novice HotPot, QuizPort, and TaskChain users. (Experts might look at these ideas and chuckle though.) The tips I shared were also presented at EuroCALL 2011, the week after our mini-moot. The brief report I wrote for the EuroCALL 2011 conference proceedings can be found here, http://www.eurocall-languages.org/review/20/papers_20/17_herbert.pdf , although it might already be somewhat outdated. Basically, when I say to people that they can use HotPot, QuizPort, and TaskChain for activities intended for mobile access, I explain that some output formats are more mobile-friendly than others. A few key issues to consider are: 1. What to do with audio. Apple does not work well with Flash. HTML5 does not work well with Android. (Thanks for the latter tip, Stan.) 2. Drag-n-drop and key press do not work in some browsers on mobile devices, so stick with dropdown menus or touch friendly activities like the example below. (You will need the username: yruhereXX and password: yruhereXX where XX = 01 to 07 to access this example. This is open to anyone from this forum who would like to check it out.) JMix (v6) for Scrambled Letters on Touch Screen/Mobile Devices 3. Take advantage of the JQuiz, JCloze, and ANCT-Scan Auto-Advance output formats. The keyword here being \"auto-advance\" (AA). With JQuiz(AA), as long as you have the same question length and number of answer choices for each question, then each consecutive question will fit into the same frame. And, with JCloze(AA) and ANCT-Scan(AA), you can use your own HTML tables to set up the display size of each question such that each question fits equally on every consecutive page, as seen in the following example. (You will need the username: yruhereXX and password: yruhereXX where XX = 01 to 07 to access this example. This is open to anyone from this forum who would like to check it out. ) All that the mobile user has to do is frame the first question to fit the mobile screen (by simply zooming in on the question), and all subsequent questions will automatically fit into the same frame one page at a time without requiring any scrolling or resizing. ANCT-Scan (Auto-Advance) for Mobile-friendly Photo Questions If you happen to be interested in more examples of activities I use to introduce people to QuizPort, please have a look at the course page where I have posted the two aforementioned activities at http://herbert.quizport.com/course/view.php?id=21 . (Using the same username and password as above.) Other than that, I am sorry to say that the only things I have online right now are personal, student generated files; and, as such, access is restricted for now. I hope you found what I did provide to be helpful in someway. Please feel free to replicate anything I have shown you (for all of you to whom it may concern) on your own tutorial site if it looks remotely worthy. Thanks, John",

Am I right in thinking it is not possible to use the Quizport notation in exit and entry pages?

Also, QuizPort doesn't convert relative urls to absolute urls on the entry and exit pages, because QuizPort doesn't know what any relative URLs would be relative to. I believe the text on entry and exit pages is filtered through Moodle's standard filters, so if you have your mediaplugins filter enabled on your Moodle site (Site administration -> Modules -> Filters -> Manage filters), the easiest way to embed a player for your sound file is to use a simple link: <a href=\" http://mysite.com/moodle/file.php/99/audio/myfile.mp3\"> ; Moodle will detect that and insert the appropriate player. If you want to do something crafty like change the size of the player or stream the sound file, then I suggest you have Moodle insert a media player with standard settings using a simple link (as I just described), copy and paste that code and then modifiy it to do what you want. Details on the mp3 player settings are here: Moodle mp3 player: playback options all the best",

Sometimes after I upload a hot pot quiz to moodle I discover there is a mistake in a quiz. So I go back to my hot quiz on my computer and fix the mistakes, delete the offending quiz in the moodle files, and upload the fixed quiz, retaining the same name. When I create a new hotpot quiz, using the same name as the old quiz, I notice that moodle still displays the old quiz that has errors in it. If, however, I change the name of the fixed quiz, then moodle will then display the quiz reflecting the changes I have made.  Is there a way to keep the same quiz name and at the same time display it with the changes I have made?

However, I have imported one into a normal quiz and added it as an activity to a course. However, the cloze was intended to be directly linked to a question page (without questions) in a lesson. At the moment, they're divorced. 2 questions: Is there any way to link this cloze quiz to a lesson page? I seem to recall seeing that a lesson could be linked to an activity. Failing that, in what ways can I use a HP cloze quiz in moodle - only through a standalone quiz activity? Thanks for any comments. Brian",

Though I wrote I wouldn't recommend QuizPort to beginners because it's in beta, I actually find it easier to use than Lesson and it will do many similar things. You might like to look at this course English for Academics and Professionals for ways of integrating Hot Potatoes into a course. In this course QuizPort is used for presenting the Hot Potatoes and I could have made pre and post conditions for each exercise. I didn't because this course is just for teachers to have a look at but I have used it with real adult students and found they almost all worked through it in order without being forced to. In fact, when I did try imposing conditions, they complained because it made it difficult to go back and redo exercises. There are other courses open to guests on the same site. There's also Deborah Delin's incredible Free Phonetic Reading Course made up almost entirely of Hot Potatoes exercises. Cheers, Glenys",

This version is a \"true\" dictation, no letters show and each word has to be found individually (no freebies as in the original where typing \"the\" gave you all the \"the\"s in the text). There is an additional problem in this version : it not only doesn't wait until the student clicks on the OK button, but there is no Moodle navigation bar (the original HP one instead). Another little thing in both exercises: at the end of the exercise (a long one) the students are supposed to see a bell ringing. You just see the place holder. This works fine outside of Moodle. I notice that in Unit 1, the WebRhubarb exercise, Exercise 12, the Source file type is given as \"htlm\", while in Unit 2, the WebRhubarb exercise, Exercise 11, the Source file type is given as \"htlm_xhtml\". I've checked the markup at W3C and both exercises validate. Cheers, Glenys",

I had understood that no HotPots at all were in the gradebook, but I see now that HotPots containing actual quizzes (JCloze, JCross, JMatch, JMix, JQuiz) are in the gradebook, and HotPots containing masher files are not in the gradebook. That is normal. The HotPot module does not know what to do with Masher files and ignores them, or rather it treats them as ordinary html files. > can i get mashed files to show in the gradebook? No. Basically a masher file is just a list of links to the quizzes. From the HotPot modules point of view, it is like a static html page and it is not possible to calculate a \"score\" or \"grade\" to give students just for looking at it. Another way to think about it is that the list of HotPots on the Moodle course page replaces the list of links on the Masher page. In this respect, Moodle replaces the Masher. Gordon",

I want to upload a folder with the hotpotatoes files plus their associated image files and then select ONLY the .htm file to upload to the course page. I've tried looking at Moodle user guides. I've watched your video Mary. I've tried various ways: I created a folder and added content - but then the whole folder showed on the course page; I then tried selecting only the .htm file from that folder for the course page - but it did not show the images I'd included. I realise I could use the private file area - but the whole point is to have this material available for teachers should they wish to alter it at some time in the future.\nI have been using Legacy course files - that works BUT having been warned there may be problems - I am looking for another way.\nI must be missing something really simple.

          "Text": "Hi Kathy, if you want teachers to be able to alter the files then you need to store them in a repository. I suggest you investigate setting up a \"File system\" repository. Basically this is a folder on the server that Moodle is allowed to access. You can also to upload and download files there via FTP . Teachers can access the files either via the Moodle repository interface or via FTP. I strongly recommend using Moodle 2.3, because it allows you to link from activities (such as a HotPot actiity) to a file in the repository. Several activities can share the same file in the repository. Changes to the file in the repository will be reflected in every activity that links to that file. Furthermore, the HotPot and TaskChain modules will be able to automatically locate and link to any secondary files (e.g. images, audio and video files) for a Hot Potatoes source file. It will save you tons of time. Moodle docs : File System Repositories regards Gordon",

But there is the problem of the grades. Is there any way I can import the grades of one Quizport into another Quizport?",

          "Text": "Hi Deborah, the only way it would be possible is to freeze the site for a couple of hours while the ids in the relevant QuizPort tables (quiz_attempts, quiz_scores, unit_attempt, unit_grades) are fixed manually. However, there is a high probability of getting into a mess quickly if you were to try that so I strongly urge you *not* to. Of some relevance is the fact that you can move the quizzes from one QuizPort to the other and the quiz attempts will go with them. But then you would end up with twice as many quizzes as you need in the destination QuizPort. The safest way may be to just hide one of the QuizPorts and then use the manual override functionality of the Moodle gradebook to make sure the grades on the remaining QuizPort are at least as good as the hidden QuizPort. Not satisfactory I know, but it is reliable. regards Gordon",

When you say override the \"functionality of the Moodle gradebook\" do you mean edit the gradebook manually? This seems like a possible good solution, but I have these Quizports set to \"force\" so that when a student selects them they start where they left off. But I found that even though I edited the grade to reflect progress through the unit, when the student selects the Quizport with the re-set grade he gets to the entry page and not to where he is according to the grade. Do you have a suggestion for getting round this. Thanks and sorry to be so complicated. Deborah",

No, I am sorry to say there is no way round this. The Moodle gradebook grade is not used when QuizPort decides where to resume a unit attempt. In order to know where to \"force\" the student to resume from, QuizPort has to have information about which quizzes have been attempted so far *in this unit*, and that information is not available in this case. When I was designing the pre- and post-condition functionality, I thought about allowing conditions to be dependant on quizzes in a *different* QuizPort. That might have helped you in your current situation. However, I decided that in general it would be confusing, so I built QuizPort to allow conditions only on quizzes in the *same* QuizPort unit. best regards Gordon",

Now we want to ask how can we choose that each student will get just one chance to answer a question, and will get no feedbacks and any information about his choosing in a jquize.

(I know that if the student does not complete the activity- meaning all answers are correctly answered, then the activity page remains).  It would be educationally useful to allow students to do a quick review (even when they get everything correct) before exiting the activity.
