For example i'm trying to move the completion ticks in courses to a left aligned location so it is easier to see where they align to. But I have no idea how to target  .course-content ???",

          "Text": "Hi Diana, As you may see from the top of this particular thread, this thread has now been closed due to the size and a new Adaptable thread set up with several subcategories. However, I don't think this is an Adaptable (or even a theme) issue anyway, but one with the text editors generally. It is a known consequence of using MSWord that MSWord adds a whole raft of its own formatting which can often distort or even break webpages (not just Moodle!). You could try the clear formatting tool in Atto, or you could try copying and pasting the text via a plain text editor such as Notepad and then into Moodle, but you may lose some (or all) of your desired formatting - you can replace it using the Atto formatting tools to create web-safe formatting.

So much like you'd use $OUTPUT->pix_url('imagename', 'theme_name') and it returns the URL of an image. I've also tried the following, but I don't know if it has the correct parameters, it creates the URL: background.mp4 but I've tried removing 'pix' from the path and it still doesn't work. \n```text\nmoodle_url::make_pluginfile_url($context->id, 'theme_name', 'pix', null, '/home/', 'video.mp4')\n```\n Neither method works for the mp4 file, it just returns a 'image not found' error message and then inserts the filename.mp4.error file within site data, albeit within the correct directory, so it is looking in the right place for it, I'm guessing it just has an issue handling anything other than images.

So the URL would be ... $video_url => new moodle_url('/theme/theme_name/media/video.mp4'); so your template context would be... video_url = $video_url; sorry if template notation is wrong I have forgotten for the moment what the correct way is!!!

          "Text": "Hi all, as discussed in another thread , I would like to create an additional commerce site that will accompany my main Moodle installation. That external site will handle ordering and payment for courses and will be based on Drupal or WordPress (or whatever). I am now wondering how to keep the design efforts manageable. Ideally, I would like to create a (more or less) seamless look-and-feel regarding the overall design, without having to work on two completely different codes. I have a lot of experience developing themes for Drupal, but have only recently started to look into Moodle. Can anybody offer any hints as to how to proceed? E.g., there's a base theme for Drupal that's based on Bootstrap... and Moodle's Boost theme (as well as the Adaptable theme, which I'm currently using) are based on Bootstrap, as well. Does anybody happen to know, if the HTML/ CSS structures are similar enough, so that, say, a Bootstrap setup can be simply copied from one page to another? Any help will be much appreciated.",

I did quite a few modifications in the code, after having read the documentation about overriding the renderers. So far, that worked pretty well. I have to say, I feel more confident editing Drupal templates than Moodle code. I am willing, of course, to dig myself into this, but have been hoping that there would be a way for... dunno, creating a Bootstrap configuration in Drupal and then copying it over to Moodle, while doing only minimal adjustments. Not sure, if that is even possible. The Drupal base theme I was talking about is based on Bootstrap 3, but there might be other possibilities. I would really like to use Drupal, as I feel most confident there, but have not made a final decision. Also, I'd be willing to switch from Adaptable to, say, Boost, if that would simplify matters.",

Boost is based upon Moodle's alpha port of the BS 4 version of the framework. Bootstrapbase (theme and parent of Clean) has its origin from the contributed Bootstrap theme ( https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_bootstrap ) which is now BS 3 and along with my Shoehorn ( https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_shoehorn ) appears to be no longer maintained. Classes wise, BS4 is similar to BS3 but uses SASS instead of LESS.  BS2.3.2 uses an older grid system.  However as BS 4 progresses I'm not sure how aligned the versions are between the BS 4 distribution and the one in Moodle core. So, really a matter of what you want to change and what you feel comfortable with. In reality I think it is understanding Moodle Themes that will be harder than applying the specifics of a given framework version API.  And that just requires time and effort.  The framework is not the solution it is just the tool used in the solution.",

          "Text": "There's no stable child theme for Flexibase at the moment, but the theme_components idea I worked on in an earlier version is still available from my github, so features such as awesomebar can (fairly) easily be added into most other themes. There were a few other features added into recent versions though - such as additional block regions (e.g. there's an 'alerts' region at the top of the page, which hides the block header by default - this came from a request to be able to allow anyone with front page editing rights to be able to post alerts, but there is no way of splitting the theme capabilities, and the alerts that most themes - including flexibase - have are theme settings, so can only be set by Site admins). Over the last 6 months there have also been a number of bug fixes highlighted by user testing. Oh and the big one - which I'm still not entirely convinced by myself and may remove - I added a separate page for blocks (which is set as the default, so its where the 'Add a block' appears) which is aimed at giving people the option of moving towards a 'blockless' main page - although the theme still has the huge range of custom block regions to give that flexibility of design over to the course creator. I plan on looking at Flexibase for 3.2 through October, so any suggestions or comments from anyone about features (existing or suggested), likes and dislikes, or bugs and improvements, will definitely be considered during that time! While it's perhaps not one of the 'big 3' themes, Flexibase has far exceeded my expectations as what was originally planned as an experimental theme to look at the use of the flexbox layout methods. I will be continuing to support it into at least 3.2 and probably 3.3, but probably wont do any more new feature development on it after a 3.2 release in November/December (for example the original flexi_ii theme hasn't been officially supported since Moodle2.1, but I was still unofficially supporting people using it on Moodle2.9 up until earlier this year). I'm hoping then to apply some of what I learned in creating Flexibase and create at least two new themes based around the new Moodle3.2 theme and the flex layouts - one to be quite basic, simply applying flex layouts (BS4 has a setting that simply enables flex as an alternative layout grid, so I've been playing with that a bit), and the other to be a kind of Flexibase2 with the additional features.

          "Text": "Hi, I'm working with Moodle 3.3+ (Build: 20170616) and I created a child theme from boost. I already got far with what I mentioned in the subject line. But now I'm stuck. What I have: I added in settings.php following lines of code: \n```text\nif ($ADMIN->fulltree) {\n\n\n\n …\n\n\n\n // Header Image Setting\n\n\n\n $name = 'theme_mytheme/headerimage';\n\n\n\n $title = get_string('headerimage','theme_mytheme');\n\n\n\n $description = get_string('headerimage_desc', 'theme_mytheme');\n\n\n\n $setting = new admin_setting_configstoredfile($name, $title, $description, 'headerimage');\n\n\n\n $setting->set_updatedcallback('theme_reset_all_caches');\n\n\n\n $page->add($setting);\n\n\n\n …\n\n\n\n}\n```\n This is working so far. With this code I'm able to upload an image and save it. Next I want to do is, add this image in my columns1.mustache template file like this: `<img src=\"{{{ headerimage }}}\" alt=\"…\">` So I also edited the columns1.php layout file and the best I got to work, altough no image is displayed, was: \n```text\n$templatecontext = [\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n    'headerimage' => $PAGE->theme->setting_file_url('headerimage','headerimage')\n\n\n\n];\n```\n The above code outputs in the browser something like this, altough there's no image: \n```text\n<img src=\"//www.\ndomain\n.com/pluginfile.php/1/theme_mytheme/headerimage/-1/headerimage.jpg\" alt=\"…\">\n```\n And before you ask, adding http: in front of the source doesn't work. So what am I doing wrong? I believe I'm just one step away but have no idea anymore, what to do. Thanks in advance, Patrick",

I'm sure I can make the language pack edit without any problems, but was wondering if there are any knock-on effects (eg if we backup then restore a course to a different site). I'm thinking ahead to move to 2.0 where I'd want to build the new site from scratch then port in resources (assuming the compatibility issues get fixed). Having 'courses' that are information rather than learning focused also prompts the thought - couldn't these be labelled in Moodle course settings the same way that roles can be renamed (eg Librarian instead of Lecturer)? Make the content suit the context !",

So the best way is to use a simple layout that has no block regions in it unless it is a custom one. You also need to make sure that the Frontpage settings is empty of content before login and also after login if you do not want any content visible on the front page when a user is logged in?. If you take a look at the frontpage.php layout file of my GoLogo theme, you will see I have added lots of customisation mainly hand coded for speed as it is just an experiment. The side blocks are hidden but still accessible by the Admin User. Hope this helps? Mary",

Is there anyway that we can have a centralized theme, available to anyone, that can be used with Moodle and MediaWiki ( and possibly Elgg ) like there is here on Moodle.org? I have admired the Moodle home theme ever since I was introduced to Moodle, way back to 1.5. I have tried to duplicate something similar to what is here ( except with my own colors, graphics and format ), however it ended up being a total mess and I gave up. Next, I also love the monobook theme of Wikipedia as well. So I tried to modify Mediawiki AND Moodle to work together with the monobook theme and again what a mess ... Can anyone see frustration in this man's voice? Then to really mess with my brain, Martin seemlessly adds Mediawiki to the Moodle Homepage and I thought my G-d... how much more torture can this man put us through? He's toying with my brain, making all the little voices that talk to me, taunt me by saying if he can do it why can't I do it??? So here's my thoughts ... as a community ... let's work together to make a theme that integrates Moodle, MediaWiki, and Elgg into ONE centralized theme ( similar to Moodle.org ) that can be modified and altered as needed. It's either that or we subscribe to the lithium-for-sale-online-store and use medication to silence the little voices. All kidding aside. The BIGGEST drawback to Moodle, IMHO , is the inability to modify the way Moodle looks and feels to the users. I am not a programmer, however I have ALWAYS been able to modify the programs I use to achieve my desired goals. Not so with Moodle. Pointing to the \"Theme\" section of the site is useless because after over 8 years of Moodle development there are less than 40 themes in the archives. Not a very good track record IMHO.",

I create a theme, never share it, distribute it, or release it. It is a theme only available to me. Its mine, all mine and nobody can steal the CSS etc... 2. I create a theme and release it to the Moodle community in the theme database released under the GPL license. Released as GPL as its based on Moodle (GPL) code - For example config.php is Moodle code. Its free to everyone, to modify, copy etc... 3. A company creates a theme for a customer, customers pays X amount for the theme. Theme has now been distributed to 5 customers with varying levels of modification. Its been distributed so therefore must be released under GPL? The customer is free to do with it as they like. Im free to take a copy of the CSS and reproduce? ++++ These are purely hypothetical questions which i've asked myself and never been able to work out the answer to.

This is what most web-designers do to protect their creative work, since I feel theme are works of art. However, if you choose to add a theme to Moodle's theme database, then you have to be prepared to share it under GPL (General Public Licence). Last year I  made a few Moodle themes where the original designs were from Free CSS Webpage Templates, but the owner had licenced then under CCL and refused my request to distribute them under the GPL licence as Moodle themes, so I had to take them off the Moodle Themes' Database . However, the CSS Template is offered FREE to anyone to customize/use it for business or personal websites/and all the designer asks is that you provide a link to their site. What I can't understand is why Moodle are so restrictive in this, as GPL is more to do with software distribution licencing and nothing to do with creative design, which web-design is. I would really like to see it as joint licencing, which seems to be the way most people are moving towards. Mary",

I know this might be a point of contention but I recommend that you develop your theme in Firefox and then \"test\" in IE . The reasons for this are: 1) Firefox is compliant to international web standards and IE is not. Hence, by developing in the correct environment, you ensure that your site is actually web compliant and works in a modern open source browser.",

          "Text": "Hi Werner, I agree with most of your arguments in defense of FireFox. I do exactly that: make my customizations on FF and then test (if I have the time) on MSIE (version 7). Let me add one remark. >1) Firefox is compliant to international web standards and IE is not. This is true. However, I have found that in some circumstances FF is more \"tolerant\" than MSIE. This means that some pages which contain some (minor) formatting mistakes (CSS or HTML) will nevertheless display fine on FF but the error will show off in MSIE. Here is an example which I came across recently. In a table, I had all rows formatted for text-align:center. Strangely, in FF the text in the top row would be centered as expected, and the other rows too. But, in MSIE, only the top row would be centered, text in the other rows looked as if it was left-aligned. I eventually found out that (in the php file) I had set the width of the cells in the top row at 80px but the cells in the other rows were set at 40px. FF did not mind and centered the other rows centered as the top ones, but MSIE centered the top row OK but centered the other rows within the 40px width , so they looked left-aligned! After I had corrected the php file code and set all cells to 80px, display was fine in both browsers. It's hard to decide which browser's interpretation is \"correct\" or desirable. On the one hand it's nice that FF is \"tolerant\" and seems to take the best decisions, on the other hand, MSIE's display points to the inconsistency in the code... Joseph",

          "Text": "Hello all, I'm new to Moodle and have this question: We have a single course, in its own Category, that will be used by more than one company. I can separate each company into its own Group and force them to remain separate, but I would like each company to have their own theme. What I'm asking for is a Group Theme, but I don't think its currently possible. If I could instead assign a preferred user theme with the imported company flat file of users, I thought that might work. We will already be using the flat file to enroll them in the course, assign them to groups and assign roles, so why not define each user's theme there too? We have enabled \"allowed user themes,\" so we could manually set each user's theme, but this would be very time consuming. Is there also a way I can set or define the preferred user theme from a flat file? I tried a column heading of \"theme\" but it was not recognized, and I was unable to find a list of variables within the Moodle online documentation.",

No \"preferred user theme\" upload option that I know of. - these are all things that you may want to recommend to the core developers - http://tracker.moodle.og -------- I do have a solution for hiding the user theme preference, though. Add the following to the bottom of a CSS file: body#user-editadvanced #moodle #id_theme { display:none !important; } This will hide the dropdown menu from your users' view. Not the most elegant solution, but a solution nonetheless.",

          "Text": "Well, my first suggestion would be that if you want the icons above the 'you are logged in as' then it would be easier to start by putting them before the <?php echo $menu ?> which is the bit that creates that in 1.9. While you can move things around using css, I find it easier to start with them in the order you want them unless there are significant reasons not to (eg. search engine optimization - which shouldn't apply here). You might also want to think about taking them outside the headermenu div completely so that they can be positioned independently of it and so that the headermenu div is just for the headermenu and not including the icons as well. Also, why is there a need to specify the css for div.icons both in #header and in #header2 ? Do you have one or both of these divs which are not shown in the clips you have provided? At the moment I think your .icons css will only be applied when that class falls inside the div id=header or header2 neither of which are shown here. The print_container settings, I believe, create a div #header-home in the case of the clip you have shown and so would not apply the css you have created. HTH Richard",

The times I got that header wrong! LOL It's good to see this code again though, it brings back some happy memories. By the way the icons are outside the headermenu that's closed off above the iconsbut, and as it's usually shunted out to the right there should be room for the icons to sit above it. Cheers Mary",

My probelm is the Calendar page. When viewing the calendar it is saying the region is not defined. What layout is used for the calendar? I have a 'general' layout but nowhere in config.php have I yet assigned a layout to be used by the calendar page specifically. I do not even know if you can. My custom regions work on all other pages as I have defined them i.e. \n```text\n'base' => array(\n        'file' => 'general.php',\n        'regions' => array('side-pre', 'side-post','search'),\n        'defaultregion' => 'side-post',\n    ),\n```\n Thoughts?",

So you could have the following for the 'fronfpage' layout...like so 'frontpage' => array( 'file' => 'frontpage.php', 'regions' => array('side-pre', 'side-post, 'topside-pre', 'topside-post', 'footer-pre', 'footer-mid', 'footer-post') , 'defaultregion' => 'topside-post', 'options' => array('langmenu'=>true), ), These 5 new regions would need declaring in frontpage.php in the head section which would look something like this... $hastopsidepre = $PAGE->blocks->region_has_content('topside-pre', $OUTPUT); $hastopsidepost = $PAGE->blocks->region_has_content('topside-post', $OUTPUT); $hasfooterpre = $PAGE->blocks->region_has_content('footer-pre', $OUTPUT); $hasfootermid = $PAGE->blocks->region_has_content('footer-pre', $OUTPUT); $hastfooterpost = $PAGE->blocks->region_has_content('footer-post', $OUTPUT); Then in each of the regions you have created you must state what happens IF these regions are going to appear with something like this... <?php { if ($hastopsidepre) echo $OUTPUT->blocks_for_region('topside-pre'); } ?> Hope this helps?

I've created a space for you to preview, download , rate, and comment on all of the themes that have been submitted. Here it is: http://newschoollearning.com/theme/submissions/ Regarding the ratings : We considered several different rating systems before settling on this one. Each system has its pros and cons. This one included. Please take time to look at the themes before using the rubric to rate the themes. If you have an understanding of the Moodle 2 theme engine, please download and review the source code. Your scrutiny and feedback will greatly help strengthen the themes and developers' skills. I'm still working on the demo site. Since I started with a clean 2.0 installation, it's still a bit empty. If you have a 2.0 test course that you'd like to share, please do. Still, the best way to see these themes is to download them for use on your local test installation. Don’t forget that we’re buying the developer of the theme with the highest community rating, the tightest code, and the most creative use of the Moodle 2.0 theme engine a brand new 16GB iPad. Plus, the best themes will all be included in the Moodle 2.0 core. The stakes are high. Please take your time reviewing these themes and ask the developers questions in the submission comment area if you have any.",

Use of BR Tag - While great for a line break without the margin/padding settings of the P tag, it seems to get used in Moodle a lot as a spacer. If indeed we wish to use a tag for spacing, wouldn't something like <DIV class=\"spacer\" id=\"spacer-#\"> work better because we could effect individual instances of the spacer through the id (something already done with other elements) or effect all .spacer elements on a page through > .spacer? Or couldn't we just use the margin/padding settings instead for the same effect? Sometimes I find I have to target a specific BR and display:none it. Use of TABLES - From 1.7 to 1.8, I noticed the disappearance of a bunch of tables; however, the conversion seems only part way. The main layout still has three columns. The course formats still have tables. Many modules like the forum still have tables. If they used a DIV/LI style layout, manipulating positions through CSS would be far easier. Changing the hardcoding isn't an option for the development environment I am working in, so wondering what sort of workarounds other themers use?",

Note to any other testers/Crisp developers: It appears there is a bug in the way Crisp adds its js so that you cannot try out Crisp by using a theme change in URL, you actually have to go and change the theme to crisp to use it.",

If you are making any changes to your theme it is a good idea to turn on Theme Designer Mode as Moodle caches all css (and many other things) which prevents changes from showing correctly - with Theme Designer Mode enabled, caching is prevented and your changes will show up as you make them 2. The Themes folder is not available as part of filepicker as it is outside the moodledata folder. you will need access to the files on your server , probably through ftp or through your webhost 's control panel to upload any themes. 3. This is part of moodle's own language files and not part of the theme - I believe it can be edited through Site Admin->Language->Language customisation, although i haven't actually done this myself, so someone with more knowledge in this particular area may be able to help you more.

Depending on who owns the site, you will need to upload the theme in the same way Moodle was uploaded. If Moodle was installed using a software installer, then you will most probably be able to upload the theme to the theme folder of your Moodle site using File Manger which you will find in your Control Panel on your site. 3. To change the message in Autentication Login page go to Settings > Site-Administration  > Plugins > Authentication and you will see various sections listed all to do with the settings for Authenticated Login. You will need to read all of them to decide which options you need or don't need. I think from memory the message is in the section E-Mail Authentication. HTH Mary",

Try going back to a different theme (if you had enable themes on url set then add ?theme=standard to your page url - if not you may have to cut the 'mytheme' folder out of the themes folder: replace 'mytheme' with whatever theme you are using) and turn on debugging, then go back to your edited theme.

Firebug too is worth learning about if you don't already use this. A point to remember, is that it is generally frowned upon to customise a CORE theme like 'Brick' as this theme, like all core themes, are updated during Moodle 2 updates, and so any changes you make to this theme will be lost. The best thing to do in this case is to 'clone' that theme. You can read how to do this in Development: Themes 2.0 how to clone a Moodle 2.0 theme HTH Mary",

It worked alright until, for no apparent reason, both sideblocks have moved downwards, so that there's a blank space now between the header and the sideblocks. However, the central block is in its right position. Any idea of why this has happened? Or rather, of how this can be solved? I'm going mad checking the code, but to no avail... Thanks in advance. PS: By the way, changing to a proper 1.5 theme makes no difference.",

          "Text": "I would like to make a custom theme for my moodle site that makes some rather large changes to the layout of the site. The main points are that I want to display the current users profile picture in the upper left of the front page , which will be linked to their profile. In addition I want to change the how the bread-crumb menu at the top bar works. I'd prefer it to link to the front page (instead of the course list) at the lowest level so that it would be Home->Course (if you are in one) ->Activity (If you are in one). My question is how to go about this. I've been looking through styles_layout. css in the standard theme folder and its making me think that the changes I want to do dont really constitute as a new \"theme\". I see where the file styles how the menu will be aligned for instance, but I dont know where the menu code that it calls is contained. Same with the profile picture, I dont really understand which part of the code says \"This menu is on the left, this image is on top, etc...\" Are making these kinds of changes possible as a theme? I'm wondering because the webhost Im using currently (keytoschool) allows custom user themes but not editing of the core files, so its my understanding that if its not something CSS/theme related I wont be able to edit it. Thanks all!",

So far as I know, K2S has limited calling php functions so you will have to ask them what all php functions do they support in themes, i.e. if they allow custom code in the themes. If they allow it, it should be possible with some coding. The first requirement can be met using the themes at www.thematoweb.com . You can also customize it to your branding needs. For second requirement, coding will need to be done! Cheers!! Good luck!! -- Nave",

Here is the code where I added it: https://github.com/kennibc/moodle-theme_fordson/blob/master/classes/output/core_renderer.php#L363-L368 You'll have to download off github as this was done after I published an update.  It will be included in the next release after 1.3.1 once I determine the best place for it. https://github.com/kennibc/moodle-theme_fordson/ Fordson includes functionality to remove the My Courses and other elements of the default nav drawer and gets it from this plugin if you choose to use boost or any other boost child theme such as Waxed: https://github.com/moodleuulm/moodle-local_boostnavigation",

          "Text": "I presume your css file is called base.css? Personally, I would recommend adding a parent theme (probably base) \n```text\n$THEME\n->\nparents \n=\n array\n('base');\n```\n because at the moment, with no parent theme, you have none of the layout files declared other than the base one, and if as you say your css file is empty, then you have no css to fall back to either. If you declare a parent theme, then your theme can fall back to the layout files used in the parent, but without any parent, I don't think it will work as there are no layout files declared anywhere (@Mary or @Gareth - would Moodle fall back to the base layout for other page layouts if none are declared ie there is no parent, even base/bootstrapbase? I don't think it would, but haven't specifically tested that. EDIT : just tried in a Moodle3 site by removing the layout files from bootstrapbase config.php and selecting that as the theme - error messages, but the page is there so must be picking up the base layout, I guess). Hmmm, OK. As well as the Main Content token changing that Mary has already mentioned, from somewhere around Moodle 2.2 or 2.3 a version.php became a required file in the setup of your theme and your theme will not install without it. If you are using such an old version of Moodle as 2.0 or 2.1, please see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Creating_a_theme for instructions If you are using a newer version (bearing in mind that Moodle is now at v.3 and even 2.7LTS is only security fixes now), then please see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Clean_theme , or the readme file in the Clean theme itself. TBH if you are using something as old as 2.0 or 2.1 then I would ask the question 'why?' If the purpose of your theme is for testing and studying, surely you should be looking at an upto date version of Moodle and how themes work in that. Richard",

Also some words 'language strings' you add in the settings page should technically be a string so that it can get translated. For example: 'Home' or 'Calendar' should be get_string('home', 'moodle') or get_string('calendar', 'calendar') most words of this nature are already translated so knowing this its easy to add. On the other hand the 'fa' font icon names are different as these are, in effect' code names and NOT strings. I'm surprised no one pulled you up on that when the theme was originally reviewed. Hope this helps? Mary",

You can download it to your desktop, then delete it off your server. Next you need to look at ever file inside that theme to see that the theme name coresponds with the name of the theme on the folder it is in. Then you need to assess each directory inside the theme to see if you have all the required parts all named and referenced back to the config.php, like the name of the CSS files the LAYOUT files frontpage.php & general.php. Read the documents found in the header of the Themems' Forum. Odds on you have an error of two, which is sufficient to stop it working. Removing the file will default to standard theme, providing you have not changed standard theme too. HTH Mary",

Basically, your best bet would be to start with a theme that is already available and try to modify it. I'm starting with the header.html file myself. I'm trying to add custom logos. For your questions however you would need to create cascading style sheets. This can be done in notepad++ as well. If you try to use word it won't work. Word just adds junk and messes up the code. If you use notepad it is hard to see the logical structures in the code. ++ made things a lot easier for me.",

And if anyone else wants to place links in a theme for admins only here is what i did: <?PHP if (has_capability('moodle/site:config', get_context_instance(CONTEXT_SYSTEM))){ print '<br /><li><a href=\"'.$CFG->wwwroot.'/myphpadmin\">My Admin</a></li>'; print '<li><a href=\"https://mysite:10000\">WebMin</a></li>'; } ?> I placed the in the profileblock.php file from the MemMed theme and this works great. If user is not logged in is shows login box in header, if a student is logged in it add links by their profile pic for updating profile, logging out, and My Courses. If admin is logged in the code above adds links for phpMyAdmin and webmin. I will attach the profileblack.php with the code change. you can edit the file to include any links you would like.",

If there is enough interest I can take a look at making the icon an option to turn on and off.  Because we use Fordson for our production site we make changes based on what our users want and I don't necessarily think of others.",

We have one other major feature we are working on in which we want to integrate a grading panel which will show teachers items that need grading.  Much like the teacher and student dashboards, this will slide down and present items much like some of the \"Marking Blocks\" do.  With integration in the theme you can free up space for learning content and avoid adding a block that eat's up space.  Our teachers have been asking for a way to quickly see what things need grading.",

When I change the course theme to Clean, the images show up normally. Regardless of the images the buttons work fine, but it makes the editor difficult to use without the images!

I found a complicated example in theme_boost (gradereport_history_renderer) : class gradereport_history_renderer extends \\gradereport_history\\output\\renderer  - but I were not able to understand the logic behind this. (The original folder is grade/report/history/classes/output/renderer.php) So for backup/util/ui/renderer.php it should be backup_util\\ui\\renderer but I tried every possible combination I could think of with '_ 'and '\\' marks at different places with no success. If someone could tell me the logic behind this (or what is the correct way to override), I would be grateful, I am really frustrated by this.",

          "Text": "/course/renderer.php is like /backup/util/ui/renderer.php in that they both aren't in a classes/output folder. So I used the /theme/boost/classes/output/core/course_renderer.php as reference to create the file /theme/mytheme/classes/output/core/backup_renderer.php as follows: \n```text\n<?php\n\n\n\n\nnamespace theme_mytheme\\output\\core;\n\n\ndefined('MOODLE_INTERNAL') || die;\n\n\n\n\nrequire_once($CFG->dirroot . '/backup/util/ui/renderer.php');\n\n\n\n\nclass backup_renderer extends \\core_backup_renderer {\n\n\n  ...\n\n\n}\n```\n I tested it by overriding render_backup_files_viewer() function. One slight annoyance was that I had to go through all the classes/functions that don't belong to the theme_mytheme\\output\\core namespace and add a preceding backslash \"\\\". In this example: \\backup_files_viewer \\html_table \\html_writer \\moodle_url \n```text\n  public function render_backup_files_viewer(\n\\backup_files_viewer\n $viewer) {\n\n\n    global $CFG;\n\n\n    $files = $viewer->files;\n\n\n\n\n    $table = new \n\\html_table\n();\n\n\n    $table->attributes['class'] = '\nMY-RANDOM-TEST-CLASS\n backup-files-table generaltable';\n\n\n\n\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n        display_size($file->get_filesize()),\n\n\n\\html_writer\n::link($fileurl, get_string('\ndownload\n')),\n\n\n\\html_writer\n::link($restoreurl, get_string('restore')),\n\n\n\n\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n    $html = \n\\html_writer\n::table($table);\n\n\n    $html .= $this->output->single_button(\n\n\n      new \n\\moodle_url\n('/backup/backupfilesedit.php', array(\n\n\n\n\n    ...\n\n\n\n\n    return $html;\n\n\n  }\n```\n I'm the same as you, used to overriding renderers in that old way. I've been using the Elegance theme before this (which unfortunately has no Moodle 3.3 version yet), and that uses a mytheme/renderers.php file to include other renderer PHP files in a renderers subdirectory. Is there an advantage to doing the autoload way (with the classes/output) directory? It was frustrating for me having to clear the cache several times when I was still trying to figure out the right filename and path. But I guess once the name is right, I shouldn't have to keep clearing the cache? It just made it really annoying to find the right combination for overriding :p. I definitely second your desire for a clearer explanation or tutorial behind the logic of how to figure out all the naming conventions for the different types of renderers (with/without namespaces, with/without being nested in subdirectories, etc.)",

They are very inconsistent; sometimes they are the Essential floating style, but in several other places (especially, but not only, with different plugins) the are a confusing mix of the classic moodle style, directly on the page, and the floating Essential style. This is really a \"stopper\" for us, considering the best for our users. Is there any way to keep the buttons in the \"classic moodle style\"? Or, how can we get a better consistency in how those buttons appear? We are using Moodle 2.8 with the corresponding Essential version, and was planning on implementing Essential when upgrading to Moodle 3.0 this summer.",

What are the fewest number of files I could get away with for creating a new theme? Ideally I'd like to have a second theme, using my own 'standard' as a parent, then just one additional css for the theme that overrides the colours in the parent. So that's just a config.php and a css file in a folder with the theme name. Do Moodle Themes require that each theme has its own header.html and footer.html? Can this secondary theme use the custompix folder within the parent? What is the least number of files needed for a theme to be a theme that works in Moodle?",

To determine whether any potential bug is in fact a bug with core or with a specific theme, it is most useful to check the same behaviour in the core themes, rather than another third party theme.

In other themes there could be lots more css scripts all working together on your site.

Never use negative margins unless you know what you are doing. Hopefully you can add the CSS I just gave you above into the user_styles.css file? Do that and see what happens to the login.

          "Text": "Hi vijay, Whenever I design a theme I try to make it fluid, in that it will resize to any browser setting. The way this is achieved is using a simple layout, as found in  Moodle 1.9 Standard theme, or the Base theme in Moodle 2.0, and make canges to the CSS for the #page element, like so... #page { width: 95%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0;} This simple bit of code sets the parameter for the outer shell of the theme. Whatever happens inside this #page structure, providing all width values of all elements are in percentages, and that padding is accounted for in these final width setting, as padding ADDS to the width, then all will work nicely. Moodle 2.0 is a little more tricky as you have to make absolutely sure the side-pre-only and side-post-only and content only settings in the CSS are exactly right for your theme. Getting this wrong spells catastrophy for your theme, because this is what the layout for the theme hinges on. Hope this is useful to you...indeed I might have even got the your question wrong!In which case this is perhaps not what you need! LOL Mary",

          "Text": "Hi Vijay, The problem with both the header and the footer is that there is a mismatch of div tags, more opening than closing in the header. The footer has duplicated HTML for the table structure. Also the css for the footer has been commented out, not sure why. I am assuming you know how to fix these things. To make the whole site more flexible, all you need to do is change all the fixed width values to 100% but make .surround 95% like the examples I uploaded here. Let me know how you get on. Cheers Mary",

Quite interesting, never seen that method of applying tags in different files. So when the header ends it open up the content and closes with the footer. All the div are in the right numbers.",

If you look in Standard theme's header.html you will see that the divs are opened and closed using php... <?php print_container_start(true, '', 'header-home'); ?> <?php print_container_end(); ?> Notice where they are opened and where they are closed. There is no reason your theme should be different. I don't think this it is design feature but rather someone not understading what they are doing. In fact the header and footer do't really need to be altered that much, but some designers like to be creative and start to dismantle something which works efficiently and ends up with a theme which people ask to make it do something it was not designed to do. Standard theme on it's own works beautifully, and with the correct styling can look as you want it to. Did you try changing the .surround width to 95% and #page to 100% and margins to 0 auto, plus change all the fixed width settings? Mary",

I made a row to hold a single block, but I can't drag the Progress block into it. I understand you are talking about the course page. In that case just add the block in the top region and add the block there. See the demo site: https://adaptable.ws/demo/course/view.php?id=5 (login as student or teacher) Is it possible to hide the right-side blocks and set the site to display in full screen, and hide the Show Blocks/Standard View options? No. This is always a user setting. But you can change the default setting. Just search viewselect in the Administration block. A trick could be to hide the button from users once set viewselect to full screen. Is there a way to send students directly to the first uncompleted activity when they open a course, instead of showing the activities list? This is a course format question and not related to the theme. Try to find one that meet your requirements.",

I've been thinking about tailoring the look of courses according to the subject - a sort of colour-coding would be a start. I know it's possible to allow courses to set their own themes, but that's probably more than I want.  As an example, if I had a site with courses for general English, technical English and business English (or maybe different levels using the snooker ball colours), I wouldn't want to change the theme completely for each category, but I might want to change the colour scheme while keeping the corporate look.  I guess this would be possible if I duplicated themes and then gave them different names.  That way changes could be made while keeping the overall look the same. So my question is this...  Is this feasible, or is there more involved to duplicating the theme than just changing the name.  Following on from that, am I going to have problems when the original theme gets updated? Am I creating an over-complicated workflow here or is there an easier way? Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. all the best Andy",

In the body classes every course and category applies a course-x and category-x body class. You can use that to target the css for the colour scheme in the customcss setting which would then allow the settings to be used for the main site, and only the course/category specific overrides to be applied over that just as required without needing to have multiple child themes. It also ensures the overall corporate look and feel is not changed by someone with their own theme settings. Of course that alters if you do need each area to make use of the individual settings from the theme, in which case you are probably into cloning your theme and then managing the child or clone as an ongoing task and you can find more information about that in the readme of the Clean file (the advice there applies to the vast majority of current themes).",

You could try enabling the filter for headings and see if that applies to the caption as a text only area, but I don't think it will. The option then is to leave the caption blank and use the html editor to style part of the slide description as a header, applying the multilang filter as required. (There are good instructions on using it with the multilang2 filter and an accompnaying atto tool to use in the editor.) R",

Depending on the scale of changes you want to make, it would be possible to use a conditional statement based on the 'Institution' field in a user profile (ie the company they work for). This could then add a class to the body and you could use that to alter the css for branding as required. I wouldn't recommend that for much beyond the logo and a few headline colour changes though, but that may be sufficient for you to provide the distinguishing between the client companies.",

          "Text": "Hello, I'm working on a 2.8.5+ Moodle site on a development server using the Essential Theme (2.8.1.5) and am wondering if anyone can offer any advice regarding an issue with the mobile nav drop-down menu (half screen @972px or less). When I click on the menu button, the titles of the sub-menu items (i.e. \"My courses\", \"This course\") appear about a half-second before the blue background color eases in behind them. Ideally, the titles would appear at the same time as the background eases in. When I click the menu button again to close it, the background and the text ease back up and disappear together, which looks nice. So I'm just trying to adjust the behavior when the menu opens. I've played around with overflow:hidden (on .navbar-inner .nav-collapse.collapse.in) which solves the transition issue, but also affects all descendents and so the sub-menus get hidden as well. As the issue seems a bit beyond my depth, the best solution I've come up with so far has been to shorten the transition time as much as possible so that the issue is less noticeable (I tried setting it to 0s but then the menu doesn't close once opened)... div.nav-collapse.pull-left.collapse { transition: height 0.01s ease; } This doesn't really solve the issue completely so I'm hoping a cleaner fix will present itself. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated. JP",

As for the @media I mentioned earlier, perhaps you could try making that font-size: 95%; or something similar depending on the font-size it is changing, especially if that parent font-size is a say 14px. Or perhaps a round (up or down) in as can be seen in bootstrap/type.less. Adding a font-size on its own doesn't make sense unless it relates to an element or group of elements?

However, I was wondering, where would they save their custom stylesheets ? Won't that have to live on the main server ? Can there be multiple stylesheets for this one theme? Could they store their stylesheets inside the \"Files\" area for their courses? Not sure what is possible. If it is not currently possible, does anyone have an idea what we would need to tweak in the code and/or css to make this a possibility? Thanks so much for any ideas and help!",

To get all theme names from theme folder needs a little php or javascript but it is certainly possible. If I have some extra time during weekend I could try to write that script to theme header.html The basic idea is that when user selects a theme from switcher (or button) it is saved to session / cookie. I have used buttons like in Joomla templates to change theme or font size. They use a small javascript but idea is the same as Urs is using. In a standard Moodle installation, session themes are not active. To activate them the administrator must add the parameter `$CFG->allowthemechangeonurl = true;` to the Moodle config.php file in the Moodle base directory. If you use that other method, javascript is included to theme folder itself and there is no need to change config.php.",

When we migrated from Moodle 1.7 to 1.9 there were some font family and size problems. I've been looking into it and it appears that the \"standard\" theme was working as some kind of master theme and was overriding my font choices in the different themes I made for academic centers. Since it appears that the standard theme affects all of our Moodle instances (we have many!), I would rather not make changes directly to the code so that it should remain pure as the 1.9 version download . How can I make a custom css that overrides it? I feel a little silly asking this. Maybe there is some config.php setting that is causing the problems but I couldn't find it. Ian",

That last point is a bit confusing so here is a quick video to demonstrate.  In the video, you can see that Menu Item 1 is above Menu Item 27.  When I hover above Menu Item 1, it exposes Menu Item 2 through Menu Item 5 in its drop-down menu.  As I move my mouse down the menu, when I get to around Menu Item 3, the submenu for Menu Item 27 appears instead. I reported this on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/covuni/moodle-theme_adaptable/issues/923/navigation-bar-sub-menus",

Simply changing the logo and restarting/purging should not cause this problem - it is more often caused by an error/typo in the php of the layout file in my experience. If you have made any changes you should go back and check those changes as a simple missed semi-colon can cause problems in the php. If you have turned on the 'change theme on url' you could try switching back to standard theme (add ?theme=standard at the end of the site address). If not, try renaming or cutting the formal_white theme out of the theme folder (paste it somewhere else so you can copy it back in later), Moodle should then go back to standard theme by default. Once you are back in, you can enable debugging mode Site Administration->Development->Debugging With that enabled, copy formal_white back into place and reselct as your theme, and hopefully debugging will tell you what has gone wrong. HTH - unless anyone else can suggest a more straightforward solution Richard",

          "Text": "Hi Derek - my understanding and happy to be corrected: 1. MoodleHQ has made a start on adjusting core code towards being bootstrap compatible, but much of it is also having to be done in a less file to override some things and change others. e.g. there is a large amount of work needed in a theme before a bootswatch can just be dropped in to a theme. But, there's a lot of code to change and renderers to create etc and at least things are moving in the right direction! Also, the decision was made to focus on Bootstrap2 which was in place when this process started and not move forward with Bootstrap3 when that came out. 2. Themes do not have to use bootstrap - base and canvas are still in the core - but bootstrapbase and Clean are now the recognised parent and default and most work is based on those rather than the older style themes, so it is highly recommended. 3. Yes, you can use bits of bootstrap in labels and so on to add bootstrap styles to your pages - but check what version of bootstrap the theme is based on! Clean and More and most others use Bootstrap2, but Bas has created a Bootstrap3 base theme which I believe Elegance uses as a parent. You will need to use bootstrap features suitable for the theme you have. Can you give any examples of the 10-20% that the themes don't do for you Derek? Perhaps someone can pick up some of those ideas and run with them if they are practical. R",

As long as BS elements are kept out of core in situations where they cannot be replaced in a theme then its possible to use any framework you want.  Unfortunately I think there is a JS file that does just that with one of the BS2 'span' classes.  But that's a matter for core to solve.",

For me, Bootstrap is just as technical as anything else, it just adds components that mean I don't have to implement my own solution to the same problem.  Like re-inventing the wheel.  But, there is always a learning curve.  To use Bootstrap I've had to learn how it operates and apply it in the correct manner to the problems I've solved. There is no 'magic bullet' that will instantly translate words into complex solutions.  That's the realm of AI, which is still being developed. So in reality the simple answer to \"It's how to deal with the remaining little bit that is the struggle\" is pay somebody!  That's what happens when a skilled job needs to be done and you don't want to do it yourself.  A few years ago I put my arm through the ceiling - big mistake - but I knew nothing of plasterboard and how the fix the tile on the roof that caused the leak that caused the damp that caused the failure of the plasterboard.  So, I payed a good mate of mine who was a builder to sort it.  Far faster, better result and less stressful than attempting it myself. But if you are willing to learn, then \"if a theme \"Uses bootstrap\" can an amateur learn a bit to do things\" = yes, if you try, look and learn from examples, ask questions and persevere when something does not work. I.e. you apply problem solving techniques. Theme wise, Shoehorn is a child of Bas's Bootstrap V3 theme, but there are others out there, UIKit for example and I thought that somebody was making one with Pure.js.  Bootstrap is not 'the solution' for Moodle, it is just one of many possibles. Kind regards, Gareth",

          "Text": "Hi Derek, At last I have managed to get back to my own computer, rather than the iPad Mini I have been using of late. I think Q1 & Q2 have been answered, so I thought I would add my two-cents worth about Q.3. 3. My real question: if a theme \"Uses bootstrap\" can an amateur learn a bit to do things with bootstrap, like for instance the Filter_tabs? The answer to this is a resounding ' YES '. If you remember, I have written about it in the LOOK & LEARN forum post I wrote last year. The real beauty of Bootstrap is in the way it works, which in the majority of cases requires just simple HTML (most of which you can copy) and an understanding that the Bootstrap CSS that it uses to style, the elements you are adding must contain the CSS selectors for these styles to take effect. The 'LazyDaisy' theme I made as a 'prototype' of an idea I had, which works simply by using all of Clean theme's structure and settings but also allowing the Admin user to add a simple Carousel slider via the Text Editor (I use TinyMCE). By just using Copy & Paste predefined text into any part of a page, be it a HTML block or a Course topic, indeed anywhere you can upload images via the editor, in fact even those places where you cannot upload an image via the Editor you can still link to an image if you have a URL for it. Strange thing is I have never had any feedback about it to say it does not work, so I am guessing someone is using it out there besides me! LOL The TAB issue, will work in a Bootstrap theme if the theme has the TAB jQuery that allows the toggle between tabs to work. Cheers Mary",

If EduHub doesn't have that as an option, then the only way to do it is either swap themes to one that does, or to edit your theme (or make a child of it) with the same kind of override to the renderers that produce that font page that you can see in the themes that work the way you want.

I have made a Tracker item, MDL-57305 , requesting that the feature to collapse blocks be added to the BOOST theme.  However, it is has not been worked on.  I am somewhat \"dreaming\" that I could temporarily fix this by just copying the block code for MORE over to the block code for BOOST.  I am not a programmer, but replacing code might be doable.  Of course, I would prefer that the right moodle developer do this and close out MDL-57305 .",

Sorry to have got you concerned - I perhaps haven't been\ncommunicating my changes and there likely impact clearly enough. I will\nalso post to the themes forum. I\nthink you can see from Urs' comments that the themes issue is not as\nbig as you initially feared. I have now used Moodle's theme previewer\nto quantify the impact - a quick and dirty table is attached which\ndemonstrates that of the 15 themes previewed 12 appear to need no\nchange - 80% success. The 3 that need some modification include the\n'pda' theme, which would have need checking for accessibility/ usability in any case. Why the <i>You are here</i> using italics...? - I like compact markup, but in this case I agree it could confuse other developers - will fix ASAP. New arrow images... should use $CFG->pixpath - will fix ASAP, and look at filenames. (The 'em1' in the name refers to them being resizable - try Ctrl + Mouse wheel.) I'm\nfully aware of the need to minimise risk at this late stage and I will\nwork with the theme maintainers. I hope this reassures you - comments\nwelcome.",

          "Text": "So I've been trying to figure out how to go about having different styles for different courses while leveraging the awesome new Boost theme. I'd love to have some insights from the community, especially the third approach. Also, is there any other way to achieve custom styling per course? The first approach I tried is using a preset with SCSS structured like such: \n```text\n.course-1 {\n\n\n   .page-header {\n\n\n       ...\n\n\n   }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n.course-5 {\n\n\n   .page-header {\n\n\n      ...\n\n\n   }\n\n\n}\n```\n What bothers me with this is: I'll end up with one huge file growing endlessly. I can't seem to figure out how I'm supposed to bundle images with presets. I can't redefine SCSS variables ($bg-color, etc.) per course. The second approach I tried is making a child theme, putting each \".course-XYZ\" section into a separate file, then appending every files' content together through theme_MYTHEME_get_main_scss_content() . I can now upload images into MYTHEME/pix and refer to them in the scss files with the [[pix:theme|…]] syntax. A new custom course appearance means simply adding a new SCSS file to a folder. With this approach, the actual delivered CSS continues to grow with each\ncustomized course, although IMHO caring about that would be\na case of premature optimization. What really bothers me though is that I still can't redefine variables per course. The third approach … I'm still trying figure out if this is even feasible and/or overkill. I realize that to redefine SCSS variables per course: the SASS transpiler must run once for each customized course, the result would be one complete transpiled CSS file for each customized course, the theme would need to serve a different CSS file for each customized course. Right now, the theme stylesheet is served through moodle/theme/styles.php , but this controller doesn't seem cut for that job: it is oblivious to the context and does not accept any argument relating to which stylesheet to serve for a particular theme (it only accepts all ). Since that controller deals with a whole lot (transpiling, caching…) I fear that circumventing theme/styles.php by overloading theme_config::css_urls() is a big deal and kind of ill advised (Is it? Has it been done?). The fourth approach : I guess I could just build a child theme for every course that needs customizing and enable allowcoursethemes . My main beef with this approach is the amount of boilerplate that we'll go through every time we need to produce some light customizing (color changes + a few background images)… although some scripting might alleviate that.",

It depends on how it gets read and included into the theme. Note - haven't actually tried this, its just thinking aloud!",

          "Text": "Hey Moodle theme devs! I'm working with Moodle 2.9.1 primarily, but possibly also Moodle 2.7.x. I'm starting a new theme project that may end up being the base for multiple client themes. In the past I've just cloned my base theme and made any modifications as necessary, this doesn't seem like an optimal way to maintain the base theme and be able to push updates to the base while leaving any client overrides intact. This is where I believe Moodles dependencies come into play. If I understand these correctly any plugin can have a dependency on another defined in the config like so: $plugin->dependencies = array( `'theme_bootstrapbase'  => 2015050500,` `'theme_clean'  => 2015051100,` On its own all this does is check whether the following plugins are installed and have a minimum version. Then within our theme we can declare the parent themes like so: `$THEME->parents = array('bootstrapbase', 'clean');` How does this parents list work? For example the first parent has it's config file load, following by the second parent and then finally the current themes configuration, with any re-declarations overriding the previous? I'm interested in whether my understanding of this is correct and how extensive the inheritance is? If my new theme does not declare a layout for the frontpage, but the second parent does than will that layout be used? I've seen a command to exclude specific css sheets from any given parent so I assume all css used by the parent is inherited by default and any rules that conflict will be resolved by load order. Are settings inherited from parent to child themes? Are resources from a parent theme usable by children themes? i.e the pix folder If anyone has an understanding of theme dependencies / inheritance or an example of how to set one up I would be very interested to have a chat regarding it. My plan as I see it is to either modify the clean / more theme provided in moodle core OR have a new theme dependent on one of them that will act as my base, then whenever I need a client specific theme I will simply say that it is dependent on my new base. This would allow my base to accept updates from clean / more and my client themes to accept updates to my base as I improve it moving forward.",

Look for styles_layout.css and styles_color.css in the standard theme's folder. There is a theme which uses a login button...you can view it HERE The code for that is as follows... #submit { background : transparent url(images/header/login.png) no-repeat scroll left top ; border-width : 0 ; color : #FFFFFF ; font-size : 1em ; font-weight : bold ; height : 25px ; padding-bottom : 5px ; width : 62px ; } The part of the code needed to relocate the language menu is a little more complex and can be found in the header.html, but this can be tricky if you are not familiar with PHP.

          "Text": "Hello I have been given the job to theme our Moodle site but have been told that the College would like a very distinctive look and feel for 1) the school and 2) the Sixth Form. Just to get a feel of how themes work, I have applied the Clouds theme to the site as the college theme. I copied the Clouds folder, changed the logos to say \"Sixth Form\" and uploaded the folder with a different name as the Sixth Form theme. When I apply the Sixth Form theme on an individual course, everything in the Header still comes from the college theme (for example, this is what I see when I right-click and go to properties http://learning.st-pauls.w-sussex.sch.uk/theme/college/pix/logoleft_small.jpg ) and all the small icons throughout the page look scrambled. I was wondering if this was because themes are inherited in some way. Does it mean we wouldn't be able to have a completely different logo, backgrounds etc on the Sixth Form courses because elements are inherited from the College theme? Or am I completely on the wrong lines. I'm sorry if this is not very clear. It may be useful to know I have an alright knowledge of CSS and HTML but I'm very limited when it comes to PHP. Any help would be much appreciated. Daniel",

With your help, I have managed to get the main theme that I was talking about up and running which is great. http://learning.st-pauls.w-sussex.sch.uk/ I still need to develop a different theme to apply to the Sixth Form courses. From my experiments though, it looks like when you apply a theme to an individual course, it doesn't change the header or footer but only applies the styleguide changes (e.g. fonts and colours etc). Am I right in my assumption? I think the boss was hoping to have a completely different look and feel for the Sixth Form. Perhaps we need a separate instance of Moodle altogether.

I've reaches a roadblock where it seems that CSS isn't implemented to do what I'd like, and so I've got some layout editing to do, or so it seems. http://www.bel.com/moodle/ As you can see, I have the grid background, and it's dark. Ideally, no body text should be displayed over that background. All content text should be inside of a container DIV. This is already accomplished on Course Views. However, on some activity view.php pages, such as Lesson , Glossary, and Quizes, the text overlays the background. I've identified this DIV to be .container. However, I can't just go and make .container have a background-color property, or I loose the background on the Course View pages. I've modified the view.php for the Lesson module already so that a NEW DIV container encloses the .container DIV, and has the background-color and border-color properties set. I did this by opening a DIV after the header function and closing before the footer function.",

The other (probably simpler) option would be to use the Topic0/Summary section to add a menu system which is separate from the main site menu and relates just to that course - if you then need it on every course, the html code can be copied and pasted with a fairly simple search&replace to change the course id each time.

So yes, Magazine is in effect a child theme of base and yes, you can simply reinstall it if you make changes to it and want to revert to the original for whatever reason. The main reason we usually recommend child themes though is that should any bug fixes or developments get done on the theme you are using, you may lose all of your own changes if you need to upgrade. Now while that may be increasingly less likely (should that be decreasingly likely?) with the legacy themes, it is still a possibility to consider. Child themes also allow you to do something along the lines you were asking about - have a main theme for your site, and then have a minimalistic child theme that just has minor css changes for specific users, whether thats teachers as you were asking, or as I've used it previously, dyslexic students requiring particular colour 'overlay' or tinting to the pages. I used the minimal child theme to create 4 or 5 colour variations for dyslexic and partially sighted (hi contrast, larger font) users to select and this meant that more large scale changes I might make to the overall site (e.g. replacing the logo) would be inherited by the child themes, without having to apply all my changes to each theme individually.

Users can then select a theme in their profile page - I have previously set these in the database and used css to hide the option in the profile page when I wanted to apply specific themes, but didn't want some of the users (KS2 children in this case) to make changes. http://localhost/moodlemaster/admin/settings.php?section=themesettings So, the example I gave earlier: I created a main theme which was (at that time) based on my Krystle theme, but coloured according to the institution branding. I also created 5 child themes which had very minor colour/style changes in consultation with our student support services. These were essentially built on the mnimal theme that is provided as a zip file on the forum thread I linked to earlier. Several students were then able to make use of these child themes to customise the appearance of the moodle site according to their requirements. When I later needed to change the main theme to accomodate brand changes (a merger resulting in new colours/logo), I only needed to make these changes to the main theme and they were then inherited by the child themes automatically.",

You can however, also apply specific themes at the course level if that is what you are trying to achieve.  That way, whoever enters the course will see it with the theme that is set unless they have an overriding theme set somewhere else. Did I totally confuse you?  Hope not!! A child theme is basically a theme that you create yourself and then make it dependent on the theme that you are basing it off.  You can make a child theme of any theme you want.  It is a way to adjust some settings on a theme that you like for the most part and a way to be able to save those settings/changes when the parent theme goes through an upgrade.",

I wanted to keep the colour switch, and display a unique logo for that colour scheme, for example logored.jpg with red colour scheme and logoblue.jpg with blue colour scheme. I tried to find relevant codes in general.php, settings.php and sl. css ; but could not figure out how to do that. Then I tried an alternative trick by using the images, and it worked. I explain it below for the benefit of all. Thanks Suranga ** Here’s how to do that** There are four images for background in pix folder named lbgv2.jpg, lbgv2blue.jpg, lbgv2green.jpg and lbgv2orange.jpg; edit these to have relevant logo images inside them and replace the original files in the ‘pix’ folder. (Note that lbgv2.jpg is for red colour scheme.) Now you get the custom colour logo for each colour scheme. But, you see unnecessary text (your site name) over your logo image. That is because no logo image is defined for Logo in ‘appearnce>themes>Splash. Now, this is the trick. Create an empty png file (i.e. a transparent file with nothing in it), 230px wide and height of your choice (Location of your ‘Tag Line’ will depend on this height - try different heights and see, I use 160px). Place this file in the ‘pix’ folder and give its http link as the Logo in the settings page. Purge your cache, .... it’s done.",

If you need more space for your logo, first you would need to edit core. css and change: div.thetitle {    width: 340px;    height: 130px;    float: left;} You would need to adjust the size here. Then, in colors.css you may (or may not) need to adjust the background position of the logo. So you would change: div.thetitle {    background: url( setting:logo ) no-repeat 0% 50%;} Change the %s to adjust the placement. Don't forget to clear  the theme cache after making any changes.

This is a pity as I love both themes. I had the same problem with Pioneer on 3.1 and Fordson on 3.2. Both clean installs with new database and no other plugins. My old 3.0 site had many plugins, worked with no problems for over a year until November 2016 I've tried all three ways of installing new plugins but always get the following error message when I try to update the database Coding error detected, it must be fixed by a programmer: The data source class does not exist. More information about this error ×Debug info: Error code: codingerror ×Stack trace: line 513 of /cache/classes/definition.php: coding_exception thrown line 515 of /cache/classes/helper.php: call to cache_definition::load() line 480 of /cache/classes/helper.php: call to cache_helper::purge_store() line 1737 of /lib/upgradelib.php: call to cache_helper::purge_all() line 683 of /admin/index.php: call to upgrade_noncore() Can anybody help? Thank you in advance",

Latest versions of 3.1 and 3.2: I have reinstalled a few times. Both 3.1 and 3.2 were clean installs. Clean theme: I installed the pioneer theme and the board format using Clean and had no problems. After experiencing problems with Pioneer I reverted to Clean but as you thought I continued to have problems. Tjhsi is why my first Moodledata folder: Your thinking makes sense as I use the same moodledata folder for all my installs. If the problem is permissions on Moodledata, can you give me more information for checking these. I have whm root access if that helps. More information: I run my Moodles in subfolders of my wordpress site.",

Thank you for your interest in Pioneer and Fordson.  I don't believe the themes are the root of the issues your experiencing. Create a new folder next to the current Moodlesite folder.  Edit one of the Moodle config.php file to utilize the new data folder.  Make sure www can read and write to your folders. That should fix the issue of shared data folders.",

It's crazy...\" Other times you know there is policy behind things, like the issue around ATTO, styles, colour and tables: https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-45515 - but you don't know what it is. Colin has asked questions here.  \"Why are devs deciding what we should and should not do?\" I'm not blaming devs, because they would answer them if they noticed the questions.  But they get lost in 2518 posts a day.  Hence my idea for a dedicated channel. Good luck with your CSS fixes Mary.  I wonder if there is comment in the code to answer your why question. -Derek",

Moving the \"content\" items down so that the top of the navbar is at the bottom of our logo (at 150px) and Making our logo a background image for the header so that the \"You are logged in as...\" message is at the top margin of the page. Please help!  I'm a novice at this.  Thanks. Mike Ryan",

          "Text": "Thanks Alan. I tried what you suggest and it does work to an extent.  The OrangeWhite color strip that forms the background for the breadcrumbs and everything below it are moved down (based on what you said I've decided not to mess around with the background).  So that problem is taken care of.  However, this has produced a couple of other problems. First, my logo image goes all the way across and off the screen on the right instead of having a white right margin.  Yet, the colorstrip (see above), which is 1800px wide (my logo is 1024 wide), does have the white margin. Second, it appears that normally the login info and the navmenu and button are at the very top of the page on the right.  My logo moves them both down so that they are just below the logo. Third, in reference to the preceding paragraph, the OrangeWhite colorstrip covers up the login info and the navmenu and button. I've tried several different things in the styles_layout.css file attempting to solve the above problems one at a time, but none have done so.  What do I do to solve these (one at a time).  I appreciate any help you can provide.  Thanks.

          "Text": "I seem to have found the solution to the problems mentioned in my previous reply. It seems that all three problems are related to the width of the image I'm using that contains the logo.  By editing the image and reducing its width to under 450 (it's possible it could be wider, but I haven't tried) the login info and navmenu are positioned where they normally are.  The problem here is that the logo is no longer a banner but a simple image with white space on the right where the login info and navmenu go. Using the cornflower theme as a model, I solved this problem by creating a table, the opening tags for which are in header.htm just below the <body> tag and the closing tags are just above the </body> tag in footer.htm.  I then used the bgcolor attribute wihin the opening table tag to set the background color to match the background in the logo image.  The result is that the header has the appearance of a full width banner that also extends down to the top of the colorstrip, which is what I wanted.  The first attempt had the background color visible for the length of the page.  However, when I set the table border to 0 instead of one this disappeared with a much more pleasing effect. Now, I only have to figure out a) how to remove the background color from the bottom of the page and b) to duplicate the colorstrip and the breadcrumbs in the footer.  But that's for another week.

In the header.html, you will find an option to insert banners for all pages. Now u will be able to see the banners at all pages except in the landing page (front page). if you need to customize some more pages without the common banner, then you have to edit the pages manually by changing few things in the code. say as example, you need to customize the signup.php page under the login folder of moodle and u dont want the banner to come at the top. Just edit the signup.php page and modify the code that comes at the bottom. THis is the standard code.... print_header($newaccount, $newaccount, $navigation, $mform_signup->focus(), \"\", true, ''); you will hv to change this to print_header('', '', $navigation, $mform_signup->focus(), \"\", true, ''); give null values for the $newaacount and change the banner for this page separately. See that it works, or else, send a reply, so that we cud discuss more. i am attaching 2 pics of samples. so that u will get an overall idea. one is d the sigup page without banners... and another is the inside page with banner. thanking you.

But i think i'd like a different way of checking which banner to feed. any other suggestions out there?",

Sorry for posting here. I though this should be relating to a theme issue but it is not. After that you can go to your theme in the path \"/pix/f/\" and add the icon mcd.gif as stated above",

          "Text": "Background: When enabled, user themes can changed by the user in their profile. This is great where it is desirable to allow the selection of more accessible themes and to enable per-user personalisation but sometimes we want to assign a specific theme for that user and a sub-set of themes that they can choose from. In cases where there are users on the same site and branding must be exclusive to them it's not possible for an \"administrator\" to specify a theme for a specific user without them being able to select the theme for the other group. Although the themes in the selection list can be limited by the site admin this list is visible to all users. The course and category theme options work fine if each groups courses are arranged in that hierarchy but this is not always the case. Scenario: One Moodle siteTwo clients e.g. competing airlinesEach client has it's own brandingRequirement is that everything a user sees once they log in must be in their company's branding.Some courses i.e in the same category are shared by both companies.We want the user to be able to change themes to more accessible sub-set of themes (which would need to be generic for the entire site I think) but only to be able to change back to a default user theme that is appropriate for that user i.e. their own airline not the competitor.Alternatively if there is not sub-set they would only see the allocated user theme in their profile. Problem: There is no way (that I am aware of) to include user theme information in an upload file - this would need to be entered directly in the database .The ability for users to switch to any theme made avaiable on the site is universal. Solution: I think these are the requirement to solve this issue, I'm open to other suggestions... *Add the ability to select one or more themes that any user may select in their profile.*Introduce a default user theme i.e. one that is specifically allocated to them and cannot be changed other than to the theme in the globally selectable group.*Enable the ability to allocate a default user theme in the CSV upload process. I've created an improvement issue in the tracker for this suggestion, please feel free to vote for it and add your suggested improvements there. MDL-27276",

This, as I see it, would also make reporting back easier in not having to separate out employees of the different clients who have accessed the same course. Themes can then be set on a course/category basis rather than for every user. I realise this would entail some duplication of resources as several courses or categories may be identical for both sets of users (other than the branding), but that seems to me a simpler solution than the added complexity of potentially setting a different set of themes for every user - whether manually or through csv.

Well, then you have less control. The renderer base class controls which arguments are passed into the method. If you need more data, then you have to break the rules and get it. In an ideal world, you put the logic to get that data into some other object or fuction, so all the renderer has to do is call it.

Peering at the code for that theme, I can't seem to figure out how/where that is done. I'd like to add that behavior to Formfactor, which I've been tweaking to my liking. Does anyone know where I should look or how I should do that? I think it'll make my poor, unqualified site admin job a lot easier if teachers get some visual cue that tells them that something is not visible to the students... Aw, who am I kidding? It'll trip me up at least as much as them! Thanks in advance!",

I've pasted the CSS you have recommended here and elsewhere, into Leatherbound's core.css, and what it does is make the text turn gray when you are in the editing mode, but not when you're not! I enter the course, and everything--regardless of visibility--is regular colors, then I go into the editing mode and it's still regular colors, then I use the eye icon to show something and then hide it, and the text turns gray, then I get out of the editing mode and everything goes back to regular colors. Repeat. Any idea about how to handle this? If I can get it working properly in one theme, I'll probably just paste it into the others that peope are using. I'm still running 2.0.2.

I mean, useful additions to the learning experience!) I've been looking at bootstrap and css snippets on the W3Schools site and have been trying out a couple. Some of the Moodle Themes state that they are based on Bootstrap, but others don't state this.  For example, Shoehorn labels this clearly, but Morecandy doesn't (though I seem to remember that Mary posted some additional code which came from there).  Is there a list of themes based on Bootstrap, or some easy way to identify this? A further noob question is, if a theme is based on Bootstrap, do all the Bootstrap functions (say, Modal or Popover) automatically work or does it depend on whether the theme developer chose to include them? What I'm basically trying to do is to avoid having to do a \"suck it and see\" test with every snippet in different themes just to make sure that they work in different environments. Thanks for any tips or pointers! Andy",

With \"do all the Bootstrap functions (say, Modal or Popover) automatically work\", then yes it does depend on if the developer has chosen to include the JavaScript for them.  There are also differences between BS 2.3.0 (Moodle core - Bootstrap base and any other child themes like Shoelace and Campus), BS 2.3.2 (Essential etc.) and BS 3.3.5 (Bootstrap and Shoehorn). With \"suck it and see test\", then I recommend testing anyway as there could be a bug in the theme that prevents it.  That's Software Engineering, you need to test everything. Cheers, Gareth",

Incidentally, the info which you posted in the forum thread would, IMO , be an excellent candidate for a Moodle Doc.  If the developers of new themes added that information as they updated it (perhaps with a column as to whether they supported the full set of Bootstrap elements or only certain ones) then this would be useful for Moodlers when setting up their sites.  They would know more about what they were getting.

That said, Morecandy is based on the More theme so by definition is a Bootstrapbase theme. We cannot say Bootstrap as Bootstrap come in different versions. Bootstrap 3 is different than the Bootstrap 2.3.2 that our theme CSS & JavaScript/jQuery that Moodle themes are based on. So to answer your question which version of Bootstrap are you referring to? The easiest way to determine if a Moodle theme is a BootstrapBase theme then look at the actual themes version.php as that should state what themes it is dependent on. For example: https://github.com/lazydaisy/moodle/blob/master/theme/more/version.php Hope this helps? Mary",

Mary, I had forgotten the \"base\" bit on the end of the theme name, hence my confusing remarks.  I haven't got to the point of going about this in any sort of scientific manner yet.  I started by simply taking some snippets from Bootstrap 3 in the W3Schools site and seeing if they worked on my main site (which uses Morecandy).  I was quite pleased with the effect and thought that they would improve the learner experience. The idea is to create a \"warehouse\" course which would store a pile of labels, html blocks and so on which could then be imported into other sites and from there used in different courses.  In my case as a language teacher I'd be looking at bundling grammar explanations and similar stuff which is often recycled in  in a range of courses. The issue is to get maximum compatibility from the start, so I'm looking at what would be needed to cover all the bases (or as many bases as possible) to minimise the amount of tailoring later.  I'm going to set up an instance of Moodle with a standard theme and then a set of blank courses all with different themes to check the functionality of any given imported label or block.  Given the amount of work involved in setting it all up, I'm trying to make sure I don't overlook something obvious at the start.

You could probably add a region that pushes across, as the main region does when the flat navigation region is displayed, or possibly arrange it so it stays where it is and hides behind the pull out region. Whatever you decide to try, it would need to be a child theme rather than Boost itself, or you would risk losing any changes next time you upgrade Moodle.",

The only way to fix the issue was to manually update the record into database config table for that setting and after that use moosh to clean the cache. Moodle version: managed to replicate the issue on: 3.1+ (Build: 20160609) and 2.9.2 (Build: 20150914) but I suspect the issue is present in any recent moodle versions name and version of the theme doesn' t matter I understand that we should trust content inserted by admins, but in this case as the purpose of that box is only to add additional html maybe the code here (admin/settings/appearance.php) should be changed from: $temp->add(new admin_setting_configtextarea('additionalhtmltopofbody', new lang_string('additionalhtmltopofbody', 'admin'), new lang_string('additionalhtmltopofbody_desc', 'admin'), '', PARAM_RAW)); to: $temp->add(new admin_setting_configtextarea('additionalhtmltopofbody', new lang_string('additionalhtmltopofbody', 'admin'), new lang_string('additionalhtmltopofbody_desc', 'admin'), '', PARAM_CLEANHTML)); Regards",

There is an admin setting to turn this feature on/off - it is off by default as it does take a bit of processing overhead. If it is switched on then you will be able to select a theme when editing categories. The theme will then apply to all courses in that category or child categories and the category page itself. 2. The priority of themes can now be set ie which theme wins when there are several set at different levels. You can set a variable in config.php called $CFG->themeorder (see config-dist.php for more details). By default it is set to: $CFG->themeorder = array('page', 'course', 'category', 'session', 'user', 'site'); Cheers, Shane.",

Don't forget to add the required setting in your Theme's config.php... \n```text\n$THEMES->javascripts = array('mycustomjsfilename');\n```\n Or this line if it's a .min file... \n```text\n$THEMES->javascripts_footer = array('mycustomjsfilename');\n```\n Where 'mycustomjsfilename' is the name of your js file. Hope this helps? PS: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=352246 Thus is a link to a previous post from last year, which explains how JQuery/JS works in Boost theme...!!!

We have divided Users under different Categories (For eg : HR, Finance,.......) . When a User creates an account would select the category applicable to him. Category is a custom profile field. Based on the Category of users, different courses would get exposed to them. A User under the category HR should have HR Courses getting shown and those under Finance Category should be able to see Finance Courses. Is there a way to restrict or hide menus based on User profile field. Appreciate your help. Thanks in advance.",

I'm going to add this to Moodle Tracker now and fix it this weekend too...and hope it passes the review! This fix will go into Base theme. Also just a note of caution. When you make changes to any CSS, you need to add the new  rule to the end of the file. That ensures that any similar rule will be over ridden by your new one. Also creating a new css file is OK as long as you add the new css file to the list of stylesheets already in config.php in the theme directory. Also...and I should have said this at the start that you are advised to copy a theme folder and customise it rather than change the code of one of the core themes as these will be overwritten when you upgrade your Moodle site.

If you leave the menu and return, then all items will have a colored backgroung. This only happens in menus with more than 4 items. Is it some type of bug or it might be an error of mine?

It was resolved when I updated the YUI library in my moodle install - although the same should be achieved by ensuring you have the latest moodle version on your server . In my case, I downloaded the YUI library from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ and used ftp to replace it over the one in the moodle directory (I didn't have time when I was exploring to do a full upgrade of my moodle install - planning that for the Easter holidays now!). It is also worth checking your code carefully especially menu.php and the relevant css file (I'd copied everything into one css file to make it easier to find, for me anyway!) - when I did I found a simple > missing in one place in the menu.php file (sorry can't remember where though at the moment). If you want me to check your code too (on the basis that 2 pairs of eyes are better than one - not on the basis of expert opinion!) I'd be happy to look at it as soon as I get chance if you want to email it to me. Richard",

The point is we have 47 segments in  a particular course. When I open it, the browser does not load the site completely. That means in the first case the course site becomes visible, but the javascript links for adding materials or activities to a segment are not shown. In the browser console I get the message: require.min.js:10 Uncaught Error: Load timeout for modules: jqueryprivate http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#timeout Can you get me started how to overcome this mistake and let people be able to add materials or activities to the segments ? If I limit it to say the first 10 segments everything works. Looking forward to your help … thanks in advance ! Best Regards, Sonja",

What is the suitable way to track the error further ? Javascript ? Is it worth to exchange require.min.js  for e.g. require.js and see what's the matter in line 10 ... and to correct it ? sorry .. I'm a little bit clueless. Another point... I uploaded an .mbz-file  on another server a order insert the course on another moodle - plattform. In the course of doing so, I got the an error message saying \"missing aliases\" or similar. ... Anybody an idea what that means ? Relevant for the js.prob ? best, Sonja",

We expect to add more courses in these languages and other languages, probably 5 or 6 languages total. Currently we have about a dozen courses in English, but only 1 each translated to Polish and Spanish. So I am contemplating how best to list the courses on the home page. I am running Moodle 3.3 with the latest update of the Essential theme. I have created course categories for each language. After we get a lot of the courses translated, it will make sense to just have the categories listed on the home page. But with most of our courses being in English now that probably isn't the best approach initially. I would welcome suggestions on how best to organize the home page. I also have not been able to find the setting in the Essential theme to display categories and lists of courses. I know I have done this before when building other sites. Where is the setting for displaying lists of courses vs. categories on the home page? Many thanks! John",

I have spend the last 5 hours fixing this theme. It's pretty easy to use. It has one settings page and is based on More theme. The only difference is that it also has a 4 column page in My Dashboard and My Public pages. If you get stuck adding and dragging blocks around the page just hit the Reset page button and start over. It takes a bit of getting used to. It has two menu types built into the layout. One that you set in Moodle as normal this will show up on pages after login. The other menu is activated via the Morecandy settings page. This menu only shows up on the front page before login, so it is meant for visitors and as such needs to be pretty simple so steer clear of too many sub menu items, as these can be problematic in small devices. One of the nicest features is the Carousel which you can add in the site topic area. Instructions are in the README.txt file within the theme and can be accesses from your site URL by adding /theme/morecandy/README.txt just after your site address, for example: http://univercity-of-life.com/theme/morecandy/README.txt I trust that will keep you all busy. Many thanks to all who have helped me with this theme. Also sorry for the delay in fixing it. Thanks an God Bless Mary",

          "Text": "Moodle 2.8.9 Build 20151218 I have one category of \"courses\" that are used for a non-instructional internal initiative in our school district. On the \"My\" home, I've created an HTML block with a link that takes staff to this \"staff-only\" category listing of courses. The problem is that I want just that page to have some custom CSS to make it less scroll-heavy and more like a bootstrap column layout. I've got that code ready to go. The thing I can't figure out is how to make the changes apply only to that one category page. An example would be sample.moodle.org/course/index.php?categoryid=29 I want the other course-index category pages to look as they normally would. I've tried referencing the category-id in a multitude of ways in the custom CSS field in the general settings. I don't know how (of if it's even possible) to add a unique class id to the html for just that page (which would then let me call that id in the CSS). Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!",

The images in the container, with initial settings, always stay at 100% width of the container and maintain their aspect ratio, which I do not want. (Nor can I imagine, would anyone.) I would prefer them exhibit the \"contain\" behavior which I believe would keep them within the container, maintain their aspect ratio and resize responsively. However, when attempting to make those modifications, I get numerous strange effects. Please note: I have tried numerous settings in the file here: \".../theme/elegance/layout/includes/slideshow.php\" on line 145 For example, \"<li id=\"slide1\" style=\"background-image: url(<?php echo $slide1image ?>); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain;\">\" but also numerous other settings such as background-size: 100% auto, et al per other discussions in this forum. I think the error may be further up in the page at line 142 with  <ul style=\"width: 400%; position: relative; left: -200%; height: 415px;\"> In firebug , this seems to be causing some dynamic changes in the css which causes misalignment of text and images (but not the dots on the slider!). Below is an example of the code in firebug. < div class =\" banner has-dots has-arrows \" style =\" overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 250px; \" > < ul style =\" width: 300%; position: relative; left: 0% ; height: 250px; \" > The second line left position % changes with each slide. I am not a programmer, so I hope I've been clear about this issue. Am I on to the source of the error? If so, how can I edit the slideshow.php line to correct this. The project is a bust without a working responsive slider. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",

You are free to use a different theme for an individual user, such as the Administrator, or to construct a theme that looks different on certain pages, such as Settings. However, other than the Site Admin role, roles in Moodle are applied at a context level, not at a site level - ie a user could be a teacher in one course, but a student in another, and even within that system, permissions can be tweaked so that an individual user (or role) can access settings and other 'backend' pages which the core default permissions may not normally give them. So constant switching between different interfaces would be disconcerting for many ( IMO ). Moodle is far more than a CMS, with far more complex activities , settings, roles and permissions, so has a different way of working to simpler systems. 'Incredibly bizarre'  No, just what you are used to - I find it (although getting used to) weird that in WP I have to go to a totally different interface to edit anything, where in Moodle (which is what I got used to at first), I can edit in place provided permissions allow. To me, that is the natural behaviour and what I would want to see in a system - but I don't go around calling WordPress 'bizarre' because it doesn't work the same way as Moodle.",

From a developer who has used a lot of CMSs, I find this to be incredibly bizarre. \" - that's not what I understand by the concept of a Front and Back end whereby the UI is the front end (view) and the back end the database / model / controller, in MVC (Model View Controller).  So with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends then CSS is always at the 'front end' and cannot be applied to the 'back end'.  So I think you might be confused with the different views presented to users depending on their role.  So in Wordpress there is the administration dashboard which is the UI to control things, however it still uses styles that are used for the site, such as font, heading and paragraph.  Therefore Moodle is no different to any other CMS in this respect.

However,  you mentioned the logo as being different and that is true.  Once away from the homepage we remove the logo to save space and scrolling.  The Fordson logo is meant to only appear on the homepage above where the slideshow is. Normal Moodle logos will work but those are in Appearance > Logos. These logos switch positions depending on what page you are on.  This is default moodle functionality.  On the homepage I think they appear where the course/page title appears.  Once in a course it switches to the nav bar in the upper left.",

Is there any documentation of the theme that lays out all the IDs and classes used, or am I just dreaming? thanks yet again. JL",

The CSS in SCSS format which is CSS most of the time but layer out like LESS in a more structured way but still available to inspect you will find this in theme / boost / scss / moodle/ To do what you want is a bit tricky. The logo should be easy to alter, however the changing the username to an image is not easy. For this you would need to alter one if the template files as well as need to write a renderer. To do all this you would really need to start thinking about designing / building your own custom theme based on the Boost theme. You can view all those files in Moodle GitHub Hope this helps? Mary",

As far as changing logo size is concerned, here is the SCSS in core.scss that seems relevant: /** Page header */ #page-header { .logo { margin: $spacer 0; img { max-height: 75px; } } } /** Header. */ header { There seem to be 2 or 3 possible logo heights at work here - so not really sure where to start - and then that rather sinister warning at the end about not touching anything unless I know exactly what I'm doing... I don't want to take lots of your time getting help if I don't have the capacity to use it. Should I just switch to a theme that has more settings and options that can be changed in the front end, and/or that perhaps has some support available? JL",

However you can get round this but styling each page differently so a fontpage can look different than the login page the course pages, the incourse pages, the admin pages, the report pages, etc. To do this you add the body class infront of the CSS you want to change. .pagelayout-frontpage .pagelayout-base .pagelayout-standard .pagelayout-admin .pagelayout-course .pagelayout-coursecategory .pagelayout-incourse .pagelayout-mydashboard .pagelayout-mypublic .pagelayout-login .pagelayout-report .pagelayout-secure In fact all these layouts listed in the boost config.php which is relevant for ALL themes in Moodle https://github.com/lazydaisy/moodle/blob/master/theme/boost/config.php#L36-L145 Another TRICK Try colour coding the places you want to change: #page-header { background-color: green; } .page- context -header { background-color: red;} That way you learn where each bit of CSS is styling. You can add all this css into the Raw SCSS box in Site-Administration > Appearance > Theme > Boost -> Advanced settings page. Hope this helps? Mary",

I'm getting white space on the right of my screen even though there are no blocks there. I'm also getting the add block block popping up on the right sometimes (only sometimes) when in edit mode. Now Ive set somewhere that i don't want a right col in the back end of moodle but i don;t remember where that setting was as when i edit a block i get options of left and left for where it goes. My main problem however is when i edit my theme, so that pre and post are read into the same div (a float left div with content on the right) I get a blank white screen and nothing loads. What can i do to remove right column from inside moodle it's self. and what can i do about having the pre and post code being claled out one after another?",

          "Text": "LOL... Well a lot of the people who help on these forums have been playing with Moodle 2.0 themes most of last year...so we are a little ahead of you, but even so, it's not easy to explain what to do, and as yet there is only one tutorial which needs updating. But it does explain things well enough. What you must do is make changes to your config.php in your theme's folder. This is what governs the way the page will display. You need to make sure the column you don't want is not listed along side the region layout...(see highlighted lines) Make sure ALL regions (which have sides listed) use the same regions as those I have highlighted here. (This in only part of the full list in config.php base theme). $THEME->layouts = array( // Most backwards compatible layout without the blocks - this is the layout used by default 'base' => array( 'file' => 'general.php', 'regions' => array(), ), // Standard layout with blocks, this is recommended for most pages with general information 'standard' => array( 'file' => 'general.php', 'regions' => array('side-pre' , 'side-post' ), 'defaultregion' => 'side-pre', ), // Main course page delete the ones marked thus Your next thing is to look at the pagelayout. css it's in this file where you will find all the code for the layout. You need to be very careful how you code the css as it is finely tuned. At the bottom of the page you will see a whole bank of settings for side pre only and side post only and content only. These too are important. The one you need to concentrate on is side-pre-only as this is what you are aiming for. Here are some links to help you style your new theme... the 2 column layout... http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-2-column-left-menu-pixels.htm and the Holy Grail 3 column layout that Moodle Themes are based on... http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-3-column-holy-grail-pixels.htm reading about the structure of the page is half the battle. YOu need to look at the source code for each of these links to get the code and the css. Happy moodleling... Hope this helps? PS: You might like to look at some 2 column themes in Moodle 2 core. Fusion is one such theme, all though it uses the right-hand column, but even so it will give you an idea how the general.php is set out with respect to side column OUTPUT php. Mary",

If you enable allowthemechangeonurl you will be able to construct links in your menu bar that change the theme. All you need to do is add `''?theme=whatever''` or `''&theme=whatever''` to the end of your URL . If you are doing it through the custom menu you will need to construct a permanent URL, it will work fine but of course your users will be redirected back away from where ever they are. Alternatively if you have your own theme and have your own top menu then I'd recommend the following code: \n```text\n \n\n\n\necho html_writer::link(new moodle_url($PAGE->url, array('theme' => 'whatever')), 'The whatever theme');\n```\n This will produce a link that will change the theme, and in most cases take the user back to the page they were viewing. Hope that helps.",

I've just created duplicate themes with differing colours for different accessibility needs and made all available to students in their profile. Seems the easiest way overall, although the menu would have been easiest for students. Thanks",

          "Text": "Hello, This is a very exciting discovery for me that I thought I would share! I'm not a PHP programmer, though it interests me, and my specialties are more with CSS and XHTML . Thanks to Mauno Korpelainen for finally helping connect the dots to this solution . Designers can have this line of code put into the <header> tag below the other style sheet links of the \"header.html\" file in a given theme. Of course, putting it on the bottom gives it highest priority in the cascade to over-ride other themes. <link href=\"<?php echo $CFG-> wwwroot .'/' ?>/file.php/<?php echo $COURSE->id ; ?>/appearance/custom_styles.css\" media=\"screen\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /> Then go to the \"Files\" section in your Moodle course and create a folder called \"appearance\". Within that folder you can upload a CSS file called \"custom_styles.css\" and an \"images\" folder if you need one related to the CSS. Note, I put the course theme in its own folder so that it is easy to archive (zip) and transfer to another course. It keeps the course theme and related images separate from the other images in the files section. Of course, you can organize this however you prefer and change the URL in the <header> accordingly. Suggestions and improvements are welcome. I'm excited to have this ability to customize courses through my browser! In large organizations access to the backend code of Moodle can be quite restricted and/or controlled through a complicated software workflow. With this change to themes I will be able to make changes in my browser and see the results immediately with a refresh. This suits my iterative way of working as a visual designer and allows me to interact with the actual course content. Kind Regards, Ian Grivois",

However, when I upload and select my file in the Boost settings, the site is totally hosed with no CSS used at all. Removing those two lines restores the CSS.  So, I'm obviously not understanding where those two lines go in the .scss file. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks!",

Slideshow - Many people wanted to see a slideshow included on the custom homepage. I am not a fan of slideshows but I do see a need to possibly draw attention to certain things from time to time.  I added what I call a \"slideshow\" but it is really an image display with nice transitions and clickable thumbnails.  Create 4 images at 900px by 300px and upload them to the theme Frontpage Settings page and you will have a nice visual display for your users.  All done via CSS . Improved Styling - Socialwall Course Format is another plugin in which we are a part of.  This allows teachers to have a facebook like experience within Moodle.  It is fully integrated with Moodle activities and is a solid course format for a social experience.  The evolve-D theme has special styling built-in for Socialwall and makes the user experience so much better! I even created a step sheet on how to configure and setup the theme: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1InnFyMfajEKF-MSfvSHFLYHFTLaiYxZ0nulVzJZ9OGk/edit?usp=sharing Watch the video on the new features:",

User documentation for theme customization seems to range from extensive and useful to sparse and sub par. I'm wondering if a standardized template was developed that covered basic theme-customizations, and answered theme-specific questions asked over and over again by end-users wanting to modify their Moodle Themes would be useful -- and used  -- by theme developers?  I would be interested in participating on putting something like this together if there was enough interest....",

Same goes for the other way round, if you are using Moodle 2.0 and have loaded Moodle 1.9 themes, these wont work either.  There are incompatibilities on both sides...so... Having said all this your problem may be something else all together. So my questions are as follows: 1. Which version of Moodle are you using? 2. Which themes have you uploaded and wont work? 3. Which folder did you upload the themes to. 4. Which site did you download the themes from? Thanks Mary",

You may have to change the color of the border-color is you do NOT want a border to appear on screen, but apparently you need it to solve the printing issue. This is strange... Joseph",

What I have done so far are 1) enable web service at advanced feature 2) enabled the web service for mobile device at moodle app category However, the mobile original theme does not take Klass theme when I enter my moodle site url to the mobile app and log in with my account.  I still see the orange theme in mobile device. I have read through this instructions in the section of customize your app theme .  I think the missing part that I didn't do is about finding a valid URL pointing to a CSS file and enter it to the field of mobile css file. May I have your suggestions to achieve my goal?  Thank you in advance.",

When they click\nthe \"save and return to course” button they get the Fatal Error below. error: Class 'core\\session\\manager'\nnot found in /var/www/moodle/theme/cafe_con_leche/lib.php on line 275 This error was happening when the\ncourse theme was set to \"Coffee with Milk” only. When the theme was changed to\none of several others (Krystle, Sky High, Standard) there was no problem. Also\nwith the course theme set to \"Coffee with Milk” there was no problem adding the\nassignment from an iPhone using \"moodle2mobile” theme (different user though). Interestingly\nthe same user was having no problems adding assignments to a different course\nthat had the \"Coffee with Milk” theme set. Initially I thought that a theme\nupgrade may have fixed things, but the same thing was happening after upgrading\nto the latest theme above, and purging all caches a few times. Secondly This error/warning is\ndisplayed at the top of the screen, when going to the admin notifications page.\nI only just notice it because it flashes up as the notifications page loads,\nthen is hidden by the awesomebar. Warning: Cannot modify header\ninformation - headers already sent by (output started at\n/var/www/moodle/theme/cafe_con_leche/version.php:1) in\n/var/www/moodle/theme/cafe_con_leche/layout/general.php on line 85 I'm not sure what the implications of\nthis warning are.

On most other pages (My\nHome, Course pages etc.) the other menus seem ok but not \"Site administration.” When being taken to the admin notifications page the following error/warning is displayed at the\ntop of the screen, I only just notice it because it flashes up as the\nnotifications page loads, then is hidden by the awesomebar.

This doesn't seem to happen on other tablet\nbrowsers ( firefox & androids native browser) or on the PC (IE11, firefox, chrome). Please assist.",

That said was there any padding in .section .filler in the first place? If not then the shorthand would be enogh to style it as it would be new. On the other hand it could be wrong all together and might well be a typo and should really be: \n```text\n.filler {\n\n\n    padding: 0;\n\n\n    margin-right: 6px;\n\n\n}\n```\n However that is not the case so removing padding-right: and use padding: 0 6px 0 0; as mentioned sounds a good idea...

Here it is what I have checked trying to solve the problem: When I check themedesignermode option I get the stylesheet working in every user, but tree menus don't expand and filepickers don't work. I have install Essential theme from Moodle and I get the same problems with tree menus and filepickers.

I have recently upgraded our site from 2.3 to Moodle 2.7.3+ (Build: 20141112) and gone from a Leatherbound based theme to Essential ( 2.7.9.3 (Build: 2014111003).  On our old site the courses were listed in Chronological order (the latest enrolment at the top of the list). Since the upgrade the courses are now in alphabetical order... Any help would be much appreciated. Cheers Stephen",

I can get CSS to change in the course theme but when changing to forums and what not the css import does not apply because its not present to override the main css. I have been using an html block to import the styles from a remote server which point to locally installed php, and directories for the theme. Why or What you ask? I am a moodle admin at a local school, we do not have access to the server files. This is in part due to the power struggle that ensues over district wide installations of moodle. So essentially I want to use a remote server to make my course better and not have to worry about what the district does. Any thoughts on hacks to do this?",

Something like... #page-header { width: 960px; height: 150px; margin: 0; padding: 0; } #page-header h1.headermain { width:100%; height: 150px; margin: 0; padding:0} The only other thing to do might be to have to enable a setting in Site Administration > Site Policies  which Allows Embeded Objects to you uploaded, this is a global setting so it will be availalble to all who are able to upload files. This may not be necessary if you have this files on a website other than your Moodle site. Not sure about the .innerhtml as I have never used it. But Moodle can work sucessfully with js scripts. You might like to read some of the tutorials Developement: Themes 2.0 you should find a tutorial which explains about getting JQuery to work in Moodle. The method in using those files will help you understand the logic behind JavaScript and how to use it with your themes. If you get stuck there are plenty of people here who can help you. Mary",

We would like to build in the ability to have the primary school section as well but their needs will be significantly different; with possible alternative log in options other than username and password, certainly a different theme, and (even with the same username and password log in routine) an alternative log in interface. The obvious answer is a second installation of Moodle, but we would like it so that the work follows through with the student from year 0 through to year 13 (potato prints to chemical diagrams of the potato molecule!?! hahahaha).

(For the courses I liked the snap theme and even more the f ork done by the cass business school .) So I am wondering: is it a sensible approach to 1) customise a theme for our needs 2) combine several themes (e.g. one for the courses, one for the rest of the LMS navigation) How problematic is this - e.g. in terms of updates of moodle versions?  Same question about themes that haven't been updated to latest moodle versions (e.g the snap theme and even more the f ork done by the cass business school which I like most so far). General recommendations how to approach the setup of moodle in general / what to keep in mind? So far my idea is to work 3) with a UX-Designer to go through one or several Moodle Themes and define look and navigation of each page. 4) find a developer/ agency specialised in moodle to realize this.

I wish to remove either: Items from the Custom User Menu, with the exception of 'Log out', or Removal of the dropdown altogether. Ideally, I would like to do this via custom CSS . I need to be able to achieve this via the interface. Has anyone managed to work this out?",

See my reply to your other post about using Mary's How to Clone a Theme document and also the links at the bottom of that page such as Creating your first theme . These really are essential reading for anyone creating a theme in Moodle2. I have just checked on my install and if you enter the logo url in the formal white settings page, it should appear on all pages. One thing to ensure though - as you are editing a theme, do you have theme designer mode enabled (Site Administration->Appearance->Themes->Theme Settings). Otherwise you will have to purge the cache every time you make a change. HTH Richard",

There are a couple of bugs and as I now discover Themza offer neither help nor a forum where people can swap fixes, I hope someone here can tell me how to shift them. First, in the top right corner of the screen there are the \"You are logged in as 'user' 'log in/out' links. Both are a relatively standard blue. Problem is, so is the background. The colours aren't identical, but close enough to be invisible to me. I downloaded the relevant css file and played around with the colours for the a: links until I decided on a not too garish shade of orange so that the links were separated both from the background and the white text that precedes the log-in text. Then I noticed the blatantly obvious....that it had changed colour of pretty much everything else on the page (how many links are in each course page....?). So, back to square one. The log-in shows at the top of each and every page. How can I change the colour of just the log-in links in the header? Anybody? If you give advice, please make it simple because that's what I am too...so spell it out in capital letters with lots of pictures.",

          "Text": "Hi Brian, I'll help all I can, but not having the theme to hand is a drawback, but having said that here are some pointers anyway. When styling/customising a theme, changing some of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a good place to start, as most things can be done this way, within reason that is. If you use Firefox as a browser you can get an Add-on called Firebug . Firebug is an excellent tool for finding out which bit of CSS code you need to either change or add to your existing style sheet (stylesheets have .css as their file-name extension). OK...on to your questions. 1: look for .headermenu in your css file for the theme you want to change. If you cannot find it, add it to the end of the css file. Here's the bit of code you need to add if it's not there already...I've added the names of the colors as orange for the link, and ivory for the hover, you can change these to suit your site. .headermenu .logininfo a:link, .headermenu .logininfo a:visited { color: orange; text-decoration: none; } .headermenu .logininfo a:hover, .headermenu .logininfo a:active { color: ivory; text-decoration: none; } 2: The problem with the logos will be generated from whatever code there is in the footer.html file. It's difficult to explain, although it is relatively easy to fix with an experienced eye for these things, it becomes all the more difficult to explain when one cannot see the footer.html file. So if you could upload this file in your next comment, that would be a good start. Note on how to upload a file: At the bottom of the page, where you add your reply, you should see a section which allows you to attach a file (be it an image or a small text file) you can upload the footer.html file from there. Just use the brows button to browse the files in your computer to locate the footer.html in your theme's folder. Select it and it then just CLICK the button marked Post to forum Hope this all helps?

I'm busy this morning so I'll play with the instructions you gave me this afternoon and see if I can't work it out for myself how to fix the rest. I've got Firebug but haven't had time to learn how to use it yet. I seem to have picked up more software than I'd need to build a space station recently.. I did a search for Themza templates and came across several posts which came part-way to solving some of the issues. Seems Themza put fake gifs and code into their templates to generate links and, I presume, some form of advertising for themselves. I've deleted most of that. In doing so, the themza logos vanished. However, there are still some bugs so I will persist. Thanks for your help. Brian",

To remove the links altogether you need to take out some code from both the header.html & footer.html files. It's quite clever how their links work. The images are not fake they are hotlinked from Themza's own website, so every time anyone enters your website, either as a visitor or as a member of staff, or a student, then Themza knows about it, as it will be logged in their web stats. It you would like to know how to take those links off your site let me know your email in a private message, and I'll email you the cleaned up header & footer. Cheers Mary",

The reason this is happening is the way in which the blocks have been added to the layout. Since it is only a 2 column theme, it only needs one block region, but Evolved has both visible. So the easiest thing to do is move the ones that fall to the bottom of the screen and drag them into the section where the Navigation block is. You will see which is the default block region as the ADD BLOCK will be showing in it. So with Editing ON drag all the blocks from below the Add Block to above it. Turn editing OFF and test to see what happens. Cheers Mary",

If you start meddling with the theme files then you will run into issues you will not be able to solve so stick with the easy fix of just moving the blocks as the empty block region will be hidden from view by nature of the CSS in Moodle. If anything goes wrong with the theme it will be a coding error that has to be fixed by a developer.

Essential has its CustomCSS setting box and you can add standard CSS in the customSCSS setting on Boost and it should work (haven't tested it yet, but LESS/SASS are basically extensions on CSS so standard CSS should also work in that setting box). Boost also has the new 'presets' which allow a bootswatch type file to be created and used to style the theme (basically its a SASS variables file). If your users want to use bootstrap features and its already part of the theme you use, then they can use it in their content. The only consideration is that they will need to use code snippets matching the bootstrap version in your theme (eg. Essential - BS2.x, Flexibase - BS3.x, Boost - BS4) Hope that helps Richard",

Unfortunatly, that did not fix the problems and the development site still looks bad.  They should be exact duplicates of each other. This is production (which is correct) http://lbconline.lbc.edu/ This is development (which is not) http://www.siteground15.com/~lbc81/ My question is this:  Is it possible that the reason this is not working is that the upgrade was not completed properly?  If so, is there a way for me to test this?

The easiest way to get an image in your header is to change your theme to 'standardlogo' and then simply upload a file called logo.jpg or logo.gif in your Site Files (look on the home page), or put a file called logo.jpg or logo.gif in the main Moodle directory. If you have already custoimised your theme and want to keep that and include a logo, then have a look at http://docs.moodle.org/en/Header_logo . You only need to change one file, header.html.

          "Text": "Hello, Firstly.... do not install this update unless you are running Moodle 3.4.2 and above.  Secondly, if you use the analytics settings then also think carefully before upgrading and read in full what I have to say here. V3.4.1.1(beta) for M3.4.2: https://moodle.org/plugins/pluginversion.php?id=16438 Ok.... Because of the new EU GDPR regulation that comes into force on the 25th May 2018 there is now a new Privacy API in Moodle ( https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Privacy_API ) - this is only available in Moodle inter-version versions of 3.3+.  In the case of 3.4 that is 3.4.2.  All plugins will need to either state why they are not affected or describe the user data they do along with other methods to export that data. To learn more about this area, then please consider looking at: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=352538 https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=365857 Also as the plugin area of Moodle.org does not support specifying specific versions for this I've raised MDLSITE-5390 . From an Essential theme point of view I have examined the settings and apart from the analytics could not find any storage of 'user related' data - at least not on purpose by the theme.  But, I am not a lawyer and welcome any input in this area pertaining to Essential if you consider there is a gap in the code for coping with GDPR. I have done some testing with the data privacy tool - https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_dataprivacy - but that is under development too and does not seem to show the 'privacy' statement within the theme but it looks as if it will. Essential's privacy statement is as follows: \"The Essential theme stores lots of settings that pertain to its configuration.  None of the settings are related to a specific user.  It is your responsibility to ensure that no user data is entered in any of the free text fields.  Setting a setting will result in that action being logged within the core Moodle logging system against the user whom changed it, this is outside of the themes control, please see the core logging system for privacy compliance for this.  The analytics settings and associated data in the database have been removed until this area is more understood from a legal perspective, as it was possible to request that userid's were recorded.  Please examine the code carefully to be sure that it complies with your interpretation of your privacy laws.  I am not a lawyer and my analysis is based on my interpretation.  If you have any doubt then remove the theme forthwith.\" With the analytics there was the option to request that the user id was passed to the external analytics software.  This seemed to me at the current time to be a grey area.  Therefore this version - 3.4.1.1 - removes the analytics settings and their values in the database.  Therefore if you don't have a backup of those setting values then do make a note of them before upgrading.  If you require analytics and do not need to comply with GDPR then for the moment, I suggest you don't upgrade. It is my intent to implement the privacy API for all my current plugins for all the major Moodle versions it is implemented in.  This may or may not be before 25th May 2018. Comments / thoughts appreciated. Gareth",

          "Text": "In what way would a theme be dangerous? OK - malicious code being added I guess: Get it from a reputable source ie the Moodle plugins database ! I would recommend using themes that are in the Moodle plugins database as these have to go through the Moodle HQ systems to be accepted into the database in the first place, they are usually also announced in the theme forum where Gareth or Mary or someone else will often take them for a trial. While some of these maybe better than others (for your particular purpose - I am not commenting on quality or otherwise of any theme!), none of them should break your site. If you need a customised, or personalised, theme then (personal opinion)\nI would recommend speaking to one of the regular contributors on the\nthemes forum, or to a moodle partner, for quotes around any development work you would like done. And at the end of the day, two points: 1. a theme is only a plugin and can always be removed and your site will revert back to the default core theme (Clean) 2. always test any plugin (theme or otherwise) on a test system to ensure there are no clashes with any other third party plugins - it is impossible for anyone to test every plugin with every other combination of 3rd party plugins available, so it is a good idea for you to test with your own combinations. Hope that helps Richard",

This is basically a rewrite of print_header and print_footer, so that instead of using header.html and footer.html, it uses a single file layout.php. Also, if you wish, for certain pages you can have a different template. layout-home.php and layout-popup.php are the ones I am thinking of initially. The layout.php file for the standard theme looks like http://cvs.moodle.org/moodle/theme/standardwhite/layout.php?view=markup This is all very much work in progress. I have just spent several days untangling the mess that is the old print_header, and have got to the 'wow, you mean it actually seems to work!' stage. I am sure there are still bugs that need to be found and fixed. Also there is more cleaning up to do in related code. However, becuase it is still very much in flux, this would be be a good time for people to have a look and give feedback, because it is not too late to change things if people have further good ideas. (By the way, if you have a Moodle 1.9 theme with header.html and footer.html, but not layout.php, that will still work, becuase I wrote fall-back code.)",

The result is then sliced in half, and the footer stashed away for later. The trick is, of course, how you get dynamic information like performance info, and all the required links to JavaScript , which may change during the rendering of the page contents, into the footer. The answer is I put a couple of unique strings in the footer that are then str_replaced in $OUTPUT->footer. Before you ask, I have not profiled this yet. I am quite pleased that $OUTPUT->header fits on one screen. Rather better than the old print_header.",

IE6 seems to cause more and more problems especially as it doesn't seem compatible with any other IE or any decent browser and the yui menus just don't seem to work in IE6 on any of the themes that use them as far as I can find. I guess the problem you have is that if you are preparing courses etc. for people to use in other businesses, you have no control over the browser they use. - Advising them to update IE or better yet to switch to Firefox /Chrome may not be feasible. One solution might be to put some browser detection in place that stops the yui menus loading in IE6 and to provide a sideblock navigation as a sticky html block that appears on each page???

This may also be similar to the request in discussion http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=89892 We are currently trying to standardize on a theme for each school in our district. Within this theme, teachers would like to provide a different logo at the top. With this in mind I have created a header.html file that should allow teachers to do just such a thing. This may also solve the problem listed in the post mentioned above. If you use the attached header.html file any teacher should be able to create a \"theme\" folder in their files area and place a logo.gif or a logo.jpg file in this folder. The theme will check for the presence of the logo file in the current course files/theme folder and if it is found will replace the default logo for that theme. Additionally, I have set it up so the course title will appear as well along with the logo and the logo is only rendered if there is actually a path to an image somewhere on the server . This file is based on the Chameleon theme header.html and still includes the Chameleon include line. Please try this out and let me know if it works on your servers. It appears to work on my 1.8 development server so please give it a shot. Randy Orwin",
