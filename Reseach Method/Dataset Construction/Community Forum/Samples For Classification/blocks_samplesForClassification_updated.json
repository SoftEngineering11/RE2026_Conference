Wanted to re-configure the block that was exisiting on the tag pages. But although I keep choosing all tag pages or any other tag page setting it defaults to across the site any page when I save changes. Tested on the demo site works fine with the flickr block hidden on the front page and only showing image results in the tag pages. Mine is the same but shows image results on all the pages even though I'm choosing other pages as above? By the way my main theme is Magazine but I'm forcing another on one of the courses would this be part of the problem? Any ideas or thoughts most welcome! Geoff",

When the block was added the blocks block was completely gone.

I tried to make the block invisible, but it didn't work. I tried to uninstall it, but it was still there. I thought I could keep it there but I never found the blocks block and then there was no point in continuing som I removed my installation and reinstalled it - no big deal since I had just started.

What file generates the content of that block? OR alternatively do you know how to configure the links for the enrollment instances?

However, in a few of our courses it does not appear for teachers in those courses. As the Moodle administrator I can see the Latest News Block, but they cannot. This is causing somewhat of an issue for them. This particular teacher is a teacher in about 6 different courses, some of which the Latest News Block appears in, and some it does not. I can't see what differences (if any) exist between these courses and I can't explain whay he can see it in some but not in others. I have added other teachers to these problem courses and they also do not see the Latest News Block, so it appears that the course itself is somehow restricting the view, and it is not related to a specific user. Both courses do have a News Forum included. If you could suggest where I might look to try and resolve this issue, I would really appreciate it.

It simply does not show up in the list of available blocks for teachers in these problem courses. Of course, I see it as an Admin. I also just checked the permissions on the actual News Forum itself... There are no special locally assigned roles, and there are no override permissions in place. I also went through one of the courses where the teacher CAN see the Latest News Block, and compared every setting to the course where the same teacher cannot see the Latest News Block. I cannot see any differences between the two courses in the way they have been set up and optioned. I am at a complete loss as to why this is happening, but it's driving me crazy. Am I correct in assuming taht the News Forum and the Latest News Block are both tied together as one thing? Are there some other settings I should be checking?",

Is there a difference in the status of the news forums across the courses i.e. some have news posted others do not? I've never set this block as a sticky block but owing to its association with the News Forum I could see this being problematic. I wonder if come of the courses had the LN block enabled before you set it as sticky and they are working OK and the others were created post-stickiness (sorry, I'm losing my grip of the English language here) and they aren't working as the block is not local to the course. The limitation of 1 instance per course might be feeding into this too. So if the risk of extra friction isn't too great, perhaps try removing the stick block and see how that impacts on things...",

However, the eventual solution was hit upon by Julian Ridden, the Moodleman himself. I had a chat with Julian this morning... he was initially as perplexed as I was, but he eventually worked it out. Turns out the News Forum itself had somehow become corrupted. He fixed it by deleting the News Forum completely, then switching to Social Format (which then created a new Social Forum on the page), and then switching back to Topics Format, (which then created a new News Forum). He then deleted the Social Forum that had been created during the switch to the Social Format, leaving only the new News Forum on the course page. Everything went back to normal with the new News Forum now in place. It turned out to be a simple fix, but it wasn't so obvious as to why it wasn't working (at least not to me) Thanks Moodleman!

          "Text": "Maybe you want to have a look at my emptyTestBlock Code I published here: http://dev.moodle.org/course/view.php?id=2$ to show how a Block works/has to be programmed (you have to search for emptyTestBlock in the Forums there). This will give you a sense for SERVER-SIDE code. Which means that a program is executed on the server directly gathering all needed data from its database . The Server and the program, i.e. php-script has to RENDER the gathered Data and then send it to the clients' internet browser for display. Gathering Data and Rendering are typical serverside-tasks. On the other end, you have your internet-browser working as CLIENT, as opposed to the SERVER on the other end of the line. Fortunately or strangely, you can even program your internet-browser to execute program-code on its side. Typically you use a programming language called JavaScript. There are many online web-sites to show/teach you how to program with JavaScript. If your Server sends such JavaScript to the internet-browser, that code can be executed locally on the users' computer, e.g. when the user clicks a button or a link. Your serverside php-program can not only gather data and send HTML-formatted Text to be displayed on a client, it can also compose JavaScript, i.e. a program or many many functions to be used and executed on the client. Please click on my sitenavigation to show up in a popUp window here: https://moodle.fhnw.ch/moodleTest/ And if you inspect the HTML- and JavaScript-Code I composed on the Moodle server with php, you will see, that I sent the client a function to open that popUp-window. It is actually this JavaScript-construct that opens the popUp-Window: <a title=\"sitenavigation: Show in a Pop-Up-Window\" onclick=\"this.target='popup'; return openpopup('/file.php/1/sess_48pVxxCvLL_sitenavigation.html', 'sitenavigationPopUp', 'menubar,toolbar,location,status,scrollbars,resizable,width=1024,height=768', 0);\" href=\"https://moodle.fhnw.ch/moodleTest/1/sess_48pVxxCvLL_sitenavigation.html\" target=\"sitenavigationPopUp\"> And this is how I programmed my Block to display/render/send the above line to the client browser: \n```text\n        $this->sitenavigationcontent->text = '<a title=\"' . get_string('showinpopupwindow','block_sitenavigation') .\n\n\n                              '\" href=\"' . $CFG->\nwwwroot\n  . $sitenavigationfile .\n\n\n                              '\" target=\"sitenavigationPopUp\" '.\n\n\n                              \"onclick=\\\"this.target='popup'; \".\n\n\n                              \"return openpopup('/file.php\" . $sitenavigationfile .\"', 'sitenavigationPopUp', \".\n\n\n                              \"'menubar,toolbar,location,status,scrollbars,resizable,width=1024,height=768', 0);\\\">\" .\n\n\n                              get_string('showinpopupwindow','block_sitenavigation') . \"</a>\";\n```\n To be honest, openpopup() was programmed by the Moodle Core Programmers. So I did not invent/program it. I actually only prepared everything so that when the link is clicked on, the function gets called to show the data I gathered on the server and that should be displayed in the popUp-window. But you could also invent/program your own JavaScript Code/functions and send them to your clients. This is how the Moodle Programmers did it in one of their libraries and how it gets transferred to the client browser: \n```text\n 342\n      <script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\n\n 343\n      <!--\n\n 344\n          function \nopenpopup\n(url,name,options,fullscreen) {\n\n 345\n            fullurl = \\\"\".\n$CFG\n->\nhttpswwwroot\n.\"\\\" + url;\n\n 346\n            windowobj = window.\nopen\n(fullurl,name,options);\n\n 347\n            if (fullscreen) {\n\n 348\n              windowobj.moveTo(0,0);\n\n 349\n              windowobj.resizeTo(screen.availWidth,screen.availHeight);\n\n 350\n            }\n\n 351\n            windowobj.\nfocus\n();\n\n 352\n            return false;\n\n 353\n          }\n\n 354\n  \n // -->\n\n\n 355\n      </script>\";\n```\n Rosario",

So everything you put in there DOES NOT COME from the Moodle-Server. If you wanted to display or check values that are stored in the Moodle servers' database, you would have to program your own Moodle Block. And again, you would then be able to decide what to display directly on the server, in your Blocks' php-code. In this case I would not suggest to do it by client side JavaScript. Rosario",

In my production environment (1.9.9), I show numerous instances of these blocks, but they do not show on the course pages, nor are they available to 'add' (which I assume is because they're already there). I can't tell you whether or not they were EVER working on this install, but they aren't visible now, and I've confirmed that that are not 'hidden'.

On the development front, our story is akin to the Wizard of Oz… that is, behind the curtain I manage the project, create the design work (i.e.  interface mock-ups & functionality flowcharts -if I can call it that!), and test the code.  For the most part, Mike Churchward ( http://www.oktech.ca/ ) has been the wizard that we rely on to bring things to life with his coding magic).  This PFD document should provide a pretty good description of the MoodleFN customisations. BTW : While this project aims to help meet the eLearning needs of First Nations schools and communities, we also welcome the interest and involvement of the Moodle community in general. Hope this background helps, Fernando",

Inserting unzipped folder to your moodle/blocks folder and then activating 'Notifications' in your Site Administration block will create the database .

It's better than nothing.  If anyone can make it work while editing is turned on, please let me know.  I should add, though, that I've tried many, many different rights settings and they don't seem to behave the way you might think.  For example, you'd think just setting a student to PROHIBIT and a TEACHER to ALLOW would work, but it doesn't. In case anyone might find this useful, here's what I ended up doing: 1.In order to be a \"sticky block,\" it has to be first created on the front page with a Page contents option of \"display throughout the entire site.\" 2.Then enter ANY course and change the \"Display on page types\" option to \"Any type of course main page.\" At this point, it disappears from the front page and can only be configured further from within a course page.  However, this configuration takes effect regardless of which course it appears in. 3.Next, you have to edit the permissions of the block to remove access from everyone (yes everyone) to view or edit the block (Yes, I said EVERYONE. Adding the teacher to the View block access doesn't do anything, at all.).  Note that while editing is on, anyone with editing rights to the course will still be able to HIDE or MOVE the block, but will not be able to delete it.",

Something like \"View own comments only / View all comments\". If you are interested, please vote for MDL-25580 . Joseph PS.- By the way, when creating a new block, is it possible to add a list of capabilities? It seems that the only capabilities available to blocks by default are Edit block and View block.",

I have run out of options to try so I thought I would post a question here and see if anyone can help me out. I made a critical error Friday night and started moving around my blocks on my Front Page to the right (not realizing there was a glitch that sent the blocks right off the screen). Having done that, I spent all weekend reading posts about how to reset my blocks on the front page as I lost the administrator block. I managed to read and insert the code for fixing the blocks from moving off the screen ( which it no longer does). I also reset the blocks to my original settings and restored everything to the way it was. I even re-ran the adminreset script to reset the admin password. I thought I had actually figured it out! Now to my current problem - I cannot display any of the links associated with the Admin block. Everytime I click any administrator links - nothing happens. I think it is loading the page ( based on what I see in the URL ), but it is like it is invisible to the user - the entire page is blank. I am not sure if anyone can offer a suggestion as to what I might have done and what I can do to fix it - but all I can do right now is see my courses, create courses -  but have lost all of the ability to do any administrative tasks, set preferences, add users, run cron etc as the Administrator. I am at a loss as what I should do next. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks, Dave",

I tell u how anyway in case u like to do the same, the navigation menu is infact a yui treeview and it depends on <li> <ul> tags, simply to collapse a node in the tree u must add the collapsed class in the style sheet, which though looks easy but u have to find where moodle do actualy render the block code. Anyway here what i have done go to blocks\\navigation in ur root moddle directory open renderer.php file and change this line if ($item->has_children() && (!$item->forceopen || $item->collapse)) { to this if ($item->has_children() && ($depth > 1)) { this add the collapsed class to all links in the navigation block whose depth >1 so they are collapsed by default after rendering. For me it is working fine with no problems after, and i did not counter a bug , but not sure it is 100% safe as i am just a programmer and not developing anything in moodle core and does not know if it may affect other aspects though i doubt it. Try it if it suits u maybe as temporary solution till u find better. Regards.",

Set block permittions to that role for the html block at front page (override permissions, view block). As a result - the block is not visible for users. When I locally assign role \"block viewer\" for this block - block becomes visible to that users. IMO , this is a big disadvantage of moodle rights/permittions system: instead of having one point of assignment - global role, I need to assign roles directly within the context. So if I have 100 blocks (contexts) and 500 users or I need to add additional user - the permissions assignment becomes madness.",

I persued your  suggestion, but could't succeded. My 'admin' was not even displaying 'Frontpage' Option. Then, I started setting legal default permission from 'authenticated user' to 'Admin' in reverse order. I did so because I found even student & authenticated user when logged in to site had some of the editing options to some of the frontpage resources. I presumed the previlages are messed up with users. All I want to say is that my problem has been solved. I have now 'frontpage' under 'Admin' and other previlages under 'frontpage'. thanks for your valuable support. (Dr.K.J.Mathai)",

Thank you very much!  Now the issue is solved! #13 did not work because the eye was already open. #14 worked.  Basically I did not see \"administration\" in the Add A Block list previously.  It took a long time to realise but now I understand that unlocking the padlock icon for the administration block in the \"Manage Block\" page brings back \"administration\" in the Add A Block list.  As soon as I lock the padlock, it disappears, so I have to keep the lock open while I add the administration blocks to pages. With regard to the front page, I was still not able to add the administration block back because there was no way to turn editing on and so was not able to use the \"Add A Block\". So, I did the following 1. Keep the padlock unlocked for the administration block in the Manage Block page. 2. Go to a course page and turn editing on. 3. in the url box in my web browser, I typed in the front page address. 4. Now I was back in the front page with the editing mode on. So, I found the Add A Block. 5. Add \"Administration\" block using the Add A Block in the front page. The issue is solved, but, I still think that moodle should make this much easier.  First of all, the administration block should not be deleted so easily from the front page.  If it is deleted, there should be much easier way to bring it back.  Moodle is rather a complicated system to get around for non-technical teachers and users..it is my opinion at least. Anyway, thank you very much for your help. Kind regards, Noby",

It isn't anything complex. I read through the XMLDB information and created an 'install. xml ' with my schema. In Moodle, I can see this new db file in the XMLDB Editor. Everything appears correct. (file path, format, etc) When I 'Load' my install.xml file, it appears to load, I get an 'Edit' option, no errors are displayed. When I run the mysql client and check the schema though, my table has not been created. Am I missing something really simple here? I've checked my install.xml file for bad syntax (comparing it against others Moodle uses), it looks correct. Should my new table show up in the schema after clicking 'Load' ?",

I created a test mentor, then in the test student profile assigned that mentor to the 'mentor' role. If I now login as the mentor, I can see the mentees block, and it has the student listed. But, if I click on the student's name, it takes me to the login page! Also, as mentor, I don't have access to anything else related to that student.

The side_bar is a block that can be created on the right colum of the administration moodle interface. Then inside the block you can create or include some resources (like a web page)... and then you can hide the side_bar block.... but the resources are still available and you can create a button on the main part of the main page and link it to that resource. It is very useful when you are dealing with image mapping in order to have a whole picture right in the middle of the screen with some active areas (links). Happy Holidays!!! Boris Note: I created the main page using side_bar block, take a look: http://www.edufuturo.net",

I have resorted to adding the ,link as a custom menu item to handle temporarily.  I also tried on our development server - which is running the same version as our production server but to no avail.  The block has not been removed.  When I removed the block I verified in the moodle logs to see if I could find the action responsible in the logs but it does not appear to be tracked. We are running moodle 3.9.3+ scheduled for update shortly to 3.9.4. Does anyone have any advice?",

Then if they wanted to send a different message to another group within the same course, they would select the different names from the list and then select \"send a message\". However, it still has the previous message in the text area, and also not only does it have the 2nd group of users, but all the users from the other group.

You can see it at www.socialstudies.ws/digital Here is the problems I am having with it. Moodle has to be open to Google. When a site is translated, you become logged in as Guest, no matter if you were logged in before. The code requires a base url, if I put that in manually...ie www.something.com , no matter where I am on the site, if I translate, it starts back there.  Is there a php variable like...getbaseurl so it starts at whatever page you happen to be on? I don't know how useful this will be because I believe that using the google translation will always be just a guest login... this means that a logged in user will not be able to use translation, b/c it will relog them in as Guest. But as a simple front page translator...its great. Maybe there is a way around this, but I have exhausted my meager abilities at coding just getting this far...lol BTW , I also tried it with the babelfish translation script... and that won't even log you in as guest. Jeff I attached the files... I think I have it all set up correctly, but please test on a test site or local server first....",

Specifically, I have defined a Mentees block which I want to appear on every page for a teacher.  But every tutorial I follow fails to work for me - I add the block to the front page (My Home) as administrator, but it never appears on any user's front page.  Why?  What am I missing?  In every tutorial \"it just works\" but not for me! I hope someone out there has cracked it... but it doesn't seem very obvious at all! Thanks in advance. James",

My question is... is it even possible? WebViewer, as far as I know, is used for web apps and mobile apps to display a web site's content, but I don't know if it even exists in a language that could be used to set up a Moodle block.

          "Text": "Hi Chris, Speaking from experience, if course pages have sidebar, you are in for a headache when you upgrade. the way sidebar works is that it creates course \" sections \" starting at section 1000.  When you do an upgrade, the activities and resources are put into sections in the course. I had some courses where the activities ended up  in section 50 and then I had to drag it all the way up. Here is my advice: go through your site and move any activities from all your sidebars into the first available empty section in each course. Afterwards, do the upgrade. Once the upgrade is done, install the \"Section\" block. What this block does is it essentially duplicates the content of a section that you specify in a block.  So, for example, if you move a sidebars activity into section 15, you can add a Section Block and set it to display Section 15. To edit the block, you actually edit the actual section instead. I've been using it and it works pretty well.",

For navigating students through our Moodle environment easily, I have included some regular webpages, much like the lay-out of the homepage of moodle.org. To link the correct courses to the images on these webpages, I created a separate course for navigation only. Of course, I don't want students to see or access this course, but I cannot find a way to hide the course in the navigation bar, and still keep it available, so that students can be linked to the right course.

As Tony says, you need Cron for a lot more than generating your RSS feeds (it also runs jobs like sending email from forums, cleaning up old users, calculating summary statistics, etc.), but it looks as though it's set up and working ok. You might want to check how often it is running though. Have a look at http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron for more information on Cron jobs. Also, what version of Moodle are you running? There are reports of some problems with RSS on 1.6.1- see http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=50614 Going back to your original post, I had said that an RSS feed for Upcoming Events was not possible - but it looks as though it might be coming: Martin D announced at the UK MoodleMoot that Calendar would perhaps support an RSS feed for \"recently added entries\" in the future (no date/version though, so don't get too excited) - see http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=50698 .",

I can see a reference to it when I do a Google search at moodle.org . But, I can't seem to get anywhere from that. Anyone else remember this post and/or have the original file???",

At the other hand, the solution is not to delete the \"../\" because in such a case, activities in a course do not get out of the course folder and dont get into the mod folder. Other problem showing the blocks in the forepage is that People (participants,edit profile), allows the oportunity to unenroll \"from this course\" even not have entered in any course yet.",

The site is in several languages and the content of these pages is created in different languages. All works well with the Multi-language filter. My question is - how could I translate the names of the Menu items themselves. For instance, I can translate the content of the page that I called Contact, but how do I make that the name of the menu item 'Contact' changes when the user changes the langauge interface.

          "Text": "Hi Everyone. I'm having a very strange problem when adding new HTML blocks to the right column. What's happening is if I add an HTML block, it appears as it should. However, if I try to move the block up or down the list, it disappears completly. Nowhere in my admin view I can I see this block. ...However. If I make the block invisible to users (eg hide it) and then move it, it behaves almost correctly. There are certain blocks that it will not go above, but if I move those blocks down, the HTML block goes in the correct position. This has never happened before today. I am using moodle 1.8. (2007021505) Any suggestions ?",

Be careful that you use the name of the block as installed. The : is important too, separating what is on the right and left sides. You can see all the options in config-dist.php; add the changes to config.php. Mine looks like this: \n```text\n$CFG->defaultblocks_topics = 'course_menu,course_list:activity_modules,calendar_upcoming,quickmail';\n```\n Good luck! This worked wonderfully for me! atw",

I have posted some messages to the quickmail area, but no reply form the developers listed there. I do not think they are developing it anymore. Last version they worked with was 2.7. This is a great tool. I do not know why they do not add this to core. I know there is built-in messaging. But, sending it as an email is something quicker to reach the students.

You could remove the Course level Blocks (but you would probably encounter the same issue again when adding a new Course).  So, I would be tempted to ensure you haven't got the Site Level Blocks switch on - which will leave you with the Blocks as added to a new Course. If you want to remove the Recent Activities Block you can just Switch Editing On and click on the X icon in the Block header to remove it. Stu",

          "Title": "Preventing blocks from being deleted",
          "Text": "In Moodle 2.x, the admin can mark certain types of block so that they can never be deleted. By default, this is used to make it impossible to delete the settings or the navigation blocks. If you delete those, you can be stuck as there is no way to turn editing back on, and add them back. (If you did not know about this, go to Admin -> Plugins -> Blocks -> Manage blocks, and look for the padlock icons.) Now that is great if you are an admin who has just set up a really complex blocks configuration, and you don't want anyone to mess it up. However, the way the code works is not that simple. The rules that were implemented were actually: A block cannot be deleted if ALL of these are true: The type of block is protected on the manage blocks page; The block's parent context is the system context; and The block is set to show on all pages, or just on the site index page. We (the Open University) don't see any benefit to having conditions 2. and 3. We have some blocks that are set to show up on all pages for type course-view-*, and idiots keep deleting them! Therefore, I have raised MDL-35964 to propose changing how this features works, so that if a type of block is set to be undeletable, then really no one can delete it. If someone really need to delete one of those blocks, then the admin can temporarily un-protect it while it is added or deleted, and then it can be protected again (or not). Anyway, that is what we would like to do, but we would like you feedback about whether it is a good idea or not. Please comment in this forum thread, on in the tracker issue.",

The activities list will grow as you add activities to your course. Therefore, the first time you enter your course, the only category that is listed is Forums. This is because one forum exists by default – the news forum. Whenever you add a different activity or resource to your course, an icon will appear in this block representing the specific Moodle module.

We recently updated from Moodle 3.11 to Moodle 4.2 and the change in behavour that I describe below seems to have taken place somewhere along the way. I have also confirmed this behaviour in the Mount Orange site. What used to happen in Moodle 3.11: Put a calendar block in a course Click on the month header to maximise the calendar. Click on a date or on the New event button to add an event. In the New event dialogue the Course context is preselected. This is great because as a teacher you usually want to create an event in the same course when using this functionality. What happens in Moodle 4.2: Put a calendar block in a course Click on a date to maximise the date. The context of the maximised date is the Moodle site home page. Problem The courses now appear in a drop-down menu. In a site with thousands of courses, some with very similar names, it can be difficult (or impossible) to find the right course context again (which is where you have just come from). Does that make sense? Has anybody else had this problem? Am I missing something? Thanks in advance.",

After setting up a test account I've discovered the following in my situation: If a person registered and logged in without joining a forum or course this person WILL NOT be listed in the Online User block. Once the user joins a forum or a course the user will be shown in the Online User block! Shouldn't a users be listed in the Online User block once they have logged in? It looks like until a new registered user has joined a forum or course the user access level will be like someone using a \"guest\" account. In our site we DON'T want guess accounts to login.

This is not a bug - it's because that the April event pertains, say, to 2020 while the July one to 2019. I think displaying the year info can increase clarity and speed of processing of the Timeline deadlines. There is a mild code improvement suggested in the Tracker that could help insert the year info - if interested, please VOTE for https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-64064 . Thanks.",

When a language pack is empty, en (the english language pack) is used by default. Please see this post for details of how to make the en_GB2312 language pack http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=34031&parent=158134 Basically, I think that you only need to create a folder",

What we don't quite follow is why the mdl_event table is being queried when it's really the calendar table and not a moodle event table, it's not mentioned in http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Events_API . We are not a very big institution and I'm sure others must have many many more records stored in the mdl_event table. Some guidance would be very much appreciated.",

In the Admin->Security->Site Policy there is the \"Enable Trusted Content\" setting: By default Moodle will always thoroughly clean text that comes from users to remove any possible bad scripts, media etc that could be a security risk. The Trusted Content system is a way of giving partcular users that you trust the ability to include these advanced features in their content without interference. To enable this system, you need to first enable this setting, and then grant the Trusted Content permission to a specific Moodle role. Texts created or uploaded by such users will be marked as trusted and will not be cleaned before display. I haven't fully tried it yet, but that is probably a place to start.",

I have check from moodle versions 1.5.4 to 1.6.4 and the option is simply not there, unless i'm totally overlooking it. I wonder is this a new addition to a later version of Moodle such as a 1.7 or 1.8? I can only run upto version 1.6.4 as i do not have the requirements on my server for higher versions. Although with the extra functionality provided with the latest moodles i will be looking into upgrading the software on the dedicated server i use. I'd greatly appreciate some clarity with the moodle versions if you can help me out here. Thanks so much, i'm sure this info will be very usful to others aswell. Steve",

If anyone knows of a way to change this I'd be most grateful.  I always loved quickmail, but can hardly use it now because of this. Thanks, Jerry",

So far the script works great; the modules are placed appropriately and function, the students are enrolled properly, and so on. The part I'm having a problem with is setting the default settings of the blocks in these courses. I know how to update the config.php file to set default blocks for my courses: $CFG->defaultblocks = 'navigation,online_users,jmail,activity_modules,settings'; That part's working like a charm, but the blocks are not showing up in the course \"subpages\", such as the participants list or the forum pages. The block settings show that the blocks are set to show up on \"Any type of course main page\"; is there an easy way to set it to \"Any course page\" by default when creating a course? As always, I'm not afraid to mess around with PHP or my database if that becomes necessary.",

The site already has a number of courses under many categories, I need to add a custom navigation to access courses in a spedcific category (a map for course by location and also a graphic list). Initially i thought i could use blocks to do this and use the center block patch to move the block to the center column ( here ) However after further research i discovered that whilst you are able to add blocks to category index pages these only appear for certain logged on users and are then turned of when the page is viewed when logged out. The only thing I can think that I could do would be to apply a custom template to this category and then add my custom layout code into the header.html file but I think this will throw up further problems and the navigation code would then be visible on all the course pages in this section. I would really really appreciate any suggestions about anything i have missed or any potential workarounds. Regards",

Our sites all live within a few categories; Teaching sites, training sites and other sites. I wanted HTML blocks to only appear in the teaching sites and this how I got around it. I created a block on the main page for the Teaching category and set it to display on the Category pages and all pages within it and then go into one of the sites, open the block and limit it to those page types. There is a trick though if like me you have administrator access, when you try to set the block to display on page types to “Any page” at the category page you will find you do not have that option, instead you will probably get “Any site administration page” and “The current site administration page”. We found that staff with lower access (I think it is equivalent to teacher role, but cannot be sure because we created a new role) that covers the whole category get the option to set the block to any pages within the category. I hope this helps Garry",

Just another thing, with your solution you have to be admin to add html block to a course but a regular teacher with editing permissions can delete this block the usual way can't he? The great thing for moodle was to, instead of defining 4 levels of editing permissions each with a set of permissions, that you could configure those sets. For example a teacher that could not add or delete certain blocks, that would also just see certain parts of the adminstration etc. Is this beeing done for the 1.6 version? Thanks Joao",

If you have \"My Moodle\" turned on, then the \"My Courses\" block would never be seen on the front page by any of your teachers or students since they would always be redirected away from the front page to \"My Moodle.\" However, if you are not using \"My Moodle\" and have it disabled, then simply putting the \"Course Category\" block on the front page will be the same as putting the \"My Courses\" block there. \"Course Category\" should change to \"My course\" upon login. This may not appear to be the case if you are both a teacher and an admin on your installation. (There is a setting under Configuration>>Variables that sets the course list for admins.) This seems like a long explanation, but should be thorough. Let me know if I can help any more.",

Recently I added a new assignment type - form - which allows for the students to answer a number of questions that can then be graded. Because the form type of assignment asks a series of questions, these need to be seen by the teacher when grading. However, the marking.php does not show all the questions (of course it wouldn't because the marking block was not designed with form type of assignments in mind!) I am wondering how I can either show all the questions the student submitted, or, show a link to the grading page with the questions displayed, in the same way as an uploaded assignment shows a link to download the assignment. The teachers can access the assignment questions if they click on the assignment itself and search for the student that way. But i would like to have it consistent and all assignment types working through the marking block. Thanks, Nikki Macfarlane",

However, I have been experiencing something that seems a little strange.  I created two test users, a Student and a Manager.  I created an approriate role for the manager and then assigned them to the Student in a Mentor fashion. When I log in as the Manager, the Mentee Block displays and lists the Student's name.  The Manager can select the Student's name and can see all of the appropriate information - I am very happy with that functionality. However, when I log in as the Student, I still see the Mentee Block with the Student's name listed.  That doesn't seem right.  It seems like that block should only be visible to the Mentor. Any one else have any experience with this block?  Is there a way to make it ONLY display for the Mentor?",

However, this usage falls apart when wanting to do the same activity in two parallel classes: the second class will see the best results of the first! This is the case even though the activity is clearly set up with Group mode: Separate groups, as should be done so that one group of students does not see the result of the other. The block itself does not propose a \"separate groups\" parameter (there is a \"group\" parameter that swiches the podium to groups instead of individual students, it's not what I would like). Is there any other plugin enabling this podium with a \"separate groups\" option or do you think adding the parameter would be a possible futur feature ?",

Since these actions are supposed to be performed by a moodle admin with no direct server level root access, the cron is to be setup using Moodle's inherent capability. We are setting up the cron in /admin/cron.php in addition to custom cron file as a part of plugin. We have referenced a link https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Task_API to develop this task.

So the code will still remain on the MoodleRooms server but no one will be able to use it. I think that should do what you need. If not let me know and we can continue brainstorming.

Apache Tomact is designed for running java servlets, so it's unlikely you can get away from it (unless this Gong thing has a PHP version?) - if you have root/admin access to the server, your best bet is to install Apache Tomcat, make sure you have the mod_proxy + mod_proxy_ajp options installed/enabled then setup a proxy instruction the apache config file once you've setup Gong - bear in mind tomcat will need a separate port, but this doesn't need to be opened up to the outside world - as long as your apache server can see this port (eg if it's within same server or LAN) it should be ok.

          "Text": "Thanks Ger. But in my case, iIt seems that none of my feeds were empty. And then one of my teachers happened to be homework using the RSS feeds. So I had to get them back in a hurry. I decided to delete the rows of the block RSS feeds database table one by one. When I got to the third, the BBC feed, the RSS block came back (with even the top two feeds that I had already deleted). I replaced these rows in the table. The BBC feed does not seem to be in the global list of feeds, and there is no warning about instances of the block being linked to a non-existant feed. I wonder what could be wrong with the BBC RSS feed. Looking at the feeds on the BBC site the only one that has a little trouble at google is Words in the News - Riots continue across France (Wednesday 9th November) Becuase it is a bit too long. The others on the same feed are Weekender (Friday 11th November) London Life (Wednesday 9th November) Entertainment (Thursday 10th November) Ask about English - will stay or will be staying The Flatmates (Tuesday 8th November) Talk about English (Wednesday 9th November) Words in the News - Webmaster faces legal action (Friday 11th November) Wordmaster And none of them look dangerous. This is quite a problem with the RSS block. If a feed can put a stop to the block, and with it all the other blocks on the same side, then the RSS block is quite a risk. Tim",

We've been running Moodle for a few years now and as a result now have 30 top level categories showing in the courses block when people first get to the site. The end result of this is that for new users who haven't logged in the front page appears very busy and they do a lot of scrolling to get to other blocks lower down. When students log in they only see their own courses in the block which is great and I want to keep the block where it is towards the top of the page. Is there a function which allows me to choose not to display the courses block before students log in? I may be able to rationalise the content a little but it's still going to be bigger than is ideal. All suggestions gratefully received. Nathan",

So, edit the permissions on the blocks to allow viewing to the Auth User.  That should clear it up for your instructors.  If you still want to hide the Nav block on the frontpage, instead prohibit View Block for Authenticated User on the Frontpage in the block's Permissions and assign that role to your instructors on the frontpage.  As far as your Activity block, on the frontpage you'll have to pick between showing it to everyone or noone. As long as you don't prohibit the Auth User, the roles at the course level will properly control visibility.",

I contacted a couple of Moodle partners to ask them if they could work on it - no reply, not even to say no. So thought I had better have another look myself, though my php skills are minimal. In the meantime, upgraded to 1.6.2 and now after adding the block, the admin page goes blank white. Do not know where to begin. Moodle FN is based on previous version (1.5.?), so presumably it may be a long shot. Desired end result is to have the 'my courses' showing as tree menu of categories (containing courses of which I am a student/teacher), expandable to find individual courses after navigating down the tree. Conventional my courses is too clumsy when there are many courses. Category tree nav (also borrowed from MoodleFN) seems to work, but puts separate blocks per top level category - using space on page etc. Any constructive help/ideas welcome... TIA Andy",

UPDATE: I found a bug that they are working on trying to fix this issue for teacher role access only to a block at: http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-6024 Should be in the Moodle 1.8.3 version.

I wrote it for 1.6 and it still works just fine for 1.8. It relies on some of the functions defined in lib/deprecatedlib.php, such as isteacher and isteacherinanycourse. If you don't want to use the functions, you might take a look at the code behind them for ideas. One of the things I like about using this is that normal users don't see anything at all, my teachers see links to request a course, and course creators/admins see a message or link to approve courses.

Also I tried to make it work. I added a version.php file that didn't exist. I changed some literal strings in lang file that wasn't defined. I achieved Moogle block installation!  But... in Site admin->Moogle I click in Settings and...

I've managed to add a block to category**, though I'd like to only show the block within the assignment activity. The block settings (Display on page types) only gives options that pertain to the category context , and nothing as granular as an activity. Working the other way, and creating the block in an assignment gives me the appropriate settings for showing in\nthe activity, but only within one course. Using the generated configuration data from the database for each instance, I've found that I can edit parentcontextid and pagetypepattern to achieve the goal. Have I overlooked something in the GUI to easily achieve the above? mdl_block_instances id showinsubcontexts parentcontextid pagetypepattern 1 1 (Yes) 10 (mdl_context:id [category]) mod-assign-* ** For reference to others, I couldn't see an 'Add a Block' option at category level.

Now today he is getting an error message: \"Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (Use the Mass Actions block)\" I've tried this out as a teacher and get the same response but it still works fine as an admin. I've checked permissions and it's set to inherit. Nothing else has changed. Now I can set up explicit 'allow' across all catagories to bypass the problem but I'd like to fix the problem if I can. Any ideas out there please? Thanks, Sam.",
