          "Title": "Global timeout even though maxtime was not even nearly obtained",
          "Text": "Hello. I am teaching a basic programming course and I use VPL for my evaluations. Most questions are fairly simple and can be solved in a few miliseconds, so I randomly create 100 test cases and assign a grade according to how many of them are correctly solved. Most questions take one or two seconds to be graded in this manner (or at least this is how long it takes after I click on the \"evaluate\" button). However, the \"Maximum execution time\" is not respected. Here's a MRE: There are 128 test cases, all equal to Case = Test input = 1 output = 1 Solution (in C) is #include <stdio.h> int main() { printf(\"1\"); return 0; } It takes about 2 seconds to compile and 1 to evaluate, when it works. Maximum memory is 512MB, maximum execution files 128MB and maximum processes is 10. When I set up Maximum execution time to 8 minutes or more, it evaluates as above; However, anything below that yields \"Global timeout\". Some VPLs which I created evaluate in 4 minutes, others 2. I couldn't find a pattern. IT in my uni noticed that vpl_evaluate.cpp ( https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/releases/vpl_evaluate.cpp ) has these lines: int timeout = maxtime / testCases.size(); for (size_t i = 0; i < testCases.size(); i++) { //... if (timeout <= 1 || Timer::elapsedTime() >= maxtime) { //... addFatalError(\"Global timeout\"); and that maxtime = maximum time in seconds (integer). So if maxtime < testCases.size() we automatically get a \"Global timeout\" error, and this might be related to this issue. However, it does not explain why it does not evaluate in 4 minutes. So, I always have to set up a relatively high maximum execution time in order for correct answers to be properly evaluated (4 or 8 minutes, usually), even if they are actually evaluated basically instantly. However, whenever a student makes a nonending loop, they have to way for that whole time (4+ minutes) in order to get the timeout error message and be able to try again. This hinders VPLs usability in exams, which are time-sensitive. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this problem as a professor (no access to uni server and moodle plugin configs)? Or is there anything I could indicate IT to do? I note that this problem was already noticed in https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=451871&lang=en . Thank you very much.",

          "Text": "Hi Luiz, Thank you for reporting this issue, and sorry for the inconvenience you’re experiencing. You are correct — the BIOTES evaluator represents time limits as integer seconds and distributes the total maximum execution time among all test cases. Specifically, the timeout for each case is calculated approximately as: `timeout_per_case = maxtime / number_of_cases` Because of this design, if the number of test cases is large and the total time limit is not proportionally higher, the timeout for each individual case may become too small, causing a “Global timeout” error even when the total execution time seems reasonable. To avoid this, you should ensure that the maximum execution time is greater than the number of test cases . The more test cases you have, the larger this global time limit needs to be. Better Solution: Use the GIOTES Evaluator This limitation has been resolved in the newer GIOTES evaluator (VPL version >= 4.3.0), which is mostly compatible with BIOTES but provides much more flexibility in timeout management. With GIOTES , you can: Define a default timeout per test case using \"time limit=\" before any case, Override the timeout for specific cases using \"time limit=\" in the case, and Use floating-point values for more precise time limits (e.g., 0.5 seconds). This allows you to manage large numbers of test cases efficiently without artificially inflating the total maximum time. Server Configuration Note Be aware that the jail server configuration can also limit the maximum execution time.\nBy default, the jail server’s global timeout is 1800 seconds (30 minutes) , but this can be freely adjusted by the jail server administrator. In most cases, the default settings work well. However, reducing the number of allowed processes too much can negatively affect performance and lead to unexpected timeouts, so I would recommend keeping the default or slightly increasing it rather than lowering it.

          "Text": "Hi, VPL is a two-part solution. The first part sits on the server and runs the code in a sandbox environment. Thus, if we want to run a specific package of, let us say, Python, then if the computer that has the VPL server running can compile Python, and has the package available and correctly configured, the code sent to it will run, and you will have an output. The Moodle plugin facilitates sending the code to the server; thus, instead of the professor downloading the student code to their development machine, executing the code, and viewing the results, the plugin does this work. There is also a way to automate checking. If the professor spends a little time, higher automation in the evaluation of the results is possible. This summarises the workflow. Now, to address your query: The sandbox environment should also have access to the GPUs. There is work to be done under the hood, however, if there is experience in setting up GPUs on another machine of similar architecture, it should be a cinch. Extensive testing is required to fully understand the workflow. Process execution limits should be suitable for the proposed workload. Very few institutions will run the backend jobe server on GPU and CUDA capable servers, although it is possible. We are curious to now the outcome and welcome the experience of your team and the professor's success in this interesting, relevant and emerging learning direction.",

This means that if your Moodle server uses `https` , the browser will prevent access to a VPL Jail Server that uses `http` or `ws` . To resolve this, you should configure your VPL Jail Server using a public IP and `https` .

          "Text": "Hello, I'm trying to set the final grade for a VPL activity using the 'vpl_evaluate.sh' script. According to the documentation, the correct way to assign a grade is by echoing a string in the format 'Grade :=>> [value]'. For example, I'm using: `echo \"Grade :=>> 8.33\"` However, when the evaluation runs, the string \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" appears in the output of the evaluation report, but the actual grade for the submission is not being set by VPL. It seems like VPL is not interpreting this line as a grade assignment. Here's an example of the output I'm seeing: \n```text\nGrade\n8.33\n\n\n\nGrade :=>> 8.33\n```\n \n```text\n\n```\n (Note: The \"Grade 8.33\" line before \"Grade :=>> 8.33\" is part of my script's output, not the VPL grade assignment itself.) Could anyone please advise on what might be causing this issue? Is there a specific placement for this command in 'vpl_evaluate.sh' (e.g., must it be the very last line of output)? Or are there any other configurations in VPL or Moodle that I need to check to ensure this command is correctly parsed as the final grade? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

          "Text": "Dear Amit Singh, After a examination of the issue you've described, it appears the cause is linked to the configuration of the NODE_PATH environment variable. This variable allows Node.js to locate global modules, including the `readline-sync` module your script depends on. To address this problem and ensure your JavaScript code executes in VPL, a temporary solution can be implemented until the upcoming VPL release, which will include an automatic configuration of the NODE_PATH variable. Here is an enhanced script for your `vpl_run.sh` file. This script sets up the NODE_PATH variable and prepare the run of your JavaScript code. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n# This file is part of VPL for Moodle - \nhttp://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/\n\n# Script for JavaScript language using NodeJs\n# Copyright (C) 2024 Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino\n# License \nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\n GNU GPL v3 or later\n# Author Juan Carlos Rodríguez-del-Pino <jcrodriguez@dis.ulpgc.es>\n\n# @vpl_script_description Using nodejs with the first file\n# load common script and check programs\n. common_script.sh\ncheck_program nodejs\nif [ \"$1\" == \"version\" ] ; then\n    get_program_version -v\nfi\n\nget_first_source_file js\ncat common_script.sh > vpl_execution\n[ \"$(command -pv npm)\" != \"\" ] && (echo \"export NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g)\" >> vpl_execution)\necho \"nodejs \\\"$FIRST_SOURCE_FILE\\\" \\$@\" >> vpl_execution\nchmod +x vpl_execution\n```\n Please apply this script in the \"Execution files\" of your VPL activity and let us know if you encounter any further issues.

It seems the issue persists despite the script adjustments for the NODE_PATH environment variable. This suggests that there might be another underlying issue at play. You can explore additional debugging steps: Environment Check: Although the provided script should correctly set the NODE_PATH, it's worth manually verifying the environment variables within the jail server to ensure they are set as expected. You can do this by adding debug statements in your `vpl_run.sh` script to print out environment variables to the console. Resource Limits: The issue might also be related to resource limits within the VPL environment. It's possible that the compilation of the evaluation program exceeds the available memory, causing it to terminate. To diagnose this, you can temporarily increase the resource limits for your VPL activity and see if the problem persists. Direct Execution Test: As a more direct test, you can attempt to execute your JavaScript code directly in the jail environment without using the VPL execution scripts. This can help determine if the issue is with the VPL setup or the code itself. To facilitate this, a simple C program like the following can grant you access to the jail command line, enabling you to run the JavaScript code manually and observe any immediate feedback or errors. Set the file with the following code as first file in your submissions. \n```text\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    system(\"/bin/bash\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n Please, attempt these steps and share any findings.

          "Text": "Dear Steve, Using pre_vpl_run.sh to install the required Node.js packages during each execution or evaluation is possible, but it tends to be time-consuming and not always reliable. A more effective approach is to install the necessary packages globally on the execution server. This ensures they are readily available without repeated installations. Regarding the issue with asynchronous input/output, you're right—Node.js and some of its packages can take full control of the terminal, which can interfere with VPL’s evaluator and cause unexpected behavior. After testing several packages that support synchronous input/output, I found that readline-sync works well and integrates properly with the VPL evaluator. I’ve tested it successfully with both VPL version 4.2 and the upcoming version 4.3. I hope this resolves the issue you're facing. Note: Please avoid using the plugin notification feature to ask technical questions, as it does not support threaded communication. Best regards, Juan Carlos Rodríguez",

          "Text": "Hi Giuseppe, Thanks for your message. I understand that when you mention \"I have set VPL to listen on port 8443 HTTPS and 8080 HTTP\", you are referring to the VPL Jail System . Just to clarify, installing the VPL Jail System on a VPS is not the most typical setup. If accessing `http://server:8282/OK` returns “OK”, then the VPL Jail System is likely running correctly. However, there may be a small typo: based on your earlier message, I believe the correct port should be `8080` , not `8282` . Assuming your Moodle site is using the default ports (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS), here are a few key points and recommendations to help you troubleshoot the timeout issue: Checklist to verify configuration Verify the ports Double-check the port numbers you’ve configured, both in the VPL Jail System and in the Moodle VPL plugin. Use full external URL In the Moodle VPL plugin configuration, ensure you're using the full external URL (e.g., `https://your-domain:8443` ). Do not use `localhost` here, note that this URL is send to the browser to access the VPL-Jail-System. Check HTTPS functionality Make sure you can access `https://your-domain:8443/OK` . This will confirm that the VPL Jail System is properly serving over HTTPS. URLPATH security It is highly recommended to configure the `URLPATH` parameter in the VPL Jail System. This adds a layer of security by ensuring only authorized Moodle servers can access it. Self-signed certificate setting Since you are using a valid Let's Encrypt certificate, the \"accept self-signed certificates\" option in the Moodle plugin should be disabled . Reverse proxy and WebSocket support If you're using a reverse proxy to expose the VPL Jail System, ensure it supports WebSocket connections . Note that the `/OK` endpoint does not use WebSockets, so its success does not guarantee that task execution will work properly. Remove unnecessary HTTP port If you're not using HTTP on port 8080, consider disabling it to reduce attack surface and potential misconfiguration. Let me know if you continue to experience issues after these checks. We’ll be happy to help further. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos",

While the default Basic Input/Output Test Evaluation System does not directly check the content of files, you can use the “program to run” and “program arguments” options to execute custom commands that do. I’ve reviewed the “pars” activity on the demo server and have a few suggestions that might help: Preventing Students from Modifying Header Files: If you want to ensure students don’t change the provided header files, include those headers in both the Requested Files and the Execution Files . In the VPL editor, these will appear as read-only, and during execution, only the versions from Execution Files will be used — giving you full control. Writing to and Checking File Contents: It seems you were close to a working solution. I’ve corrected and improved the execution scripts on the demo server. The activity should now correctly check the contents of the output file. I recommend adding a few more test cases with different file content outputs to thoroughly assess student solutions. Best regards, Juan Carlos P.S.: I’ve uploaded the corrected execution files here to ensure their content is preserved",

Unless you have a specific need for that kind of setup, it's safe to disable the service. Also, I recommend updating your VPL Jail system to version 4.0.4, which includes various improvements and fixes.

For many years, the run of `sql_run.sh` execution script for SQLite3 generate a code to go in interactive mode showing the software version. However, it seems that now also shows the version when VPL is evaluating the student code. Upcoming Fix: In the next VPL release, we plan to modify the sql_run.sh script to suppress the SQLite3 version output when in the evaluation process. Workaround: In the meantime, to resolve the problem, you can customize your `vpl_run.sh` (based on `sql_run.sh` from the VPL source) . For example, modify the code block that checks for batch mode. Instead of: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n    echo \"sqlite3 $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n you can change it to: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   if [ -f vpl_evaluate.sh ]; then\n       BATCHOPTION=\"-batch\"\n   fi\n   echo \"sqlite3 $BATCHOPTION $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n If you wish to avoid going in interactive mode of SQLite3 when running use: \n```text\nif [ \"$1\" != \"batch\" ]; then\n   echo \"sqlite3 -batch $DBFILE\" >> vpl_execution\nfi\n```\n Thanks again for your valuable feedback. Please let us know if you have any further questions or suggestions. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

          "Text": "Hello Rajasekaran, VPL does not currently provide out-of-the-box support for Servlets or JSP . However, because VPL can be configured to manage different runtime environments (e.g., text terminal, GUI, or web applications), it’s theoretically possible to adapt it for Tomcat-based web applications. If you have experience with Tomcat, you can use the existing PHP run script as a starting point and modify it to launch Tomcat (or another Java web server ) within the VPL environment. This approach may also involve adding Maven (for dependencies) and the Tomcat plugin to manage deployment. Keep in mind that configuring a servlet/JSP environment in VPL requires additional resources and significant setup time. If you decide to pursue this route, you will need to : Install Tomcat (or another web server), Maven, etc. in the VPL execution server. Customize a run script to compile your project (using Maven, if desired) and start Tomcat. Configure ports as the PHP script does. This is definitely an advanced use case and may require considerable effort, but it can be a viable solution. If you do try it, your feedback or any shared scripts would be valuable to the community. Best regards.",

If you need an execution file to be present during this second execution phase, you need to check it in the \"Files to keep when running\" menu.

We solved this by using NGINX to prevent anyone from connecting to the task submission URL_PATH. But I think the issue still stands that there are over 900 servers which I can execute arbitrary code on the internet right now at this very second due to the insecure by default configuration. At a minimum requiring the user to set a URLPATH would resolve this issue I can provide the list here but it isnt difficult to find by just using any service which indexes favicons.",

WebSocket connections are secured using HTTPS and switch to WebSocket protocols, ensuring robust encryption. Additionally, many organizations aim to minimize the number of open ports to streamline security management. Regarding your concern about system administrators potentially being unaware of the risks of omitting the `URLPATH` parameter, future releases of VPL will address this. We will introduce warnings in the execution server startup process and in the VPL plugin's execution server checks. These warnings will explicitly highlight the risks of not using `URLPATH` and strongly recommend its configuration to enhance security.",

Addressing this concern is on our TODO list, and we have planned different approaches to resolve it effectively. These include: Generating a zip file for each submission. Creating a single zip file containing old submissions for cleanup. While these features are under development, you can try the following interim solutions: Adjust the \"Discard Submission Period\": In the plugin's global settings, increase the \"Discard Submission Period\" from the default value of 1 minute. This change can help manage submission retention. Perform a Backup and Restore: (risky) As a more involved solution, perform a backup of the course (including users and activities ) and then restore it. This action will remove all submissions except the most recent ones. These steps should help mitigate the issue until the planned features are implemented. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

I missed at the time a detail that I think is the problem. The error message you get says \"Not saved\", which means that the VPL Question failed to submit the code to the VPL activity (thus not even trying to execute it). The most probable cause I can see is that you did not set the \"Maximum number of files\" to a sufficient number in VPL settings > Submission restrictions. Try to set it to at least (number of required files + number of execution files). Please let me know if this fixes the issue. Sorry again for the wait! Best regards,\nAstor",

This limitation is due to the way the VPL Jail Server URLs are structured. While this could be addressed in the future to provide more flexibility in how the VPL Jail Server is configured, it is not a high priority at the moment. For a workaround, I recommend using an alias name for the Nginx server instead of a subfolder. The alias name can redirect requests to the VPL Jail Server, allowing you to place the VPL jail server machine (with other name and IP) behind the Nginx server while keeping the current URL schema intact.

Under normal circumstance VPL is responding good if more number of users using we find VPL is bit slow. So we decided to put more horizontally scale based on no of users. For that i have personally testing VPL docker images especially ubuntu-full. Everything works fine if i created as separate docker container in a separate VM and accessed through common physical router. But when i tried to run moodle and vpl containers in same machine and connect with docker network it is not working. In console i am getting ws (web socket) error.

          "Text": "Dr. S. Rajasekaran, Thank you for sharing your experience with VPL. Details are important for understanding the behavior and performance of VPL. Could you please indicate if you have tested adding more Jail servers to your Moodle server to resolve the performance issues and what resources (especially RAM) the machines you added have available? Using one machine for both the Moodle server and the Jail Server may raise some inconveniences. You must limit the resources available for the Jail Server to avoid slowing down Moodle when the jail server gets very bussy. From your statement, “I tried to run Moodle and VPL containers on the same machine and connect with Docker network,” I understand that you are trying to expose only the Moodle server to the internet. Note that, as indicated in the manual, the Jail Server must also be exposed to the internet (see the third requirement). Documentation on VPL Jail System Requirements To run both servers on the same machine, you may use two names or different ports for the same machine. The first approach requires proper configuration of a reverse proxy using Nginx or Apache , for example. Remember to set the correct URL (reachable from the internet) for the jail server in the VPL plugin configuration. Note that if you use localhost or the localhost IP (127.X:X:X) for your jail server it will only be available from a browser on that machine. If you are trying to build a Load Balancer, please read the following documentation: Load Balancer Documentation Additionally, be aware that modern browsers reject non-secure requests (HTTP or WS) from secure pages (HTTPS).

          "Text": "Hi Bruna, It seems like the issue is related to the use of the backslash \"\\\" in your regex. In programming laguages strings, the backslash is used as an escape character to represent special characters in a string, such as \"\\n\" for newline and \"\\t\" for tab. When using regex, backslashes are also used to escape special regex characters to treat them as literal characters, for example, \"\\.\" to match a dot instead of any character. However, in VPL regex, the first use of the backslash (for special characters like \"\\n\") is not implemented. So, if you want to represent a newline, you should directly write the newline character in the editor instead of using \"\\n\". Please try replacing your \"\\n\" with an actual newline character in your expressions. Note that the \"output=\" option in VPL allows for multilines. Additionally, using regex can sometimes be complex and may require external tools to identify discrepancies. Simplifying the expected output of student's code, using simpler regex patterns or other types of expected output as numbers or text may ease the process of writing test cases and improve readability.",

In this case, it will attempt to open a browser. Otherwise, the system will run the PHP CLI, executing the first student's file. For more details, you can refer to the default PHP run script available at the following link: default PHP run script . If you want to change this behavior, you need to create your own `vpl_run.sh` script. Note that you can detect if you are running in an evaluation action by checking for the presence of the `vpl_evaluate.sh` file. Remember to select the PHP files in the “Files to keep when running” section. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos",

It is working fine now, but I had a few issues during the installation: First, if you are using a router, you need that your real IP ports 80 and 443 from outside be foward to your local IP (192.something) [you do it by configuring your router] and that those ports also be fowards from your IP to your NAT IP inside Virtual Machine (10. something) [you do it by configuring the network on Oracle Virtual Machine). Second, I got a hell of time to put the SSL certificate to function. The non secure host / OK was working fine but the SSL  host / OK was given a not secure error. I tried to copy the etc/letsencrypt .pem files to the respective correct names on the etc/vpl, however, it did not work. Later I verified that the size of the copied files were way smaller than the original ones and instead of copying the files, I just put the link of the pem files inside the vpl jail server conf files and it started to work just fine. Those were the two major issues I get and I had to say it took me a couple of hours to solve it, but now I'm happyt it is working fine. PS: Do you guys know some low cost 24/7 linux server account where I can run a vpl jail server?",

This include npm, used, and nodejs. However, you have the flexibility to use any version of the development software on your jail server. The key limitation is ensuring that the command line interface of the software version you choose is compatible with the scripts used by the VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) plugin. Specifically regarding your query, the npm command is utilized by the jail server installer exclusively for installing Node.js packages. Meanwhile, the Node.js command is employed by the VPL plugin's JavaScript runner. Both commands rely on straightforward command line interfaces, which means you should encounter no issues when updating or downgrading these pieces of software. Regarding updating Node.js to a version that is compatible with npm 10.4.0, as you've described the requirement ^18.17.0 || >=20.5.0, it can be accomplished in the usual manner and with the standard precautions associated with software updates. Please note, this process is independent of the VPL jail server's specific considerations.",

Here is a quick example: \n```text\n#################################################################\n\n\n# caesar.py for XY\n\n\n# by PQ, 16 February 2024\n\n\n# Last changed: 29 February 2024\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Copy this code, go to Edit and submit it, Save and Run\n\n\n# You encrypt with positive shift. Eg 3 makes A > D, B > E, ..\n\n\n# To decrypt the shift is negative, Eg -3 makes D > A, E > B, ..\n\n\n#\n```\n That part works. The students crack Caesar's code by trial-and-error. My problem is to make sure that they've run the program at least once. For that I made this test case: \n```text\ncase = Case 1\n\n\ninput = 'ABCD'\n\n\n3\n\n\noutput = 'DEFG'\n```\n But that test always fails! It should be the opposite: always pass.

          "Text": "To address the \"Http(s) Unsupported METHOD CONNECT\" error, let's break it down: The check you mentioned pertains to WebSocket connections' URL paths. These connections originate from the user's browser. The error message \"Http(s) Unsupported METHOD CONNECT\" indicates that either your browser or a proxy in your network is attempting to send a CONNECT method request to the Jail server. The CONNECT method is typically used by proxies but doesn't make sense for the Jail server. To resolve this issue, consider the following steps: Verify your network configuration: Ensure that there are no misconfigured proxies in your network that might be causing this issue. Use a full transparent proxy: If necessary, set up a transparent proxy that doesn't interfere with WebSocket connections. Direct connection to the Jail server: If feasible, try connecting directly to the Jail server without any intermediate proxies to see if the issue persists. I hope this helps you diagnose and resolve the problem effectively. Best regards,\nJuan Carlos.",

However, it's crucial to understand that there are three distinct levels of resource limits to consider: VPL Execution Server Level: The first level of resource limitation is at the VPL execution server. You can configure resource limits at this level, and details on how to do so can be found in the official documentation here: VPL Execution Server Configuration . Moodle Plugin Configuration Level: The second level involves setting resource limits at the Moodle level through plugin configuration. You can explore the necessary configurations in the plugin's global settings. Refer to this link for more information: Moodle Plugin Configuration . VPL Activity Level: Finally, the third level of resource limits is at the VPL activity level within the activity settings. It's important to understand that the most restrictive limit among these three levels will be applied when executing VPL activities . You can find additional details on this level of configuration here: VPL Activity Level Configuration . In summary, while there isn't a fixed hard limit for memory allocation, the resource limits imposed by the three levels mentioned above collectively determine the maximum memory available. To extend this limit, you should carefully adjust these configurations as per your requirements, keeping in mind that the most restrictive setting will take precedence.",

I recommend configuring the VPL execution service to use different ports, such as 8080 and 8090. You can usually set this in the configuration file of the VPL Jail System. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/configuration.html#network-parameters Missing Certificate Files : The logs indicate that the VPL Jail System service is failing to find a required certificate file. Ensure that the SSL certificate file paths are correctly specified in the VPL Jail System's configuration file. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/configuration.html#ssl-cert-file For more details , see documentation at https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-3.0.1/ I hope this assists you in resolving your problem.

Since the standard build / launch script (blank vpl_run.sh) compiles all source files present, the linker complains about multiple definitions of main. The easiest way of interaction for the student would be to see only the currently edited file to be compiled and executed, leaving all other files untouched.

I would like to use VPL to propose some challenges to my students in my algorithms and abstract data type course. To be pertinent, the challenge must treat large (up to 10 to 20MB) files as input. My problem is that the files are displayed in the main page of the activity : the page is thus quite slow to load (a few seconds). The IDE is also slow when I want to save a file, it seems that all the files are saved even if only one single file is modified ? Here is my question : how could I solved these slowdown issues ? One solution could be to create my instance files on the fly, but maybe there is a better solution or a configuration that I missed ?",

          "Text": "Dear Nicolas BODIN, I appreciate your interest in using VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) for your algorithms and abstract data types course. Thank you for bringing up your concerns regarding the page load speed and file saving behavior. I'd like to address each point: Slow Page Load for Showing Large Files: The delay you are experiencing is due to the system is interpreting unknown file types as code files, thus attempting to render them. Solution for Slow Page Load: To circumvent this issue, you can rename the files with a .bin extension. This will mark the files as binary, and the description page and editor will not attempt to display their content. To add these .bin files to the editor, you can use the drag-and-drop feature or the import functionality. Required vs. Execution Files: You don't necessarily need to add these large files to the \"Required files\" section. Adding them to the \"Execution files\" section and marking them as \"Files to keep when running\" will suffice for your purposes. File Saving Behavior: The editor, by design, saves all the files every time you execute a save command, regardless of whether a single file or multiple files have been modified. I hope this addresses your concerns and assists you in efficiently using VPL for your educational needs. If you have further questions or require additional clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. Best regards, Juan Carlos",

Execution resources limits may have been exceedeed\" even if no limit has been put foer the questions. 4) if I re-evaluate a student answer the process takes a huge time and sometimes the results vary for each try. There are cases with correct quiestions that are marked as wrong one time and then correct the second time. 5) When re- evaluating I sometimes get the following error \"Error: mdb->get_record() found more than one record! line 1636 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to debugging() line 1596 of /lib/dml/moodle_database.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_ sql () line 58 of /mod/vpl/jail/running_processes.class.php: call to moodle_database->get_record_select() line 567 of /mod/vpl/vpl_submission_CE.class.php: call to vpl_running_processes::get_run() line 440 of /mod/vpl/vpl_submission_CE.class.php: call to mod_vpl_submission_CE->cancelprocess() line 273 of /mod/vpl/forms/edit.class.php: call to mod_vpl_submission_CE->run() line 106 of /question/type/vplquestion/locallib.php: call to mod_vpl_edit::execute() line 97 of /question/type/vplquestion/question.php: call to qtype_vplquestion_evaluate() line 109 of /question/behaviour/deferredfeedback/behaviour.php: call to qtype_vplquestion_question->grade_response() line 57 of /question/behaviour/deferredfeedback/behaviour.php: call to qbehaviour_deferredfeedback->process_finish() line 1356 of /question/engine/questionattempt.php: call to qbehaviour_deferredfeedback->process_action() line 1437 of /question/engine/questionattempt.php: call to question_attempt->process_action() line 896 of /question/engine/questionusage.php: call to question_attempt->regrade() line 345 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to question_usage_by_activity->regrade_question() line 511 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_attempt() line 420 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_batch_of_attempts() line 260 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->regrade_attempts() line 104 of /mod/quiz/report/overview/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->process_actions() line 97 of /mod/quiz/report.php: call to quiz_overview_report->display()\" The jail servers I'm using is the jail server in spain and a local server in Italy Any suggestion?",

First, they have to ask how many titles the person wants to enter (number), and then the input \"Enter a title\" comes up as often as the first number mentionned. The output is a list of the titles. As this programm is to see how \"for\" works in python, I would like to get a second exercise with a nicer output: not in a list, but in a row like: title title title And here starts my problem: the output without quotes will also take a list-utput as true. And then I enter quotes, the output is evaluated to false because of the first input (number of songs, you want to enter). Thank you for any help! Luise expected code and testcase: musik = [] anzahl = int(input('How many songs do you like to get in your list?

Below is the steps for preparing the jail server: Install Xephyr (apt install xserver-xephyr) Modify /usr/sbin/vpl/vpl_vnc_launcher.sh, replace the line \"$HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\" with the following block \n```text\n        if [ -f $HOME/.glx_required ]; then\n          VNCDISPLAY=$(ls $HOME/.vnc/*.log | sed -e \"s/[^:]*://\" -e \"s/\\.log$//\")\n          XEPHYRDISP=$(($VNCDISPLAY+25000))\n          Xephyr :$XEPHYRDISP -fullscreen &\n          while true; do\n            DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP xdpyinfo >& /dev/null\n            [ \"$?\" == \"0\" ] && break\n          done\n          DISPLAY=:$XEPHYRDISP $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        else\n          $HOME/vpl_wexecution &> .std_output\n        fi\n```\n For a VPL instance that requires GLX support In \"Execution files\" section, add an empty file called .glx_required In \"Files to keep when running\" section, tick .glx_required In \"Resources limits\", the option \"Maximum memory used\" should be at least 256MB In fact, the workaround is a preliminary work. It has been tested in single-user case (at least for my programs). I am not sure whether it works without trouble in multi-user case. Hope this would help in your case.",

          "Title": "VPL - how to add prisoners to secondary group(s)",
          "Text": "Hello, Intro I was testing VPL for some time and it is a great piece of software. Inspired by its flexibility, together with my colleagues I am trying to connect it in the common workflow with programs we have installed on our server . Our use case is as follows: on our server, we set up a VM with Ubuntu 20.04 64b and latest VPL jail jail server communicates with Moodle without problems, we can run standard software tools and software we compiled and installed in `/usr/local/bin` , for example we have mapped a partition with additional software to be able to access and run the software on the mounted partition, the user needs to be added to secondary group, let's call it `secondarygroup` with guid `2000` `` in Ubuntu VM we are able to add the `vpl` user to `secondarygroup` using `usermod -a -G mygroup vpl` and we are able to run the software. But of course the vpl user won't be a prisoner in the VPL jail. So we need to add all prisoners to `secondarygroup` . Question So my question and problem is: how to add prisoners to (a) secondary group(s) . What I've tried For the purpose of testing I reduced the `MIN_PRISONER_UGID` - `MAX_PRISONER_UGID` range to 10000-10007. I found `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` file, which seems to be executed each time after I run `systemctl restart vpl-jail-system` I modified `set_etc` function in the mentioned file so that `$JAILPATH/etc/group` file has an additional line with `secondarygroup` and `$JAILPATH/etc/gshadow` file is generated (details below) `` Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/ehjSaSoZPX , I also attach the files (before/after) `` Result (VPL in the browser) `` For the testing purposes, I put several command in the `vpl_run.sh` , and the result is as follows: `` \n```text\ncat /etc/passwd : \n\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:10000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:10001:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:10002:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\n\n\np10003:*:10003:10003:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\n\n\np10004:*:10004:10004:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n\np10005:*:10005:10005:prisoner 10005:/home/p10005:/bin/bash\np10006:*:10006:10006:prisoner 10006:/home/p10006:/bin/bash\n\ncat /etc/group : \n\nroot:*:0:root\np10000:*:10000:p10000\np10001:*:10001:p10001\n```\n In the `groups` and `id` I would expect seeing `secondarygroup` , but it is not there. Also, `gshadow` looks like this in Ubuntu VM: \n```text\ncat /jail/etc/gshadow\ncat /var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/gshadow :\n\nroot:::\nsecondarygroup:!!::p10000,p10001,p10002,p10003,p10004,p10005,p10006\n```\n I also did an experiment when no custom `gshadow` is generated, with the same result as above. Summary So it seems that either I am doing something wrong with purely linux-related files that determine user groups or there is something VPL related I am not aware of. Is there any way to add prisoner users to secondary groups? I will appreciate any help.",

          "Text": "It looks like I found a partial solution to my problem. Not sure about its safety, but seems to be working. The trick is to modify and recompile the vpl daemon C++ code so the user GID is always the same (2000 in my case). Technically no secondary group, but I get the group membership I need. Won't work if several groups per prisoner are needed. Procedure: Do all the steps on the installation page until this step . Stop before executing `install-script-sh` . OR simply `cd` to your `vpl-jail-system-[version]` directory you used for vpl jail installation. Find the following line: link `src/processMonitor.cpp` file `processMonitor::becomePrisoner(int prisoner)` method `setresgid` function ( `unistd.h` ) Modify the line: `if (setresgid(prisoner, prisoner, prisoner)!= 0) {` After modification (hard-coded gid=2000 in my case): `if (setresgid(2000, 2000, 2000)!= 0) {` Stop the daemon and backup config if you made any customizations: `sudo systemctl stop vpl-jail-system.service` `sudo systemctl disable vpl-jail-system.service` `` `sudo mv /usr/sbin/vpl /usr/sbin/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/ /etc/vpl.backup` `sudo cp /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf.backup` Re-run installation script in order to recompile the daemon (respond \"no\" to software & SSL key installation queries if you have them already installed): `sudo ./install-vpl-sh` Edit `/usr/sbin/vpl/vpl-jail-system` (fresh one was copied from `vpl-jail-system.initd` during the previous step). Diff is here: https://diffonline.net/1JZPOA982x Before: \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$I:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:p$I\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n After (replace `mygroup` and `2000` as needed): \n```text\nfunction set_etc {\n        local MYGROUP=\"mygroup\"\n        local MYGROUPGUID=\"2000\"\n        #passwd file\n        local PASSWORDFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/passwd\"\n        local I\n        echo \"root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\" > \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        for (( I=$MIN_PRISONER_UGID ; $I < $MAX_PRISONER_UGID ; I+=1 )) ; do\n                echo \"p$I:*:$I:$MYGROUPGUID:prisoner $I:/home/p$I:/bin/bash\" >> \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        done\n        chmod 644 \"$PASSWORDFILE\"\n        #group file\n        local GROUPFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/group\"\n        echo \"root:*:0:root\" > \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        echo \"$MYGROUP:*:$MYGROUPGUID:\" >> \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        chmod 644 \"$GROUPFILE\"\n        local SHADOWFILE=\"$JAILPATH/etc/shadow\"\n        chown root.root \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n        chmod 600 \"$SHADOWFILE\"\n}\n```\n Note: it is another topic, but you may need to add `set_other /yourpath` in `start_vpl` function and `unset_other /yourpath` in `stop_vpl` function to be able to access custom-mounted filesystems in the jail. Restart the vpl jail service: `sudo systemctl restart vpl-jail-system.service` Result (in the browser): \n```text\n+ id\nuid=10005 gid=2000(mygroup) groups=2000(mygroup)\n\n+ members mygroup\np10000 p10001 p10002 p10003 p10004\n\n+ cat /etc/passwd\nroot:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\np10000:*:10000:2000:prisoner 10000:/home/p10000:/bin/bash\np10001:*:10001:2000:prisoner 10001:/home/p10001:/bin/bash\np10002:*:10002:2000:prisoner 10002:/home/p10002:/bin/bash\np10003:*:10003:2000:prisoner 10003:/home/p10003:/bin/bash\np10004:*:10004:2000:prisoner 10004:/home/p10004:/bin/bash\n\n+ cat /etc/group\nroot:*:0:root\nmygroup:*:2000:\n```\n To summarize: I think this is a good enough temporary solution (although with ugly hardcoded gid) but I would be happy to know if it can be done better (or included as a feature in the next VPL Jail release) and about security issues The solution doesn't add prisoners to secondary group. It just sets common primary group for them. Is there any solution for prisoners to belong to several groups? I have no idea what is the purpose of `/etc/shadow` file in the jail context , since both `/jail/etc/shadow` and `/var/vpl-jail-system/jail_live/etc/shadow` contain host server users' info and not the prisoners' I think there is a small bug in the original `vpl-jail-system.initd` script. Result is similar to the one above: for `MAX_PRISONER_UGID=10005` , the user p10005 is not added in `$JAILPATH/etc/passwd` and `$JAILPATH/etc/group` . Only the users p10000-p10004 are added. However, the daemon sometimes randomly selects such user.",

          "Title": "Extending VPL's functionality",
          "Text": "Hello everyone, my name is Zaid, I am a student at Hochschule Hannover in Germany . We recently started the process of integrating the functionality of VPL into our own moodle and to evaluate VPL concerning its interoperability with other automated grading systems for programming tasks . In this context m y University, in colaboration with many other universities, developed an XML exchange format called ProForma . ProForma is an exchange format for programming exercises/tasks. It formalises the specification of programming exercises, for example, the description, required programming language and suggested tests for evaluating the student submitted code so that exercises written for one tool can be exported and imported into another tool. We are interessed in extending the functionality of VPL so that it would support the uploading and further processing of tasks in our ProForma format, and if possible, we would like to avoid breaking the VPL standard, as we are interessed in making use of future new VPL releases. Therefore, we are wondering if there is interest from the side of the global VPL community to integrate this extra functionality into VPL and if so, we would like to collaborate with the creators of VPL for assistance. That way, everyone could make use of the ProForma format to exchange programming tasks independent of the learning respectively grading platform and we would still be able to rece i ve future VPL updates down the line. Please contact me if you are interested. Best regards, Zaid Akad",

          "Text": "How can I make VPL evaluations interactive with guessed wrong answers? Here is a minimal example to explain what I mean: - The students are supposed to write the ubiquitous helloworld . - The expected output string is \"Hello, World!\" - They are allowed to evaluate the answer  any number of times. - During the evaluation I want to catch typical wrong outputs like \"Hello World!\", \"Hello, world!\", etc. and give them corresponding feedback, \"Comma missing\", \"'World' should be written in uppercase\", etc. How can I achieve that? My first thought was the vpl_evaluate.cases file, but it is a list of correct cases, I found out. First time user. Apologies if this is a FAQ. I did a forum search though, they are bewildering for a beginner. ;( Edit: Is the VPL Question type the answer? That would be a vertical learning curve, since I want to put this to test the coming week!",

It is possible to only edit some of them. In your case, you only need to edit `vpl_evaluate.sh` All files submitted by the user are available in the environment. The `vpl_execution` file should write on standard output all information regarding the evaluation of the submitted code. All files submitted by the user are still available in the environment. There are several line formattings you should know about: - A line starting with `Grade :=>>` followed by a grade will set the grade of this evaluation. - A line starting with `Comment :=>>` will output a comment visible by the user. - `<|--` and `--|>` can be used to display multi-line comments. - Within multiline comments, lines starting with `-` will be displayed as headings, lines starting with `>` will be displayed as pre-formatted text. Dummy example for vpl_evaluate.sh contents: \n```text\n  echo \"echo Grade :=>> 100\" > vpl_execution\n  echo \"echo Comment :=>> \\\"Well done!\\\"\" >> vpl_execution\n  chmod +x vpl_execution\n```",

I usually use the due date as the last possible date to submit an vpl assignment and I set \"Expect completed on\" a week or two before the due date. I use this technique with other acitivities as well, e.g. quizzes, lessons, ... all of them show up in the timeline block with the \"expect completed on\" and there actual due date as long as the activity was not yet completed. VPL activites are not in the timeline block, neither with their due date nor with their expect completed on date. In the course calendar the due date results in a calendar entry, but again not the expect completed on date as it is, with the other activities. Is there a specific reason for this behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Both VPL and moodle have their latest version installed. Regards Lisa",

Notice that instead of using symbolic links you also can use the new parameter to indicate to the SSL certificate (fullchain.pem) and SSL key (privkey.pem) files.

          "Text": "HI Visvanath. Notice that if you want to use VPL and Apache at the same machine and Apache is using Certbot to get the SSL certificates the correct way to install VPL is to indicate that you already have certificates and using symbolic links or the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_KEY_FILE parameters to allow VPL to get access to the certificates got by Apache. I guess that if you are getting two different certificates for the same HOSTFQDN the Certbot generates two different directories. If you are using Apache on the default ports HTTP:80/HTTPS:443 you must set VPL on two different ports g.e. HTTP:8080/HTTPS:8081. You can also remove the HTTP port from VPL. https://vpl.dis.ulpgc.es/documentation/vpl-jail-system-2.7.0/configuration.html#ssl-cert-file Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

But imagine the student wants to check with the console for example he or she wants to type two numbers in but the console doesn´t ask for the two numbers it automatically tests the method´s and give an error or not.

If this is expected behaviour then it was successful. If this is not expected behaviour then it was unsuccessful. In either case the \"No execution server\" error does not display. Maybe I am misunderstanding the \"Check execution servers: VPL Editor and Compiler\" page. The \"Current Status\" column has a \"Ready\" value, but the \"Last error\" column has a \"request failed: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\" value. I understand the last error and I have fixed that error during the upgrade. The problem, I believe was that the cert.pem file was linked to X.509 certificate instead of the full chain (cert.pem -> /etc/letsencrypt/archive/jailserver/fullchain5.pem). Browsing to both http://jailservername/OK and https://jailservername/OK returns OK. I also confirm that I can access the paths by using wget from a command line from the Moodle server , and it also returns OK.

I tried modifying the format of the test cases but they still failed. For a while, I thought that the testing system has some bugs, but After many tests, I rewrite from scratch your test and voila the tests worked as expected. ​At that moment I was astonished. I looked for hidden characters in your test code with no luck. Finally, I realized that to represent the minus sign, you wrote a large hyphen from the UTF-8 charset (\\342) instead of the common hyphen of the ASCII table with char code 45. You can see that the hyphen near the 1.0 is a little bit larger than the hyphen near the 2.0 Please, use the common hyphen to represent the minus sign and the problem will vanish.

But as soon as I am trying to grade the tests based on the Moodle Plugin vpl_question, I get the error: \"An error occured during question grading (no grade obtained)\". I tried to debug this (debug level 8 on the jail server ), which shows me that the files are uploaded as expected, the output of the test result is written into the log entry also. But it seems that this result is not transferred back to the moodle server correctly. I get the same error when I activate the checkbox \"Validate\" inside the question activity, as soon as I try to save the question. Can you please help me in solving this problem? Many thanks!

          "Text": "Hi Astor Bizard and Alexandre Meslé, Thanks for the help. I worked last week with the administration, but I am not an administator. We try several configurations in the global configuration, some stop the pre-check from working, and no configuration could make the grade working. We conclude that should be something in the execution server, since we change the local execution server to http://demojail.dis.ulpgc.es , it works, if we set to our server https://vpl-jail.uab.pt (or http://vpl-jail.uab.pt ) do not work the VPL question, but work the VPL activity. I made now a test, after submiting a VPL question that return no grade, go to the VPL activity and submit the data that was there (from the VPL question), and return the following: Testing 1/1 : 1 <|-- -Summary of tests >+------------------------------+ >| 1 test run/ 1 test passed | >+------------------------------+ --|> Grade :=>> 1 So, it appear that only our execution server and VPL question are not working 100%. I will confirm with the administration, but I think we have the latest version, since the platform have the upgrade last month. I checked the grade in VPL activity and it have a grade, that is visible to the students (but the course is now closed, I am preparing the next semester). I already setup a quiz without time limit, so the students can return and continue, during each module. Thanks to the VPL question type, I could put all content in a single quiz, so I can also make a block with results of top 100 of student progress, based on that quiz. I will keep the previous tool as a backup, but I think this will be a clear better tool/method, since the students are reading and have a zone to write / complete the code and check the result, and I can see what the students are doing. If the problem is not solved until the semester start, I can always setup the quiz without grades, but with that I would lost the top 100, that I think works well in student motivation.

The run-time limit can be set in the \"Maximum execution resources limits\" option. Q2) How can we limit the number of evaluations/submissions? A2) The number of evaluations or submissions cannot be limited. You can only penalize each evaluation. Q3) how to export the highest grade among all submissions like in CMS. A3) You cannot get the highest grade of each user, only the grade of the last submission. You can export the activity grades from the grade book of Moodle.

Regarding Q2 - My students are submitting over and over to \"hack\" my tests. Of course I can penalize them, however this is not a good enough solution, as they need to think twice before each submission - something that I do not wish them to do. Also, they think it is petty and that it is some kind of a punishment. I believe that a better solution would be to limit the submissions to X times a day. It will stop the \"hacking\" as well without punishing them. Is there any chance that this feature will be supported in the near future? Best regards, Achiya",

I am wondering if it is possible to check the Java or C/C++ style Guidelines.

I find out a book \"developing programming courses with moodle and vpl\" that shows a solution for my purpose, however, from my point of view, it is a bit difficult to do it. And finally, I don't know if it is possible to integrate the PMD analyzer code in VPL (or another one) in which you can set the features that PMD has to check in student programs and VPL returns an error it has not a good codification. Thank you very much and you've done a really good job!!!",

I'm trying to use the forward slash character (/) within a regular expression in the \"vpl_evaluate.cases\" file but \"no test case found\" message is shown when evaluating the output of any student program. I guess there is something wrong when Moodle is processing such a regular expression... For example, the output of the program should be the string \"2/2\" or \"02/02\", i.e., both strings are valid, so I think regular expressions come to play in this case because using exact match we can not define alternative clauses... If I define the following test case: \n```text\ncase = Test 1\n\n\ngrade reduction = 20%\n\n\ninput =2\n\n\n2\n\n\noutput = /(2\\/2)|(02\\/02)/\n```\n Moodle shows a \"no test case found\" message when I tried to evaluate any program. I think the problem is related to the use of '/' within the regular expression, any help? Thanks in advanced! José",

Also the execution server administrator can control the access to the server by configuring the vpl-jail-service. Notice also that by default if your Moodle server use HTTP connection the browser will use not cyphered WebSocket connections with the execution server. Parameters at /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf you can use to control the access to your execution server: PORT : Sets the server port number for http and ws. Default 80. If you change this port only users that know the port number can access using HTTP to your server. In a future version, this access can be removed. e.g. http://servername:34377 URLPATH : Represents the PATH expected in execution requests. It acts as a password, if the URL PATH in the execution request does not match, the request is rejected. By default \"/\". If you set it only Moodle server that uses this URLPATH can use the service. e.g. http(s)://servername/PASS TASK_ONLY_FROM : IPs or networks (type A, B or C ) from which execution requests are accepted. You can set multiple separated by spaces. This parameter only affects Moodle servers, access from clients (browsers) is done using frugal tickets. If this property is not set the server will accept requests from any machine that set the correct URLPATH. Default not set. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

You can resolve this need with this approach: 1) Create a  script \"inputFile.sh\" to pass the file to use as standard input to the student's program. \n```text\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nread filename\n\n\nif [  ! -f \"$filename\" ] ; then\n\n\n    echo \"Error: file $filename not found\"\n\n\nelse\n\n\n    # Runs student's program with $filename as standard input\n\n\n    ./vpl_test <$filename\n\n\nfi\n```\n Remember to mark \"inputFile.sh\" as \"file to keep when running\". To have the script available at testing time. 2) You must add to each test case at vpl_evaluate.cases file the following: program to run = ./inputFile.sh Example: \n```text\nCase = Test file input\n\n\nProgram to run = ./inputFile.sh\n\n\ninput = data1.txt\n\n\noutput = \"Expeted result\"\n```\n Important: VPL is not ready to evaluate based on the code runtime. VPL does not use a queued execution leading to the possibility that some tasks run in the same execution server at the same time. To palliate this problem the teacher, after all, can reevaluate all the student submissions using a dedicated jail server. In this situation, the evaluation tasks will be run one by one.

For example, the evaluation process takes these steps. 1) A user launches an evaluation process. e.g. the user clicks evaluate button. 2) The browser sends a request ( AJAX / JSON ) to the Moodle server. 3) The Moodle server selects an execution server (with retries) and sends the task to an execution server (HTTP/XMLRPC). The execution server generates different security tokens as a response to de request. The task start. 4) The Moodle server responds to the Browser request with information with the \"execution server URL \" and the security tokens. 5) The browser connects with the execution server using the URL+security token and the \"WebSocket\" protocol to monitor the task. 6) When the task end, the monitor sends a request (AJAX/JSON) to the Moodle server to retrieve the task report/result. 8) The Moodle server request the \"execution server\" the task result (HTTP/XMLRPC) with the security token, save it and return the result to the browser. 9) The browser shows the result.",

Q2) We tried to use Spring core,JDBC.Any ways to add jar files??? A2) From VPL 3.3.7 you can easily use Java jar files. Drop/import the jar file into \"execution files\" and add it to the \"Files to keep when running\".",

You can know the available languages by creating a file with \".all\" extension and running it. Due that VPL is a stateless execution system, may be difficult to develop scripts to execute Oracle queries inside VPL due to the need of keeping Oracle security/passwords and its and own users. Q2 Can I even evaluate multiple languages in a single program. Is creating a VM the correct way to execute it? A2 The I/O test system is independent of the programming language. The system detects the language used based on the filename extensión. If you want the student to write a program using a mix of languages you need to write your own scripts. Q3 Can I create evaluation scripts directly in the plugin to achieve the same or web services would be a solution. A3 Yes, you can customize the system. But notice that all executions will be done in the execution server. Q4 Any instruction documentation would be great. A4 Sorry for the poor documentation.

In this case, the message \"connection fail: error\" comes from a PHP Fatal error due to memory exhausted. To avoid that one PHP script uses too much memory (taking memory needed for other scripts) the memory used by each script is limited by configuration (php.ini). The solution to this problem is to increase the PHP memory limit. Notice that binary files are coded as b64 to be sent in JSON . Due this question, I added \"showing a verbose message for this problem\" on the TODO list. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",

Some of the files defined in the VPL Activity do not get packaged for use in evaluation (such as example submission files that can be used for testing purposes), which is what I am trying to do. So far I had to use a separate student account to test it, and the test worked, but now I need to know how to get more new files in besides the main ones and other ones that do get in. 2. Follow up of question 1, it seems like when a student submits a file, and a file of the exact same name is defined in VPL activity, the student's file(s) that are in VPL activity are not packaged for the evaluation and seem to be ignored. Why is this? This test was even done with both files (student's and in the VPL) have the same contents., so is this supposed to be some sort of anti-plagiarism measure? 3. Under what privileges do the scripts execute and the submissions get evaluated? A student can run the evaluation script to auto check their submissions' output, but that student should not be able to do anything that compromises security, such as have access to the execution files in VPL activity.",

Instructor: * Instructor defines a programming homework in the VPL. * Instructor defines a number of files (about 10) that will be used for testing the homework. These files can be packaged in a zip file, or can be uploaded individually. * Instructors loads these files in VPL using \"execution files\" upload mechanism. The instructor can see those files. Indeed, when zipped files are uploaded, the VPL automatically unzips them and shows them. Student: * Implements the programming homework * Presses the evaluate button, which should cause the evaluation to occur. What we have found is the following: After the evaluate button is pressed, the evaluation script runs, and: * The student's test programs gets copied. * Only some of the files in the \"execution files\" are copied. N ot all files from execution files are copied * Evaluation fails because not all of the instructor's testing files are there. We checked the directory by running a python script when an evaluation takes place. The script iterates over the files of the home directory. It shows that only some files are copied, and most of the instructor's test files are not. Is there something that we are missing? We truly appreciate your help in this regard. Regards, Raju Pandey",

We decided to move on to using an AI-experience center (AIEC) called Jupyter for students to be able to store their files on that server, with each student/instructor having their own directory there. We want to integrate that server to our VPL LMS-client, and we want students to be able to download the files they work on in Jupyter and then upload them to a VPL for evaluation. One issue we have is the security. When trying to download a file, someone should be presented with an authentication request (username/password). Is it possible to use a client like Putty or WinSCP to SSH into a Jupyter server? If so, what would be the proper credentials? I tried this with WinSCP and failed, possibly because the server may not have FTP /SFTP installed. The thing is, from the VPL I am able to use the wget command with the link to the file to download it onto the temporary drive in the VPL server during the execution. This should fail and/or ask for authentication credentials. We do not want students to be able to see or get files they're not supposed to. How can I implement this kind of security to any of the servers? I believe our main goal is to unify all 3 servers (Jupyter, VPL, LMS)",

          "Text": "Dear Juan, Thank you for your response, but what we are trying to do now is find a way for VPL to be able to access a student's files on their directory on a Jupyter server and grade them. For the time being we log in and download them manually, then submit them to Moodle, but we want the execution of the VPL to get the files automatically so that when a student decides to have their files evaluate, the VPL will get them from Jupyter and grade them. I understand what you explained to me about how there's no easy answer, but I came up with another idea based on what I know works, and I explain it below. Since I am capable of using wget to do this, I thought if there was a way, with the use of strings and variables, to run a wget that gets the correct files based on the name of the student on Moodle and the name of the student on Jupyter. I would assume these have to match, but is there a line of code that gets the name of the student running the execution which would be stored as a string during the execution itself? This would help in the creation of the file path for wget, which uses variables and strings to construct it in the program. One last question, I would like to know if and how it's possible for a student to run the VPL's execution without providing their own file manually in Moodle since this would be done automatically by the VPL's execution itself. Thank you!",

The real numbers are checked with tolerance. example: \n```text\noutput \n= 4\n\n\n5 6.8\n```\n Text : Only words are checked, the comparison is case-insensitive and the other characters are ignored. example: \n```text\noutput \n= lemon orange\n\n\napple\n```\n Exact text : The text is enclosed in double-quotes.",

According to me case 1 is correct because its output match with program output. But the moodle gives a result  test case failed. Similarly I passed a second case, which according to me is wrong because it does not match with program output. Thats why i ask that one question. Why its behave strange.",

For each task, the selection of the execution server is as follow 1) If there are servers online then one is preselected randomly. If a server was marked offline 5 or more minutes ago, it's considered already online for this preselection. 1.1) If the preselected server is found offline the server is marked as offline and repeats step 1. If the preselected server is found overloaded repeats step 1. 2) If all online servers have been preselected then all servers, online or not, are sequentially preselected again. 3) If no server can be selected a message is shown to the user. - Notice that after preselecting a server, it is checked to know if it is or not online and if it is overloaded.

So, I don't want students to modify the calculator.cpp and main.cpp files. They should not be changed in order to test their knowledge if they can write header files or not. However without modifying the calculator.h file, students can modify main.cpp to make the program run. Is there any way to protect these 2 files? Thanks for your help, have a nice week",

Add the main.cpp and the calculator.cpp to  activity setting > advanced setting > Execution files. These files will go with the submitted to be compiled with each run, debug or evaluation. You can remove the main.cpp and the calculator.cpp files from the description if you add them also to the \"requested files\".

Please check: 1) The setting at the /etc/vpl/vpl-jail-system.conf file needs to write parameters using a strict format \"Parameter=Value\" without spaces. You must use \"URLPATH=/moodle\" 2) You must restart the service \"systemd restart vpl-jail-system\" after a configuration change. Important: you must update the VPL plugin to the 3.3.7 version due to a bug that prevents to run Java programs in the 3.3.6 version. It is highly recommended to use https due to the web browsers are reluctant to allow using http connections from pages using https. Best regards, Juan Carlos.",
